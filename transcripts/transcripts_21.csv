gD60MgamLZ8,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd looking really creepy in this harsh light hmm and just want to let you know that there's a new track that I want to point your attention toward the new st. Vincent's song aka singer-songwriter Annie Clark the new track is birth and reverse it is promoting her next full-length album it is a self-titled LP it's dropping in February of next year I know it's been a day or so since this song dropped originally I did like it at first I thought it was interesting but now it is really clicking with me it's been really interesting watching Annie Clark progress musically artistically over the course of her career a lot of her early stuff just being very whimsical and very pretty and sort of arranged at points with extra instrumentation art rock and and art pop and she's going into much noisier bolder and I think slightly darker territory with her latest material I mean her last LP strange mercy in my opinion her best and after seeing her put out other recent singles like crocodile it's gonna be interesting to see where she goes next on this new LP of hers especially considering that this new track birth in Reverse we have incredibly claustrophobic guitars that are grimy and buzzing in every direction and the mix very very tense drums and lyrics that sort of a display a slow growing sense of insanity which i think is due to this very ordinary day st. Vincent is having everyone knows you can't have too many ordinary days in a row or also just drives you mad give this track a listen down give this track a listen link in the description box let me know what you think of it Anthony Fantana st. Vincent birth and reverse forever 
qXvyxrarDxw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busy I'm Anna and it's time for a review of the new future of the left album how to stop your brain in an accident future of the left is a very cheeky experimental rock band hailing from the UK and this is their fourth full-length album and unfortunately they're one of those bands that is slightly haunted by the successes of their past or more specifically these successes of guitarist and vocalist Andy Falcon who was actually in a band preceding future of the left called McCluskey he used to front them as well and they dropped a couple pretty essential post-hardcore albums in the mid-2000s McCluskey disbanded but it didn't take Falco long to reform things under this future of the left name with Jack Eagle stone the band's drummer and right now they're currently working with Julia rueake and Jimmy Watkins and even though the band name and the band lineup that Falco and Jack have been working with since the mid and early aughts has changed the focus has still remained on post hardcore music noise rock and indie rock with driving bass lines wild noisy guitar phrasing and riffs and lyrics and vocals that are pretty eccentric now future of the left's debut had a lot of the same rawness that McCluskey used to have but the band's ambition brought them on to their next record hoping to make something that was a little bit more refined well recorded dynamic and diverse but the band's experimentation and ambition continued on to their next LP but maybe to a degree where it felt like more songs on here we're kind of losing their rock edge in their aggression especially with more keyboards and softer tracks kind of coming into the picture still this album featured roughly the same personality that's always made the band appealing and it is worth checking out if you're new to future of the left however with this newer LP of theirs which is actually the result of a successful crowdfunding campaign the band brings that rock edge back in a really hard way with some songs that are future of the left's heaviest tracks yet the very first track that kicks this entire LP off is one of those songs with incredibly low-end driven and jagged guitar riffs that are just jutting in between stints of silence sounds like something the Melvin's would have hammered out in the 90s with a very very sludgy finish with a lot of these riffs ringing out instead of playing in this very hard staccato fashion and of course even though the song feels very Melvin's inspired it does uniquely ring out as future of the lefts with just how off-kilter the riffing is and of course the vocals more heavy sludge kind of comes through on the song future child embarrassment matrix however this song is not really a highlight for me outside of how weirdly sexual the lyrics are just because I don't really find much of the singing or the very monolithic riffing to be all that catchy or memorable though it does stand out on this record and does bring this thing some variety sonically the sort of contrast these heavier spots future of the left does bring some very fast nimble catchy tracks on here very well crafted concise and clever little rock tunes with a lot of personality like the track Johnny Borrell afterlife whose choruses maybe one of my favorites on here just a boy just a boy I just know boy with this start/stop syncopated riff on the verses and again very very very cheeky vocals and lyrics there are some misses on the sweeter side of this record though like the male gaze which really kind of feels like a Pixies tune with Falco's vocals on top of it and then the real meaning of Christmas another very fun song melodically and very straightforward and accessible but to me doesn't really stand out as bold or interesting on this album simply because of how weird every other track surrounding this song is aside from that I love songs on here like Donnie of the Dex a killer track with another catchy chorus he was good with a very snarky verses that depict the life of this DJ character and the song has a really absurd refrain toward the back end the stink of sex is undeniable and then there's the song things to say to a friendly policeman which has this killer killer kazoo melody on its chorus there are just so many songs on here that are catchy and aggressive rock tracks with loads of personality and quirk like the two track Sahn here that are obviously very strong pieces of entertainment industry satire like singing of the bone saws which is this very properly delivered piece of spoken word on top of a very grimy bass guitar riff talking about how the music industry is tricking you into being excited and making you be afraid of missing out and then there's the track how to spot a record company which has one of my favorite refrains on the back end of the track how does bad does bad alright with a bunch of somewhat bitter just angry lyrics throughout the track about disappointing labels and disappointing fans and might have been a little bit of a reflection upon some moments in the past of McCluskey or even feature of the left and there are some real left hooks on here too like the somewhat teary-eyed and absurdly worded french lessons which is a kind of a soft willed indie ballad that that i like a lot and there is the song something happen too which is dreary as well but also switches between moments of very sad piano and bass and then these joyous guitar chords playing against people cheering it's one of these moments where future of the left is not only great at playing with sound sound play but also mood play with how the song really transitions from being oh - ah in a matter of seconds and the clothes are on here another acoustically driven track and I do like the tone of it a lot especially with Falco's vocals as lyrics kind of just seeping out between what what sounds like clenched tea and I do love the ending on here - with the harmonized vocals and just how together and joyous and celebratory they sound but this song to me is an example of an issue the future of the left has at times that is drawing out moments for a long period of time that are just not that interesting because I can't say I'm totally in love with the faux back woods dirty down country guitar playing that's on this track it does get kind of stale before the band even gets a chance to add extra instrumentation to the mix still despite those complaints I do feel like this is a great record from future the left one of the better rock records of this year this album has sharp heavy very raw straightforward and dry production that I like a lot is just clear as a bell very good playing an execution on this thing and this record has some great lyrics and personality and vocals which really has been the most consistent element of future of the lefts career in terms of quality really the worst thing about this record is that some of the songs on here just pale in comparison to others but there are 14 tracks on here and none that I really strongly disliked I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana future of the left forever 
i2uzq3A9YbU,hi everyone Antoine Fandango here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new childish gambino album because the internet childish gambino is the stage name the pseudonym of actor writer singer songwriter producer donald glover who you may know outside of the music world for his role in shows such as 30 rock or community from his stand-up - and a bunch of other things he's been dropping musical projects for years but he sort of reached this peak of attention with his 2011 album camp which was one of my least favorite albums of that year I don't really want to talk about why and even though there are a lot of people that hate that review and hate me for that review I was not anticipating the same level of dislike from this new record of Gambino's because there were some banger beats and tracks on his royalty mixtape that I thought were pretty good he had a feature on chance the rapper's latest mixtape that I thought was decent and there were some songs that dropped before the release of because the internet that I thought were enjoyable I thought that I would be in for a bit of a mood change on this new project of Gambino's and for sure because the Internet is a very different project from camp however this record is not without its baggage or its hang-ups though for one this LP does kind of come along with a 72 page screenplay which sort of seems to be the narrative which this album soundtracks so while I don't think the screenplay can be completely ignored because the screenplay and the album run is such a close parallel I still ended up being really underwhelmed by what was going on in this tale which wasn't really much of anything we essentially follow the exploits of a silver spoon protagonists truck with this general feeling of malaise and depression which there's never really any explanation or justification for throughout the whole story we're just supposed to accept that he's sad and there's never a point in this storyline where the reader is actually influenced to care about why the protagonist is so sad or depressed it's not like his negative worldview when loneliness brings a special perspective to the table that lends some insight to the reader and it's not like his sadness or his depression is uniquely interesting either as far as I could see all the issues he's dealing with are some of the same issues we all deal with the only thing happening here is that he's handling them in a really ungraceful manner so because the characters and the dialogue and the emotions are so shallow and boring and pointless we're sort of dragged through a series of disorienting plot shifts that follow very little logic and leave more questions than answers for one the boy and his group of friends witness a robbery at a burger place and the protagonist also witnesses a shooting outside of a nightclub which his friend mysteriously leaves him outside of to just hang out by himself seeing some of this violence just makes him go to Oakland to see this girl that I think he used to be with then there's a point when his dad just dies who's actually supposed to be played by Rick Ross so says the screenplay which is really the only legitimately depressing thing about this characters life from what I can tell but after his father dies he has to head to Sweden to claim the ashes where he actually has a fight with the guy who wrote what does the Fox say and then toward the end of this thing spoiler alert he just up and decides to become a drug dealer and then is like shot in one of the next scenes the whole screenplay really reminded me of other independantly film movies that I had seen recently like tim heidecker's a comedy or that new michael cera film crystal fairy and the magical cactus movies that also center around these kind of young careless but emotionally distressed main characters and we follow them on an emotional journey of a very short distance and while these movies for sure are character portraits and I think they work best as character portraits they're very boring and kind of inconsequential as stories and that is especially the case for because the internet even though a lot of people do seem to be kind of interpreting this thing as a social commentary on social awkwardness in the Internet age but for me that is a far stretch either that or the social commentary here is not really carried out that well there are instances in this script and on this album where things like trolling and WorldStarHipHop are brought to attention people using the Internet to treat other people like garbage or gawk at the dark underbelly of mankind but still even sort of important issues like this feel like mere subplots or footnotes in this screenplays unjustified despair and lack of drive not as a script but as an album because the Internet is way more interesting for one it features way better production than what was on camp there are tons of trap influenced beats a lot like what landed on royalty but a lot more melodic more interesting textures - like on the song crawl with the female vocal samples and the killer kick drums the very lavish keyboards and the string sections on this thing and the multiple beat change ups on this track it's really surprising and beautiful instrumental beats like this right now I feel like are the perfect sound for Gambino's music because they're aggressive they're heavy there's a lot of bass but the synth leads and some of the samples make things playful or kind of silly enough for him to put forward these ridiculous punchlines he usually works with I'm glad that Gambino is starting to sidestep a lot of the pop rap sounds that were kind of played out on camp but I don't think he's in totally original territory yet there's so many things that occur on this LP that I think are mere variants of things that have been hot over the past year past two or three years for one most of the slow jams on this album kind of sound like a Frank Ocean b-side from channel orange and in my opinion the singing on this LP is not as good or as distinct as Frank's and neither are the lyrics either with some refrains on here like hold me close my darling or Tuesday afternoon ain't got to do befall in love with you which happens on the song shadow where Gambino is doing these really subdued raps against his singing and to me the song is just really overly sentimental its underwhelming a lot like the track Telegraph Avenue with the Oakland Oakland chorus I do like the fast rap verse Gambino spitz toward the end of this track but it's not so good that it makes me want to stick around for all this inconspicuous R&B style singing still I don't really dislike this track or many other tracks on here instrumentally I may not dig the song or the singing or the lyrics but the beat the beats are really where because the internet shines through I like on shadows the bass arpeggios which I believe are being brought by Thundercat the very cool calming vocal harmonies and the really distorted guitar riff that is just booming and buzzing toward the back end of the track it's really psychedelic it's a great progression 3005 the lead single from this LP it's not a song that I love but to me it's probably the best on here when it comes to this mixture of Donald's pop sensibilities and his hip-hop sensibilities they complement each other in this really cute little love song where the melody is undeniable yeah the chorus is a little rotten my teeth because of how sweet it is but I'm still digging this song a lot more than the slower more syrupy ballads on this thing which I think are just literally so boring that I want to skip over all of them so the instrumentals I do praise through and through but it's the lyrics and the songs on here that can be really really hit or miss for me like the song earth the oldest computer with its really ambitious driving beat and it's numerous synth layers but what Donald does here vocally with his singing and with his flow on here too I feel like we only end up hearing a less grandiose version of Kanye's lost in the world from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and then there's the song zealots of Stockholm with its numerous instrumental shifts it's really really linear it's really all over the place but only a very small amount of what actually happens on this track ends up being captivating or even memorable the few tracks on here that I thought were legitimately entertaining were the more aggressive ones like crawl and WorldStarHipHop where some of Gambino's punchlines I at least thought despite them being very silly are kind of funny like y'all be stirring like a broke guitar and I still put it down like the family dog or that one stop in the song worldstar we're gonna go put foam go put hello consistently over the course of this album in this script game you know is trying to give us this character who is this young well-to-do Rekluse who spends a lot of time on the Internet I guess that's what he is and I guess that's what he knows but I wouldn't say he's great at keeping that angle and keeping that persona interesting long-term though one of the best moments where he's in this characters on the song sweatpants despite the fact that Glover is 30 at this point in his life he is saying that he's a rich kid asshole pay me as a villain and there's some hilarious lines in this track - are you even though breakfast lunch and dinners for beginners you don't even know and I do think Donald does display the darkness of that reclusive side on the song no exit successfully the closer on here is really self-defeating but also kind of triumphant - which I thought was great kind of having this character struggle but the thing is this record is so so so dependent on this screenplay to be completely understood or I even think enjoyed just on its own they complement each other in a way the music sort of speckles some of the cracks left in the screenplay with how illogical some of these shifts are in the storyline but I guess the script brings this deeper character portrayal that the album doesn't necessarily have and the thing is this album kind of brings a different character personality trait to this boy individual at gambino is talking about in the screenplay because while this guy is very just quiet and food not really do much boudreaux the whole story there songs on here on this album where this character is very cocky and in-your-face and ridiculous I think there's a lot of potential in the amount of ambition that Gambino came forward with on the script and on this record and and how they come together but there are just so many completely uninteresting spots especially throughout the script I like a lot of songs on here that I think are legitimately good but I still don't like this LP as a whole I think Gambino brought great instrumentals to this record he's very conceptual he's a capable rapper but the lyrics on this record the flow of this record the songs on this record and the singing on this record tend to be very weak I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition internet if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana childish gambino because the Internet forever 
v7F2qoZkNIo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busy banana banana and it's time for a review of the new Gustavo Stein album LF guys savage side is the pseudonym for a French electronic music producer who's been making the rounds over the past couple years with some singles some EPS some official remixes of artists like Lana Del Rey and he also helped produce a few tracks from Kanye West's latest album yeezus however his work did not really grabbed my attention personally until I heard the lead single from this debut album of his pursuit really this track a great combination of techno and house with an array of sounds that feel like they were produced in some kind of industrial facility there's something so metallic and I see about Casal Stein's production on this particular track more so than other techno music producers tracks like pursue have a killer driving kick snare groove but the sounds on this track also sound like they were sampled from an assembly line a thousand years from now in a future where our robot overlords have crushed the human race into submission definitely one of my favorite singles of this year with its dark vibes and undeniable bee tracks like this really had me looking forward to a laugh but I ended up being sort of disappointed by the final result not that there are highlights on here there are but the album is a little bit of an inconsistent mess the tracks on here that are great and play to gas offal Stein strengths are good but they themselves don't feel that varied and how they're executed or how he goes about producing them I mean pursues easily the most detailed and interesting of all the more hard edged tracks on this album then you have some softer tracks on here that I will get to later but there are a few songs on here that just kind of feel like unnecessary detours or distractions like the opening track on here as well as the track destinations songs whose beats are so basic in terms of progression they're just not that interesting from beginning to end and I feel like progression and maybe complexity was sort of sacrificed at the hand of having these really weird spoken word pieces thrown on top of the instrumentals that really are swallowed too much in Reaver and don't really grab my ear in any way shape or form in terms of how they sound or what they're saying really these two tracks are the most lackluster moments on this entire LP then there are the softer and more easygoing tracks on here which some of them are good but for the most part it feels like they only exist to serve as brakes or sort of interludes or spaces in between the more aggressive tracks on this album which is really a less bread and butter like the song nameless which has some pretty dreary keyboards or the track wall of memories whose keys are just as spaced out and Atmospheric but our little earier both of which are I mean good when it comes to bringing a mood to the forefront but they're not that engaging for the duration of their length and they're just a little middle-of-the-road really these songs don't feel anywhere near as passionate or as urgent as some of the more aggressive tracks on here again the song piece of future is sort of an exception to this rule it is a slower track but it slowly grows more lavish and intense as it continues on and then there's the song values which has some pretty sweet keyboards on and I love the groove that the percussion brings forward because it does feel a little craft work inspired the best thing on this album is definitely the bangers but I'm just not seeing enough contrast or perceived contrast among them to not feel like I'm hearing some filler or some redundancy especially with so many tracks here kind of following that type of pattern but really after listening this album goose offal Stein does sound like a very very capable producer the the sound quality and just the richness and the crispness of the sounds on this record deserves to be praised all day the audio on this record is so hard-hitting and just so sharp it's like just staring into a giant diamond however this diamond is not cut all - impressively goose offal Stein does bring some good grooves to the table however due to a lack of progression and variety he allows them to go stale very quickly he allows the tone of this album to go stale very quickly as well trying to balance out these very Sammy Sammy aggressive tracks with these softer songs that just aren't all captivating on the whole really I loved just about as many songs on here as I disliked and majority of the other tracks on here I felt were just kind of passable I'm really feeling a strong 5 to a 6 on this thing transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantana gets offal Stein Aleph forever 
2k1n3-2GHQc,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and just making a quick video here letting you know that there is a track out from a band that the band is artificial brain they're from New York the song is absorbing black ignition they have a new full-length album that is dropping in February on profound lore records if you're not familiar with that label they are a metal label and of course because of that this is a metal band they go in that sort of technical death metal direction however even though that's not one of my favorite metal subgenres mostly because of how just overly produce some of the records can sound this band's track here at least sounds very natural justa really has a very human element to the playing especially the drums that I like a lot and not only is this song really technical and really busy it's really interestingly structured as well always throwing something in there that's going to surprise the listener really a very dynamic track that has me pretty interested in seeing what this band is going to do on their debut full-length labyrinth constellation alright give this thing a listen tell me what you thought in the comments let it hate it why transition and I hope you guys have a good time listening to this thing and yeah that's it Anthony Fantana death metal forever 
rwZLiOQbEPM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new era broad album self-titled this band is a norwegian rock outfit and their lineup has been a bit of a revolving door since they've been dropping releases in the early 2000s right now they seem to be functioning off of two core members who collaborate with a bunch of different musicians and noise makers and producers to create their records and i heard an EP of theirs that they dropped this year called murderers art had three tracks on it that were a bit of a mixed bag one was a bit of a generic sludge metal track one was an eight-minute noise piece and another was sort of a noise rock sludge metal combo that was 15 minutes long that had this sort of hypnotic repetitious thunderous riff approach not too unlike something swans would do the EP caught my attention and made me want to dive into the band's other records look back into their discography and I found that they came out with an album this year and it's like their sixth album and the sounds that were on these albums was pretty interesting in terms of just the stylistic influence combinations we're getting really heavy just BC sludge metal and some elements of noise rock - topped with some pretty eccentric vocals that vary from these deep guttural growls to these somewhat deadpan and nasally ah moans and some very hellish devilish snake-like whisper yes I liked the variety that the vocals brought to the table but still listening to these records back to back I kind of got this sense that era brah is the sort of band that slowly fine Tunes its sound over years upon years upon years rather than coming through with something completely radical and different with each new release a lot like a bands such as high on fire or The Melvins to a lesser extent both of which I know I'm sure her Arab rot takes at least a little bit of influence from especially given that they have worked with producers that have created some of the best albums from those bands people like Billy Anderson as well as Steve Albini so the years that this band has been spending on the heavier side of things has definitely resulted in them having a very aggressive and ear catching sound I wouldn't say the riffs on this LP are thunderous like they're raining down from the sky but they are pretty aggressive and they do bring the rumble the good of these characteristics is that the album is loud as hell and that the vocals are so weird and just off the chart when it comes to the general sludge metal sound that it's hard not to get caught up in the eccentricity that era brought brings to the table like the very throaty snide whispers on the opening track here that be nagged and if Noah is yes then there is the song throwing rocks at the devil which is maybe my favorite track on this entire LP has a fantastic guitar lead that feels sort of influenced by Middle Eastern music or music from the Eastern Bloc and just these really hard-hitting juts of guitar bass and drums just syncopated and the vocals are all over the map we have the very gruff growls screaming this fantastic hook and then shortly after we're getting these just nasally moans coming back throwing rocks at the devil it's a great track the bad side of some of these characteristics though is that the album is so boo me it is so boo me man like especially the drums and the drums do get to the point where at times they swallow up the vocals they swallow up the guitars and kind of cover everything else that's going on a lot like on the horns of the devil grow or the vocals here can get so weird that they feel a little silly and and kind of take away from the aggression of the song like blood on the poet which oddly enough is sort of inspired by a pretty odd French film of a similar title I do like the wailing lead guitars in the background on this track but man do the vocals dumb daughter go feel a little absurd and not necessarily in like a flattering way I do like that this band has some odd lyrical concepts though and while that's great it doesn't necessarily make up for what I think is this album's biggest issue and that is the riffs and the song structures not really being that interesting or adventurous I actually think a majority of the riffs on this album are pretty inconspicuous and and standard when it comes to the sludge metal sound especially the lead single on here blood on bunny which is maybe the most forgettable track on this entire album just because of how bland the Rivage is if the riffs are going to be this overly simplistic I wish they would come through with more tracks like drawing down the moon where essentially we we not only have these basic riffs but we have a bunch of noises and and sounds and sound play going on in the background just kind of keep things layered and engaging because this track is not only sludgy but also psychedelic and borderline disturbing with just how chaotic it is the horns in the second half of this track too sound fantastic and make this song sound really anthemic overall while I did like the odd vocals and I thought the guitars and the riffs on here were very visceral I thought the recording was heavy and there is some sound play on this self-titled LP for sure this record does have its eccentric moments but there just wasn't enough of a structural or a melodic or a musical appeal for much of what's here to stick with me and I mean we're talking about noise rock and sludge metal on here when it comes to melody I'm not looking for a whole ton I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition if you've listened to this album what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana arrow brought self titled forever 
MOfyvPM6FJI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and I am sitting here hoping to make what I think will be a pretty quick video about a concert I went to last night and Hamden Connecticut at the space it was a show that actually I helped Co promote with manic productions a local show promoter in the Connecticut area and yeah the bill essentially was Rat King who opened up for King cruel kind of a weird combination of artists but maybe not so strange if you are familiar with the fact that King cruel has put out tracts under a different name I'm pretty sure where he does rap I mean King cruel is a capable rapper he is a hip hop fan and does follow what is going on in the underground so to see them on the same stage wasn't too weird for me but still it did kind of draw two slightly different crowds of people though it did seem like there was a lot of overlap in terms of yeah you know people like wrecking and King cruel you don't necessarily have to like just one or the other but anyway to start off Rat King played and yeah while I really loved half of the songs on that one EP of theirs that I reviewed and I was really just disliking the other half of songs on there I was hopeful and I did expect that I would see a good live performance from them especially given that they just came out with that song 100 which I thought was great and they did it was a great live performance the three of them were incredibly hyped energetic there was a song off of the wiki 93 EP I believe but they remixed it with a totally different beat and vibe not as much screaming or aggression or noise and the older tracks just sounded a lot better in person the beats were bangin and I just loved how just messy and bleeding into one another the samples sound and sort of psychedelic and hard hitting their production was together I think racking has an interesting sound and I'm hoping that they come out with an album in the coming year especially again given how much I like that track 100 Wiki was just so it was like a monster on the stage he was just like stomping and just flow and flow and flow and flow and flow and the kid is like he's nuts I'm so happy I got to see them there's really good if you get a chance to see Rat King do check them out just a really hyped energetic performance and then King cruel came on after and you know I I don't want to say I didn't get what I expect I mean I thought it was going to be good but it ended up being really good I mean it was a really good performance I actually want to say that I feel like King cruel was a lot better in person than he was on record and for a few different reasons you might have caught my review of kink rules debut full-length LP which I did like but I didn't love and I felt like the issues that I had with that album were just completely resolved in the live set for one his singing felt way more in control in person than it did not record like sometimes his vocals just seemed so over-the-top and about the twang and about just the tone of his emotion that it is about the pitch or the melody that it becomes a little distracting and I think it kind of derails the song a bit however in person I feel like he was much more focused on just singing the melody of the track though still very animated and soulful and passionate and not only that but another issue that I had with the album is that I wish more songs on there were fleshed out instrumentally because a few of my favorite tracks on this LP feature a full band and that's exactly how King Kroll performed that night with not only him on guitar but he had another guitar player on there he had a bass player and he had a drummer with him and there were tracks that were being performed that night that didn't feature any extra instrumentation at all but he played them with the full band and it completely transformed the vibe of the track and just made it feel like an entirely different song to me and really in my opinion a better song man was his band tight tight tight super tight the drumming was fantastic the bass player was was really great at just finding the groove and improvising on top of it and just always bringing something different as the song switches from one section to another not only do I recommend checking out this album and and potentially expecting bigger things from King Crue in the future do make the effort to check out his live set because I think at least the one that I saw was really great and that's it transition if you have ever caught rat king or king cruel live what did you think of them did you love them hate them why and yeah that's it you know what about their live sets stuck out to you or were they just not special at all let me know Anthony Fantan Oh King cruel Rat King live forever 
8nOe4cyttnQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Hopson album nach madness Hopson is a West Coast MC who's had a pretty illustrious past couple of years with a lot of hot singles coming out through his ill mind of Hopsin series is a double XL freshmen alum he has a handful of projects right now under his belt and he has had a lot of success through his label funk volume lately too with some artists like Jarren Benton and dizzy Wright gaining a lot of attention and he really doesn't mince words or worry about what's going to be offensive to other people and that has pretty much gained him a very passionate cult following even if stylistically a lot of what he does come straight out of the M&M playbook Hopson just gets a lot from Eminem when it comes to flow and delivery and hooks and personality even the dr. Dre style production on some of the tracks from this new LP of Hobson's shows influence from Eminem's earlier albums and for the most part I do think Hopson does Eminem's really cartoony rap style justice he's a really animated MC is foul-mouthed bars can be pretty hilarious on some of the more hard-hitting tracks here however I'm not really saying that Hobson's brand of comedy is all that mature or clever or well-groomed he really kind of shoots for that cringe style of comedy in the you know you like I'm an animal a mink coat bitch wear me or I got balls like Ash Ketchum or I love Christ but I guarantee you wouldn't want to cross me or it's like having sex with a nun what the heck have you done this handful of lines only comes from a few tracks on here but believe me these songs are not really the exception on this album everything on here is pretty tasteless and the thing is that's not even really my biggest issue with him I think Hobson is really good and and capable as a nasty offensive giggle worthy rapper the issues that I do have with this LP for one lie with the hooks which I mean with Eminem being such a big influence on Hopson and hooks never having been Eminem's strong suit Hobson's hooks sometimes are really just nightmarish they're either sung in this really melodramatic tone that is hard to believe and hard not to laugh at like on tears to snow or dream forever or what's my purpose sometimes the singing is just really hand up in a way that makes it cringe-worthy like on old friend gimme back my oh man or I still got love for you where I mean really that the singing on the course is kind of excruciating or on jungle bash where you kind of have the call and respond hey yeah yeah yeah the hooks are one thing but when Hopson really starts to grate on my nerves is when he hops on some kind of moral high ground and tells the listener what's what a lot like on the song what's my purpose which is essentially a lyrical attack on the human race and Hopson is pretty harsh on the shortcomings of people and I think he has some points on here like people don't know how to act people don't know how to handle themselves there's all this monkey-see monkey-do stuff going on hivemind but the thing is what on this track or on this album in general makes Hopson a worthy messenger of this point of view or even somebody who can be a torchbearer to fix these problems or bring these problems to the attention of those who might actually try to change things there's also the issue that Hobson's views on romantic relationships are completely shot especially with the nice guy mentality on the song good guys get left behind not only is the song cringe-worthy because there's a Twilight reference in here but there are plenty of lines on this album that objectify women which kind of makes it hard for me to believe Hobson playing into that nice guy role but still it feels like Hobson is taking this nice guy mentality pretty seriously as he details this failed relationship play-by-play and the whole time he's just being really bitter because he couldn't get in this girl's pants because I guess he was just too good of a guy and the problem with the nice guy mentality is that they always blame their inability to get in a relationship on everybody on the planet but themselves and they always come out the hero too like when Hopson is saying that he's paying this girl's way who got pregnant from this other guy when he was planning on getting with her first on the song I still got love for you what nice guys fail to realize is that maybe they're not getting laid because they're insecure bitter whiny and boring I mean just take the really sick and desperate emotions that come through on the track dream forever on this album I can't imagine anything that would be a bigger turn off to a level-headed woman nice guys constantly blame their failures on women just having bad taste in men and they fail to even think for a moment that maybe their issue is that they have horrible taste in women and are bad actually gauging whether or not another woman is interested if they actually even get the guts to approach that person you know I don't want to doubt that life is unfair and I don't want to doubt that Hopsin has had some traumatic experiences in his lifetime but the way he puts his experiences into words just makes me not want to sympathize ever there are some tracks on here that legitimately I think are good I think are entertaining I think are fun like the lead single hop is back or give me that money a hilarious track with Hopson saying that all these new friends he makes are constantly trying to get money from him begging him for money because he's so famous and popular now then there is lunchtime cipher which has two of the more solid features on this entire album and has just a hilarious beat it's a great song concept rapping spitting bars at school between your friends and then there is hip-hop sinister which is easily the angriest most just frothing at the mouth track on this entire album and I actually thought it was it was great definitely a highlight on here but there are even some shortcomings on the more upbeat tracks on here honestly on this thing overall the production and the hooks are just weak weak weak and Hopson doesn't do anything with his punchlines his views on life or his personality to make up for that he's occasionally entertaining with how empty is and how zany he is and how he goes at other people like I love the verses when he was making fun of Kanye and Kendrick but he is way too obsessed with dropping jewels for a guy whose life view is just too bitter and warped to be taking notes from if you are copying off of Hobson's paper you are probably not going to pass this class I am feeling a strong three to a light four on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony fan tanto Hopson nock madness forever 
x4of2hBNPpo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new demacia 6 mixtape the 6 6 the 6 commandments organized crime hate that you left that world in the behind I thought so too but I've still doubt that live em seen amazing de mafia 6 might be a relatively new name in the world of hip-hop but do not let this fresh tag fool you the mafia 6 is just a variation on the seminal southern hip-hop outfit three 6 mafia a group that has had some pretty sturdy hits in their career like hard out here for a pimp as well as poppin my collar and my personal favorite stay fly but now that the southern hip-hop sound is hot in the mainstream in the underground people are going back digging up old gems and the southern sound like three 6 mafia's 90s output their early contributions to gangsta rap in horrorcore like mystic styles now there are quite a few artists who are trying to bring back that old three 6 mafia Memphis rap style sound artists like little ugly Mane Halle Kamal space goes purp of course there's a huge influence from three 6 mafia and a lot of the ASAP mob stuff and now you have pivotal members of three 6 mafia coming back and reliving this sound as well gangsta boo crunchy black Lord infamous DJ Paul as well as coupe stuff and there are some very good features across this mixtape too like 8ball & MJG yellow wolf bone thug Space Ghost purp and little white plus plus there is a massive posse track on the back end of this LP that is about 9 minutes long and has a verse from Juicy J project pat and a lot of other familiar faces from three 6 mafia's past they even redo an older track of theirs on the selfie break the law with just a whore hitting catch your version of the classic 1995 cutoff of mystic styles and honestly it goes over really well and so do most of their attempts to bring their devilish sound back to the forefront now lyrically uh I'm not promising anything on this mixtape that's going to uplift you this is definitely not the kind of rap mixtape that is going to make you pat yourself on the back like I listened to a smart song six commandments isn't really an album that tries to impress it's more of an act of intimidation the verses on this record are really just like coming face-to-face with a junkyard dog with bar after bar after bar after bar on this record having to do with trappin cooking pulling triggers cold-blooded murder smoking mobbin pretty much every greasy thing in the book the only thing that keeps this album from being overly redundant is that every member of demacia six or three 6 mafia has such a distinct flow and voice and style the way the features are peppered throughout this album adds to the variety as well if you're already familiar with three sixes older stuff you know what makes each member stand out DJ Paul being gruff is hell gangsta boo always very cool charismatic as well as confident and being the only female member of three 6 mafia of course that makes her voice stick out too there's crunchy black who was incredibly animated with his deep voice Lord infamous who flows a little bit harder than every other member of the group from what I at least hear on this record and then there is coupes - who is incredibly creepy and eerie the production brings a lot of heavy sometimes over modulated 808 sand twittering high hats for rhythms there are a lot of dark minor tones synth leads and chord progressions and even though this record is pretty heavy on the since there are a lot of samples interesting samples that are looped throughout this muddy mix - like the Black Sabbath song God is dead one of their more recent tracks that pops up on the song better pray and the theme to the song Fame which is loop pretty quickly a little snippet of it in the song remember and again the sound on this thing the sound of the production the sound of the vocal recording it's really really rough at times I would say lo Phi and then blatantly so but still the production on here bangs it is Basie it is heavy the recording quality doesn't take any of the aggression away from these beats and even though you do have the backing of these hip-hop rhythms melodically a lot of these instrumentals just have the aura of a creepy slasher movie there's some really hard-hitting tracks on this thing like better prey and remember and Ben had hard which is one of the few tracks on here that has an awesome beat change up in the second half where coups too pops out of nowhere and get such a creepy and the song go hard whose title does not lie it's just this really grim southern hip-hop sound that deserves to be cranked with an incredibly catchy chorus which is nastily growled by DJ Paul's voice and that is kind of the approach that most of the choruses on this mixtape take however it is effective it is catchy it does lead to a lot of infectious tracks and there are some songs on here that tone it down a little bit and take a creepier direction stash spot murder on my mind and beacon in a blender which is blatantly a song about cooking drugs and dealing them and yeah just a slower track on here but still a memorable track on here and there are a lot of memorable moments on here this mixtape is just so goddamn raw punchy horrific and catchy there are a few shorter tracks on here toward the back end of the mixtape that maybe are not favourites for me but still this tape does not have too many shortcomings in my opinion even though it's not incredibly diverse in terms of sound or production or anything like that personally I don't really feel like this mixtape needs a moment where it makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside or something that I really need to contemplate because it's simply just so good at being tough-as-nails for sure this thing does have its limitations if I guess you're getting the mixtape version because you're constantly getting hit with the check daleks real trap shit and all the DJ paul interjections and there is even a weird outro track here where he is just mentioning this staying off all the social media of everyone in the group which actually did lead me to a YouTube channel where you have Paul doing a bunch of barbecue cooking but the songs themselves are an incredibly great grouping of just again dark dark violent southern hip hop music with absolutely no remorse and you know just really nasty scowl on its face feeling a light too decent ate on this thing transition if you've given this mixtape a listen what did you think about it and I have a new episode of my music video review show over the maker music channel you can watch it by clicking on my face right now also what do you think I should review next and did you love this album hate this album why and I hope you're having a nice day Anthony Fantana de mafia 6 6 commandments forever 
euUEkuTjyKg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a vinyl update where I talk about all these new pieces of vinyl that have made it into my record collection oh my god I almost lost him there I'll sit in my lap right here almost lost them I'm not gonna edit that out because here in these videos we do it raw and yeah yeah all right cool a few of these records come via courtesy of David over a super-dee distribution gave them to me out of the kindness of his heart the first of which I would like to talk about a record that is new to me it's actually a power violence split from several bands Antichrist demon Corps Magnum force and sex prisoner this is a nasty filthy disgusting 10-inch oh my god especially the Antichrist demon core tracks on here they are the hardest hitting of the bunch it's a nice little 10 inch I'm not sure if I played this at the not sure I played this at a 33 or 45 I think 33 mostly because of how all of the stuff is on one side and on the other side we sort of had in itching with a lot of uh let's see circle one limbo circle to the lustful circle 3 the gluttonous it's actually it's like the since the circles of hell right here damn it's dark but anyway yes three-way split from Antichrist demon core sex prisoner uh and Magnum force again here's what it looks like for all the people that are that are interested to live a lie it says on the back there's a nice little insert in here - this thing is dark through and through I mean this thing is nasty offensive offensive to those who are easily offended all right next what was past my way as well thanks to David here are the Sonics the Sonics the Sonics check out this album if you're looking for some filthy rowdy over-the-top garage rock that is gonna rock your world I mean really these guys were ahead of their time in terms of being just oh really just loud distorted and sort of morbid with some of the tracks on here too especially the witch as well as let's see what else what does the strychnine is the other song I'm looking for on here and of course and psycho to can't forget psycho and and there are other tracks on here sort of rock and roll favorites that they cover on here as well like roll over Beethoven as well as good golly Miss Molly but they do just very rowdy insane versions of those tracks and the other album that David passed my way that I want to thank him for is Iggy Pop's the idiot Oh an album that uh I'm more familiar with his his uh con with Alice time yeah obviously I'm not more familiar with it because the title is uh who looks slipping my mind at the moment oh my god I'm gonna think of this right here in front of you I'm gonna think of this right here in front of you like a total idiot let's see let's see how long it takes for Anthony to stop being an idiot mmm lust for life with him smiling on the cover I'm more familiar with that album this one I have not listened to all the way through yet so I'm saying hey let's check this one out obviously I haven't listened to lust for life all the way through in a while either but um yet to listen to this one all the way through so I figured let's try it a lot of people rave about it and looking forward to listening to this thing all the way through very fairly simple packaging that's typically other people with four men with bee birds do their repressing but we do get the lyrics on the back of this thing and four men with beards though the packaging does tend to be very simple when they do repress stuff they do give you a hefty record so you know if you're sort of more valuing the thickness of the record the heaviness of the record then then you should have no problem with this version of the record all right a new one a new a newer LP something that is one of my favorite albums of this year I splurged a little bit instead of getting the regular version of the packaging I got kind of the deluxe version of the packaging baby fucking yes and of course oh gatefold and there's some pretty nice sleeves that a come with the records believe it or not these are to be played at 45 rpm even though they are twelve inches you get about three tracks on both sides I mean did this thing really need to be two records it could have been played at 33 and it could have just been one record but still I mean I I don't fault them because it is nice packaging they did put together a nice vinyl package on this so yes I have played this through it sounds fantastic sounds fantastic on the vinyl sounds heavy on the vinyl here's another group I recently reviewed Karen ear if you remember my recent review of their stuff hardcore punk black metal coming together on this record very filthy very aggressive and hard-hitting production on this thing is what hit me most just very gritty loud and little death metal influence as well and some of the tremolo guitars just how grimy and heavy they are as well as some of the more guttural vocals that turn up in the mix here fairly simple packaging but it's a record feels like it's in good shape not thin air you know flimsy at all nice thick record care near portals to a better dead world haha again here's what it looks like alright next an oldie but a goodie the debut album from um I guess yeah I mean really my favorite wu-tang clan member Ghostface Killah ironman ryan Cappadonna on this LP that big single that he had a what is it motherless child that he had on this album kind of the oh well one of the most tender songs I've ever heard him do ends up on here know is that motherless child yeah pretty sure that's motherless child what do you say maybe I'm wrong no it's all that I got is you mary j blige duh such a fool no motherless child is another track on here that I'm forgetting that is a little more hard-hitting but man that's ride with the piano and I think has a string section in it too it's a very pretty song for Ghostface Killah ironman yeah again we had a gatefold all the credits in here and yeah oh and goes well there's a lot of thank yous in here i got to read this through as i'm listening to it obviously haven't listened to it yet on vinyl alright this next one also a double album also a gay fold though a more recent release just review this black milks no poison no paradise i still enjoy this record quite a bit I watched the dead end hip hop review of this record the guys didn't seem to be as thrilled with this album as I was however I mean if you check my review I was again I mean I feel like Black Milk is a guy who is not an incredibly thrilling emcee to listen to vocally but I do think that for a concept of very personal except albums such as this there were some really interesting lyrics and stories being told on these tracks and this is purple splatter vinyl why yes purple splatter purple splatter holy crap and it's a heavy one too it's a nice heavy purple splatter and this is just really just thick cardboard stick stiff cover packaging this is this is heavy duty like they really put this cover together hoping that people would take this out in DJ and the cover could get beat up because it's not a flimsy ass cover at all just really nice four sided four sides a record and just all purple splatter it's really nice packaging that they put together on this thing and a nice little mural going on in the the gatefold here as well very nice very nice on this black milk vinyl very nice beautiful beautiful packaging bravo Bravo on the packaging and we have we have one more we have one more record to uh to be shown in here I have I shown this yet I think I don't think I have I don't think I have a friend of the show did a trade with me over Twitter we did a trade and gave me his vinyl copy of Tonetta 777 vol 2 so now I have I have the whole family I have Tonetta 777 vol 1 as you can see right there and vol 3 okay so now they're just like one big happy sexually disgruntled family all together like I mean that's pretty much how they roll and you know of course on this second I find it so odd that this this did not this did not sell out this did not sell out but this was sold out maybe they were repressing Zoar more copies of these I have no idea but anyway there were hits hits on here such as hot little fuck and ninja ninja kick k I Kinjo Kinjo just like that death sentence G and B showers dominate picking on Lenin ultimate whore daddy's doing a dyke tonight got a love doing a dyke tonight classic Tonetta right there do you want to die tonight man just really dirty um I like to think of Tonetta as a full Pierrot of sorts or a fuck hero you know and yeah that's that's that's it for this final video those were the recent additions to the record collection sorry if you hated my hat been wearing it all day it's cold my apartment want to keep my head warm not a lot of hair up there and I hope everyone is having a good having a good weekend hope everyone had a good holiday if you celebrated one and we'll talk we'll talk soon but we will talk soon talk about some new music soon very soon and let me know let me know down in the comments any opinions or thoughts on the records that I just picked up and if you recently purchased any records yourselves cool cool Anthony Fantana final updates forever 
OlB6Wvq3YtM,feeling really good today sorry sorry just feeling good today it's all that's all that's all I can say that's all I can say for myself oh come on let's let's go sad sick currently right now is a new jersey-based music producer he has come out with a slew of different projects in the past but we're gonna but but but what we are going to be talking about now is this new self-titled full-length LP that is out via the collective resonance label and electronic music label that has a lot of beat music beat tapes on their electronic music very very forward-thinking and on the surface while this thing may not seem like anything more than your average beat tape on the internet though it is very dense with about 30 tracks in its regular track listing from what I understand you can get off of itunes or bport but if you grab this thing off of band camp for just a few pounds you actually get an additional 16 tracks added to the tracklist of this thing making the final runtime of this altogether about an hour and a half thankfully sad sick comes off on this thing anyway as a pretty versatile producer men not only are the beats he creates on this thing very dense with detail and layers and samples but his influences seemed to spread pretty wide as well while he definitely loves your underground Kings such as mad lib or J Dilla I for sure think that this guy's in the DJ shadow and even newer acts and experimental hip hop instrumentals such as flying lotus he is also I think pretty into neo psychedelic music such as panda bear animal collective stuff or even a little black moth super rainbow now this dude loves sampling so many tracks on this album loaded with samples he tends to layer them very heavily a lot of the time which leads to a lot of these sounds just bleeding into one another in a very psychedelic like display in a very trippy tapestry and the songs themselves sort of fade into one another to a lot of longer tracks here being somewhat well-developed and their book ended by the shorter moments that are maybe a minute or less that seemed to bring the album from one beat one groove one song idea to another I would say overall this album is very diverse set of purposeful odds and ends there are some hiphop inspired head bobbers on this thing like the track citizens sleepwalk a moment that opens this album up kicks things off with a very jutting bass drum groove this guy is fantastic at engineering bass the bass and really everything considering how dense these productions are is so well mixed crisp everything is really defined so despite being overwhelming some of the time I would say a lot of the sounds here are impressively organized because as citizens sleepwalk progresses we have these choppy vocal samples these crispy snares that come into the picture as well as some handclaps and then on top of it melodically we get these swirling organ arpeggios in this very just epic somber bass line that is moving so slowly and it takes the track from being just sort of a quirky hip hop beat to something that's really grandioso so so so and while there are a lot of really great punchy psychedelic cuts on this album that I think are great the latter half of this abridged version as it continues through we sort of get to hear the darker side of sad sick the more tender side of sad sick the more experimental atmospheric side of sad sick with the league of tracks that some of them are really atmospheric and cloudy and feel a bit like a drone or kind of like floating through a dreamworld some tracks like night phantoms still a beat but very very nocturnal and dark and eerie there's the title track on here sad sick which is sort of like this really weird noise wall with a beat happening in the background and some mumbled spoken word not a favorite moment of mine on here but I guess it does show some diversity of sad sick just trying some different things some of which go over really well some of which feel a little boring however nothing happens on this album for so long that it makes me want to flip the track or really angers me however there are tracks on here that I do wish we're longer that's kind of the double-edged sword of making a bunch of tracks that are so short and lumping them in a bunch while there are tracks on this thing that do feel like filler there are tracks that for sure are not going to hit you because you just may not find anything special about them there's no denying the level of ambition that is going into this thing because of how long it is overall and how diverse the songs are together while I don't feel like this album comes together as a cohesive whole there is something about sad sick kind of going into this project making sure there's at least a decent noticeable amount of variety among these somewhat short cuts I'm going to leave a link down there in the description box to check this album out transition and if you've given this zishan if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it really what did you think of it and what should I review next Anthony Fantan oh sad sick forever 
fDOOUiq1hVE,some people are asking me where are you being filmed and the real question is where are you being filmed on the computer on the bus on the train out in the street in the in the club at the convenience store I my camera right now because I want to be so there's new track out that I want you to check out that it's so good it's uh from a band called mankind all caps I believe they stylize their name with and this track of theirs that I want you to check out it's called blood comma sugar they have a few other songs of theirs floating around SoundCloud and they are just heavy fast and tight as hell I love the Psalms this band is dropped so far sort of hoping they come out with an album soon and a serious seriously I like these songs so much I'm psyched for what they're gonna do next they really remind me of like refused but with much more eccentric vocals and a little bit more garage and soul influenced - and the song structures are just kind of wild the guitars are all over the place the drums are really high tight tight and I just think there's a lot of promise right now in in the few songs that I heard thus far I'll link them down there in the description but most importantly I would love for you to check out this on blood comma sugar mmm transition give this track listen let me know what you think and hope you have a nice day thank you for watching Anthony Fantan oh mankind forever 
ElxzDYTLs7k,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new quality Chris album ghost at the finish line this guy is a Detroit rapper songwriter producer he crafted a few of the instrumentals on Danny Brown's triple x-- mixtape and he has a handful of projects out two of which have dropped this year this is the second of them quali chris is an odd dude however I don't think of him as being so strange that I would lump him in with other art rappers such as open mike eagle or bus driver or milo i don't really think he is a meme rapper either or simply absurd and his delivery is far far far from aggressive however I would not call a comatose boring or listless either he's a guy who's just very very chill however his words are very dense with wordplay or deeper meaning or personal introspections or just straight-up weird jokes he's really an equal balance of thoughtful playful and serious there are moments where his music really reminds me of Danny Brown or MF DOOM or mos def push a tee or maybe even like Das Racist I think there are a lot of artists out there that have similar qualities right now to Chris and to me that means potential fans but I think part of what keeps his music from translating far outside of the underground is that he writes his songs to be so low-key Chris's songs have plenty of hooks I wouldn't really say any of them pop per se and there are lots of hip hop artists out there who made that sort of songwriting and and they're great doing that they're completely fine doing that I just think Chris is so eccentric that he has the potential to make songs that are a bit catch here a bit more pop savvy because as of right now like I said a lot of the courses here very understated like on the song loop dreams where essentially we get Chris saying and overdubbing himself saying loop during loop dream Lube dream you may get a moment a very dreary spoken word like on the track King is dead as the hook or a very eccentric shouted refrains such as on the track what up como it's them bitches and another thing that really kind of kills the flow some of these tracks is that structurally Chris keeps it so simple with a lot of these songs starting with mere fade ins or hardens and ending with fade outs or just abrupt finishes the fact that the songs on here don't start or finish that fantastically leaves this LP to me feeling like a bit scatterbrained despite these structuring and the flow limitations that this LP has quality Chris still manages to captivate on many songs here there's a good handful of tracks on here that are completely whacked out and they feel bold because of it case in point the song super this track to me has Chris feeling kind of like a hip hop blow fly where he is working out the calves working on the ABS using the shake weight trying to get in shape frapp and ever since I heard this album one of my favorite things to sing in my apartment has been and then there's the song coke with Denmark in black milk which instrumentally feels like a beat that Swizz Beatz sort of produced in bizarro world I love the ridiculous refrains on the chorus the crazy lyrics throughout the song and of course the at the end where we get a club a club bitches on the flyer e-ever at the club it's moments like this where I feel like Chris is at his most surprising at his most interesting and the closer to to an extent while I don't like this song as a finisher I like the repetitious don't nobody love me don't nobody look over a very quirky spacious synth heavy beat and I like how just simple this song is with Chris saying that nobody loves him but things will change as soon as he gets money the track does seem a little too dumbed down to be interesting however in a way it can kind of be a self-criticism with Chris making so many tracks on this LP about his time in the rap game and trying to make it in the rap game and how maybe he's boiling his passion down to merely wanting to get money on this track making it all seem maybe little shallow in the long run when Chris is serious on this album he is dead serious like on the track loop Dreams which is actually a really depressing look at Chris struggling as an independent artist he's making no traction labels or to his fans think he's made it but he hasn't really made anything and all of this is performed over a very dreary beat with a pretty eerie tremolo simply that I like a lot and I love the track undying one of the best instrumentals on this entire LP with the background vocals oh the Tom beat that feels really primal on this thing as well as the jazzy flourishes of horns that occur throughout this track - it's just a really lovely instrumental and this track is just sort of about Chris's passion for music passion for success I love the refrain on this track where he's saying I thought you did it for the love but I love life and since it's all connected then I guess I got it right and then there's the song life beyond which is sort of an introspective moment about personal choices and on his bars here Chris reflects upon a lot of the other artists around him who sort of influenced him in a positive way in music Black Milk Danny Brown Mosel who actually appears on this track with a verse and then there's the very eerie King is dead one of the more chilling tracks on this LP and there are some more hard-hitting moments - like the previously mentioned what up as well as the song prx with guilty simpson as well as alchemists with open arms is a bit of a posse cut I liked these tracks I mean really I liked all the tracks there are only a few that underwhelmed me but still as a whole when I listened to this album I don't find myself captivated by the entire thing as an experience because of just how unorganized and unkempt it is in a way it's kind of like looking at a really great sculpture but it feels kind of unfinished or it feels like the corners and curves haven't been completely sanded over or chiseled out to perfection there's just something about ghosts at the finish line as a whole that feels kind of a uneventful and while I am drawn to the weirder moments on this LP maybe there are some tracks here that I feel aren't such great songs versus just silly song ideas sort of like super however its spots like this that I think are a testament to Chris's personality because even though these songs don't feel fleshed out that heavily don't feel that builds up I'm not getting a great sense of ambition from the songs on here still Chris is such an eccentric and just off-the-wall rapper that he shines through a lot of it much of the time I'm feeling a decent two strong seven on this transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it he had the name antenna quality Chris forever 
oc5cWsoV3ho,yeah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest me sick nerd and it's time for a review of the new blood orange album Cupid deluxe blood orange is the musical project of singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Devante Hines who you might know for his other recordings under the name like speed champion or even earlier as a part of the band test icicles of course these projects were in different musical styles but this blood orange project of his this is his sophomore album under this name and this project is one that he uses to not play singer-songwriter music or chamber pop or indie rock or pop or dance punk genres that Devante has played in his earlier career but this is all about synth pop synth funk contemporary R&B especially these sounds as they were being portrayed in the eighties this guy tends to where his influences on his sleeve the likes of Michael Jackson Billy ocean Lionel Richie and Prince I'll show up in his tunes in some way shape or form and he grabs all these influences and he portrays them in a way that's really smooth but also very inoffensive and not that catchy or memorable it's like he's grabbing all of the nostalgic Kitsch but just taking out the personality with the vocals and the very sensual grooves on this album it's like blood oranges shooting for sweet and sexy but instead he delivers an album that goes down like a warm flat glass of Mountain Dew there is a lot of revivalism going on right now but there's nothing on this record that says to me that blood orange is great bringing these sounds back with the ambition of like Daft Punk's latest record or the eccentricity of destroyers latest record or the conceptual ideas of a Janelle Monae across the 11 tracks here there are some decent dance grooves being dished out but that is where the strong points of this album start and end because truthfully the songs here are so uneventful that it really becomes difficult not to tune after halfway in to any of them especially since blood orange doesn't really progress a lot of these songs compositionally as they continue not only that but the lyrics and the vocals for every track on this thing just sound like hilarious mimicry I'm singin ACK this these songs have nothing but weak falsettos and breathy vibrato 'he's on top of weak falsettos and breathy vibrato 'he's sometimes sometimes it's tolerable like on the opening track and the song you're not good enough but even these songs sound like they were made with the intent to just merely be background music for whatever store you go to at the mall to buy overpriced clothing I actually think the first interesting moment on this entire LP occurs on the song uncle ace and believe me it is not due to the cheesy sax solo in the middle of this thing and the really melodramatic spoken word which is not attractive at all actually I would call these two things low points on this record right up there with hearing David long strength of the Dirty Projectors sing in this similarly sexy way on the song no right thing which believe me is not sexy or entertaining at all it's like this entire record is just devoted to bringing back this singing style that was hot in the 80s and just redoing it in the most unflattering way possible really the only interesting part of this whole song uncle ace are these woodwinds and horns toward the back end that are arranged in a way where it sounds like it's part of an epic Philip Glass piece it really sounds like Devante is borrowing straight from that Philip Glass playbook and as much of a ripoff as it sounds like it kind of makes me wonder if he can put together musical pieces like this why is he hanging around in the doldrums of offensively simple synth funk and songs that rehash the same instrumental ideas over and over and over throughout the track to the point where the song gets stale like on the line and time will tell the record can't even manage to pull together a good vocal feature from singers who are proven to be good singers like Caroline pull a check of chairlift or the rapper despot who raps for the majority of one single track on here while I do think he is a good lyricist the very hard nails tone of his voice just does not fit on this record at all it really ruins what little flow this LP has going for it already the UK based rapper sceptic ahooo is featured toward the back end of this LP the tone of his voice and just the subtlety of his delivery is much more fitting for what goes on here instrumentally but still I don't really see how his success or him starting to make it in the music industry which is what he raps about in this song is really relevant to the theme of this record out of all of his vocal features Hines gives the most airtime to Samantha herb annie of the band friends who was easily the least interesting vocalist of everyone who was invited onto this thing not only was the full-length from her main band friends really underwhelming but the first few lines she sings on the song it is what it is just sound incredibly awkward and and very amateurish that and the song always let you down and it's like there's no effort to remedy this at all instrumentally these songs feel off at times to either rhythm guitars slightly out of place or the synth solo on the song you're not good enough which is just really really shoddy and boring or the slap bass line on the song always let you down and swing and across the cell P instrumentally I feel like Devante runs out of ideas too like the track always let you down feels like a little bit of a rehash of the first song on here not to mention that it sounds a lot like a track off of glasses first album as well again the only thing I really liked about this LP is that I thought that some of the grooves were pretty good but they're never structured into an interesting song the vocal melodies and the lyrics and the refrains and choruses are never really that memorable neither is the singing that great and really that is maybe the biggest kicker on this entire thing if the singing was fantastic then maybe the incredibly bland songs and instrumentals wouldn't be that big of a deal but they really are simply because there's nothing else to really pay attention to for me Cupid deluxe is a shining example of the darker side of modern music's current addiction to nostalgia because I feel like we're merely gravitating toward this record because of this lost essence that it's captured versus what's actually going on here musically compositionally or vocally sitting through this record is like having someone try to seduce you for 50 minutes straight after you've already told them no ten times because I do not find anything sexy moody emotional or attractive about what goes on here honestly I'm really feeling a light decent too on this thing transition if you give it to Sophia listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino blood orange forever 
hwEA9vhpQDA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new sky ferreira album nighttime my time sky ferreira is a Californian singer and model this is her full-length debut album on which she has a pretty indie friendly sound which she has built up to for a handful of years with some singles and some ep's skies first big musical outing came around 2010 with the single one which was just a really offensively generic piece of dance pop and then last year she had that ghost EP which dropped where you could definitely tell there was movement from point A to point B here instead of dance pop we're getting these indie folk tunes these synthesizer pop tunes that have a bit of grit to them a bit of a underground production aesthetic and then there was the song red lips which had this really heavy loud grunge sound to it for sure sky was evolving and she was putting out tracks that had some nostalgia for past musical movements and was kind of capturing the essence of that with her producers the instrumentals were tight however I've just really been consistently unimpressed with her lyricism and her singing because really I personally find a lot of her songs just be too lovestruck and melodramatic the instrumentation that backs her time and time again is just really really safe and unadventurous and there's nothing about it that says to me anything but this exists just to spotlight the singer which would be fine if she was a stellar singer but really she's not for the most part she's passable on the more acoustic cuts from her ghost EP she's certainly a motive but nowhere near distinct and chock-full of personality I honestly could not pull sky Ferrara's voice out of a lineup if I saw it commit a murderer and then I was called in for police questioning until now sky is kind of held off on dropping a full-length LP though I'm sure she could have done that earlier and I imagine that must have had something to do with maybe her and her producers waiting until they kind of struck upon a sound that they could ride and draw out for 30 to 50 minutes and while I guess they found a direction with this new full-length album I still think sky is sounding as commonplace as ever now just like the new you'd cover on this LP suggests the sound on night time my time is moving into edgier territory however unless you fear the sharpness of butter knives I can't see if phasing you songs like boys and it's your right Christine are essentially dreamy lightly shoegaze pop rock that kind of sounds like a sugary version of a place to bury strangers or like a noise pop version of best coast and you know one of the opening lyrics on this thing about boys being a dime a dozen songs like this are a dime a dozen we already have bands like dum dum girls on the scene and frankly that they're more interesting especially considering the state of the lyrics here where we get this nauseating refrain of cross my heart and hope to die stick a needle in my eye I do get the point of the song with the lyrics progressing talking about how she doesn't trust boys and then eventually she finds a boy that that makes her love again as if she's never been hurt before but it's still not a song I would return to some of the vocal harmonies that pop up with Skye's multitrack vocals on the courses here are very sweet they're very heavenly but most of the comatose moaning which I guess is supposed to be singing most of the verses here is just outright boring it becomes most unbearable on the song Oman ko which is essentially Japanese for but not that that matters because the song is essentially reading Japanese comics Japanese  and having a Japanese Christmas all kind of piled up into this really lame set of lyrics that are so pointless it's just inexcusable and I see that they're sort of a weird post-punk minimal synth influence going on with the instrumental here really cool musical reference going on with this track but still if the lyrics were more interesting I can see it working but mmm they're not another one of the slower songs on here that's incredibly awkward is the closing track which only ends up sounding like a slowed down more atmospheric version of one of the more forgettable songs on this LP melodically and compositionally the song is really simple so I imagine there must be something really emotional or powerful about hearing Skye awkwardly vocalize in the midst of this very reverb heavy instrumental but if there is I'm not seeing it please educate me the best songs on this album because there are some good ones here are the ones that make no buts about what sky ferreira is a pop singer that makes pop music the sweeter songs on here are much more enjoyable than the foe experiments and mock rock like the arena Psy's new wave ballad 24 hours great it's the first song in this entire LP that makes sense Sky's voice is not strong enough for modern radio pop so having her sing sleepily over this somewhat vintage synth pop ballad is fantastic the hook is catchy as hell the plinking synthesizers behind her voice over that chorus melody sound great and the lyrics about being with this person for the next 24 hours wishing this day could last forever wishing the clock had no hands it's a sweet song and so are other tracks like you're not the one really nice lead single that is not so big but still a very catchy track then there is blame myself and love in stereo tracks that are heartbroken or really smitten and sometimes about more personal stuff that I can't necessarily get down with specifically on I blame myself I feel like there's so many moments on this LP where sky takes the opportunity to lyrically remind the listener or maybe remind people she's frustrated with that you don't know me she's trying to put out this message that she's not being understood and that people aren't listening to her and while sky does have some very passionate vocals when singing on this topic I just feel like I want to be spared when it comes to this because really if you want to convince people that there's more to you sing on legitimately interesting instrumentals or don't deliver lyrics that are laughably dumbed down case in point the song heavy metal heart or the track nobody asked if I was okay where again and again and again we are reminded that nobody asked sky if she was okay overall there are some bright poppy spots on this LP that I enjoy but even the better tracks on here including the big single feel slightly disposable when the songs on this LP try to work outside of that poppy comfort zone into something noisier grittier more rock driven it just becomes whatever as much as Skye and her producers might like post-punk and garage rock they really failed to capture the excitement and the rawness and the essence of these genres and just create very pale imitations I am pretty much feeling a light for on this record transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it you have to be Fantino night time my time forever 
gdXGEworpCI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new soup cans EP parasite brain soup cans is a filthy scuzzy gross disgusting and raw ass rock van from Ontario Canada this is their new EP they have two full-length albums that drop before this if the music here interests you I do recommend that you check out their 2012 album good feelings it breezed by me last year and these guys are a trio that embraced the sounds of noise and garage rock and psychedelic rock and really noisy post-hardcore acts like the jesus lizard and this band is just not bring incredibly low phi distorted and saturated production to the table but their approach to vocals is pretty interesting as well basically their philosophy is to be as insane as humanly possible while still sounding like you're actually fronting a rock band these six tracks on the CP barely breached the 10-minute mark but what the CP does not have in length it does have in intensity with the vocals the distorted bass the distorted guitars and the very dirty drums all blaring it's such a high volume that after listening to this thing even one time through years will be just ha ha the opening track on here parasite brain the title track has this fast killer riff and the vocals are really caught up in the chaos of everything going on in this song but they just go so berserk that they feel as if they're drowned out by nothing there's a moment where the band slows down the riff of this song out of nowhere with no warning whatsoever and it adds up to a pretty interesting moment and there's also the masturbatory guitar solo that happens after this that really just feels more like noise-making than actual solo and even though there are things about this track that I think are are catchy just the speed and the intensity of it just it's it's so over and done with right as it starts it's like ripping off a really big band-aid then there is the song new teeth that comes right after the opener a more mid-paced track on here and a moment that is one of my favorites just because of how hopeful insane the vocals are a track that is really minimal lyrically got no teeth I got OJ with these lyrics being kind of grunted out as if they're being performed by a caveman and I just love the band where they're pulling together something a little slower like this because then things just seem so much more noisy and insane there are great faster tracks on here like the closer where essentially the vocals are rendered down simply too but still moments like this are just a bit of a blur it's these slower tracks that just bring that pain and so much more of an intense way which maybe is why my favorite track on here is future crimes part two the longest song on here and when I say longest I mean this song is like the length of three other tracks on this EP it is the slowest track on here as well featuring these loud loud 4 soup cans booming guitar chords that are just Brown Wow very primal drums and some of the most deranged vocals yet on this entire release and you know for a band that plays it this loose soup cans do seem to have some kind of command over their dynamics because as this song goes on it just gets more and more and more intense again what this EP does not have in length it does have an impact and it's it's definitely something you're gonna want to seek out if you like your music to work like a hot strong black cup of coffee being violently splashed into your face even though there are a few moments on here that are a blur and I do wish this EP were longer and I do wish the lyrics were fleshed out a little bit more so that they added to the insane quality of the vocals the vocals and the distorted guitars the dissonant guitars and the catchy grooves are all just so sharp that it's hard for me it's impossible for me really to charge much of what's on the sea as being forgettable or just sort of run-of-the-mill I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing transition if you've given the sepia listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fan Tan Oh soup cans parasite brain EP forever 
IhzS6Du5-nI,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new moon face album Julia with blue jeans on moon face is the pseudonym for Canadian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Spencer Cruz he has been in a number of different successful bands and projects over the years like Swan Lake sunset rubbed down as well as Wolf Parade his newest his moon face and it's the most indulgent and seemingly flexible of his project so far putting out an EP of songs based on marimba an album of songs based around organ another full-length album where he actually featured a full-fledged band that was playing songs he had written he's been releasing at least something with every year that he's been writing music under this name and his latest here Julia with blue jeans on is another pretty surprising turn in his moon face based ventures Spencer is not with a band on this record he's back to doing things solo and he is on he is behind his main acts the piano and this LP delivers 10 tracks that are a little out of the ordinary for Spencer in that they are very personal and blatant about the fact that Spencer is writing about some experiences that he's had especially dealing with a lot of the tracks on here are very clearly love songs however it's not like Spencer explores just simply one side of love throughout this record this album has romance and tragedy infatuation loneliness and there are some moments here where Spencer is just being deeply introspective like on spots such as love the house you're in it feels like he's trying to deliver these personal experiences without sugarcoating things over dramatizing things or building things up a little too much this philosophic approach that Spencer is taking with the lyrics on this LP is stated in just a few lines on the title track here it's a mad man's game making the commonplace unreal fantasy it's a madman's game at the very least a young man's game thank you thank you thank you and this is really like a turning point for Spencer because typically his songs lyrically are so odd and esoteric and extravagant and eccentric he's not even delivering his lyrics on a lot of these songs in an incredibly concise way there are so many tracks here where it feels like his lyrics are just rambling they're not structured that heavily at all and this is a direction that I think Spencer pulls off very well some of the time maybe not so well on other tracks here I think an example of this working out was when Spencer can pull together a passionate track a moving track a riveting track like the title track on here where there's a lyric that hits me where he says I think the only word worth singing is not God it's you and the track to me is all about finding beauty it's about finding inspiration in not only the ordinary but this other person whom you are in love with then on the flip side of this double-edged sword we have the song dreamy summer which is one of the longer tracks here and meanders melodically structurally vocally lyrically to the point where I just feel like this song is very very mundane there's not really much about it that I like aside from the very refined piano playing however I do think Spencer is conscious of that mundaneness and doesn't care because I think he's focusing a lot more on just exercising these emotional demons and kind of taking the good with the bad on that and it really is more good than bad a lot of the time on here like with the opening track barbarian where I feel like lyrically Spencer is putting his dark side and putting his more innocent side on display measuring them up a bit something that I think he does in an even more bold and obvious way on barbarian part 2 a 2 minute track a follow up but in between these two tracks is maybe my favorite on this entire LP everyone is Noah everyone is the ark where Spencer is taking relationships and needing other people whether these relationships be tonic or romantic or whatever and comparing this to the story of Noah and the Ark I think my favorite line on this entire track is when he says everyone ends up talking to the sky or staring the elephants in the eye another particular line on here that makes the metaphor really obvious is when Spencer is saying that everyone gathers Souls around themselves to feel needed and useful and loved then there is the dark yet unapologetically cheesy November 2011 a track where Spencer is talking about how he is destroying his own music and how it wasn't that good anyway destroying computers and getting together with his significant other in this track who he refers to as his slaughterer and I feel like there are a group of lines on this track that display just how crazy Spencer and this girl are and how flawed their relationship is but there are moments of great beauty throughout this track too but then we get hit with the refrain it's just basically a repeat over and over and over of baby we both know that we're both crazy baby as far as other tracks on here there's the very dramatic black is back in style and the very grand closing track your chariot may be not one of the most epic songs on this LP but as far as the piano playing on here it is very very again grand and a beautiful display of Spencer's chops to kind of close this LP out as far as the sound goes on here it's a very simple portrayal of voice and piano the piano sounds like this very well-kept grand piano and the sound the recording is just pristine and the singing on this record another change for Spencer in a sense is some of his most vulnerable yet I feel like you can call Spencer Krug a lot of things but you cannot call the man emotionless as he croons and yelps and moans and shouts and through every single track here typically songs like the ones that are delivered on this LP where the structure and the lyricism and the story and just the point is also it just doesn't turn me on I mean prime examples the last weekend album the new Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album however with Spencer's captivating vocals and potent emotions and somewhat self-deprecating lyrics I think this and the very sharp piano playing adds up to some great introspections a lot of personality and some very enjoyable songs too I didn't love this thing but I did like it quite a bit I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this transition if you've given this up he'll listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana moon face forever 
RYOtj-5SSPo,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and just letting you know that Rat King the New York experimental hip-hop outfit has a new track out titled 100 hit the description box down there to give it a listen a lot of you might remember that I reviewed their wiki 93 EP about a minute ago and was a little on the fence with it loved some tracks was pretty underwhelmed by others however this track to me so good that has got me kind of wondering or rather anticipating where they're gonna go next Bumi hip-hop beat on this thing a lot of bass kicks very steady hi hats and a very eerie synth lead that reminds me quite a bit of 90s West Coast hip-hop and wiki rapping on top of this beat reminds me a lot of like a young young zack de la rocha but very very smooth Rat King finding a balance between their very dark abrasive kind of moody production and a lyrical emphasis as well again give this track of listen let me know you think of it down there in the description box it's out now on itunes as well at the moment and yeah that's it Rat King 100 
-v5hKxV70-0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new mi l b'm matang e mi a is a UK via Sri Lanka singer rapper producer and songwriter who is on her fourth full-length commercial studio album right here when mi is music first gained popularity in underground music her sound was fresh exciting and bright she had this really eccentric vocal style and these very hard-hitting and colorfully produced beats that featured musical influences from all around the world and after this full-length debut mi a took this very magnetic personality in her music and focused it into some bonafide hits on her next full-length record kala and the singles on this record made her a household name in the world of pop music at the time also made her a pretty controversial figure she was collaborating and performing with big-name artists her name was on everyone's lips it seems like she was really on the cusp of becoming a long-lasting figure in mainstream music and she just threw it all away not in this really dramatic way or anything like that even though there were some spats and Fiasco's that have occurred in relation to her over the past few years that we could talk about New York Times super bowl these things certainly impacted her popularity on the whole but I think really what made her take a nosedive musically was her third full-length LP Maya an LP whose instrumentals moved into territory that was way noisier just harsher more obtuse than anything on her previous records at the time this record was released the harsh power tools and the shots of noise and the heavy heavy kick drums opening up one of the tracks here step up turn a lot of people sour even I myself did not find a lot of the production on this LP to be all that pleasant to the ears however in a world where currently we have things like Death Grips and trap electro bangers because people love that bass and they love those hard-hitting noises I think it might be worth kind of going back and re listening to this record simply because of how bombast the beats on this thing are even though this record did get a mixed reception it didn't slow m.i.a down a bit she went on to release the Viki Leakes mixtape shortly after and last year she put out her biggest single yet only seconded by Paper Planes Bad Girls which lands on this LP the song is catchy as hell fantastic chorus really sweet epic and catchy Middle Eastern melody as well as a hard banging groove and vocal emia brings that cool as a cucumber charisma that makes some of her best songs so great so not only does this LP have some of em is best tracks ever on it but it's not like some of the mixed reception around her last record has really shaken her sound at all because some of the tracks on this LP are just as unapologetically noisy as moments on Maya like the song Yolo with these buzzing bass lines and these very very loud shouts from mi a at the beginning a really catchy chorus banger beats lyrically there's a lot of club imagery but again mi a is kind of doing a little clever turn of phrase here talking about that excess and that materialism in mainstream music but also talking about hey yalla you always live again Hinduism Eastern religions and forms of philosophy and it's not like she comes off in songs like this as if she's looking down her nose at you or anything like that its tracks like this that like any hip-hop artist mi aegis braggadocious Li represents what she's all about and there are other tracks here that are also freaking just aa huge bangers that I find to be just as enjoyable like only one you and warriors there is the song Double Trouble bubble which is sort of a weird fusion of electro trap and reggae it's an oddly refreshing combo and just a fun song then there's no it ain't right which is kind of this slowed down trap sex ballad that is kind of catchy one of the more underwhelming tracks on the album but I like that they were able to take this very hard aggressive sound that's very popular right now and kind of turn it into something that's a little sweeter or tender in a way and then there's the song attention just kind of another sort of left-field surprise on this album where essentially instrumentally we have a two-step type track and I know this B I know this rhythm is really popular right now on electronic music and rarely do I catch an artist sort of doing a one-off track in this style where it feels really bold and interesting and very brash and that is certainly what I got here with how zany and noisy and colorful the production is which Mis production typically is it's not like she put together some kind of sleeper snoozer of a two-step track especially with the lyrics on this track doing a sort of odd concept throughout where mi a is using words over and over and over that had the word tent in them and emphasizing that word of the very brash I use the word again use of auto-tune like president-- attention 10 account tent mutant most of the experiments that mi a does on this record most of the new ground she tries to step on at least new for her goes over pretty well I think one of the most underwhelming spots though is the moment here where she samples the weakened track lucky star or the song Exodus in a way I do feel like songs such as Exodus put a line between moments when mi a is singing and that really sort of listless girly silly tongue-in-cheek style like on the song come walk with me a track out here that I do like but her voice kind of just gets old for me by the end of the track especially with the repeating lyrical verses but still that is a very fun interesting and hard-hitting a song about social media friendship people interacting in this current modern technology age but here on Exodus mi use singing is just fiery it's passionate the beat is especially killer and Atmospheric and epic it's just a shame that across this track which is one of the longest on this LP mi a singing and the beat don't change up that significantly and it just all kind of gets stale by the end of it there's not that much structure to this track and I feel like the entire song hinges a little bit too much on this lone weekend sample the song lights to me has that same issue of just not being diverse enough from beginning to end and then there is the song sexy de switch finishes this album off and it's just like a hard trap a fied banger version of Exodus the sample is pretty much the same mi a singing on this track is exactly the same it doesn't even feel like she changed the vocal take at all either to hear it rehashed in this way it's just not that great it doesn't add to the album for me at all still despite my complaints about that track and a handful of other songs on here that that underwhelmed me a bit in just this general overall feel that this album doesn't flow all that well I did think a vast majority of these tracks were great to listen to like usual mi a comes through with tons of personality great beats and production sharp singles despite some lyrical and vocal limitations mi a craftsman really fun thoughtful and infectious tracks on this LP still her first two LPS are my favorites this album does not beat them out but I'm still feeling a decent a strong 7 on this thing transition but if you've given this LP a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it mi a Matangi forever 
_g2wiO5w0dc,hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Daniel Avery album drone logic before we get into this LP I know some of you are still a little sad still a little down in the dumps but hey come on it's another day another album to listen to put a smile on your face it's alright man chill I love you Daniel Avery is a uk-based electronic music producer he has released this full-length debut of his drone logic right here on fantasy records earlier this year and I was pretty impressed with what this guy was doing with techno and house music from a technical and from a sonic standpoint I wouldn't say Daniel Avery is reinventing the wheel here or violently burning down the status quo even though he's not blowing me away with a really experimental take on these genres he is delivering a very long album a very well assembled tracks the beats on this LP have a lot of rigid robotic techno characteristics but are still undeniable to the hips a lot of Drive in these rhythms and I think the bass lines are especially bouncy it's really nice to hear beats that have such a synthetic aesthetic but still appeal to those very deep got to move to this primal instincts there are quite a few vocal snippets on this thing moments like Walter Jones weird little cuts of spoken word that play throughout a lot of these tracks for the most part the vocals add to the very stone-faced near emotionless vibes that this album gives off through a lot of its sounds even these sustain singing notes on the opening track here that are sampled and looped over and over and over are manipulated and distorted and feel so grainy that they are just merely a shell of their former selves in terms of feeling human anyway the most tender vocal cut on this entire LP is the whispered singing on the closing track knowing we'll be here it's pretty nice to hear a techno album an electronic music album that starts off so just lockstep and chilly war month as it progresses relatively anyway like on the very gently pulsating soft and melodic tracks Samuel wreck or the track new energy which gets progressively more and more intense and noisy and fiery as it goes on with a very krautrock inspired beat and there are a lot of sharp and noisy drones that occur on some of these tracks to adding a bit of emotional heat and intensity as far as the melodies go on this LP and the counterpoint with the bass lines and some of the synth chords that pop up Daniel Avery's approach is very simple but there is purpose here because all of these elements do add up into some catchy synth sequences or just a really potent moody mix of sounds and structurally these tracks justify five six seven eight minutes song lengths with the theory that if you start out with a great groove you can keep things interesting by varying the rhythms dropping out ideas introducing new ideas or slowly layering tracks for a gradual climax and even though drone logic to an extent is easy to sum up as an album it doesn't take away from the magic and the tension of listening to these songs in the moment like the song water jump which has multiple phases and all of them leave me feeling like I'm listening to the soundtrack to driving at night at very high speed through a neon lit City 1000 years into the future and things get especially epic when a few very grainy minor tone chords enter the picture on top and already growing pile of beats synth leads vocal samples and some ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bass and some tracks do hit harder than others with some very punchy rhythms and hard ass bass like the song naive response whose low end is very heavy and rubbery as the song progresses with its bassline just bouncing over and over and over or the song these nights never end whose groove is very lightly kissed with these sharp distorted oddly placed since sequences and these eerily sustain notes I will say that the Assembly of sounds on this LP lacks a certain finesse that you might find in the productions of an R like John Hopkins or Pantha new prints however I do kind of enjoy the hard entrances and exits of new sounds and ideas on these songs because it does add to the already enjoyably rigid characteristics that these songs have to offer and while there are some sharp noisy drones on these tracks that I do like and I did kind of expect given that the name of this album his drone logic for the most part the drones do feel more like an accent or a side dish not a main attraction the most spotlight a drone gets on this LP is on the 1-minute interlude tracks spring 27 and even though the drones do add character to this LP they're not exactly enough to save some of these tracks from their very very repetitive selves like the song all I need where even though the drone is entering the picture and changing things up slightly there's not enough variation in the instrumentation underneath that to kind of keep things feeling tense and the song all I need is well to me is is lacking in a bit of drive to progress and kind of change the sound of this song as it plods along so yeah there are a few tracks on here that do feel a little less developed a little less detailed than others and I did think the clothes are on here while good was sort of anticlimactic for a finishing track that and the fact that I felt like there really could have been a little more sonic adventure going on with these tracks these were the only major issues I had with this album though again I don't think Daniel Avery is reinventing the wheel here he has put together a series of very very well crafted techno tracks with great grooves rhythms bass lines since sequences I am feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition but if you've given this up he'll listen what did you think why am i whispering what should i review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Daniel every drone logic forever 
Ca1tyVTGf3w,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Death Grips album government plates Death Grips is an experimental hip-hop trio and you might already be familiar with their very noisy aggressive chaotic and cutting-edge fusion of rap electronic music and industrial music and you might already be familiar with just how prolific they are as a band as well since they put out their first major full-length project ex-military they ended up dropping two full-length albums the following year one of which was my favorite of 2012 many many stores goodale good good and the other was the root of one of the year's biggest musical controversies with Death Grips releasing it onto the internet for stream and for download completely for free to their fans against their labels wishes at the time Epic Records who dropped them shortly after labels they're doing and earlier this year the band made the announcement that they would be dropping their next full-length LP in 2014 however just this past week suddenly out of the blue no warning whatsoever they decided to put out their latest full-length LP that I assume they had been working on all this time and maybe plan to drop next year government plates however after giving this new release of Death Grips multiple listens I'm not really feeling much more than a light six on it I was pretty impressed with what this LP was doing or trying to do with the first several tracks here the opening song on this thing featuring some broken glass very shrill since enter the picture and ride vocally gives one of his most intense performances on any Death Grips track ever the chilling screams at the start of this track are fantastic as well as the very speedy demonic passage of vitriol that are also spat throughout this thing not only that but this track feels like one of the least hip-hop oriented songs that Death Grips has ever done the groove onthis thing as well as the very heavy fuzz doubt bass riffs this song more than anything sounds like a lightning bolt or at least a black pus track I would even compare some of these bass riffs to a dubstep drop and I realize there are a lot of people out there that make that comparison to Death Grips in a negative way however I find fusions like this very interesting and I think it's great with tracks like this that Death Grips is sort of on the cusp of some new and interesting sounds still the second track on here and Bonnie has some squelching synth arpeggios that I think are fantastic the tone of these scents isn't too unlike a lot of moments from no love deep web and when the very loud bass e crunchy distorted bass kicks enter the picture after a pretty tone down intro on this thing the song just goes into hyperdrive and it is super aggressive and vocally ride just gets crazier and crazier and crazier as the song progresses another favorite of mine on here to heavens which is a song that I think features one of the most unique beats Death Grips has ever worked on Zak Hills drums are not only very punchy and hard-hitting on this track but I love the sampled metallic tones that are placed throughout this song especially as it gets going into the verses it's really panoramic it's dizzying it's kind of psychedelic and there are also some pitch shifted samples of emcee rides vocals placed throughout this track too now sampling rides vocals and re using them on a track or placing them in different spots of a track nothing new for Death Grips but I do think it is kind of the downfall of a handful of songs on here instead of some fresh verses after every chorus or a vocal performance that changes and evolves as the song progresses we get a league of tracks on here that don't really feature much vocal input and some of these tracks are pretty short too I can really only call them beats since there's not just a unique vocal performance on the track we're just kind of getting a sample and it's being played throughout and while I don't really mind a beat or an instrumental from or even death grips in theory a lot of these songs are incredibly underwhelming and just kind of leave me feeling like I'm listening to Death Grips with all of the ferocity and all of the noise but none of the coherence like the song this is now which is incredibly chaotic electronic probably the best of all of these instrumental type tracks merely because of how interestingly the percussion is treated on this thing with these phaser drums which feel like they're just bouncing and echoing and creating some really psychedelic textures the layers of rhythms and grooves on this track absolutely insane even if the last minute of this song just kind of feels like a copy and paste job of everything that happened before and the song over flow another track on here that I like killer freakin bass drop on this thing total highlight of this entire album but again I feel like the second half is just another copy and paste job here of whatever is going on in the first half redundancy keeps a lot of these songs from feeling like songs and instead just leaves them feeling like song ideas especially on tracks for that redundancy that repetition gets incessant tracks like feels like a wheel and bootleg songs that I literally cannot stand because of how stale the songs get even 30 seconds in and while these instrumental tracks do bring some newer sounds into the fold for Death Grips there are some songs here that just feel like they have no surprise to them whatsoever like the title track on here which just feels like a remix of the no love Deep Web song black dice a very uninteresting remix in the song big house I like the speedy synth arpeggios and the very quiet tone down eerie beats and verses on the second half of this track too but again it's another moment where it cuts out and it feels like it could have been an interesting Death Grips song but it's just too short of breath to leave a long lasting impact and then the final song on here while it is maybe the most ambitious with its length it suffers from the same incessant repetitions that make so many other tracks on your just blatantly uninteresting overall I gotta say death grips on this LP still very aggressive very original and very attention-grabbing with some very good songs great songs for them on the and however once this album grabs your attention it is very very very little to maintain it for the duration of its very short length on this thing half-baked song ideas uselessly repetitive song structures shorter track lengths less of a focus on lyrics less of a focus on memorability Death Grips has come through with a record that has much less impact than the money store ex-military and no love deep web transition but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Death Grips government plates forever 
2lR7MWjLGDU,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lady Gaga album artpop Lady Gaga is a New York pop music artist this is her third full-length LP she has released two before this and an EP by the name of the fame monster and across her handful of releases thus far she has had some incredibly ubiquitous hits like bad romance as well as pokerface Born This Way but personally I've never been somebody who has taken Lady Gaga that seriously outside of her singles not only that but I think the album she came out with a few years ago born this way is easily one of the worst mainstream pop albums to come out in a while my issue with this record and Lady Gaga in general is that she has this eccentric look and way of dress these alternative personalities as well as this political activism edge - it seems like she's adventurous and experimental with everything except her music which she keeps incredibly bland and uninvent Eurus really Gaga did the worst thing that I think a pop artist can do to their fans on this record and that is give us some really great memorable singles but then have the rest of the album just be really fun enjoyable maybe this is less of a sin in the download age when people can just kind of grab the songs they want and don't listen to what they don't want to but still after a long very painful album like this I can understand that it is easy to count Lady gaga out maybe not just predict her downfall in popularity but maybe sort of write her off and just expect nothing interesting from her ever for the rest of her career and that prediction seems to be coming true in a sense because this is easily Gaga's most lukewarm album release year yet but I like art pop I think it's her best album yet and I understand why a lot of you might hate her image in her persona and her very look at me style and publicity stunts but at least on this LP Gaga is taking very little high-heeled baby stuff in a direction that I've always wanted her to go in it all I've ever wanted Lady Gaga to be is consistent if you are mentally and personally as whacked as you look then put out music that lives up to that and I'm not saying Lady Gaga should put out something avant-garde or anything like that she's a pop artist I expect her to put out pop music but give me pop music with some legitimately great fantastic instrumentals with some amazing music being written into them give me some personality give me catchy melodies give me a sense of bliss and that is what I got on here for at least a good chunk of the tracks and it's funny there are a lot of professional critics out there right now who are saying that this record is really run-of-the-mill for Lady gaga but maybe Lady Gaga shtick is getting kind of old for some people because truth be told it's not like there's much more to her than her shtick it's not like she's an incredible wordsmith or anything like that like on the song or aware our first introduction to the chorus is do you want to see me naked lover do you want to peek underneath the covers or the song dope where toward the beginning of the song Lady Gaga is saying I up again because I lost my only friend and then the song gypsy where it gets really ridiculous naming off all these different places I get the concept of the song and kind of going around and being a bit of a nomad maybe through how Lady Gaga is always moving in her career and touring so on and so forth but toward the end I'm a gypsy gypsy gypsy Hey then there's the song Donatello which is kind of a parody of Donatella Versace and a lot of the sort of high-class fashion types out there and even though there are mentions on this track of being blonde being a rich bitch only having eaten a salad all day asking your gay friends for tanning advice it feels like the song just does not go far enough to be truly funny or biting or hilarious not only that but the vocal melody on this track and the verses seem so underneath Lady Gaga's chops because she has some serious pipes and at the end of the day it only ends up kind of like a Weird Al parody when it comes to writing lyrics Lady Gaga just does not have that much tact however the fact that she doesn't mince words sometimes as sort of a makes the song so entertaining to go back to the song dope where we have the refrain I need you more than dope I need you more than dope where Lady Gaga is just on this huge meatloaf trip and then there's the song sex dreams which kind of gets me in the mood what you in the mood for I'll tell you when you're older and with Lady Gaga's lyrics on this track touching yourself when you're thinking of this person with these dirty thoughts in your head how you and this other individual are convicted felons of thought the song is just so hyper sexual it's like Madonna's like a virgin except never a virgin ever and then there's the track swine where Lady Gaga is straight up calling someone a pig talking about squealing and screaming herself all over this track again another moment where Gaga is just really yet one of her most vocally eccentric zenus to hear her singing in such a weird and just over-the-top way is a little refreshing to me like on the opener or aware again we return to a moment very similar to Born This Way where we have some Spanish guitar playing but musically we slide very quickly into what seems like some middle eastern vocal melodies over an instrumentation change and then as the beat kicks in and really gets going on the track it's like we're getting some jittery French electro house sounds that remind me a lot of justice and this very progressive noisy abrasive fidgety EDM sound is pretty consistent throughout the very colorful instrumentals on this thing and when aura starts Gaga's vocals on this thing are just so whacked I'm not a wandering slave I'm a woman of choice then there is the song Venus which is essentially this love fueled intergalactic space travel mission of epic pop proportions with a very explosive harmonious chorus and some verses that March in this really militaristic way and then there's a refrain that comes up later in the track take me to your planet a moment that really reminds me of like some 90s era Michael Jackson this is a really multifaceted track in terms of structure for lady gaga especially with the very tight tight multitrack vocal harmonies on the back end which are so colorful and quick to hit that they remind me of lightning of Montreal song there are other moments where the instrumentals really surprised me like the trap influence beat on the back end of manicure or the rock opera esque instrumentation on the end of Mary Jane Holland and there are more straightforward tracks on this LP too that I think are just as entertaining just because the song and melody is so freakin catchy like GUI and the disco fried fashion which is so freakin enjoyable I love the groove I love the fashion this track is so fun to me it makes me wish I was a rich socialite piece of with nothing to live for other than a coke habit and expensive clothes I would just blast this song all day I blast this song all day anyway however there are tracks on here that I do not blast all day I would not blast any day for example jewels and drugs a song that I do not get down with based simply on premise it's a track rap song the very quirky instrumental reminds me a bit of tonight and I do like the beat here and I think the chorus here is pretty whacked out we've added Rosa Maya and the song even features rapped verses from ti too short and twist up but I am NOT trying to hear TI rap about beating the case on a lady gaga album the other feature idea on this LP ruins what could have potentially been the greatest song on this album the greatest song Lady Gaga has ever done do what you want the sexiest song on this record it hits with this very pulsating thick heavy rigid New Wave inspired beat just really done and then and then Lady Gaga's voice sounds fantastic on this track I love the refrain man as basic as it is it just works do much and then our Kelly comes into the picture and now only is his lyrical contribution to this track incredibly weak but this is the last guy who you should be giving license to do whatever he wants to your body and you know why it's the same reason Lady Gaga has to be careful pronouncing the word party around him or else it will sound like potty he'll pee on you oh he went there oh yeah there are a few softer ballads on this LP that aren't too bad but aren't too exciting either like the title track which sort of in a weird way reminds me of a Crystal Castles song if they were totally stripped of reverb and were really made to rely on the vocal melodies of their tracks and then again there's the song dope which goes in that meatloaf s direction and it's an okay track but I wish it had a very explosive Bat Out of Hell type ending to kind of finish things off the track gypsy sort of goes in that same direction too with how it opens up with the piano piece and then kicks in with some pop house beats and some Springsteen influences on the vocal melody but this track just feels sort of redundant to me on this LP it doesn't really add anything it feels like in a way what dope should have been and then there's applause which I feel like is a very good single not Lady Gaga's hottest but certainly a highlight for me on this album I love how eccentric she is on the verses here for me what makes this song good is a lot of what makes the tracks earlier on this LP so good overall I feel like this album has more positives than negatives for Lady Gaga for one the beats the instrumentals are fantastic props to her producers on every single track here I feel like Lady Gaga is still a great singer she is certainly facing in a stranger direction on this album with songs that still remain catchy fun and have personality but on the con side there are a lot of underwhelming tracks on here too and moments where it feels like Lady Gaga just doesn't go far enough to be interesting and again Lady gaga when it comes to lyrics her ideas seem so half-baked at times while I do like this album if this is as art as pop gets pop has a pretty dismal future I would say I'm feeling a strong six on this thing transition but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantan Oh Lady Gaga art pop forever 
BVAuofrPpfU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cara cara cara near album portals to a better dead world before i review this thing though there's got to be a retraction i recently did a review of the new action bronson mixtape and in this review i said that action bronson has an alter-ego on this tape by the name of big body bes when the fact of the matter is is that that is not an alter ego at all he's actually a real guy sometimes you hear people and they sound like other people and you assume they're the same person just like how when someone looks like another person you assume they're the same person you won't say it it is a good to say don't talk I don't need you to talk right now okay so action bronson big body best i apologize many please forgive me yes kara near is a dallas rock and metal duo and this I believe is their third full-length album now the members of this duo Chris Francis and Gary Brent's they have been in a bunch of different rock and metal outfits of various styles over the years and this variety shows up in how they write songs for this album a lot of the tracks on here feature vocals that blur the lines between punk rock scream Oh black metal death metal there are plenty of guitars that are quickly strummed on this thing feature a bit of tremolo picking and some very dark archaic mulatto sysm but the tone of the guitar is very very clear it's not like the guitars are sort of over modulating or blurring in some kind of lo-fi mix or anything like that they're actually quite punchy and very tangible like black metal mixed with the power and ferocity of just straight-up punk rock it's a stylistic blend that I think a lot of you will find sort of familiar to that deafheaven album sunbather that dropped recently and while that LP is good deafheaven is definitely going for something a little they look for a certain crescendo to carry their tracks a certain level of reverb an atmosphere to carry their tracks instead care near is just so much more raw bear in your face instead of a big up and down rollercoaster ride it's more like a brick to your skull the seven tracks here very pretty heavily in terms of song length from the ten minute closer to the two minute four Lauren loves a song that kicks off with some really intense speed some brutal blast beats some blood-curdling screams very dismal guitar lead melodies slither in when the drums and the rest of the instrumentation seem to slow down for a few moments at a time this song definitely has intensity but I wouldn't say it's one of the more memorable songs here this track and maybe a couple others too are that I guess distinct from a melodic or a riff standpoint a lot like the opening track on here which is this really interesting hybrid of black metal and scream oh the lines are really blurred on this track and it seems like these genres have more in common than ever but sometimes it feels like the most novel thing that this band has to offer is their mash of these genres because their approach to song structure and melody writing and riff writing doesn't really feel anywhere near as novel or as radical I can't say every track on this LP is that way though the track closing doors definitely catches my attention another song on here that features some really high speed guitar work and drums very tight very intense but the guitar leads on this track are just so bright and ear catching I love the fast tones that are playing not only does this track sound like clenched teeth and white knuckles but the melody written into this song sort of makes these angry feelings feel triumphant and I love the way this track sort of settles down in the middle with some dark primal guitar work and then finishes off of the riff at the end it feels a little speed metal inspired this is a moment where I feel impressed with the structure of the track not only that but this song glides very nicely segues nicely into the next song on here and this track 2 features a lot of speed blood-curdling screams and a chord progression that feels really anthemic but as this court progression repeats throughout the song it sort of loses its flavor just kind of gets a little stale I sort of have the same issue with the song exalting the shadow proprietor what a little longer tracks on this LP seven-minute song in which I think the most interesting moments are the first two minutes where you get this really nice violin this riff that feels like an epic march into battle and then the last two minutes of the track which has one of the most fiery amazing guitar solos on this entire LP the coup de Gras on this album is the final track the 10-minute long three thousand three hundred and eighty pounds and in a way it feels that way it feels like you're kind of being crushed by that amount of weight in a really unpleasant way though I do like the vocals on this track the very cleanly sung vocals which I assume are sung by a female but they're kind of a nice heavenly contrast from the very hellish vocals that are performed throughout much of this album and of course the duo brings some strings onto this track as well they're really pulling out all the stops on this song and trying to write the most unique track that this album has to offer and honestly all the very dark heavy riffs leading up to the end which is this very wide panoramic blissful drone of guitars it's it's just okay it's like there are some very blase moments on this LP that really breeze by me but the band manages to surround them with some really fantastic ideas and it's just got me on the fence a little bit with this LP though I think in the end I really do like it overall there is some great production on this thing really great performance intense playing very tight there's definitely a very refreshing combination of influences on this LP there's a nice variety among the tracks here every song felt pretty distinct from the other I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition but if you've given this LP a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Carra near album review forever 
KLSF6OExWec,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Action Bronson and party supplies mixtape blue chips dos movember super refresh style Action Bronson is a New York MC who sticks pretty passionately to that East Coast hardcore hip-hop tradition early on in his career his flow and his voice earned him a lot of Ghostface Killah comparisons but as he's progressed from project to project and drop more songs he's really separated himself from his influences in a pretty big way with his lyrical style which pretty much adds up to excess excess and excess a lot of food a lot of eating which is something that is sort of informed by his background as a cook and as I also said about Action Bronson in my rare chandeliers mixtape review he sort of takes on that big heavy powerful Don persona that a guy like Rick Ross portrays the sex the money the power the luxury but action does it in a way that is just so much less self-serious way more funny clever after that he dropped a little ap with Harry fraud which was a little all over the place but kind of showcased action on some newer more modern production and then we have this new party supplies project blue chips - and even though blue chips is not really my favorite bronson project it was one that I definitely remember because it had him over some pretty unique instrumentals which essentially had me looking forward to this thinking I would hear action on a lot of different beats that I don't usually catch rappers on and not only is Bronson on some interesting production on this thing but blue chips - feels like a concept LP in the same way that rare chandeliers was a concept album it's not really like Bronson is reinventing his persona or whatever it's kind of like he's taking the same recipe but putting it into a different setting but really all of these differences are just kind of window dressing because Bronson is the same guy on this album that he was on previous projects you're getting the same flows the same types of lyrics the same personality hits just a new installment of bars on a new assortment of beats to go to the instrumentals like I said some of the samples here kind of surprising a lot of synth pop and new wave and funk music on here that feels like it's from the 80s and then again there are some tracks that do feature some soul and Motown sampling just like on the original blue chips project but a lot of the time it sounds like party supplies is merely grabbing some loops that are pretty great but he doesn't really reinvent them or rehash them or I guess alter them in a significant way really just kind of clipping them and then ooh boo boo boo going through that cycle and going that route is a bit of a double-edged sword or maybe even a triple edged sword for one the production can get kind of redundant with just hearing the same groove over and over throughout the entirety of a track but on a positive side because the sample source material is so obvious with how party supplies treats it it can kind of grab your ears and just make you think oh hey I like this song but as a rapper you also kind of compete with then the heads of listeners and risk losing their attention or just not really grabbing them if your verse isn't tip-top and your enthusiasm isn't up there enough to kind of wreck the attention away from what the sample is and toward what you're saying and this is a challenge that action is up to most of the time like on the track Amadou Diablo which has the very iconic plucked guitar on the beginning of the Tracy Chapman track give me one reason give me one reason to stay here and even though the sample is a little distracting with how untreated it is action does drop some funny attention-grabbing bars I note it in like three strokes now that's no way to rep the East Coast it's not technical but it's funny and even though there's not a strong song concept here action does have bars but another downside to this track is that it's really just a minute forty three long kind of on the short side which is actually not a rarity on this LP there are quite a few songs on here that are sort of on the short side it's more like him and party supplies are kind of shooting for a vibe or a feel to a song and then merely sort of cut out on it maybe just a few minutes in like on the track Pepe Lopez which has a pretty generous sample of the song dick ela it dip it dip it dip it or the song it's me which has this really kind of cheery bright Island instrumentation it kind of sounds like the instrumental to a coconut drink commercial and the track contemporary man is kind of a unique song in that it feels like a bunch of little baby songs in one giant song with just one 80s loop hitting you after the next one I believe is actually Huey Lewis and the news might be wrong but one I know is John Mellencamp and two others I'm pretty sure are Phil Collins Susan so do these tracks particularly are not terrible but the samples are really what sort of end up standing out to me at the end of the day not actions bars or even what the song is about or what the chorus is if there even is a chorus in short there are just so many tracks on here that I feel like are filler and there are some longer tracks on here to that start off pretty well maybe you have a great beat to them but then later around the middle point of the track action Bronson's alter-ego big body best comes in and just performs this really long interruptive monologue while there are spots on this LP that are hilarious it sounds like Action Bronson is having fun making this project it really hasn't added up to a whole lot of memorable focused tracks that have an incredible amount of impact to them the few tracks on here that I think are fantastic not just likeable or sort of breezy our Rolling Thunder for one fantastic soul sample on this track and I love the way party supplies put some really punchy drums in the background adds a nice groove I just love this instrumental to its core it's simple but it's great in a way kind of reminds me of the UGK track international players anthem in a good way a rap song with a really classy edge and the song through the eyes of a G has a great instrumental really sweet organ loop and a murky murky bassline it's a spacious instrumental like this that I think showcases action bronson really well and makes me want to really to in and listen to everything he has to say I love the lines on here about the ginger shot that he's taking and doing concentration curls with a cinderblock just all of these lines again add up to that character portrait that he does of this big Don type character that he plays and a lot of his songs not only that but with ABS soul on the back end of this track this song really is the best feature track this mixtape has to offer which is unfortunate because on here we also have Mac Miller and Mae helm a wren landing on this thing overall blue chips - it sounds fine but it's just way too breezy hmm and that's because most of the very short tracks on here while likeable feel so effortless for Action Bronson in comparison with his better stuff so while blue chips was okay not really horrible it definitely fell short of being exciting I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition but if you've given the listen to blue chips what did you think of it did you love it hate it oh why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana action bronson party supplies blue chips to forever 
XjSjgPvaqgw,haha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new de Bochy's album big machines and peculiar beings these guys are a rock trio from Louisville Kentucky this is their debut full-length 12 tracks 37 minutes and these guys have a pretty peculiar sound lots of oddball jagged rhythm guitars that are upstroke throughout many tracks here punchy raw basic simple drums and some really clunky bass lines on top of all of a guitar player Sydney chadwick's voice which is really difficult for me to put my finger on there are moments where it feels a little sloppy sort of amateurish and then there are spots on here where it feels like especially on the last track where she has some real vocal power and no doubt she does have range on this LP with some moments where it feels like she's singing in this higher register where she is very vulnerable very sweet on the years and then again there are tracks here where she is just belting out in these bellowing lows and even though some of the performances on this record maybe feel a little too sloppy there are some tracks here like I've got energy which feel way too noisy and left of center to be played by a group of people who have no clue what they're doing either this group is directly influenced by groups like the slits and the raincoats and young marble giants or they've been possessed by some kind of post-punk poltergeist everyone knows post-punk poltergeists 8 jazz fusion where are we even though there are some older post punk acts that I feel have a lot in common sonically with the de Bochy's it's not like they are revivalists of this genre or anything like that they actually showcase a pretty big influence from a band by the name of this strokes you might have heard of them especially on a track like sometimes I think we're the very jagged drums and guitars that are played throughout not just this track but many tracks on this album are suddenly switched out for these very smooth guitar arpeggios and Sidney's voice sort of turns into this very beautiful Kroon that is very Julian Casablancas esque but this strokes like sound is a serious rarity on this LP a lot of the songs on this album are not very catchy slick pop rock songs but instead very herky-jerky underground rock misfits with very crunchy brittle guitars and this sound goes over well most of the time especially when the debauch ease are playing a track that is incredibly energetic intense like on the opening track the title track to this LP where we have all these very low subtle deadpan just very dismal verses that are mixed together with these explosive courses that are backed up with upstroke guitars very tight female vocal harmonies the song really turns from night today in a really just Oh sort of frenzy then there is the track I've got energy more very nice female vocal harmonies yeah but do but and again these shots these blasts of brittle noisy guitars the guitar tone on this record is just so freaking sharp it's like chewing on broken glass and this very chaotic insanity is backed up with drums that are sort of following this one to battle battle bots pattern which is something that like the upstroke guitars is featured on a lot of songs hear the song mathematics though really changes up the roof of this album with some very heavy riffs heavy for them at least and some pretty futile lyrics talking about well you know why should you even bother why should you even try what's the point and it's delivered with just this really relentlessly downtrodden rhythm but it did it did it did almost every melody and rhythmic pattern on this LP gives me the serious sense of unease that makes me feel like if I was forced to listen to this album in a continuous loop I would slowly go insane I guess I sort of mean that as a compliment I also like the wailing guitar solos on this track and as far as another intense song on here that sort of hits me in a good way definitely whatever go for to track here that has some serious rock and roll swagger to the riffs and to me with these guitars combined together with these vocals it really kind of feels like I'm listening to screaming females too but weirder the really rough performances and instrumentation on this record they lead to this kind of chaos that makes the more energetic tracks on this LP sound really great sound really fun but i guess the slower spots on here the spots that really require a bit more finesse is where the band fumbles the ball a little bit i guess on the slower moments here i was looking for a little bit more seduction i'm not even sure if this band is capable of such a thing and maybe they're not and maybe they're conscious of that there is the track rancid dancin on this thing which is essentially a song about being sort of insecure self-conscious which I mean you know if you feel that way it's fine but sometimes you just gotta let go you've got to dance like there's no one watching man think about this track though is that the dance groove that the band is playing sort of gets stale after a little while and the chorus on this thing it's it's nearly non-existent I get that the band has sort of an unorthodox way of playing their instruments and writing their songs but they're just some tracks here the sort of lose steam because of the very same flaws that make the span seem so unique and kind of attractive plus there are some tracks here where the lyrics don't grab me all that much and because of these things I feel like the de Bochy's the best tracks that this album has to offer are the ones that are the most hard-hitting and have the most sudden changes to kind of keep the listener keep me engaged and sort of keep me out Wow cool crazy Oh stuff is happening these very multifaceted tracks like i just sit around or songs like the closer where we get kind of a very jazzy shot of drums and guitar out of nowhere are the ones that really keep this album entertaining while big machines is a very decent mixed bag of tracks i do think the de Bochy's could use a few more tricks up their sleeves when it comes to playing these songs out to kind of break things up between the very bottom bhadram's and the upstroke guitars even though coming out of the gate this band is not showcasing a whole ton of technical ability they are coming through with some really good tunes some great courses that are pretty memorable as well as just some straight-up character and if the de Bochy's are able to continue to showcase that character but sort of pump the playing up a little bit more and write songs that have things feeling maybe a little less stiff into the future I think they could be writing some fantastic records but as of right now feel no decent too strong 7 on this thing transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it epiny Fantino the de Bochy's forever 
K2uBdDrUIqU,hi everyone antthony Fantana here the internet's prettiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Eminem album The Marshall Mathers LP - oh I love mr. damn net since when Oh ever since he put out that album that one I know you're saying man that album was was pretty good Eminem slash Slim Shady slash Marshall Mathers is a Detroit rapper I personally grew up on the man's music through the Slim Shady LP Marshall Mathers LP as well as a lot of his very hot radio singles like loose yourself oh my god and maybe you know things for Eminem have been a little turbulent lately kicking an addiction going on a little hiatus and releasing a few lackluster LPS people are always consistently comparing his newer stuff to his older stuff we want the older stuff back we missed the old Eminem he's a different person now you know and so many of the people like me who grew up on his music I'm a full grown adult who kind of cringes that people calling other people faggots in a public forum hmm aren't I a little too old for this but then again I think of things like the aristocrat joke which I think are really funny as well as South Park and how people like George Carlin took crude humor and framed it in a really thought-provoking way it kind of makes me wonder if there's really anything on this album that I'm too mature for and no I guess there is not an Eminem definitely does approach crude humor with the tact of a flame thrower on this LP with plenty of lines about wiping his butt and firing a machine gun at his 99 problems which is one girl get it the bitch ain't one she's the 99 of them he still got a pretty big pension four grand and yes and I really did grab my nuts there however despite the fact that Eminem is a total prick who refuses to grow up I still find him pretty interesting as a musical personality especially on this album he is self-hating yet braggadocious and self-aware of both of those sides the dude is also a total badass with a knack for versus that just make you wince and cringe not only because of how offensive and foul they are but because of how really they attack the sensibilities of what makes a traditionally good line and hip-hop throwing out these unapologetically corny bars like this is your jam unless you've got toe jam Eminem is also a dude whose songs can be really sensitive and personal motivational inspirational and he's a pretty decent cultural satirist as well plus I think Eminem is the only hip-hop artist right now who topped charts in the 2000s in a big way and still is really really about his music as far as other people like the diplomats and DMX and jay-z and 50 cent Kanye West and Nelly it's really no competition a lot of these artists are just either not making music anymore or not making music that anybody cares about or have just continued to put out albums that are kind of lazy Eminem is still really technically proficient showcasing tons of personality flows different Cadence's at the drop of a hat will totally break into this entirely different vocal impersonation it just sounds like he's incredibly invested in where his sound and story go next and that's really what a lot of us have been anticipating ever since the announcement of this new full-length album of his merely because of the title The Marshall Mathers LP 2 which is an album that yeah for sure maybe some of the jokes and maybe some of the beats sound dated by today's standards but following this album up Eminem's most critically acclaimed album it's still a tall order but in a way I think Eminem kind of meets that challenge Marshall Mathers LP 2 is one of the more ambitious releases he's put out in a while he has plenty of tracks and lines on here that are direct references back to his earlier stuff if not just sequels and he's got plenty of songs on here that are just personal epic hilarious this LP kicks off with the song bad guy it's a seven-minute monster and here Eminem is kind of dealing with his problems in a way that we are familiar with sort of dumping them in the trunk of his car and this track is wrapped from the standpoint of the younger brother of Stan who was killed in the song Stan on the original Marshall Mathers LP but I think the reason is sort of falls short is that I don't really get a vivid sense of this character in the same way that I did with Stan on that original track for the most part I think Eminem sort of uses this as an opportunity to not critique how crazy some fans can get but sort of critique himself which i think is primarily the purpose of the last verse on this song where Eminem is sort of pointing out the fact that time has passed since he was at his peak he talks about the polyps on the back of his throat after his concerts sort of pointing to him being older being worn out aging also the double standards with what he puts out in his rhymes versus how he lives his life treats his daughters and how he came up rapping about how he hated bullies but sort of became one himself through his rhymes and that is the focus of a lot of songs on this album Eminem's past how it affects his present his remorse and his regret with a lot of the things that he's done up until this point there are moments where it feels like Eminem is seriously beating himself up on these tracks but there are also spots on here where it feels like he is so hungry and fighting for the last breath of relevance that he has in the world of hip-hop which I think he does pretty well on some of the tracks here like survival which is a song that has I've listened to it more and more sort of grown on me a track where I don't really care for the hook and I don't really care for the huge arena rock beat but I feel like Eminem bust some serious rhymes on this track and has a really relentless flow he sounds hungry he sounds fiery and as silly as some of the bars on here are like the line about how he is wiping his butt stabbing a knife in his gut he still sounds mad as hell delivering this stuff and kind of convincing - there are other tracks on here that I feel reference Eminem's current place in rap music like the song asshole but not every track that delves into Eminem's past in his place in current hip-hop music is that exciting like the song legacy which has an incredibly melodramatic cook with a really basic rhyme scheme legacy me see guarantee and lyrically this song is a bit of a tale of evolution in Eminem's younger years which I feel like he's able to give us a different picture of now being older but I feel like the story is framed in a way that we're already very very very maybe too familiar with people bullied me here I was misunderstood there and there are some kind of corny lines on this track that are just a little unforgiveable like one of the final verses on this thing where he essentially just gives a shout to five dog from A Tribe Called Quest I mean cool for him but sort of arbitrary and that one line about the Italian sausage and the Flying Saucer and I know being purposefully corny has always been a weapon of Eminem's but they're just some moments here where the jokes just aren't that funny and I also accept that hooks have never really been Eminem's strongest point as well like on the hilariously bitter so much better where Eminem says on the hook that he was laying in bed and this thought came into his head plus a pretty cringe-worthy first verse on this thing about smurfing yourself and then puking blue kool-aid with this female character sort of sleeping with other popular rappers cheating on Eminem making him but some of the hooks where Eminem is singing aren't too bad like on the song rhyme or reason which has one of the most interesting flows on this entire LP a track where Eminem sort of focuses on his hatred for his father and those abandonment issues a little bit and here Eminem has a very generous sample of the zombies song time of the season where he is singing the melody to the chorus on this thing with some multitrack vocals it's hardly bearable it works though it really takes a turn for the worse on the song stronger than I was a track that I guess as I'm reading into it is sort of written from the standpoint of his ex Kim but it's really a song where Eminem is singing for most of the track and I feel demands a level of singing talent that Eminem just doesn't have and it really becomes so bad every time this song pulls up I just skip it I give it a skip however there are spots on here where that more tender side of M&M totally works like on the song headlights a track that I'm surprised does on this LP was I feel emotionally mind-blowing a song about his mother and how after all these years of hating her and hating her and hating her maybe most bitterly on the Marshall Mathers LP he forgives her it's rare when you see Eminem being this consistently serious and because of that this track was a real tearjerker and the chorus at least in my opinion wasn't the worst in the world maybe one of the better courses on this LP with the singer from the van fund as far as other singles on this LP go like berserk and rap God songs that I had previously reviewed in another video berserk has grown on me a little bit because of how catchy it is with repeat listens but rap God I'm still sort of on the fence with it with not liking some of the rhymes especially the gay looking boy bars that all sort of come together at once as well as some of the battering women talk toward the end but still the flow on this track super impressive it's moments like this that I think real M&M fans and potential Eminem fans could really get excited over not another Rihanna chorus the ride that the Marshall Mathers LP 2 presents is a little bumpy some tracks that I really hate some tracks that I really love but it is at its most solid toward the last quarter I love the four tracks that this LP finishes off with the song so far which has a very generous Joe Walsh sample taking a different section of a single track of his and building a different part of this Eminem song with it a track that not only reflects on Eminem's southern roots a little bit but I think is a whole hilarious take on this new older self of his he's sort of dealing with fans harassing him he is dealing with fans making fun of the fact that he looks older he's trying to cope with new technology and the song love game 2 which I think has it's hilarious moments especially the part when he walks in on his girl and she's rapping and sucking at the same time and the verse that Kendrick Lamar has on this track too while the song I feel like on the surface is a little corny with a very generous sample of the game of love Kendrick really comes through the verse that matches Marshalls very cartoony energy and then the song evil twin which i think is a dark hard-hitting closer to this LP yeah man who was just really happy with how this album ended off overall because of how diverse a lot of these tracks are and just how much context this album relies on with its sitting so far in Eminem's career it's really difficult to sum the Marshall Mathers LP 2 up but let me say that even though Eminem is older and I feel like he can sort of look back upon his past career in his life with a bit more intelligence and and be a bit wiser when approaching a lot of these topics he's still not a guy who has matured he's acknowledged that and it's very plain to see that he's not interested in maturing at all I feel that growing out of Eminem's wares is is kind of understandable but I really do think he's writing some stuff here on this album that is early Eminem quality Eminem is definitely bringing that competitive side back that fans have been wanting to hear for a long time while a lot of the hooks are sort of sour and the beats for the most part are passable there are some interesting ones on here with some pretty obvious popular music samples but still they bring this album character they do bring diversity all that said I really am dig in the cell P I'm feeling a light decent 7 on this thing transition but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana Eminem's forever 
wXYj6ExDLaY,hey everybody Anthony feat Ana here Internet by Munna Minard and it's time for a review of the new black milk album no poison no paradise black milk the pseudonym for detroit-based MC and producer Curtis cross the dude has been producing albums collaborating with other artists for years he's pretty much a seasoned vet at this point he's worked with people like let's see J Dilla Black Thought lsi you know another slum village connection they're guilty Simpson and Shaun price on that random acts album as well as Pharoahe Monch he was an early supporter of Danny Brown as well not one of the biggest names out there but very well known in the underground well-known where he's from at least in the world of hip-hop and he has a strong affinity for boom-bap hip hop as well as jazz rap soul samples but he is a purveyor of bold experimentation - he's not afraid to put together a strange beat and off-kilter beat a dark beat especially on this album I mean look at that cover not exactly sunny days and birds tweeting now I was not crazy about this guy's last full-length LP album of the year what do you want me to say I just feel like on that album it was so apparent that black milk's lyrical abilities are not really up there with his production abilities and while yeah that's sort of a consistent thing throughout all of his LPS maybe the gap was wider there than it ever has been before but I no poison no paradise I think that gap is closing in a pretty big way I wouldn't say lyrically Black Milk is blowing me away but certainly what he doesn't have inflow or sort of really clever punchlines he makes up for in just how reflective personal relatable and a descriptive of his life his experiences this album is the instrumentals on this thing the beats the kicks thud the snares are dirty he loves to use a lot of sawtooth wave synthesizers I usually prefer a very smooth square-wave but they work in his favor a lot of the time make his beats really rough and they add to that grimy feel that he loves to deliver he's really great at bringing together some jazzy samples on this record some soulful samples on this record as well and I would say that even though no poison no paradise is a pretty grimy album I mean there's just filth on this LP urban decay uh still that does not stop it from being really melodic cinematic the track interpret sabotage which opens this album up it's a great track a killer opener a song that lyrically seems to be about Black Milk kind of aging in the rap game fighting to stay relevant fighting to stay interesting continue giving fans that next evolution that new and he talks about this in a really speedy and passionate flow and it brings the song some serious urgency and the instrumental here has a very simple drum beat but it is lifted with some very nicely placed synthesizer strings and some very catchy melodic leads as well usually a much bigger on sample based hip-hop you know I just love the way that samples get twisted and looped and so on and so forth but I really am drawn toward a lot of the synth based stuff that Black Milk does on this LP like the song ghetto DMF which is obviously a reference to the Detroit electronic music festival and that electronic feel is sort of reflected in the beat with the heavy use of synthesizers and the skittering hi-hats the synthesizer sort of have a phaser quality to them really the track with reference to this festival is more of a very gritty and dark portrait of the city that he comes from and quali Criss drops in on the back end with a lyrical feature with a with a very Randy verse I love the instrumental to the song dismal as well another dark track and synth heavy track it's got a bit of an eerie Halloween vibe to it but still very gritty and lyrically it's a song where Black Milk kind of reflects on a loss a shrinkage in his fame in his success and how that's a bit of psychological torture to him I also love the roughs in leads and the bubbling arpeggios on attract parallels it's a nice backdrop to black milk's lyrics which are kind of romantic seductive about attraction to this woman and sort of a very intimate moment that they're having and I like the song moneybags too which is also very synth heavy and funky because of it the leads on this thing are bright they're kind of noisy the production is solid the issue is that the tracks that are less lyrically driven maybe the beats are not wowing enough or progressed enough or detailed enough to be interesting from beginning to end like the track Sonny jr. which is a song that has Robert Glasper appearing musically very nice jazz hip hop fusion and a good groove just not a track that to me is fiery and interesting from beginning to end and then there's the song X chords which is one of the more playful tracks on this LP where the synthesizers are kind of cartoony but I don't find every melodic element in this track to be all that interesting to me the song ends up more of a mess than anything and maybe that was kind of intentional because of how tongue-in-cheek the song feels but maybe there is sort of an issue with song structure occasionally on this album because it does hinder some of the lyrically driven songs on here like codes and cab fares with black thought and because of how subdued and underwhelming the instrumental and sort of the pacing of the song is even though I do like how dark and moody the song is and I do like the lyrics on this track too when Black Thought finally appears it seems like such an anti climactic moment and there are moments on here too where the overall rough and somewhat lo-fi sound of this album does kind of hold it back a bit especially when it comes to Black Milk EQ ngahiwi tongue a track that features a lot of pianos organs some tight drum fills and this very soulful instrumental serves as a nostalgic backdrop for Black Milk to kind of spit and wax poetic about older times when he would hang out with his friend the real sort of subject of this track is sort of how Black Milk is having a hard time getting along with this person's mother and how she sees him is you get out of here it's a pretty funny trip down memory lane but there are some moments here where it feels like Black Milk is a little underwhelming poetically about how he takes the blame because everyone expects him to be insane or the closing track on here where he says that because he's not able to pay his bills he feels like he's falling there's also a line on this track as well where it's like if you don't make dollars then you don't make sense some of the Rhymes and wordplay on this album are basic but maybe not as laughably so as it was on album of the year and I do feel like again this is sort of made up for by the very true to life and from the harsh storytelling that Black Milk is delivering like on the song Sunday's best and Monday's worst which the Sunday's best track has a sample that feels gospel inspired and it's a song about being a kid and getting up on Sunday going to church the family the deacon you're pretending to be sick you'd rather be playing video games it's all there later in the track referencing how as an adult he sort of chose the wrong path made some bad moves and that's essentially where the track Monday's worst comes in where we find Black Milk sort of plotting on doing some dirt robbing this guy who's drunk outside of a club taking his chain and I love the soulful hook on this track to sing about how it's never too late to get your values straight and it's cool to see this connection between these two tracks and there are other connections between two tracks on here as well other pairs of tracks songs like parallels as well as X chords because X chord sort of seems to be the sexy moment that follows the seduction of parallels and then there is Sonny jr. which is kind of like this jazzy dream sequence before Sunday's best then there's also perfected on Putnam Ave which is kind of this dreamy positive light-hearted trip backwards into nostalgia land like many other tracks on here are but right after that is the song dismal which is more about the current adult state of affairs where Black Milk is sort of not seeing that much hope in his career right now there are some well-formed dichotomies on this LP between the past and the present the good and the bad making positive and negative choices in your life being a success being a failure but still despite all of that hoping for the best at the end of all of it I love this out I think it's very good I think it's well put together I think I have a few issues with it maybe it's a little too low-key I wish it was just more I guess in your face with how great it is is is plus there are some points where the mixing is just okay in the vocally cueing like I said and the clothes are on here the money bags track while I do feel like much of what Black Milk suffering sort of comes down to is lack of money and maybe that's why this track ends the album off musically sonically it still feels like a somewhat anti climactic closure and not really the most poignant finish to you know an album that seems as personal and as reflective as this there are some spots where I feel like this album could be just tighter more cohesive maybe flow a little bit better in a storyline sort of way but still I I feel like even in this disjointed State no poison no paradise is still an incredibly telling and uh relatable album I'm feeling a light a decent eight on this thing transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Black Milk forever 
tCGtdhEqO8A,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and this is a review of the new four tet album beautiful rewind for tet is the pseudonym of electronic music producer kiran Hebden this is his seventh full-length LP if you're counting the compilation of singles that he dropped last year pink and musically this guy has had an incredibly interesting evolution look at his discography he has tripped through numerous electronic music genres and some not so electronic bringing together elements of house music and IDM with jazz he's also dabbled in glitch full chronica his compositions have also had a bit of hip-hop influences well but his most recent album sound a lot like their coming from the micro house minimal techno oh tech house side of things getting the bounce of those 4 or 4 beats but with tracks that aren't exactly poppy and really hard-hitting more introspective more odd subtle experimental especially on pink which even though that album was a series of different singles still a release that was pretty cohesive in that you had a series of songs that were very stripped back for four tet definitely a change in pace from the very lovely and lush there is lovin you one of my favorite four tet albums and beautiful rewind is essentially a continuation of that evolution that four tet has been on since like you know forever and i like it it's a very short sweet and textured tech house album straightforward grooves rough samples very rich synthesizers some hypnotic rhythms with a few different musical detours here and there across the 11 tracks here like there is one song that is a two-step foray into future garage there are some hints here and there to ambien music and then there is the song unicorn which is this synth arpeggiated track where it feels like you're getting this one synthesizer sample looped over and over and over different pitches and speeds one sample being dropped on top of another for about three minutes and then it kind of coasts downward and fades out it's got a bit of a whoa no tricks point never vibe to it honestly but without all of the nostalgic chic a lot like OPN on this record for tet seems to favor outright experimentation adventure i guess he's at a point right now in his career where it feels like doing something sort of left field at least for him again is more interesting than doing what's comfortable I feel like for Ted is on his way to kind of carving out his own little niche in this sound that he's shooting for like the song dong the opener to this LP it has a lot of very speedy break beats hammering away in the background it's a track that is sonically a little money and maybe intentionally so but I feel like it takes away so much punch from the song because of it still the song is layered with some really odd interesting tones what feels like a sound Bowl or a really nice bell is ringing out in a very long hung gated way just calling out against these beats again it's a sharp groove a very busy song and really there is so much sound here that it's like kind of crackling in the mix a bit varying cacophonous and the progressions are really buried in all of this cacophony I do dig it it's not epic like I do enjoy my four tet songs to be you know that very slow awesome engaging from beginning to end rising action but still the songs that he ends up delivering are of some quality at least like the songs cool FM and bullsh tracks that have incredibly hard-hitting grooves that are very dirty some odd vocal samples to set against these pretty noisy beats cool FM has the sort of surprise start/stop quality to it while bullsháá has this very dark droning bassline very moody song it's sort of glitchy as well and I think one of the most emotionally intense tracks that for Ted has put out since there is love and you then there's the song aerial which features quite a bit of hand drums in the track very lively song it feels like a freaking from circle it's colorful its energetic there are all these weird muffled vocal samples playing against this noisy beat sort of like listening to a crazy radio DJ try to announce over this song and the song your body feels with these very gentle vocal samples playing throughout it is a very serene track I think one of the more tender tracks on this LP at least one of the tender tracks on this LP that is fun to listen to you from beginning to end because there are quite a few underwhelming moments on here that don't go quite as hard and I feel like are kind of lacking because of it like the track our navigation which is that song I alluded to earlier that goes into a future garage direction with a two-step beat but even though for Tet I feel like is trying to make his mark doing a different take on each of these electronic music styles that he jumps onto with this record this is maybe one of the least bold of the eleven tracks here then there is the song crush which is sort of an experimental footnote of sorts and comparison with all the other songs on here while it is very off kilter not very memorable and then there is ba teaches yoga which is this very fast twittering rhythmatic piece with so much sound and very light breezy sound all coinciding at once to the point where the song really feels like an ethereal drone of sorts it borders on ambient a bit with how it hangs in the background it sort of loses my attention so quickly structurally it's not really a highlight for me and that is maybe my biggest issue with this album I feel like for Ted delivers a lot of great grooves on here but how he orders them in terms of a song structure it just doesn't make much for an impact here it's really how good the grooves are and just how great the beats are and how good some of the funky synth lines are that keep this album engaging I'm just not seeing that level of ambition to sort of take these songs to the next level pull them out of these somewhat low fight doldrums and really give them some body and some size and some girth I'm feeling a decent of strong seven on this LP an addition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it for Tet beautiful rewind forever 
tSkKa5OQWfM,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the album blood tears by sisu give less fuel but I hate counter cheste Sisu is a California rock band fronted by a singer/songwriter Sandra vu who plays drums in the dum dum girls which I actually didn't know at the time when I listened to this album I had seen the band live knew she was familiar from somewhere and aha that's it and dum dum girls if you didn't know have this sort of loaf I aesthetic their sound is very poppy dreamy a little beach friendly somewhat shoegaze e they're not a band that I'm particularly crazy about but I am enjoying this project quite a bit and sand review does move into a different stylistic realm with this album with this record chasing after sounds from synthesizer pop a bit of post-punk the darker side the gothy ER side of that genre a bit of dream pop thrown into the mix to the sound here overall is chilly it's moody and it just has a dash of despair I can't say the sound on this record is entirely original though Sandra tends to wear her influences on her black lacy sleeve but for the most part on this album I do think she comes off as a sharp songwriter whose hooks and verses don't at all feel hindered by the purposefully dreamy and Atmospheric aesthetic that she and her band shoots for the opening track counting stars on this LP is pretty sweet very understated versus with vuze singing in a very eerie voice on this track not exactly straightforward but kind of sharp kinda weird I wouldn't exactly say it's on the back burner either a very slow spacious groove but then the song blossoms really sweetly and melodically once the chorus pops in and it's like an entirely different song i like these night and day differences between the verses and the courses that sisu sometimes brings to the table the same thing happens on the track cut me off which is a more fast-paced song with a very melodic verse but as soon as the chorus comes in it's just really a kick drum backing vows voice as she's saying it could have been easy it could have been easy could have been easy basically a song about a relationship that has gone awry but you're not really getting that info from the other person in the relationship and they're not really saying hey you know what not that interested anymore sorry in this track despite the fact that it is so atmospheric like other songs on here it's really again driving fast a lot like another track on here maybe my favorite may be the front-runner as my favorite on this album return the favor another post relationship track about kind of keeping up appearances if I see you you see me we say hi we another post-punk feel I think fans of Siouxsie Sioux would definitely appreciate a song like this and killer melody on the hook too we vow and herb and add more variety to the mix with these song harpoons which seems to be a bit of a tribute to shoegaze with this course that seems to have way more ethereal layers than any other song on this entire album the only issue for me though is that structure wise it's not that fantastic of a track in that the song seems to be mostly that chorus there's even a moment where I think we only get one measure of verse and then we instantly pop right back into the chorus with really no alteration to how it sounded all of the times previously that we heard it completely neglecting the verses is sort of a thing that happens occasionally on this LP like on the song sharp teeth as well and there are some songs on here like electronic where it feels like the verses are so odd so off-kilter and so separated from the chorus I have a hard time being engaged with the entire track even if I do like the very milky somewhat Twin Shadow esque bass lines on this song still more variety and good tracks do come down the pipe like on the song sinking feeling where it does feel pretty clear that there is a dum dum girls connection with this record with the very twangy guitars but this song does feel darkened to an extent and doesn't feel like it sort of slips out of the overall aesthetic of the album then their shotgun running which is purely a vocally lead dream pop track that is pretty sweet on the ears and then there's the song let go one of the slower tracks on this LP one of the earlier and more wintry tracks on this LP a song that also feels inspired by a relationship where you can't get away this track like others on here that do feel like they have some kind of romantic route in them the lyrics at times can be sort of basic in terms of description and it makes it difficult really separating these songs and getting a different emotional vibe from each of them still I do like the tune of the track a lot in the very ghostly vocal harmonies on the song sort of scratch a special itch in my eardrums I guess overall as an album it sort of feels like a mixed bag of tracks that sort of all follow a similarly dark blue print and there are quite a few tracks on here that while not terrible are sort of underwhelming and just pale in comparison to others I think blood tears is decent but there are enough highlights and interesting moments on here and especially catchy choruses that make me feel like there could be more interesting stuff coming from this project into the future I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh sisu blood tears forever 
GglCYueKKIQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's november Halloween's over birthday's over October's over and let's quickly talk about some of my favourite releases from this past month you can find links to reviews and songs from all of these albums in the description box let's go darkside psychic whoo nice collaborative album from Nicolas jar and David Harrington Nicolas bringing together as his very dark strange approach to house music with Dave's very nice guitar leads and they mix elements of micro house with rock and psychedelic rock into a pretty interesting fusion with some very nice songs and yeah highly recommended next the new of Montreal album lousy with sylveon briar if you're into of Montreal check this album out if you're into old world old-school psychedelic rock folk rock a little bit of Americana check this album out as well I think it's the best this band has dropped in a while and they have had a pretty long spanning career in indie rock next the new melt banana album fetch whoo what a crazy noisy punk rock cyber future major awesome album short but good this is did any of that make sense well it was a dizzying jumble because that's kind of what this album is it's just grabbing my brain shaking it violently putting it back inside the skull over here and I am a better man for it next an album that is on the opposite end of the spectrum when it comes to aggression a very gentle album the new Tim Hecker album virgins if you're looking for some drone music some ambient music a little bit of neoclassical here some minimalism I wouldn't say it's directly those two things but it's definitely inspired by those two things with some very beautiful tones and sounds that deliver some very somber depressing somewhat apocalyptic melodies then listen to this thing it's when i favorite albums of this year not just to this month but like like top 10 quality stuff next the new Armand Hammer album race music Billy woods New York DC MC teams up with a lucid for a collaborative album of grimy hard-hitting hip hop songs with some really crazy ass instrumentals that are heavy slow lumbering and chaotic cacophonous and lyrics that are well very conceptual very detailed very well written and put together but still puzzling and cryptic and esoteric good album something you're gonna have to play over and over and over in order to really get a full whiff of what's going on but in album who's enjoyability is more on the surface but not the weaker for it the new cage the elephant album melophobia an LP that a lot of people have sort of questioned my enjoyment of because I didn't like their earlier stuff which I said in my review but a lot of people are like yeah this is just plain old rock music what's so good about it huh I just think the hooks are so goddamn sticky on this album while yeah again some very obvious comparisons can be made with this band of other bands and their influences are pretty much out there and in the open too but I think that the lo-fi yet epic and ambitious instrumentation on this record combined with the very catchy melodies and energetic and over-the-top and zany vocals for Matt Schulze all of this has come together and made for a really enjoyable garage all some what blues rock record for me that is something I like to return to every once in a while like oh this is catchy this is sweet I'll put this on I'm that kind of guy sometimes come on I'm not always this Oh disdain it enough not always that kind of guy and that's it those are my favorite releases from this past month looking forward to reviewing a bunch of records for you this month November and thanks for watching what were some of your favorite releases from this past month let me know Anthony fan tanto albums forever

I0G9Uw0QVYM,hi everyone Anthony Pham tan Oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Arcade Fire album reflector Grammy award-winning famed Montreal rock band considered by many to be indie rock kingpins known for their lavish instrumentation epic and femme ik songwriting and very emotive vocals from front couple wind Butler and régine Chassagne since the mid-2000s the band put out three full-length studio albums that I and many other people consider to be great for years the band has been celebrated as this group that just pushes things further reaches higher just has this massive amount of ambition and I was pretty excited to see that playing out into this next record of theirs reflector in LP that looked fantastic before its release that looked fantastic on paper we're talking about a pretty interesting cover here a double album James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem and DFA records Fame taking the reins on production for a lot of these tracks and on the lead single the title track to this album that was released months in advance of this LP fantastic song a track that embraced the tenets of disco and is one of my favorite tracks of this year this single and all the other elements that I just mentioned added up into me being super excited for this album and overall I gotta say Arcade Fire does go in some kind of direction with this thing I do feel like this is a more groove oriented record for Arcade Fire I think this is a slightly popular record for Arcade Fire those still very epic and long-winded I do think there are some really strong lyrical themes running throughout this thing maybe a little bit more obvious than what was happening on the suburbs but despite all of that I feel like this record still fell short of my expectations I want to start off with the lyrics on this thing because I think they are my favorite piece of the recipe that Arcade Fire tries to pull together you have a myriad of different song subjects and just one liners on here that deal with troubled love heaven hints toward Greek mythology with Orpheus and and you're a dice with songs that essentially talk about seduction attraction and a lot like on the suburbs there are a number of tracks on here that sort of deal with being an outsider being on the fringe I feel like the first song to kind of hit with that message is we exist a track that lyrically to me feels like the band is singing about being this smaller group against this greater power sort of having the face or having to live in the world of a majority that may be morally or ideologically they don't really agree with and this majority is trying to ignore them and count them out similar themes sort of run through tracks like Joan of Arc and normal person and then there's flashbulb eyes another track on here a lot like reflector deals with this current vanity age or fame with wind making reference to the old wives tale that when you get your picture taken it steals your soul and then there's porno where you seem to have this male narrator singing to a female in a way kind of apologizing or just being upset about these two living in a world where they just don't see eye to eye with the sexual standards or what constitutes sexy lyrically I feel like reflector has a lot to offer on the surface and on a more subtle level to maybe there are a few hooks like on songs such as you already know an afterlife where the lyrics are a little redundant or overly simplistic like you are right you know or scream and shout till we work it out but that's it it's musically where I feel like this album sort of fails to entertain instead of embarking on another group of immaculately layered songs Arcade Fire instead delivers a musical jumble a stylistic hodgepodge of different genres across the length of reflector without much attention or care toward whether or not all of these sounds are flowing together well as a record and a lot of the time I don't even really feel like they're putting that much care into whether or not they're doing some of these genres justice I've already said I like the song Elector which obviously goes into a bit of a disco direction and then there is we exist which feels kind of New Wave influenced and that's a song that I like too it's got a very mid-paced easygoing dance music beat a warm synth bassline some shimmering guitars it feels like a very moody nocturnal take on the instrumental to Madonna's like a virgin but the tune of the song is great and a lot like reflektor Arcade Fire manages to take this epic anthemic feel of their music draw it out against a very hypnotic groove and just progress the song with different layers of instrumentation keep things engaging and keep things entertaining in the process then there is normal person where it feels like Arcade Fire is is trying to play with the idea of this being a bit of a live recording or something thanking people for coming out and opening the singing line of the track asking them if they like rock and roll music and while this track does sound rock and roll instrumentally there's kind of an awkwardness to how the instrumentation links up and it feels like there's a bit of a tongue-in-cheek vibe to the way the music is being played of course the song lyrically sort of takes shots at society and bringing that together with a weird portrayal of a popular music genre I can't really think of anything that is more Talking Heads also the big distorted chorus and the wailing lead guitars as well as the the faint distorted and kind of buried horns in the background of this thing it's a great track it's very well put together even if it is kind of fuzzy and just really over modulated which I'm sure was intentional there's also the very heavy dramatic and driving song it's never over hey Orpheus another favorite of mine on here hey oh yes the groove on this thing is hypnotic it just captures me and I'm like yes I am so happy James Murphy is doing production on this because this is one of the moments where his influence is is most apparent this song and the next track on here porno which is a bit of a subdued track with a bit of electronic drums in the background some synthesizers playing a very big role yes there is a bit of a new wave post-punk minimal synth influence here but it's very stripped back sort of reminds me of moments from the LCD Soundsystem's last full-length LP tracks like I can or somebody's calling me and while I think the production is decent I'm more enamored with the message of the song and the tune of it more than anything sadly that's about it for highlights for me I only liked about half of the songs on this album and many of the other tracks here I just find to be half-hearted imitations of different genres that Arcade Fire just wanted to pursue on this LP for no other reason than to do them like the song flashbulb eyes I just don't find anything entertaining or good about hearing wind butler moan over this sort of straight back dancehall beat that is kind of underwhelming there are some echo effects over his voice and a lot of the instrumentation here and it's really turned up too much to the point where the song doesn't really read it feels like a dub reggae nightmare and then there's the song here comes the night where it feels like the vocals are really too distorted as well as the bass and they're presented so upfront and in-your-face in a way where it's kind of claustrophobic something that I feel like works for an LCD soundsystem song but doesn't do this tune too much justice I do like the song here the melody the piano playing is pretty quaint but again I feel like we're delivered and instrumental here that is just not really a flattering portrayal of a Caribbean style of music not only that but I feel like Arcade Fire continues this faux live feel on this track and it results in some of the instrumentation feeling way less explosive than it should be like the outro where they really kind of kick up the tempo all the instrumentation is going incredibly fast you have these guitar strumming very quickly and the song here only ends up feeling like sort of a dull drone rather than an exciting explosion of feeling and instrumentation you have the song you already know with this quirky playful silly rock bass line and this drumbeat that kind of feels like it could back a song from the grease soundtrack groove wise the song just feels really stiff and kind of corny the only thing the song is missing is a group of backup singers going wow wow then there's the track Joan of Arc which starts off with this distorted fast punk rock intro but then kicks into this slowed down tempo that delivers a guitar riff and a B that feels like a slow-motion version of a sweet song it's got a hard rock glam rock vibe to it but none of the joy fun or viscera the track just feels like bad emulation with very very little attention to musical detail and not only that but as the song progresses a growing problem is that it doesn't stay interesting as the band starts to draw this slow rock beat out longer than it really should be awful sound sort of an underwhelming ballad which has some distance strings that kick in and really sort of brings home the title of the song but then the second half of this track instead of being underwhelming is sort of a slightly insipid explosive feel-good folk rock opera that just does not vibe with me all too well then there is supersymmetry the closer on here which I don't even know what hour Kade fire was going for on this track an incredibly anti-climactic closer with some sequence drums some synthesizers and I feel like the rush of instrumentation and the experimental last six or five minutes of this track are more interesting than the tune itself because winds and Regine's vocals are so buried and so comatose that the song isn't even really entertaining so in short I did not dig this album as much as Arcade Fire's previous LPS was it what they said no the lyrics on this thing are solid was it the tunes necessarily only a few of the melodies and the tunes and the songs on here I felt were unlikable the problem is Arcade Fire wanted to make this overblown double disc album and ended up neglecting flow in a huge way cohesion musical cohesion between the songs and for Arcade Fire the sound of these songs was incredibly unimpressive - even with James Murphy being credited as a producer on this album historically the let's try to sound like this song and let's try to sound like this band and let's try to do that hook that formula works really well for James Murphy but it did not work out for Arcade Fire on this album there are two new wave songs on here and a few tropical songs on here and if you disco oriented songs on here a bit of rock and roll a bit of Afrobeat and they only end up doing some of it justice I'm feeling a strong five on this thing transition but if you've given the cell peal listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Arcade Fire reflector forever 
XHFtvJ7cPHc,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd going to do a quick simple straightforward review of the new glasser album interiors glasser is the musical project of producer singer songwriter Cameron my sorrow this is her second full-length album her full-length debut ring kind of a short LP but still one of my favorites of that year brought together elements of electronic production and MIDI and her really beautiful soaring vocals and the the style of just music underneath her vocals was really synthetic but also very primal very i want to say basic or simple but there was kind of this rudimentary old-world feel to the grooves and just the pacing and the and the growth in the progression of the tracks that was kind of seductive beautiful hypnotizing and something that just fell archaic in kind of away now this LP did earn Cameron some Bjork comparisons all around from numerous music fans and critics as well and while there was a really obvious influence they're coming from the world of bjork it didn't really get me down because i thought the songs were so catchy the melodies were so good and i thought this very rootsy primal feel to some of the beats and the progressions of the songs had glasser kind of in its own little camp you know like oh this is obviously an influence but this is her style this is something that she approaches songs with this is something that if I heard it in one of her songs I'd be like oh well this is definitely a glass or song so I wasn't really down with the whole like make up your comparison but sort of in a negative light kind of thing because I was appreciating what glasser was doing as a project on its own and I wasn't even hoping I was just assuming it was a sure thing that on glasses next full-length LP not only would her influences diversify a little bit in her music at least because I know she's an artist like Laurie Anderson who I also have a great love for her work but I just expect did this sophomore full-length LP to be a bit more original and honestly I can't even say that it is as original as glass errs debut in fact I feel like there is an increased production value on this album which is good and I think the compositions and the atmosphere are a little more vast but I feel like glass or has taken all of this extra all of this new effort and merely put it toward I don't even want to say it this album just sounds like a Bjork imitation it's it just hurts to say because I was like ah you know I don't think she sounds that much like Bjork to the point where I would cringe or think okay this should all right but honestly everything from the fluttering somewhat glitchy instrumentation in the background to the melodic phrasing and the vocals there are so many songs on this album that don't even sound like a myriad of different places in Bjork's ever-growing career a lot of these songs just sound like they could have been on vespertine which is my favorite Bjork album but even though it does feel like there is a clear influence from that album this LP is way less textured than vespertine and and way less layered instrumentally in way less epic as well and honestly there's not too much about this LP that I can say there are a few songs on here that remind me of a few of the songs on ring and I don't mind that I think that's fine I guess I was just perplexed listening to this album as to what I kind of see as a huge step backwards rather than forwards into a more interesting or just a more distinct sound because with the last full-length I think glasser had a pretty good thing going with this combination of primal beats and futuristic synthetic tones and her voice on top of it it was something that I feel like had potential and it seems like she in a sense has sort of scrapped that and while I don't normally get automatically disappointed by some artists showcasing and influence from another artist this is just one of those cases where the influence is so deafening I don't hear anything else but if you've given this glass or album will listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana glasser forever 
_hN0W9NWbq4,my needle drops and Joel how're you doing haven't really talked to you in a while haven't responded to you in a while and I figure recent events make it sort of necessary to make video say something about what's just happened this past weekend but first I wanted to address a few things in the video that you previously made in response to my church's video talking about some of these sexually explicit messages some of the harassment that sort of been thrown the band's way via social media by fans there is still a double standard right now in terms of how male fans can interact with female musicians and it sort of seems like everybody shrug their shoulders and thinks that well that's just the way things are that's just how men are people who are famous are supposed to sort of accept people crapping on them in the public eye over social media because people who are famous have been harassed for decades upon decades upon decades and to directly answer your question about why I think some stories like this aren't really widespread in the press it's it's just because those standards are there and because people aren't getting offended by this suffer they don't really perceive it to be entirely wrong or they think that it's something that in time isn't really going to resolve itself and you know that may be the case for right now but into the future I hope that us discussing issues like this makes people think twice about I don't know sending somebody who is in the public eye oh really stupid heartless message for no other reason than to get a quick misogynistic thrill moving on to something that needs to be discussed of the passing of rock legend Lou Reed a lot of people have been sending me tweets messages emails asking me if I'm going to talk about this sort of telling me their perception of the whole thing how upset a lot of people are and personally I'm not really the type of person who gets worked up over the passing of someone who I didn't know personally obviously sympathy is there but in a way Lou Reed will always be alive to me to some extent because I love the guy's music I love a lot of the guys records and I'll always have that to listen to and the pack that that music is had in my life is always going to be there that's never going to change the fact that he is now gone that's not erased and all I can really say about Lou and his legacy and his discography is just how it's all impacted me personally some people you know that they get their minds blown when they figure out that they like hip-hop or they like punk are they like jazz or like classical or they're like whatever genre and it seems like there's this whole new world open for them that's what getting into the first four studio albums from The Velvet Underground was like for me to me the Velvet Underground represented this new league of edginess in rock and roll even though during their time they weren't quite as appreciated as they were later in retrospect because not only are there really strong elements of well-written and catchy and fun rock and roll on these records but there are some really beautiful love songs on there ballads drones experimental spots just straight-up noise rock really interesting moments of spoken word and some really great stories in a lot of the lyrics here because of Lou Reed will be remembered for anything into the future it's a lot of the tales and a lot of the very grim images that came up in his lyrics as well and of course you know we have to attribute a lot of the experimentation and the adventure in the Velvet Underground's music to the other members of the Velvet Underground but still that experimentation and that will to push boundaries and do something different carried on into the Reed solo career as well as he was making some really solid art rock and glam rock records as well as incorporating elements of spoken word and poetry into his LP is like with the album New York or the Raven and then we have his very experimental for Ray's such as Metal Machine music and you can't deny that the guy was a risk-taker all the way up until the end especially with the Metallica collaboration that he recently did with the album Lulu an album that I personally feel and you can check my review I still don't feel like it's that bad and you know what even though over the course of his discography and his career Lou did have some records that weren't so hot had record that were really misses in comparisons to his hits but you know the hits that he did have were so deafeningly great I can't see why he won't be remembered for them and be remembered for his influence on rock music in general in the foreseeable future and Joel I'm just kind of wondering uh mostly because of my reaction to this when a legends such as Lou Reed passes and he's no longer with us and essentially what that comes to guarantee that we're not going to get any brand-new music and we're not going to see him evolve any more as an artist how does that make you feel do you feel personally upset does a guy like Louie leaving the planet caused you to reflect upon his discography sort of his wider impact on the world of music and of course that that goes for everybody who's watching this to let me know what you thought of Lou Reed's music how did it impact your life did this recent news event sort of caused you to go back and listen to his old solo stuff listen to The Velvet Underground are you a new listener to Lou Reed's music and if so what so what's your perception of it Anthony Fantana reflections forever [Music] you 
Od7fLNhEecM,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of milla phobia fear of music from the band Cage the Elephant I know more free them now free them today free free free them no more in the cage none never no more free free I hate couch acosta Cage the Elephant is an alternative rock band and with the release of mellow phobia they are on their third full-length LP and truthfully I have not really been a huge fan of their previous output mostly because when I listen to their stuff I just don't really feel like I'm I'm missing out on anything sure it seems like Cage the Elephant is into some really good modern bands like hives the vines white stripes of course the Pixies maybe a little bit of underground or left field post hardcore like future of the left or mcklusky but I just think some songs of theirs like ain't no rest for the wicked are just unbearably corny like on this level of like Kid Rock whitey Ford sings the blues sort of cringe-worthy songwriting but with the sort of snide indie rock vocal it's just that there's this really underwhelming sense of ambiguity that I feel like runs through their first two albums where when I'm done listening to them I just feel like who is this band what is their sound what is their direction what are they doing I'm just not sure I was gonna skip over melophobia I wasn't gonna listen to it but out of recommendation by a lot of people whose musical tastes I trust and a lot of people who watch the show I decided to check it out and was pleasantly surprised and in my opinion this is Cage the elephant's most consistent album in terms of the way that it sounds and some writing quality the production the mix and the instrumentation is great it all sounds punchy clear well balanced and yet there is kind of this gritty dirty low-five vibe to the recording as well that feels like it's intentional place there just to make things a little dirty stylistically it still feels like cage the elephant is coming from that same place with alternative rock blues rock a garage rock on this LP I would actually say that cage the elephant sounds like the black lits if they could pass a drug test mr. Matt Schultz vocals are still really over the top whimpering maybe some people would say whining and I wouldn't exactly say that his lyrics have evolved into pure 14-karat nuggets of gold but I don't think there's a single song on this LP where he comes off as obnoxious or unlistenable or just generally unenjoyable I think the most unenjoyable vocal on this entire LP actually comes from Alison Mosshart who at the end of the song it's just forever is sort of displaying the definition of overacting while singing and there are a lot of songs on here that I think are great the LP kicks off really well with the song spider head not a bad tune with some fun catchy sweet melodic guitar leads as well as some plinky pianos I also love the really weird skip edits that occur toward the end of the track that lead into a pretty nice guitar solo I think maybe the weakest link in the chain is the lyrics talking about spiders in your head and your mind she took your eyes but you're not blind not exactly Shakespearean and not exactly going so far into absurdity that it's like oh but it is kind of a breath of fresh air to not be cringing at the lyrics in the way that I have on previous caves the elephant releases come a little closer another track on here that's not too bad the lead single from this album and explosive song that when I first heard it didn't really think too much of it but it really has grown on me since the song has these really subdued verses that are pretty short feel a little surf rock influenced to an extent Matt Schulze is really downplaying his vocal in a big way and then when the song explodes on the chorus with these multiple layers of instrumentation and what I like so much is that we had this low-five vibe here and yet the song seems so huge and seems so epic and layered it's a pretty beautiful come a little closer and you see the ending of the track is pretty explosive too to me says a lot about caves the elephant's maturity with their songwriting on this LP even though all the songs here are pretty much a verse chorus verse structure the band is really great at sort of throwing some little surprises in here or bringing some significant instrumental changes from one part of the song to the other so that there's a lot of variety there's a lot of color there's a lot of personality the song telescope being one moment that I think is an example of that and I think a song that is actually interesting from a lyrical standpoint a track that tells a story of paint a character portrait about a person who's a bit of a recluse I won't go any further into the lyrics than that and I think it's a beautiful tune a frontrunner for my favorite on this LP and kind of has that tenderness to it that a song like a day in the life from the Beatles has I especially like the vocal bridge toward the end of the track with the beating drums in the background it's a really nice piece of progression for the song again Cage the Elephant impressing me with the way that they build these songs and move them from point A to point B there's actually another ballot on here called cigarette daydreams which is the closer it's kind of a short track a little anticlimactic for the last song but another tender moment that goes over pretty well I actually like the strange sections on this track a lot the bowed strings the plucks strings I think all over track 4 track 4 track these songs have a really nice layer of subtlety that previous Cage the Elephant albums just lack and this subtlety even carries on through to the more aggressive and hard-hitting and catchy songs like the song halo which has these multiple instrumental shifts throughout with these downstroke guitars on the chorus and some pianos through the verses and stylistically especially with Matt Schulze vocals the song feels like kind of a hybrid between a stroke song and a Vampire Weekend song to me that's sort of the appeal in the combination of influences too on the track take it or leave it not two tracks on this LP that are favorites of mine maybe because of where they're coming from is a little too obvious but I guess they're pretty successful at bringing that straightforward rock-and-roll swagger a van like The Strokes but also that sort of boyish armed that Vampire Weekend has there are more surprising moments on this LP though like the track Black Widow which is this hard rocking sultry horn backed tune that is about seduction and Matt Schulze is singing all over this track with a really goofy weird falsetto oh there's a good row and then there's the track teeth which I think is another favorite of mine on here not only the most authentically wild song I've ever heard from Cage the Elephant but actually a weird song for just about any band these days a track that starts off with this really wild cacophonous rock instrumentation that to me feels like coming from that post hardcore background a little bit eventually progressing the track into this really nasty weird sax solo and then an odd space of spoken-word that's really off kilter and kind of unsettling again to an extent I feel like we are delivered an album from Cage the Elephant that is all over the place it's kind of schizophrenic but they did a much better job this time at finding a sound finding a production style that links all of these songs together even as Matt Schulze goes through just as much schizophrenia with his vocals I like this LP I was surprised pleasantly surprised how good many of the tracks on this LP were the production is great the performance and execution of the instrumentation on this album as well is raw it feels really in the moment it feels alive and it feels natural the melodies are solid the choruses are really infectious even on the songs that I'm not too crazy about there's quite a bit of detail and personality I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition but if you've given this Cage the Elephant Album oh listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it also I have a new music video review video over at the maker

PxeVDCXOoos,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new toxic Holocaust album chemistry of consciousness toxic Holocaust is a metal outfit that right now I believe is portland-based and is fronted by singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joel grind this is their fifth full-length studio LP and for years this project has been dropping music that has been a pretty seamless combination of thrash metal punk rock a bit of black metal which was placed into the equation ever so subtly overdose of death being an LP that I think brought some of Toxic Holocaust most well crafted songs yet to the table ferocity variety and detail and the songs on this record and then there was conjure and command that dropped a few years ago which showed toxic Holocaust bringing a better recording to the table the band sounding much heavier thicker just who probably the most visceral album to come out of this project and Joel really subtracted the black metal influences from this record in a big way and just sort of stuck simply to the thrash metal and the punk sounds that they had been playing with for the most part up to that point anyway there's no question on this album Joel really simplified the Toxic Allah to some of its most aggressive just no BS elements and that sort of left me wondering or fearing that maybe the next album would entertain me a bit less because there would surely be a lack of surprises on it I do kind of feel like that is happening here to at least some degree I guess the recording and the production on this record are a bit thicker a bit more distorted Joel's vocal delivery is roughly the same if toxic Holocaust goes in any direction with this album I think they actually boil things down even further because many of the heavy slower or more ominous moments from the projects previous LP conjure and command are sort of subtracted and even though that means that on this LP are not really waiting around for the song as the start kickin ass it's just one non-stop ass-kicking fest what that has also created here is an album that to me feels a lot less dynamic than its predecessors toxicology leaves no room for finesse whatsoever and they really lay the weight of this album success on to the guitar riffs which are by no means bad they're executed very well again the grooves are hard-hitting they're infectious but toxic Holocaust guitar riffs don't exactly have a track record of being incredibly original or distinct for me on toxic Holocaust previous stuff the riffs and the beats were just a really good foundation for some more interesting things that brought this base flavor and that would be some interesting lyrical concepts that were grim or dark or socially aware some guitar leads or melodies that were memorable may be an interesting bridge and the song structure or a song that was kind of a coming out of left field in a darker or slower tone or something these variants don't introduce themselves enough on this album to make the entire listening experience memorable there are highlights on here though like the sort of slow and feedback filled out row to the closing track here or the ominous guitar peji OHS on the song rat eater which opened the song up there are some refrains some courses on here that are pretty memorable like acid fuzz the guitar solo is pretty badass on that track too and then we have some lyrical ideas like deny the truth we're obviously we have Joel talking about in the lyrics this blatant refusal to believe what is true and sort of right in front of your face just self-imposed ignorant and then there's the track MKULTRA which I'm not sure how many thrash metal songs there are out there about top secret government projects but this is one of the few one of the proud and honestly throughout this LP there's not really one huge moment where I feel like it falters or Joel comes through with a horrible song the production is crushing the riffs again passable the album is fast paced there is an element of just adrenaline-pumping madness - the way these guitars and drums work together I liked this album but I'm just not seeing what toxicology is doing here that they haven't already done better on their previous releases so I'm feeling a light - decent six on this thing transition but if you've given this toxic Holocaust LP a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana toxic Holocaust forever 
JNyoitGE2cc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review this is a review of the new fi record burials these guys are a hardcore punk outfit that dropped some of its most aggressive albums in the late 90s and early 2000s and they didn't really do this sub-genre of rock much justice at all with a series of albums that didn't feature much in the way of variation interesting riffs or hooks and honestly I think davey havok svos is one of my least favorite in punk rock ever there's not really a single AFI record that I like there are a few that I think are alright but I'm just letting you know where I'm coming from now in the mid-2000s this band really refined it sound cleaned its sound up sort of kept the punk thing on the backburner a bit but we're embracing a lot of these popular sounds and emo in indie rock and even though Havoc's locals took a turn for the incredibly whiny and not in a flattering way this change in AFIS career resulted in albums that had more variation and a few pretty big hits like with the LP December underground with the track miss murder but even that album did end up disappointing a lot of the Bands older fans because of how radio-friendly their sound was going and even though there is sort of the sentiment that oh AFI went mainstream AFI did this a if I did that in every single phase of AFIS career and there have been a lot of phases they've always sort of been this virtually unoffensive somewhat watered down version of something much more interesting in the world of underground rock the band's bland ways have not changed at all on this new LP burials and even though their sound has altered a little bit they're not singing the praises of emo as much on this LP or indie rock or even hardcore punk I actually think the band moves in a somewhat Moody dark and Atmospheric alt-rock direction if it wasn't for the fact that the songs are so succinct and chorus driven and void of experimentation I would maybe call it post-punk there are some spots here where it feels like AFI is trying to be a little edgy or hard-hitting but the raspy shouts and the toothless guitar chords on most these tracks just do nothing for me neither do the cleanly sung vocals which are harmonized a lot of the time and it's not even the foe aggressive sounds that AFI puts into its songs that really gets to me it's the surface level melodrama that I feel like is presented in a lot of these tracks that's a huge turnoff to this is the kind of boring modern rock aggression that I erased from my life when I traded all of my new metal CDs in an FYE which I actually did yesterday and I got a pretty good price for my copy of disturbs the sickness so throughout this entire LP afi's attempts at heavy and hard fall incredibly short offensively short for anybody who has actually heard anything heavy or hard again like I said before there are some moments here like the start of a few tracks where I'm hearing some Spacey guitars lots of reverb and I feel like I might hear something that feels a little interpol influenced or maybe Joy Division influenced but instead I'm just getting this dramatic melodic pop punk that feels like it is way too reverb to really grasp at the lyrics or the meet of the instrumentation even the song wild feels like I'm hearing a pretty decent pop punk influenced band play a song on the other end of a sewer pipe with some pretty weird vocal sampling and some obnoxious keyboards now even AFI has fallen victim to modern musics addiction to reverb cover-up bland songwriting cover uninteresting vocals all with this magical mystical effect we have a falsely dark atmosphere on this album that is just a front for incredibly sterile rock music songs like a deep flow panic are a little more straightforward a little more upfront and tangible but still this style of pop punk feels so dated to me I'd much rather listen to an old My Chemical Romance record at least at that time that band had personality and ambition with the way that it wrote its songs overall even though there are some spots on here where I did like the dark atmospheres before I realized that they weren't that dark or interesting not a single song on your had anything to offer for me this album is overblown under written and covered with too much reverb to the point where it just takes away what little teeth this album has for a rock album that as its foundation uses a style of music that is one of the most biting styles in rock music this LP is a lot like getting gummed to death just like burials in a nutshell just being chewed by these slimy little gums I'm feeling a strong to to a light 3 on this thing transition but if you've given the cell peal listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana AFI burials forever 
OJkmhEfwrnk,hi everyone and the husband and it's time for a review of the new shad album flying colors this guy is a rapper of Kenyan descent who hails from London Ontario Canada I believe this is his fourth full-length studio LP and easily this guy is one of the brightest and sees that our neighbors to the north have to offer yes Flo he has personality the lyrics he dishes out usually have a pretty sharp sense of humor and his vocals his cadence just the sound of his voice just has a really friendly demeanor like whoa I kind of want to hang out with this dude and be his best friend it's that feeling that that separates shad from most emcees out there today now as you guys already know I love grit in my music I love experimentation and sadly shad offers up very little of both however I don't really necessarily mind emcees that are playful or really smart or poppy and even though shad dabbles and all of these things he's an emcee who always comes off to me as being just a little less than exciting however maybe flying colors is the closest he's come to doing that so far considering how many serious highlights there are on this thing like the intro which has an explosive string back instrumental I love the rolling drum machine beats on this thing really detailed noisy in the first verse the shad drops on this thing incredibly fast and passionate usually not rapping this fast which he also makes note of and I'm loving some of the lines on here some of the wordplay like not saying they're Nazis but how can they not see that it's a white world they don't even want that coffee black he also says that he's a vet but not the type of it that's feeling these cats and shad has three other pretty good features on this track as well Lisa Bob singer hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly seems pretty beautifully over this very glistening chorus Ian Ken how has this beautiful bit of spoken word in the midst of this track and I think maybe the shakiest verse on this thing maybe not necessarily 100% necessary on this thing is que haces verse which closes things out and while his wordplay isn't bad on the set of bars I guess I wasn't crazy about his flow and just sort of the heaviness of his voice and the distortion that really made him stick out past the beat on this thing to me not really a pleasant way to finish this song off still it is one of my favorite tracks on this LP along with fam Jam a song whose instrumental feels like a mix between hip-hop grooves and some turntable cuts and cake instrumental yep kind of feels like cake and the song is essentially an ode to immigrants people who have come to America looking to make a better life for themselves and shad especially delves into his own Kenyan roots talking about how we've had immigrants that have gone from donated clothes to caps and gowns and how his mother moved them away from where they were and shad growing up realizing that there was sort of fighting turmoil murder going on in the motherland stylin not a bad song either one of the lead singles off of this LP shad with Socrates on the hook singing very soulful II and with a pretty sharp beat and a heavy buzzing bassline we essentially have shad spinnin bar after bar after witty ass bar saying he's like a combo of Nickelback and The Diplomats or even the line about how he runs like a Kenyan because he's Kenyan ask his mama and I love his bars on here about how somebody may love his music but they hate rapidly addressing that sort of weird moment when you're dealing with somebody who doesn't quite understand that there is rap music out there that is deeper and more emotional and sort of moves beyond what the lyrics you're usually hearing and the mainstream stuff is I especially love the last verse on this track too with all the acronyms at the end really nice theme at the end of this track and shad sort of passes and delivers a lot of bars with flying colors and the song love means while maybe not the most hard-hitting and sharp instrumental of the bunch it does kind of get the job done with its groove and its really beautiful soul sample is one of the most moving tracks on this LP and kicks off with a stellar verse from an MC a fem c by the name of eternia she has maybe the most urgent passionate delivery of any guests on this LP and though her delivery is aggressive the verse that she drops here about love is freakin gorgeous and shad follows up with talking about love in the abstract a little bit rapping about how love is something that is easy to talk about easy to rap about easy to pretend you're romantic and you're this and you're that but love is something that is in fact when you really get down to is hard to live up to this is the kind of thing that no matter how disappointed I may or may not be with the shad album or a shad track that I'm like yeah this this guy is awesome he finally finishes the album off with this 7-minute closure which is a lot more hard-hitting and has some pretty personal energetic and nostalgic bars throughout but when it comes to the sadder or more toned down tracks on here he just doesn't bring the emotion that really makes these songs have an impact or makes them moving to listen to like the song y'all know me which to me energetically is just too middle-of-the-road to be memorable I like a lot of shads bars but the instrumental and the flow and again the energy of this track just isn't there and the song he says she say another track that lyrically is interesting a song about how it seems like shad is rapping from the standpoint of a younger version of themself rapping trying to make it but dealing with a girl in a relationship who is sort of putting up with him being childish and chasing these pipe dreams the instrumental here doesn't really give much weight to the story especially with the smooth jazz trumpet playing toward the end and the song dream while I think it kind of continues on this theme of shad succeeding and achieving in hip-hop music and in his career but feeling unfulfilled despite that I'm liking the concept part that's going on here but again instrumentally and flow wise I'm left sort of underwhelmed shad has some sad tracks on here but in his most emotive moments he feels so close to indifference and I could see him having some success pulling tracks like this out onto his albums especially considering how well the song progress goes this is one of the longer and sadder tracks on this LP has a pretty interesting vocal and instrumental interlude on the back end and it's a pretty deep track for shad talking about mis-education lies hip hop as an art form kind of dying I love how he uses the hook from American Pie on here delivers it in a really sad way and the rising strings on this very propulsive beat give this song a lot of energy that I feel like some of the more toned-down tracks on here just don't have truthfully there isn't really anything on this LP that I dislike yeah there are moments here where shad seems a little too playful or a little too vanilla but that's also part of his appeal because with that question this dude is clever he is hopping on some of his most ambitious instrumentals yet on this thing he's got concepts themes bars personality wise and his rhymes he seems pretty down-to-earth if only his delivery and just sort of his presentation was a little bit more thrilling that's it I'm feeling a light a decent seven on this thing ah transition but if you've given this LP a listen what did you think of it still what it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh shad forever 
ZyuHpnylj38,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new armand hammer LP race music armand hammer is a newly formed hip hop duo out of New York consisting of MCS a lucid and Billy woods Seleucid pretty underground guy on the come-up you may remember him from his numerous features on a bunch of different Billy woods tracks and Billy woods you might remember him from some reviews I did of his recent LPS the latest of which door candy I think might have grown on me a little bit since I initially reviewed it however I really pronounced the name of that LP wrong quite a few times in that review woods and a lucid kind of debuted this duo a little earlier this year back in September with a mixtape that had quite a few tracks on it it really seems like a less polished and more grimy and sort of more rough around the edges not necessarily in a flattering way version of what we're being delivered on race music Billy pretty much still comes through with that flow where it's like half spoken word half passionately shouted lyrically Billy's bars add up into what feels like an incredibly scattered narrative a lot of very gritty and potent and very vivid but disjointed imagery that sometimes until you've heard the entire track and paid really close attention time after time after time then you're able to kind of figure out how it all comes together and tells a story but still even not totally understanding what a lot of these songs are about Billy's very sharp wit and his dark sense of humor really rings through on lines like bad trip like you had to take the bus back or weeks with no sleep I'm living the dream don't really want to know how it go like ground beef a mother's grief Billy never comes through on this LP with a sharp or a speedy flow not really his thing really he's the kind of guy instead who will space all of his words out and emphasize things like raw emotion and concept a lot like Billy woods history will absolve me from 2012 you just get one track after another that dives into a different theme some very obvious from the lyricism and the title of the track itself and others need lots of replay in order to fully comprehend because making sense of some of these tracks it's really like putting puzzle pieces together like the song hatchet job which doesn't really tell a direct direct story but if you pull all the various lines together it kind of tells something about doing dirt and not being able to trust someone or some people who you're working with they're dealing with them sort of being in fear of a double-cross and you've got moments lyrical irritability Woods is saying you know white man handshake twinkle and I this new guy's got my spidey senses tingling later in the track you're getting these lines about maybe some of this coming back to hurt your family and on the track Sunnis blues you get what is essentially a lot of imagery dealing with much of the conflict going on in the Middle East right now especially it gets really vivid on the verse lucid drops toward the end of the track with children being mangled but maybe from the perspective of the person seeing this it's all for a just cause then you've got the track Willy basket which is a really standout track on here because of how dark and just sad it is with its subject matter you've got kind of mental illness on this track kids who are essentially underprivileged living in urban areas and are suffering from serious aggressive mental diseases and don't really have anywhere or anyone to turn to and the track actually gets pretty disturbing with a lucid rapping narrating about one particular kid and sort of the suffering he's dealing with and Billy would sort of turns it into another standpoint of a parent or relative or just someone being afraid of what this kid might do just how he lashes out song no roses is sort of about these broken damaged relationships which it seems like there's a lot of adultery kind of being implied back and forth it seems like there are some emotional hang-ups on this track to that I feel like I have to listen to a little bit closer in order to fully get them but then on the back end of this LP we have a song like Nosferatu - which feels like it's another male-to-female relationship dichotomy but what's going on here lyrically just seems like a much more prime evil and and physical sort of lustful kind of thing you've got the song Duffy on here which is actually a term Jamaican Patois for spirit Billy Woods goes into grave detail a situation that went on when he was younger with his father dying and his funeral and what seems like a lot of people in his family turning against his mother because there was some kind of suspicion that his death wasn't accidental and lucid comes through with a verse on the back end of this tract and what I like so much about him is that they both take a concept and it seems like both of them run in a very different way with it and yet it ends up so cohesive he goes into a lot of just incantation type stuff ritualistic type stuff lyrically talks a bit about superstition as well it's a really chilling track and maybe one of the most spacious atmospheric instrumentals in this entire LP then there is hand-over-fist where it seems like we have three different verses with a guest rapper creature hopping on this song and each verse seems to paint a picture of people who seem to have lost their lives to drugs or addiction there's just really sharp detailed concept after sharp detailed concept on this thing where the wild things are you've got kids kind of running wild in the streets fighting gang activity just sort of falling in with the wrong people I love elusive ersan this track sort of talking about sort of the initial fights that kids get into being kind of a gateway into that and having to stand up for yourself and using violence in a kid's youth as a rite of passage of sorts and then we have Billy woods on the back end I feel like talking a little bit about the school system failing kids too and then failing to pull kids out of the cycle of violence there's a really sharp line on here saying Waiting for Superman the classrooms full of kryptonite and then there is new museum a track with four different MCS including a lucid and Billy woods I remember one of my critiques of Billy woods door candy was that we had this longer Posse cut on the LP but I feel like it sort of took away from the concept of the album or didn't come through with a strong theme at least in my opinion but this track definitely does and it's kind of a tongue-in-cheek look at the everyday grind of the modern artist with Billy talking about being addicted to the Internet constantly refreshing always looking for what people are saying about you but always coming across the same handful of mentions you've got open mike eagle rapping about his caliber as an artist and how he should be brought out with the show dogs and how he's so dedicated he never breaks character he's so dedicated he edits his own Wikipedia page a lucid is rapping about NPR think pieces being voted consistently averaged by other rap fans and then bus drivers verses are taking an interesting theme in that they sort of bring the museum thing into place on this track and he's shouting like a ringleader a bit on this song in my opinion and a lot of his verses have to do with very avant-garde odd art that when you see it you actually question whether or not as art just go into this expecting something kind of like a book of different short stories with each tale telling a different story or painting a perspective or a character portrait I should also mention loosens rap style on this album because it is a pretty sharp variation from Billy's and you can really tell the difference between these two rappers not only with how they attack things lyrically but with their flow the sound of their voice two-for-one aloose it has this incredible rasp that sometimes swallows his words a little bit his rasp really is overbearing sometimes kind of like on Aesop rocks latest stuff and he definitely flows a lot more traditionally than a guy like Billy woods does who really spaces his words out however a lucid I wouldn't say because of his flow is any more catchy than Billy woods because a lot of the flows that he uses are constantly changing or really off kilter in a lot of ways he's just as non-traditional they're a pretty good match but I will say that with over an hour of material on this thing it can get a little redundant especially with a lot of the beats on here being so heavy electronic slow noisy however each of these beats do have definitive characteristics like the really whaling off-kilter kind of dissonant sense on the track hatchet job or the rumbling bass and the kind of interesting cult sample on the song new museum I just can't get away from cults their sample too right on the hook hear the song go outside the pianos on frog and toad are friends as well as shark fin soup are pretty nice addition the beyond new roses is one of the speediest and detailed on this entire LP and has this incredible gospel sampling going on in the background it's a chaotic beat but elusive and Billy just cut right through it Willy basket actually goes in a trap direction which we have Billy woods and elusive flowing over this track in the way that a modern young trap trapper normally would but of course the story and the personality that they bring to the table and the very noisy sense in the background really change up the flavor the song hand-over-fist has these odd reed instruments with this really quirky melody sampled in the background that I like a lot that give that song a lot of personality and then there's the song cloisters which is one of the more toned-down soft and jazzy tracks on the album really there's just a lot of variety on this LP despite the fact that it is so dark and the beats again are pretty lumbering I would say that the Achilles heel of this album is though that it is so freakin dense and while for people who are willing to give this album multiple listens given they're already into Billy woods and Anna Lucid style this album rewards it pays out a lot however it is so heavy with these loose puzzling word assemblies that it may scare off some newcomers to Billy woods elusive Armand Hammer whatever definitely not as many instantaneously catchy tracks in comparison to door candy or history will absolve me but in my opinion an album that is about as enjoyable as those two releases I'm feeling a light too decent 8 on this thing transition but if you've given this LP a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino Armand Hammer forever 
WedevnI57u0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cult album static cults are a pop duo who gathered quite a bit of buzz a few years ago with their debut album and some pretty hot singles leading up until that point mostly the song go outside which was maybe one of the most viral songs of that year for sure listening to these songs cults did have a style and aesthetic pulling together pieces of rock-and-roll jangle pop a little bit of Motown some indie pop as well and just being incredibly cutesy with it sugar encrusted like a Sour Patch Kid and on top of it there was just tons of reverb and just a weird vintage gritty sound to the way that they recorded their instruments - that just made everything that they were playing seem much older than it actually was it became pretty apparent that when they put out their full-length debut their style while very distinct was very limited not only were a ton of songs on the band's debut sort of uninspired and unmemorable but very Sammy Sammy - especially in the case of Madeline's vocals on this record which i think was my least favorite thing about this album by the time I was finished with it because of how light and high and limited in range her vocals are this record just becomes very unpleasant to listen to not grading when you first start hearing the band but it slowly becomes very because I felt that cults were very attuned to the styles of music that they were copying a little bit and bringing into their tracks I was hoping that they would mature a little bit onto this sophomore album of theirs that they would bring maybe more layers more depth and just make things poppy but a little more interesting to listen to upon replay but as soon as I heard the first track on this thing sounding like the soundtrack to an eighth grade playing out of busted speakers in 1955 I knew that that was not going to happen cults have not changed their foundational aesthetic had not really changed the core of their music at all they seemed pretty content with where they are and what their sound is one Madeleine fallens vocals haven't changed a bit I actually think they're a little less entertaining this time around because you kind of know what to expect from her with the reverb and the instrumentation on this LP she is incredibly buried so much to the point where it becomes difficult to make out a lot of her lyrics or really make an emotional connection to much of what she's doing I actually found her vocals and a lot of tracks on this LP to be unenjoyable e lethargic take a look at the very comatose duet on the song where before maybe one of the most boring spots in this entire LP and when I can get a good grip of her vocals the melody the cadences or the lyrics like on the song always forever for example it sounds like I'm listening to I don't know a local singing talent show as opposed to somebody who is actually putting out a commercial music release the vocals are just a really huge downside for me on this LP and I don't see myself ever liking a cult album if that doesn't change because with the kind of music that cults play vocals are such a focal point because the melodies and the backing instrumentation are certainly not stealing the show still this time around they're incredibly incredibly basic however I do feel like a bit more ambition and production value came through this time around with layering of instrumentation like the numerous guitar tones layered on top of each other on the track I can hardly make you mine or the sweet organs and the psychedelic effects on always forever the song we've got it has a pretty sweet key change so far has a great string arrangement wrapped around the backing instrumentation songs like we're before and high road would have a very strong backing beat and really separate themselves from the rest of the tracklist with very standout percussion but going to the song high road that is pretty much what's become the biggest track the the lead single if you will with a pretty nice music video off of this LP and in my opinion nowhere near as catchy as anything from the band's last LP I actually think what they do on this track is sort of average for the kind of music that they're trying to play in general you can catch a lot of very schmaltzy poppy organ grooves like this on plenty of Records sitting in the dollar bin at your local thrift store and it's not even the dated style and aesthetic that leaves the feeling so uninspired on this record it's that a lot of the time cults are such slaves to reverb the instrumental progression they make on this album leaves very little impact as far as the instrumentation has been assembled it's not a bad album yes it's really basic yes the melodies don't really stick with me but everything kind of falls into place and it's not that cult sound is necessarily awful it's just that over time it just gets really old and doesn't stay interesting for the duration of a full-length album and that was basically the downfall of their last LP now what makes this album less interesting to me despite the fact that more instrumentation has been thrown into this thing in a nice way it's that there are less memorable songs on this thing this album has much less single power than cults debut it's just got less highlights I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana cults forever 
ywhjLNIup10,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and this is a review of the new dismemberment plan album uncanny valley it would seem that these days there really is no shortage of comeback albums and this record is most certainly proof of that being an album that it's been about a little over 10 years since dismemberment plans last full-length LP i believe they disbanded in the early 2000s and in that time that they were formed as a band they penned a few what people consider to be indie classics like emergency and i which is an album that to be completely honest while i know that a lot of people are living and dying by this LP it's a seminal record for a lot of people in indie rock it's definitely not a favorite of mine i do like a lot of the musical characteristics of the dismemberment plans tracks i like they're typically jagged and and very tight drum beats that are at times dance music influenced the very groovin bass the angular guitars i guess i always gravitated more toward their energetic tracks toward their i don't want to say aggressive since it's it doesn't feel like anger is fueling these songs but they're more over the top and and very fiery songs like girl o'clock and eight and a half minutes i love a magician I thought that I would give this new album of theirs a listen even though a lot of people haven't really been asking me but I'm just personally interested because this really seems to be a band that a lot of people love this new album of theirs to me feels like nearly everything I remember about the dismemberment plan - and this is a big - - all the eccentricities even the drumming has mellowed out in a pretty big way with maybe the most energetic and danceable track on this album being Mexico City Christmas for the most part the drum beats do not feel as sharp or as jagged and they're thrown in the back of the mix a little bit the guitars have a much more equal balance with synthesizers now and they come off much more gentle as well I think the most unchanged characteristic about this whole record is maybe Travis Morrison's voice again you don't have him reaching up into those really frantic highs of his range but he does still have this vocal that feels really youthful feels really boyish and yet there's this strange vibrato to it and this really earnest tone all that's really occurring on this record is dismemberment plan is is merely working with their softer gentler more playful side there are moments when the music in my opinion shoots for a blatantly feel good mood kind of like the track daddy was a real good dancer even though there is sort of a sad personal story going on in the lyrics there I'm definitely trying to advocate for the direction that the band is moving in from an outside perspective I don't think this is a terrible record but does it appeal to me not really the truth is a lot of the music a lot of the guitar phrasing and a lot of the lyricism on this album are insultingly simplistic like the track let's go to the dogs tonight with the opening lyrics about well what is it I'll be the sugar and you'll be the cream I'll be the dreamer and you be the dream and of course these lyrics are delivered with a flow that kind of feels like it's it spaced out like a children's rhyme or something and I mean that could have totally been intentional maybe that is intentional especially with the the level of rhyming and imagery going on here too but I definitely don't feel like Travis Morrison juxtaposed this in a way where it actually feels like an adult can enjoy it not only that but there are tracks on here like go and get it where the music feels much more well suited for a band like okay go that's how saccharine the dismemberment plan sounds on this record and while that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing I feel like the pop appeal of this record isn't quite as high or as energetic or as thrilling their spots here that I enjoy like the earnestness in the lyrics on the track white collar white trash or even how tender and and wonderfully melodic the song looking is but as I've said before when it comes to more toned down tracks more ballad driven tracks from the dismemberment plan they just don't really thrill me they just don't really move me I guess I could say so not only are there moments where I just wish this record was a bit gutsy er but for music that has a wider pop appeal when you compare to their earlier stuff it isn't particularly catchy or infectious and for music that is much softer and gentler and sweeter than music from their earlier records it's not incredibly moving or in my opinion beautiful so yeah honestly I'm really left out in the cold on this new dismemberment playin album but what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana dismemberment plan forever 
daDLgR6kxSM,let's do this Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and this is a review of the new Eminem single rap god Eminem you know a Detroit rapper Michigan rapper and apparently the best-selling musical artist of the 2000s considered one of the living greats in hip-hop today I grew up sort of in the midst of the hype in his first two records owned both of them I loved ends fast flow his really raw delivery is raunchy and offensive lyrics his songs which could be incredibly cartoony and sort of silly but but have sort of a message lying underneath that maybe a bit of darkness and he had outright sad depressing and kind of personal songs to which I also found to be really interesting statistic and now that he's back and he's clean and he's put out recovery he put out that long-awaited project with Royce two five nine bad meets evil it just seems like there's no sign of him stopping and it feels like his eyes are on just a really ambitious prize right now in that he is planning on titling his next LP the Marshall Mathers LP 2 which I think we should have seen coming I mean Eminem is nothing if not responsive to his fans and he is also kind of regretful about some of the album's in his catalogue admitting in his own songs that they were kind of subpar and of course ever since the Marshall Mathers LP there has been this growing sentiment this chant among fans like we want the old Eminem back we miss the old Eminem now that it kind of seems like he's trying to trend back a little bit go toward a gruffer more hard-hitting version of himself uh I don't know I can't say I'm feeling that excited especially given the few tracks that have dropped so far from this forthcoming LP berserk was huge and caught the whole rap world by storm a bit with a pretty loud crunchy guitar driven beat from none other than Rick Rubin I didn't review the track when it initially came out and honestly it's because I didn't really dig the track that much he kicks off the song saying that he's going to take it back to real hip-hop but the thing is when the Beastie Boys came out with Licensed to Ill that was a sound that people in the hip-hop community people who were hip-hop heads didn't take seriously which is why they abandoned this sound and this kind of party boys style on their next LP I think license is a great album I own that album I think we can all enjoy it in retrospect but I don't see how doing your best Beastie Boys impersonation is getting down to the roots of real hip-hop not only that but there are just so many lyrics throughout this track that stick out to me is just being kind of corny and and that's the thing mmm can be a little corny sometimes though he does make some very serious tracks he does make some very personal tracks like the reference to MC Ren on here not Stimpy's friend or you thought PE was gym class or talking about doing so much codeine that you would not future into tomorrow and the entire second verse on this track is just cringe worthy bar for bar starting off with hitting on a girl and telling her to get on Kids Rock bow with two bow wa pound chicka wow wow while I think the instrumental here is just really loud and over-the-top and maybe it was a little shocking at first maybe you felt kind of obnoxious at first with more listens I've kind of grown to appreciate the instrumental appreciate the flow they're just spots here where it feels like Eminem has made a track that lyrically and sort of the the humor and the comedy and the wit that he delivers with his lyrics it feels really dated the reason that so many lyrics on Berzerk don't fly for me is the same reason that a lot of rappers don't come through on the mic with lyrics and flows like sucka MC's they are wack watch out for me I'm on the attack hearing Eminem rap like this and try to deliver this level of cheese in his lyrics is like having someone run Windows 98 on a brand new iMac but now with this new track rap God Eminem has come through with something that I feel like is instrumentally it's a lot less risky in fact I think maybe the biggest issue that this track suffers from is that the instrumental is a little bland the sub-base is a little muddy and a bunch of whip whip look really going down an electro route with some of the sense on this beat but mm comes through with a super mind-blowing crazy insane flow the flow on this song is top-notch eminence technical ability is just there man it's there and for sure from that technical standpoint mmm is worthy you know he's calling himself a rap God and I'm like you know what I don't disagree but man still when I read into some of the lyrics on this track what is the point of rapping this fast when you're delivering lines about how you're rubber and insults and attempts that you were just bouncing off of you and sticking to them for sure maybe it's a bit of a tongue-in-cheek thing because he calls himself innovative and then throws out this schoolyard rhyme but even if you slice it that way I don't really see this as clever for sure mmm does throw his history out there references to his success in the past references to the fact that he is not as popular as he used to be Clinton administration Pharoahe Monch who he has ties with but then again there are spots on this track where he's detailing the Ray J and fab beef that I didn't even think anyone remembered there are some deeper bars on this track that are actually kind of personally telling for mmm rhymes about his race addiction his hunger in the rap game now his bitterness against women but we're also following this up with wordplay about battering women but baking them a cake is anyone laughing at this is is this actually comedy and while yeah I know the eminem throws a lot of wordplay and double entendre is out there they all add up to just some really cheap humor or are slight rehashes of the same kinds of jokes Eminem has been telling for years from a narrative standpoint from a punchline standpoint this track isn't anything altogether new or refreshing or exciting the instrumental bread the the best thing this track has going for is just the flow which is fantastic they can of course on the Marshall Mathers LP 2 drops I'm going to be listening to the whole thing but as of right now given these two tracks and survival - I'm not expecting a whole ton but what do you think are you expecting a whole ton from this LP do you like survival berserk rap God and yeah transition but if you've given this track listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh and then rap God forever 
YzjLq2AoWv8,they do bad bad zebediah hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and this is a review of the new Tim Hecker album virgins Tim Hecker is an electronic and ambient music producer hailing from Canada this is his seventh studio LP under his own name and for me a very highly anticipated return from his fantastic 2011 album rave death 1972 and on this LP tends typical blend of ambient music noise and drone got a bit more textured a bit more layered piano really took over on this album in a big way and it felt here more than on other Hecker releases that the instrumentation was kind of live in the moment not only that but all of the sounds combined on this record added up into a very post-apocalyptic vibe it's a great LP if you haven't heard it go listen to it and with this new album though rave death did get a bunch of hype when it first came out it is really a highly praised album I think Tim has hit it out of the park once again right here once again Tim is ambitious with his layers his sound play with his instrumentation with creating a somewhat live feel with the instruments on this record but the instrumentation here seems so much less bleak and wandering than on Tim's past few releases even though virgin's has plenty of soft and sparse moments on its tracks I think this is actually one of Tim's more direct albums a lot of the tracks here are actually quite busy with sound and don't take too long to start don't take too long to build I wouldn't exactly call it fast paced but it definitely is one of Hecker's more tightly composed efforts but that just speaks to the structure of this album as far as the instrumentation goes of course you have piano returning on this record you have harmonium on many tracks here as well what feels like a few different synthesizers and maybe some woodwinds that could just be more harmonium and it feels like Tim played out planned out wrote composed some music for a variety of different tracks here but he grabs the instrumentation or the performances that he made and he reverses parts of them he loops them he chops them he swirls them and layers them and scatters them Tim manipulates a lot of the instrumentation on this record very heavily and yet it doesn't really lose that live-in-the-moment feel that you would get if you were just listening to a quartet or some kind of instrumental music ensemble not only that but Tim just layers piece of instrumentation on top of piece of instrumentation to the point where a lot of these compositions end up feeling a bit like drones and even though these very heavy thick layers may feel a little impenetrable sonically because of just how large and wide they are there are very beautiful melodies and interesting chord progressions that peak through it all to those who are attentive and sort of focused on what's going on Tim Hecker usually approaches his records with an eye on the bigger picture and how the record sounds as a whole and virgin's is no different however even though this album really feels like it was created from a holistic standpoint there is a bit of a disjointed and fractured aesthetic to a lot of the music on this LP as if a lot of what the listener is hearing is being conjured through some kind of distant idea or memory and to me that comes through on just how cloudy and and muddled the melodies can be sometimes with the instrumentation being layered on so heavily so cacophonous Lee but the sounds and the emotions on here though are so vivid this record could really put a dent in the happiest of days but I think Tim Hecker goes about that melancholy and a slightly different in a slightly cleaner way the way this LP starts with the track prism with an incredibly bright drone so bright it's just like staring into the Sun there are these weird shots of reverse piano playing throughout the track and the song just grows more and more and more cacophonous and eventually gives away to the splintered pianos that are layered throughout the second track on here virginal where it feels like Tim Hecker is indulging in a little bit of piano minimalism in a bit of modern classical he's just grabbing this one piano piece which it could be from a bunch of different takes and he's just placing them on top of one another to the point where it feels like you're listening to this piano being played within a Hall of Mirrors it's like you're hearing a repeat of the same piano phrasing being played again and again and again with slight variations on top of one another to the point where it's really dizzying it's an amazing and kind of creative effect and the song just grows heavier and heavier and heavier and eventually coasts down really beautifully toward the finish we also get a little piano part playing toward the end of this track that is cut off that foreshadows to another song around the middle point of this album the next song on here radiant's another very bright drone and kind of a sad melancholy post-rock esque footnote on this album that feels like a bit of a transitionary track not really surprised to kind of see some post-rock influence on this album considering that Tim Hecker record his last EP in the infamous hotel to tango recording studio the first incredibly noisy moment to pop up on this LP is the track live room where you get the same fractured piano approach but playing a different phrase and it's matched up with these incredibly heavy Basie ways of distortion that kind of sound like you're listening to the last dying breath of some kind of about to break synthesizer and even though it's a really ugly sound there's something very beautiful and and final about this track too especially as Tim starts swirling and rapping and surrounding all of these ugly and ethereal sounds with some really beautiful synth Keys live room out is a very touching closer to this track and then you have virginal 2 which kind of takes that piano phrase from virginal but goes in a different direction with it I like that Tim has these recurring themes on his album he can grab Mel ladies from previous tracks and reworked them in a way that sounds fresh and even though Tim is really great at layering and recycling and reusing and manipulating one of the most stunning tracks on this album is maybe one of the most bear to black refraction now after this point in the LP I actually feel like the album hits a bit of a lull not a bad way but most of the very heavy and structured compositions on this album are doled out in the first half a lot of the songs on this second part of the album are a bit shorter like the song in sense Abu Ghraib which only really feels like an introductory moment to the next track on here amps drugs and harmonium both of these songs consist of very chilling harmonium passages and I like that Tim is able to pull such coherent songs together especially on amps and drugs with what feels like just a bunch of pieces of harmonium playing maybe a sound collage of sorts my only disappointment with this track though is just how suddenly it kind of drops out and and and finishes again I feel like that's Tim sort of shooting for that typically fractured feel that he likes some of his songs to have but it's really only so appealing to me if it's getting in the way of the feel or killing the vibe of the song or just sort of the mood that has been building up the clothes are on here though stab variation is maybe the most damaged sounding and psychedelic instrumental on this entire LP taking some of the distortion from stigmata one and some of the heavy percussion what feels like percussion just rumbles kicks in the lower end of the mix from stigmata to and bringing them together with a really big epic climax for an artist whose music is constantly tagged as being ambient this finish is really explosive I really am in love with most of the tracks on this LP and even the songs the tracks that I'm not head-over-heels for by themselves I see them having a very important part being played inside of this album as as kind of a transition or just a moment where we're moving from point A to point B you're changing the mood for an album that is so short just like 47 minutes long it feels much longer this LP really is a very hefty journey and a journey that is incredibly well recorded fine tune colorful at times meticulously composed and at other moments very vast and open and no matter how busy or sparse this album is it always comes off as beautiful fantastic I'm feeling a light a decent 9 on this record transition but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Tim Hecker virgins 
00f6tOy38I8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and we're going to do a quick review here of the new church's album the bones of what you believe those guys are a Scottish synth pop outfit who I told a lot of you in the comments maybe I wasn't so crazy about their new LP I wasn't really planning to review their LP but as a lot of you know I put out a video talking about the sexual harassment sort of the misogyny that's been thrown in the band's way via Facebook and other social media platforms and how lead singer Lauren Mayberry was speaking out about that and I felt bad not really talking about the band's musical talents and really sort of having the only mention of their new album on this channel be that video because clearly churches has more to bring the world than a view on misogyny and sexual harassment so in a nutshell churches essentially makes synthesizer pop with a bit of an 80s chic but with a very strong modern indie pop vibe as well on top of that I would actually say that the trio has a very bright and accessible commercial edge to their songs too but overall this is just an album where outright I just ended up preferring the singles and pretty much that's it really I wasn't as crazy about the deeper cuts I love songs on here like mother we share I love recover and the song night sky is a really catchy stand out for me on here as well to go back to the song recover the synthesizers that open that track as well as the verses with the really odd vocal phrasing it's all really ear catching and then when the chorus comes up it's such a melodically sweet chorus ah the vocal melody on this hook is stellar and it's such a long hook too it lasts a really long time I actually think the chorus lasts longer than the verses on this track I actually think this song a majority of the time is this elongated chorus but I don't find every chorus on this LP to be well written and succinct for example the song we sync I'll be a thorn in your side till you die I'll be a thorn in your side for always if we sink we'll lift our love I just don't see what's so appealing about this hook for a band that makes pop music they have some incredibly uncommon this album and then there are moments where I feel like churches try to take it away from their very bright obvious catchy side and do something a little sweeter a little more toned down like on the song tether but it just ends up feeling boring because not only does the band's instrumentation not really play all too well in a more subtle direction but Lauren Mayberry's voice doesn't really strike me as at least on this song an incredibly emotive vocal while her ultra youthful singing sounds fantastic on these really bright upbeat catchy songs to do something a little more tender the dynamics there for me just not there but I prefer Laurens vocals on any of these tracks to the male vocals that pop in on the song under the tide as well as the closer here - neither of which are appealing to me oh I just think the male vocals on this LP are flat bland and not interesting at all while I don't think Lauren is an incredibly passionate vocalist on this record her singing on these songs is at least sweet I think my one surprise with Lauren's singing was on the song science / visions where not only does her accent peek through a little bit on this song but I feel on the chorus on this track she slips out of that girlish tone into something that feels a little more mature has a bit more body and this instrumental here I think is a little surprising for churches as well while it's just as busy as a lot of the other beats on this LP it's really a dark instrumental and over the course of the song it just grows more and more intense and not to count out the other instrumentals either like by the throat that while they are sweet with all these sparkling synth arpeggios there's quite a bit of detail in the beat and then there is lungs on here which is very off-kilter Groo on this instrumental with these very base e distorted heavy synth notes that play through a majority of the song overall I did think this album was likable but it's not anything that I enjoyed from front to back a lot of potholes on this thing to be completely honest and overall I think that while churches can write some really catchy songs they do have a very sweet appeal their production is very bright and ear grabbing there are moments where I feel a little let down by the lack of dynamics and the singing by the somewhat unmemorable and and kind of corny lyrics here and there obviously the male vocals on the selfie didn't appeal to me at all and the slower softer moments that this album tried to deliver we're nowhere near as entertaining or as moving as the brighter more hyped up spots but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan o churches forever 
u3BWyaejZX8,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd this is a review of the new or on see Pazuzu album these guys are a Finnish rock band this is their third full-length LP I heard of them back in 2010 thanks to their debut album which actually dropped in 2009 but I was actually kind of late on it but when I actually got around to listening to the album I was pretty excited by the band's mix of black metal and other genres of rock music because the music on this album is actually quite spacey to me their work on this LP is admirably adventurous however their next album really just kind of breezed by me honestly there can be moments when this band's riffs their drumming just basically their songs in general can come off a little static still a little underwhelming on top of that it's not like there are other artists out there doing adventurous things with black metal music at least sonically however in a way I will say that I feel that or Anne siese it's at least on a throne of their own because their approach to this style of music at times just feels outright trippy and certainly that vibe bleeds through on this new record as well for these six tracks and 47 minutes that it lasts some of the songs on here are the band's longest material yet 11 minute track on here 15 minute track on here but the four average sized songs that surround these two monsters for this band are pretty straightforward like the opener Vino versa where the band delivers this pretty nice mid pace guitar riff got a good groove to it banana now but this really only is a foundation on top of which the band lays some very twisted bright synthesizers some guitar chords here and there that are so distorted and brittle that they sear like the Sun and synth lines that are constantly skipping in the background as well but however most of the experimental characteristics of this song really buried in the mix behind the guitars really thrown in the background placed on the back burner while it's not a horrible track and the riff does make for an ear catching opener why ad adventurous or experimental elements if they're not going to enhance the experience of the song the fourth track out here follows a similarly repetitive formula but instead of a booming guitar riff we have a very slow spacious bass line and this base line is a part of what is essentially a very eerie brooding and kind of psychedelic instrumental I would actually call it chilling if it weren't for these sort of wobbly synthesizers playing through at the end of the track making it kind of feel like corny Halloween tape soundtrack not every synthesizer part on this track is a bus though for the most part this is a pretty interesting transitional moment on the album I think my favorites of the mid sized tracks on this LP definitely have to be the second track and the fifth track especially the fifth track these songs are multifaceted and they stay pretty engaging from beginning to end this fifth song has a pretty nice guitar riff that kicks things off some rest vocals placed on top of this of course and then the song gives away to some wailing guitars on top of blastbeats a very intense combination and then it just settles down into a rock groove that is no less chilling and sort of reminds me of something from the 28 days later soundtrack this is the kind of rollercoaster esque songwriting that I think made the band's first LP so great and I wish they engage with a little more on here as far as the longer cuts on this LP go there is or an insula which starts off with a booming riff that I think would be a fantastic start for just about any metal track but then the song begins to drag as it becomes apparent that these awesome crushing riffs have only become a music bed for some decent vocals and guitar soloing that is only interesting about half the time the best parts of this track really are the beginning and I think the last four or five minutes of this song where all of a sudden we have a huge explosion of guitars and the band suddenly kicks into this odd timed riff and even though it is incredibly off-kilter they play it in this really visceral way where the groove is just so primal and fluid and free and as far as the monstrous closer on this LP goes not a bad track either it's got a very quiet and an eerie guitar led intro that reminds me of a little bit of Godspeed and then there's an explosive riff that brings the song to another plateau of intensity and even though on this track like many other songs here the the playing the performance it's not fantastically intense or mind-blowing I do like the fact that this song progresses in a much more interesting way than other songs on here the band is always looking for another level of volume or another layer to add on to the mix to sort of keep things engaging there are times when synthesizers that that and there's a moment toward the very end of this track where there is a very thick string section that is paired really well with the thunderous guitars that are clashing away behind it it's just odd to me that a band would arrange such a great piece of instrumentation around their track and then just a little bit earlier in the song like around the 930 mark we have some guitar intervals that don't feel all that well mixed into the song and are simply going plugging away in the background not really adding that much to the song it's just like there are moments where the band is is adding another spice or another ingredient another element to the mix just to have something else there or just to have an ornamental little bit of sound there to separate their tracks from what would normally be just a straightforward black metal song even though there are cons to this album for me there are quite a bit of pros it's recorded well the grooves are really nice they get my head bobbing the mix is great there's a variety among the tracks the album for sure flows well and for sure or ANSI sits at an interesting crossroads of different genres but there are moments here where some of the guitar riffs are the soloing the sound play feels a little average and that goes for black metal metal psychedelic rock whatever genre you feel it really sticks out at you when it comes to this record I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing position but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fant an O or an C PES whose metal forever 
fKOePUxRn-g,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a video a question comment thing talking about whether or not you should physically print your album music the auditory art for years celebrated on physical mediums through visual mediums like gold records and elaborate packaging today it is this almost invisible medium it's a digital medium it's just ones and zeroes in order to listen to it and experience it you don't need to have this physical representation in front of you artists have made the necessary changes that they needed to in order to maintain and grow their audience by putting their music and places where people are most likely to hear it and even though there is all this newness being embraced there's this progressive attitude in the music community there is an old habit that is dying very hard if it ever will die and that is printing your album as long as music collectors music nerds and incredibly passionate fans walk the planet there will always be room for CD sales record sales cassette sales since they're kind of coming back and who knows what else will come back into the future so I put together this handy flow chart so that you can decide whether or not you're going to print your album do you make music no go away yes do you have a passionate fan base willing to spend money on your merchandise no don't print anything yes you may want to print just remember that the music industry in terms of sales is not what it used to be 20 or 30 years ago depending on how you interacted with the music that you enjoyed everybody was lumped into it essentially one single sales group if you liked a few songs from the album if you liked five songs from the album if you loved the entire album you bought the entire album nowadays if you love those two songs use it by those two songs or you pirate the entire album or you could stream it and of course you're going to have fans of your music that will buy it digitally but there is going to be an even smaller subset of hardcore passionate people in your fanbase that will be willing to buy your music physically and what you need to evaluate is whether or not you have people like that in your fanbase for the music that you're creating question/comment thing is over okay alright thanks for watching that's my opinion whether or not you should print your album let me know what you think did you hate what I had to say did you love what I had to say agree disagree whatever let me know and yeah you're the best anthony Fantana printing your album [Music] you 
7UkObDLYo1Y,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new melt banana album fetch melt banana is a Japanese hardcore punk and noise rock band that has been around since the 90s or at least that's what you would think if you didn't actually know that they were sent from the future to the past is proof that the 1975 is as boring as rock music gets hey what alright I'm sorry I just don't I don't really like them you say we'll go where nobody knows with guns hidden under our petticoats no we're never gonna quit it no we're never gonna quit it no ears well since about the 2007 album Bambi's dilemma mel banana has pretty much been on hiatus from releasing new studio material but now they are back with this LP fetch and on this LP as it is with their previous LPS mel banana has a pretty unique sound and style when it comes to rock music one that has won them over some pretty passionate fans some of whom are pretty big names and experimental and underground music guys like Mike Patton John Zorn The Melvins but their sound is also something that has turned a lot of people off on first listen as well the band's guitarist Ichiro prefers a tone that is so bright and is so just ah ear piercing that at times it feels like instead of a guitar no you're just hearing raw feedback or maybe even a dog whistle the bass lines are usually pretty busy driving and occasionally if they want to stick out have a crunchy tone to them the drumming which I believe on this record is sequenced programmed it's basically a drum machine that's how melt banana has recorded a lot of their records though I have known them to perform live with different drummers over the years but on this album the drum sounds are just so loud they're just so ah they sound like gunshots they're so tightly sequenced to some amazing fills on the songs here and you have a myriad of different beats on this album from dance beats to just straight-up rock beats to grindcore style beats and D beats and just a bunch of different punk beats and then there is yasuko's vocals which maybe throughout the Bands career have been the most consistent sound in their canon her voice is just so high-pitched and it doesn't help that she is shouting and shouting and shouting in this really hyped staccato way that is incredibly ear grabbing and as far as song structures Mel banana can be pretty unpredictable as well with some songs in there earlier records lasting up to 10 seconds now as the band progressed into the 2000s they drifted with some of their records away from the typically low five recordings that would cover their earlier stuff they started fleshing out their songs a little bit writing tracks that had more accessible rock grooves maybe incorporated some elements of pop some electronics its hero really got very very ambitious with the guitar effects he was toying with with records like Cell scape in 2003 Mel banana was sounding way way way more coherent than they ever have and even though they continued to make music under the tag under the genre of noise rock at that time the noise that they were bringing to the table was changing from sounding really chaotic and hectic to something that felt way more meticulously crafted now even though Mel banana has released music in the 10-year period between cell scape and fetch Timmy fetch is really the sequel to cell scape it's the growth beyond the cleaner and more organized sounds they created on that record for one the guitar effects and the layering which sounded so great on cell scape are much more ambitious on this LP and stacked to a higher degree the sound play on this LP is pretty surprising it's hero comes together with some pretty interesting textures there is actually more melody brought to the table by Mel banana on this album there are intros and outros and softer moments worked into some of these songs and this album in general bringing this a little more dynamics than any other Mel banana LP and the production here is so clear and notch it perfectly complements Mel bananas incredibly busy sound me being a fan of Mel bananas ins college and also being aware of their musical trajectory over the course of their discography it's hard for me not to see fetch as melt bananas best album this help he kicks off with the track candy gun the opening of this song just starts with these colorful epic layers of guitar leads that actually sound not too unlike something I would normally hear on a Marty Stern album but what ends up arriving around the corner of this intro is something that's very different with the throbbing bass lines the very sharp fast rock drumming and yasuko's very energetic shouts that are interrupted only by these very colorful shots of guitar noise this is a formula that the band repeats with even better results on the song infection defective [Music] that little two notes slide in this track is so freakin infectious but yet it also sort of sounds like a siren to an ambulance or something like that their music seems so meticulously and melodically crafted here even though you are hearing such an overwhelming sound being brought to the table when you dive into it it's just so perfectly executed it's like wow there is not a note or a sound out of place on this song on this entire album is there and at least for me it's rare that a band comes along that that seeks to reach this level of execution perfection and yet their music stays so visceral exciting and joyous joyous despite the fact that on this track the drums are so loud that they're like bomb shells exploding that there's even a moment with some tremolo guitar picking that sounds pretty heavy metal for just a just a little spine this track Yasuko actually experiments with her vocals a little bit on the next track here one of the first tracks to drop from this album the hive it's a song that actually sees yasuko's voice with the auto-tune or some kind of auto-tune esque effect and it actually doesn't sound too bad not that it complements her voice or makes it sound amazing but it works for her in the fact that it seems at least here like a weird little distortion effect because she's not really singing in a typical or a normal way the end result of her voice in this effect is she sounds like a robot malfunctioning going berserk just about to explode and the guitar work on this track matches that with something that is just as dizzying as frantic with these guitars that are constantly sliding up in this very noisy way on the chorus and on the bridge to this track with these constantly skipping guitar notes it's like taking a sample of guitar and just repeating it on end the vocal Adventures on this record continue with the track schemes of the tales where you Sukho actually has her vocals multi-tracked on top of one another in a pretty harmonious way this combined with the pummeling drums and the really triumphant guitar melodies make schemes maybe one of the most joyous musical beatings of 2013 and the closer zero on here to features again what I think is a bit of auto-tune but the instrumental in the background is not normally what you would hear melt banana pursue there's a dance beat and a really sweet vocal melody and yasuko's vocals seem so heavily treated that it's almost like listening to a keyboard as opposed to a person's voice and it's a pretty catchy tune too but still in my opinion this song is maybe the lowest point on this album because of the really redundant and repetitive guitar layering and the really abrupt finish that this song meets at its end but still this track goes to show that despite the fact that Melba Nana is such a loud fast and in a way an abrasive band they're not a dark group their music doesn't feel tortured their music doesn't portray for me any type of suffering if their music does manage to appeal to you it's actually pretty exciting and and somewhat smile inducing I think the dreariest song on this entire album is the track my missing link where you have the guitars taking a much more minor tone and you have one tremolo pick note on top of another creating this darkly epic menagerie of guitar sounds the vocals on this track are harmonized as well but as far as their performance they feel like they're taking a bit more of a stern tone there are shorter tracks on this album as well that are just as enjoyable as some of the longer songs tracks that barely break the two-minute mark tracks like lie lied lies where you've essentially got these Punk riffs layered with noise played at light speed and then there's vertigo game which has these syncopated snare drums and guitar riffs this track actually sounds like some kind of weird cyberpunk college football fight song from the year 20 X DX I love it there are just so many moments on this album that feel familiar to melt bananas style that feel like something I would expect from Mel banana but they're doing it better than ever and then on top of that there are spots where there venturing outside of their comfort zone and seeing a lot of success as well after decades of existence and this very short studio album hiatus Mel banana has come back and and has proven that they are still frantic speed noise virtuosos and are capable of making one of the boldest rock albums of the year I'm feeling a light too decent 9:00 on this album transition but if you given the cell peal listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fanta no belt banana forever 
bSLHjrxd8GI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd it's a great day to be alive it's a great day to be listening to music and this is a review of the new self-titled fuzz album fuzz is the collaborative duo of multi-instrumentalist and garage rock garage Punk modern garage Punk icon ty Segall as well as Charlie who Ty has actually performed with and collaborated with on numerous occasions the most recent of which I believe was actually bringing Charlie on as a guitarist in the ty Segall band which dropped a full-length LP last year except Charlie and and Ty take this LP in a slightly different direction by embracing some influences from the worlds of heavy psyche stoner rock a little bit of hard-nosed blues rock or classic rock but the downside is that a lot of the songs here feel like they could have really been swapped out and thrown on to any other ty project and they really wouldn't have thrown off the track listing or the flow the album or anything like that like the opener on here earth and gate doesn't sound too unlike many songs from the slaughterhouse album and honestly it's not that memorable of a tune either the intro is overly long when it starts getting good toward the end it just kind of fades out and the vintage riffs that are played throughout this song at a very high speed while they're not bad the very chaotic and distorted production kind of just blurs them all together and they lose some of their defining characteristics I think the only part of the song that really stuck out to me is being awesome was the blaring fiery guitar solo that pops in before the song finishes off there are other spots though on this LP that come off as memorable like the really crunchy riffs on the song sleigh ride I love the groove that ty and Charlie hit on this song it really reminds me of something that could have been on the Stooges record raw power also the blaring lead guitars toward the beginning of the track that are harmonized in a really odd way it adds a bit of a quirky characteristic to the song and the spot-on here is singing about isolation is one of the few moments here that are memorable from a lyrical standpoint these song loose sutures wasn't a bad moment on here actually reminded me of an incredibly extreme version of an old Led Zeppelin song or two especially when they hit that distorted peak around the middle point in the song and there is a huge drum solo that finishes this track off and it builds into this really explosive finish that is maybe one of the most fantastic points of this album the song what's in my head is one of the darker tracks off of this LP and really feels like ty is borrowing in a huge way from Black Sabbath especially with the huge elongated and just overly emphasized drum fills did it that it and the vocals on the verse from this track are pretty melodic as well it's a it's a welcome change of pace from some of the snotty and snide and sort of vocals that you usually hear on other Thai songs that you usually hear on other songs on this record while I'm not against the really raw and aggressive presentation that Ty's music usually delivers I feel like a lot of the time he allows that to overshadow things like finer details and grandeur and possibly more progressive ambitions typically ty bringing other musicians to the table ends up in a record that is a bit of a standout does shake things up in his discography a bit does bring some new elements or just some newer sounds to the table but maybe this time it didn't quite happen though still you know the there is that energy here there is that ferocity like I said there are some worthwhile solos and some great interplay between ty and Charlie when they focus on that but it feels like the songwriting sort of fell to the wayside on this album a bit but if you've given Fuzzle listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana fuzz forever 
yo_TlAJmldA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and making a quick video in response to some questions and comments that I've gotten saying Anthony where is the Higham review didn't you like the new Higham album and the answer is yes I did like the new higham album and a review for it kind of already exists it's just a co review that's all I did a live view of their wonderful very enjoyable new little pop album and it was on the rocket out blogs channel during a webcam sort of live show that we were doing again I say live and yeah I will leave a link down in the description to where you can watch it cool cool Anthony Fantan oh hi I'm [Music] [Music] 
osgjyexGTEo,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Pusha T album my name is my name Pusha T Virginia rapper signed with good music if you didn't already know push a T is a member of the famed hip hop duo Clipse a lot of people consider their album hell hath no fury to be a modern classic however it would seem that talent hasn't necessarily added up to a strong foothold in a vibrant solo career every every what little stuff push it he has put out just hasn't been that memorable earlier this year he released the wrath of Kane mixtape which I think had some worthwhile tracks on it and then there was numbers on the boards which was the first single to drop from this forthcoming album and in my opinion one of the best singles of 2013 regardless of genre I would say a little more than usual push a tease wordplay is freaking dense on this track and his words his lyrics and the way he delivers them is clever it's funny it's convincing he raps in a way that's so toned down but feels so hyped and exciting and what makes the song even more interesting to listen to is just how unorthodox the beat is I love the skipping bass line on this track the kind of goofy percussion sample and Pusha T just drops bar after bar that I could just imagine him writing out and then reading and rewriting and rewriting it's a different jingle when you hear these car keys which leads into the line about the SL leading into the line about the plane leading into the line about the wings it seems that with Pusha T it's either every line is just filled with wordplay or has a reference back to the previous line or has a reference forward to the next line so after I heard numbers on the boards I folded my hands and I prayed that consistently on my name is my name the beats would be adventurous that the bars would be hardest steel and that the features would be enjoyable and then came more singles from this thing and it seemed like I was kind of getting my win like with songs such as nose stall jet for one I love the beat on this song I love the wailing guitar note that repeats over and over and over the hand percussion that seems to skip and drag a little bit in a kind of interesting way really making the groove flow and swish back and forth like a bucket full of water I love the Boogie Down Productions sample that pops in and out of the song - and sonically the beat is just really fitting for this dark druggie dope boy world that Pusha T always finds himself in lyrically of course Pusha T comes through with solid rhymes solid wordplay when he's talking about selling Johnson & Johnson then he says he was a babyface monster references diaper rash references a teething ring when Pusha T builds on a theme in his verses he just goes all-out and when Kendrick Lamar comes in who is also featured on this track it is fantastic couldn't have asked for a better rapper to hop on this song but he just comes through with a hard-nosed verse talking about his father selling drugs for a little bit and then kind of linking that back around saying that well in the future I'll be your connect and kind of coming to the conclusion that your son is dope dope drugs don't you get it every verses a break this song is essentially just like a headbutt to the face I love it other tracks that drop before the release of this LP weren't bad either King push you've essentially got more coke talk on this track on top of a futuristic trap be the song does reach an abrupt end though as a lot of other tracks on here do kind of like a drug dealer this album hangs around long enough to give you what you need and then disappears into the night there also was the track sweet serenade with Chris Brown that also dropped before the sell P and maybe that was the most underwhelming track to be released before my name is my name came out the chorus which Chris Brown sings on was so toned down that it almost felt like a little anonymous like that really could have been anybody singing on this track the beat had these really ethereal tones hanging in the background that I loved some really crisp 808 drum sounds again Pusha T comes through with dense bars I think one of my favorite series of lines from him on this track comes from the final verse where he says that his Ouija board doesn't lie to him and he knows what MCS are alive to him and that the competition is dead to him and not only does my name is my name have some pretty solid singles but there are some deeper cuts on here that are enjoyable to the song hold on features some production from Hudson Mohawke also has Rick Ross on a verse here to a song that is not quite as hard-hitting as the song millions which was on Pusha T's wrath of Kane mixtape may be a little more enjoyable because of how gruff that song is but hold on does kind of bring an introspective side to push a tee and Rick Ross that you don't normally see the worst thing about this track though are the production credits kanye west brings to the table while I like the very nutty beat and the bright sense that Hudson Mohawke has in this track and some of the grand pianos that I'm sure Kanye included the auto-tune singing he has all over this track sounds completely obnoxious not even enjoyable on any level whatsoever Pusha T kind of talks about being a dope dealer and a rapper raps about selling dope and how that isn't really any worse than being a rapper who avoids those topics but sells listeners false hope kind of painting himself is more of a realist and Rick Ross like I said a lot more introspective than we usually see him on this song I would actually say his verse is kind of decent from a substantial standpoint the song suicide continues push a tease connection with Pharrell delivering a beat on this song that is very quirky some interesting synths on this song it's colorful it's odd and Pusha T brings a lot of charisma and some good bars of this track to the first half of this album is is really solid but it's really at the halfway mark that Pusha T starts delivering one unenjoyable song after another there's no regrets on here which lyrically isn't a bad track and features some more Hudson Mohawke production but the beat on this song doesn't really feel that enjoyable the percussion is really intense and it's busy and you do have some bright scents on here but without a nice brown warm bass line to kind of smooth things out the instrumental is just so jagged and not really that complimentary an MC like Pusha T who does sound so low-key a lot of the time he feels a little drowned out to me here then we have the song with Kelly Rowland let me love you which Wow um no clue I push it to you to this track it just sounds like a mace song not even like oh it's a little influenced by me no it just sounds like a song that would have been on maces welcome back album from the instrumental to the cheesy R&B hook to Pusha T's cadence on this track it's all just a dead ringer for a very forgettable May song and all pusher really did on this track is just make a song that sounds dated from the word go its tracks like this that really make me feel like Pusha T's best songs on this album are the ones with non melodic hooks or just simplified hooks because when you have songs on here like pain with future which not surprised that this song that this feature happened because you did have Kevin gates on Pusha T's last mixtape doing what was essentially a future impression and now here he has the real thing was this hook even written it just kind of sounds like future completely ad-libbed it in this really unintelligible uninhabited it and yeah and then there's the track who I am which I think only illustrates how much of a double-edged sword signing to good music can be because while the beat is fantastic on this track and push a tee sounds great as well really banger beat here with some personality to chains and Big Sean essentially come in for two guest verses that are incredibly weak then there's the track snitch which closes this album out but nothing that's really going to redeem the second half of this LP nothing that really stands above nostalgia as being the best song on this part of the album Pusha T could have given us some pure just mind melting cane but obviously as fans were not really on that level with push of T where he hooks us up with the good stuff so he kind of patted this album out with some baking soda some baby powder and said here you go I'm feeling a decent strong six on my name is my name transition but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it push it t my name is my name Anthony Fantana forever 
k9X1u7H_JcU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and this is a review of the new of Montreal album lousy with sylveon briar these guys are ignored a rock band who has had one of the longest-running careers in indie rock and pop music they are famously known for early on being members of the infamous elephant six collected they've also put out quite a few albums on the famed poly vinyl records and their earliest stuff which is my favorite stuff in their discography had musical leanings toward indie folk as well as art pop and psychedelic pop and for the most part Kevin Barnes would write tracks that were sort of cute quaint boyish playful lyrically witty but also at times kind of dramatic and troubled now eventually the band evolved to take on some really clean nice and detailed production and start to incorporate a little bit of studio trickery they kind of laid it heavier with the effects and started to use some more sense and electronics this led to some hyper colorful vocal layering that reminded me of artists such as Queen for example and albums that just generally had more pop appeal LPS like satanic panic in the Attic son'll antic twins as well as hissing fauna are you the destroyer quite possibly the band's biggest album to date however hissing fauna is is kind of a turning point for me in the band's career in that I feel like lyrically and and sonically melodically of Montreal was getting really really gaudy they're very over-the-top vocals and dense instrumentation kind of caught up with them a bit on skeletal lamping as well as false priests which is maybe my least favorite release from them because of just how chaotic it is however since this record I think Kevin Barnes and the band have been kind of slowly drifting down to earth again and putting out music that is while lavish and very emotionally distraught lyrically intense it's also maybe a bit more sensible I think that was definitely the greatest quality that paralytic stalks had going for it if it which had some fantastic arranged instrumentation around some pretty solid songs and since then of Montreal has put out a few compilations of older stuff and I feel like that has definitely set the tone for this new record of theirs which in a way goes back to the band's roots in a really big way the band has really put out a true-blue rock album again with this release with plenty of catchy sort of poppy hooks hard rocking guitars of course some guitar licks and bass lines being borrowed from that psychedelic rock and pop tradition and some full key elements too but there is sort of a new addition to the repertoire the stylistic repertoire that Kevin Burns usually brings to the table there is a bit of a folk rock and I would say all country influenced on this LP songs like fugitive air and Belle Glade missionaries have certain twang to the guitars that wasn't quite as prevalent on the band's earlier releases plus I guess it's kind of hard to call this record a true return to form because over the years as Kevin Barnes has released more records with of Montreal he has become an incredibly volatile frontman I mean at least artistically with his lyrics dealing in some real real emotional distress so while this record to a longtime of Montreal fan may feel like a bit of a trip back there are elements in the music here that do kind of keep lousy from feeling like a deja vu moment now regardless of what musical style this record sits in I do truly feel like this is one of Montreal's more solid albums as of late lyrically this album can really be read into on a pretty deep level melodically this thing is really sticky it's sweet and as far as the production goes while this album does have a raw and somewhat acoustic vibe to the sound just like old of Montreal records there is a newer cleaner punchiness to lousy that of Montreal's earlier material just didn't have because the band's production chops have been evolving for years up until this point this album kicks off with the song fugitive air maybe one of the most potent songs the band has released to date when it comes to just having a rock and roll attitude and this song opens up with a really sharp succession of chords which of Montreal is so great at putting together some very tight and complicated chord progressions that really add a lot of character to their songs and then this is no different and there's sort of a noisy and slick slide guitar playing through this track to adding kind of a backwoods bluesy country aesthetic vocally Kevin Barnes is coming off bitter and emotionally explosive the lyrics on this thing are a barrage that are a little difficult to decipher there are some songs that when Kevin is singing and I'm trying to read into the lyrics I feel like I've been thrown into a giant spider's web and I'm trying to escape but it's the other tracks on here that are a bit more readable that I feel really resonate with me even though they are just as worthy as the opener here songs like obsidian currents which is a great track about someone who is just too logical to be emotional this person that Kevin is singing about is a very cold and contemplative person who doesn't see the point in getting worked up or really emotional over much of anything and I can relate to that sometimes but I find the course especially hilarious talking to this person telling them that there's a virus in their tenets and melodically the song is so warm and sweet it can melt any cynics heart there's also the incredibly tender song sirens of your toxic spirit and if I was the person who this song was written about I would be absolutely depressed apparently this individual has no real friends everyone surrounding this person is just kind of there in some warped form of charity this person is in a struggle with addiction which he or she inherited from his or her father however Kevin Barnes sees this personal destruction having gone so far that he literally goes out of his way to say that you know what why even change why even do anything different at this point and there are some parts here where Kevin Barnes just seems like a very raw and upfront modern-day individual but it's lines like sirens of your toxic spirit that kind of make me want to liken him to a Renaissance poet there is the track Colossus which I love where lyrically Kevin Barnes is sort of describing an incredibly dysfunctional family and its tracks like this where his lyrics feel especially jumbled and wordy to the point where his singing is maybe just a smidge away from almost talking and there are tracks on here that actually go further down that road like Belle Glade missionaries as well as Hegira emigres where over some really energetic folk rock instrumentation Kevin Barnes is sort of just rambling in the same way that Bob Dylan would on a record like highway 61 revisited or bringing it all back home and these songs are just as entertaining Lee scatterbrain as those Dylan tracks too though I guess there are some spots where Belle Glade feels more like a character dissection of course there are moments here where lyrically Kevin Barnes seems to be singing about some kind of personal experience that deals in a bit of emotional trauma like on the track triumph of disintegration where he literally kicks the track off with the lyrics the last ten days have been a  but as far as the music goes on here I guess I can't really complain either like I said before of Montreal kind of goes back to their roots but does it with this slight very subtle country vibe and there are some familiar musical tropes being played out on this record some grooves that kind of feel borrowed right out of the psyche pop riff playbook but I feel like of Montreal continues to play in this realm of music but they still end up dazzling because of just the good melodies the good writing and good playing - and just some creative segues and contrasts between different points in the song like the surprise acoustic transition in the middle of the song Belle Glade some of the romantic acoustic strumming in the background on song sirens is is pretty moving the chorus on the song triumph has these really wild guitars wailing against Kevin Barnes very manic vocals on the chorus toward the end of hit gara there's a very nice psychedelic jam with this folk rock instrumentation just intensifying on this groove and getting louder and just crazier and the string kissed raindrop in my goal is easily one of the prettier tracks on here - as far as downsides and complaints these instrumentals would I be wowed by them would I be blown away by them if Kevin Barnes vocals were not in the picture and they were just completely erased and gone maybe they would feel a little kind of every day but honestly Kevin Barnes really is that electrifying of a frontman that I do enjoy the record anyway and obviously these songs have been pruned to kind of put him up front and center in the mix there is the song amphibian days which I do feel is a little underwhelming neither upbeat and catchy and exciting or so low-key and pretty that it moves me a little middle-of-the-road and sort of the double-edged sword - Kevin Barnes being so over-the-top and and lyrically verbose is that there are some tracks here like the closer that are literally so wordy that listening to Kevin Barnes sing is more like listening to him stumble because of the way his words are parsed out in such a scattered odd way that the pacing of the song is thrown off a bit I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it of Montreal lousy with sylveon Brouwer forever 
h_7zG3XQTSo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and this is a review of the new Darkseid album psychic Darkseid is the musical duo of David Harrington and new york-based electronic music producer Nick Louis jar who you may be familiar with if you've been watching the reviews for a while because he has made some of my favorite electronic music of the past few years I was pretty psyched to listen to this new album even though maybe I wasn't head over heels for the EP that Darkseid dropped on Nicholas jars clown and sunset label but as a duo Darkseid under the name daft side did put out a strangely interesting and oddly creative remix album a track for track remix of the new daft punk album titling at random access memories memories and even though the remix album wasn't tracked for track amazing it said to me at least that Darkseid was evolving into something a project that wasn't afraid to take a risk and just kind of do something a little left-field and give fans something a little unexpected and maybe unexpected sums up a little of the music on this album - like I anticipated from Darkseid and just from a Nicholas jar project in general I feel like this record in a way fits squarely into that micro house wagon and of course the overall vibe an aesthetic of the sounds on this LP are very nocturnal their shadowy but I think this record takes those characteristics and just turns them in a different direction while the beats and the grooves on this album are sort of subtle and spacious there is a pretty over rock vibe that bleeds through on most of the tracks here for one the song paper trails with its percussion with its guitar lines as well as its vocals mud there was a bit of a doors influence radiating off of this track from the first moment I heard it and whether the influence is intentionally being shown off or not it's still a great track I love the bluesy guitar licks that Dave brings into the fold as the song is building Nicholas jars vocal phrasing seems very Jim Morrison inspired maybe a bit of a Scott Walker vibe in the vibrato in his singing and there's this weird based chorus effect behind his voice kind of adding this just unsettling unnerving characteristic to the vocals on this track that while they were weird the first few times I heard it I sort of have grown to love it with repeat listens I also love the subtle keyboards hanging in the background that sort of pop in against the course around the 2:30 mark this song it's a really beautiful track overall one of the most melodically interesting songs that I think Nicolas jar has been involved with so far I would say that the song heart too has a rock vibe in it with its crispy err drums as well as it's trudging and slowly descending chord progression with the guitar melodies echoing this really obvious rock influence from the 60s and from the 70s I would actually even say the melodies and the chord progressions on the closing track here are a little floyd ian still even though darkside does embrace a rock direction on this LP i would not say this album in any way is is in-your-face or incredibly upbeat it's still a slow burner it's still a record that requires a lot of patience there's really nothing that says you need an attention span for this record like an 11 minute opening track the way this opener kicks off with these really warm kind of sporadic synthesizers there's a really just ear tickling fuzzy drone hanging in the background that I like a lot and with this Rocksteady beat just kind of subtly pulsating away in the background this to me feels more like something I would just expect from Nicolas jar but this moment in the song is merely the intro after 4 minutes and 30 seconds Dave Harrington brings in these really dry prickly guitar leads that just kind of bounce and plink around the mix I love the heavy groove that this song sort of flows into toward the finish as well as the bill that's backed up with some really high pitched synths it sort of explodes and dissipates fizzles a little bit and then floats on this very textured outro it's a fantastically structured song stays engaging from beginning to end and nearly every other song on here is engaging from begin and to I think the most lackluster maybe least memorable songs on this LP are the two shorter tracks on here that kind of feel like intermissions maybe I was looking for a little bit more from the song Greek light though the song does fall just short of three minutes and it's a kind of interesting three minutes with these somewhat kitschy keyboards playing a very mournful set of chords and then these vocals are laid on top which are incredibly odd and maybe that's another thing I need to sort of make note of with this record a lot of tracks on here feature vocals and many of them are not sung in a very traditional way to go back to the song heart there's a very awkward and strange falsetto over a majority of that track and the track the only shrine I've ever seen has these falsettos and maybe some mid-range vocals doubled up on top of each other for pretty strange listening experience that that I actually liked a lot also the water Ian and very sharp rhythm guitars on this track kind of leave me feeling like Nicolas and David really did take the disco direction that Daft Punk took their new album in' to heart overall not a lot of complaints about this record a few songs on here most notably the shorter ones paled in comparison to others but still Nicolas and Dave came together on this album and made a series of tracks that are intensely hypnotic low-key and very detailed with layers of instrumentation and some pretty interesting textures too especially at the beginning of a track like freek go home which it was day which is mostly an instrumental song that is chock-full of all of these odd samples that that really could have been lifted from anywhere sort of reminds me of his live sets when he samples radio noise or radio static I am feeling a strong eight on this album transition but if you've given this dark side album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it dark side psychic forever 
AJYUx4pIIAo,hi Joel hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and before I get into the crux of this video I have to answer a question answer a query that Joel posed in his last video is there still an underground in music before the digital age that we're currently living in now if you wanted to find out about experimental progressive or obscure music you might need to put in a bit more effort like digging deeper into a crate at your local record store or even going to your local record store read some books pick up some magazines maybe listen to a local community run radio station go to some shows now most of these things can be achieved by merely engaging in a few clicks not only that but independent musicians are no longer inhibited by a lot of the same limitations that they were back in the day either like a lot of people can't hear our record because we can only afford to print a hundred copies of it however when it comes to promoting your own music there are still barriers between the artists and popularity I mean the music that they make could not really be vibing with people there's still a lot of saturation and competition out there in the music world right now you're also kind of dealing with the issue that a lot of people want to listen to sort of what's popular what's hip what's kind of catching on in some ways it's almost as if the underground is bigger than ever because you have tons and tons and tons of artists right now more artists than ever whose music is is out there but is literally just not being heard so with this convenience that the internet brings us there is a bit of difficulty now sort of on to my next thing if you were watching the music news this past week you may have caught a little story involving Lauren Mayberry of the Scottish synth pop trio churches talking about responding to some of the vile lusty and kind of sexist messages that are thrown the band's way on Facebook and I'm not really sure why people engage in this behavior on a regular basis and that's another thing this sort of thing has been going on a while at least from what I can tell in the indie music community because before Lauren Mayberry I can also recall Lana Del Rey Annie Clark Grimes as well as Alice glass of Crystal Castles all attracting very vocal and sexually obsessed groups of males and while I understand that attraction physical attraction is not really something that you can turn on and off I don't really see sending explicit messages to some female musician as being a healthy way to kind of deal with these desires just because Lauren Mayberry is a public figure and you may find her physically attractive doesn't mean that she deserves to be viciously sexually harassed it doesn't mean she deserves to be at the butt of your cheap thrill Joel I guess what I'm kind of wondering from you is if this kind of behavior just continues to go on what do you think could happen in music in the future will this just be something that females are expected to deal with and will they continue to deal with it or will you have people kind of saying in themselves you know what maybe moderate music Fame isn't worth all of the perverse attention that I'm receiving let me know Anthony Fantan Oh sexism misogyny harassment forever [Music] [Music] 
MapvwWsSYco,hi everyone Anthony fed tato here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new haunted horses album watcher these guys are a rock duo hailing from Seattle they have dropped some singles an EP they've got a KEXP performance as well under their belts and now this new full-length album and basically what they deliver on the nine tracks here are a heavy heavy combination of numerous musical styles including a little bit of post-punk on the darker side of that genre industrial rock noise rock encapsulated into this very chilling cavernous atmosphere there's definitely a vibe a sonic vibe that they bring to the table that reminds me of old swans records as well as maybe a little bit of Bauhaus or Killing Joke and if we're going to put a few contemporaries into the mix maybe a band like pop 1280 like their debut record as well as Ice Age when they're incredibly slow and depressing and at their most cacophonous it is a very primal and overwhelming 25 minutes of music with heavy drumbeat after heavy drumbeat in lockstep with incredibly grimy and harsh guitar riffs occasionally what sounds like a sinister keyboard pops in and there are these very distant disembodied vocals moaning out in the background in a very eerie way delivered mostly in a deadpan style occasionally reaching up into this screamed intensity and all of these sounds combined on this record really do have a huge presentation this is a very very loud loud album from the very first guitar whale and and bellowing the record is pretty ear-shattering it kicks off with the song numinous which feels a bit like an intro to the next song go attea which has this very Spacey one-minute track following it which feels a bit like an outro it's like you've got these three songs which together really feel like one song but the middle point of these two tracks go at TIA is just the thrilling energetic blood pumping and adrenaline filled highlight these driving guitarists are just pumping and pumping and pumping with these skittering noisy just bright brittle glitches happening on every fourth bar and even though the riff is essentially kinda just a couple notes switching back and forth between one another taunted horses is throwing so much noise and so much sound this mix it's almost actually a fulfilling song the band does sort of layer things a bit more with tone on the track the moon's March with some keyboards that I like a lot even if I do wish that the vocals were a bit more up front I see the appeal in just how cavernous and distant and deadpan the vocals are on this record but they do kind of lose their appeal after a while I think I get much more of a thrill from the odd vocal samples and the vitriolic shouting on the track children of light I love the explosive shots of dissonance and and guitar distortion around the middle point of this track it's a moment where I feel like haunted horses really shifts themselves from being a rock band to just some kind of primal noise act like these are the kinds of terrible sounds that would be created if rock instrumentation had thrived in the Stone Age I love the drumbeat on this track too really busy way more detail than some of the other beats on here and I feel like in order to keep things very just the drummer does hold himself back it points to kind of play into the aesthetic of this record but still there are songs like the void where the beat is oddly danceable the closing track on here actually features a beat that feels a little tangible - and it spots like this that make me feel like maybe the drummer's a little more versatile than he would seem on the surface playing these really loud crushing noise rock songs it certainly feels that way on the song luminance which has this very scattered drumbeat with these high hats jutting out every single direction but when it comes to the guitar work on this track it's just not a moment that sticks out to me in comparison with everything else on here while I think haunted horses has a fantastic sound they are amazingly heavy I'm really being crushed by this record I just wish they would diversify their sound a little bit sometimes the second-to-last track on here was a bit of a surprise to me because the guitar chords here are actually pretty harmonious in comparison with many of the other songs here and moments like that moments that really stick out to me and feel different from every other spot on this album are sometimes what I feel like this album lacks that in length because I would love to hear these guys go add it with a few more songs in the tracklist but still this is a really enjoyable release if you're into that could coffin is industrial rock then do give this thing a listen I'm feeling a decent strong seven on the cell P transition but if you've given a listen to this thing what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said haunted horses watcher forever

GYaVI3fLFz0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new Danny Brown album Oh Danny Brown Detroit rapper who in 2011 dropped one of the most acclaimed hip hop mixtapes of that year XXX AKA 30 a tape that i loved myself showcased Danny Brown as a rapper with a lot of personality a lot of split personality the dude raps in numerous pitches a voice some very high out there and over the top some very low and kind of subdued he's got numerous rhythmatic flows in his arsenal and emotionally he seemed like a guy who was a little all over the place to the first half of this tape kind of displaying a dude who was drinkin smokin poppin pills talking shit fifth album in the mouth the nasty conjuring images of Sarah Palin herself deep throating until she hiccup but also putting together some clever wordplay and some internal rhymes within his lines as well like every time I indent you could see my intent leave your mind bent hanging on every sentence but the latter half of this album was way more toned down way more depressing Danny Brown was a guy that not only did drugs and rapped about doing drugs but he was a lyricist that sort of brought everyone willing to listen to the entirety of xxx into this twisted downward spiral of addiction really however even though xxx really caught on for Danny and he made a name for himself on this tape it's as if that half of the message didn't really translate so much to this wider audience he seemed to have gained overnight and I'm not exactly sure why was the tape too long did people only listen to the first half did his crazier drug-addled tracks just have more replay value because as soon as XXX got big it was like the indie music media and Danny Brown embraced this image for him as this crazy Molly poppin party animal and what's interesting is that there were some men of Mali on xxx but it seems that as Dany was getting more popular Mali MDMA was sort of on the rise being mentioned in hip-hop either mainstream or underground and sort of what else was on the rise - was really zany EDM influenced rap beats so he really capitalized on it with new singles like black Brad Pitt and with it he had a pretty big track with a rap music as well of course he's collaborated and toured with ASAP Rocky who was huge into trap music himself he also appeared on a track that DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill produced that was hugely trap influenced actually his whole new record was hugely trap influenced and the appearances and the collaborations that I just mentioned are a very small slice of the pie Danny spent majority of the time between these two records working making connections building this clout in the hip-hop community that he never had before he was on the new tech 9 album new Flatbush zombies mixtape he was also performing at the gathering of the Juggalos which surprisingly within the indie community he received no backlash for not only was Danny building himself up to be this really off-the-wall personality but he was just everywhere as awesome as it was to sort of see Danny's career taking off because I was such a huge fan of xxx part of me was kind of worried that he would abandon his more introspective side in favor of really embarking on making these party tracks as much as he possibly could because they seemed to be gaining more buzz for him than those more introspective tracks off of his record thankfully that's not actually the case on old because there are plenty of songs here where Danny explores the darker side of his past and his psyche however on this record I can't help but feel like the multiple sides of his personality his emotions and his addictions are just at odds and I'm seeing less connections between sort of the dark somber Danny Brown and this wild just let's party as hard as we possibly can Danny Brown and I feel like these separations are increasing because of the lyrical content between these two sides the cadences that he uses of course the beats that he usually hops on when he's going in a particular direction just like on his last record Danny does his best to keep one emotion on one side of the record and the other emotion on the other side of the record but he flips it putting the more introspective tracks at the beginning and maybe that's sort of in an effort to get people to listen to that side of him a little closer and it definitely pulls me in because I think lyrically Danny is a lot more descriptive when he's going down this road than he was on xxx like on the opening track he rolled which essentially is Danny kind of talking about going back to that old self of his getting his braids back going back to wrapping up drugs dealing constantly tripping and even though this is not really a new tail and hip-hop music there's just this incredibly grimy urgent vibe to this track especially with the really thick Basie and noisy instrumental going on behind Danny and he just has a voice that cuts through all of it this instrumental and a lot of others on here have a really psychedelic edge whether they're going for more of a boom-bap flavor maybe something kind of toned down or something really trap influenced following the opening track is the return with Freddie Gibbs again another track on here that I love has really kind of funky dark nocturnal vibe to the instrumental and it kind of continues with that theme of Danny Brown going back to his old gangsta self going as far as to say fuck a hipster squeeze a trigger but then you have songs later in the track listing on this side like lonely where Danny Brown is saying that he's a hipster at heart but he can tell you how the streets feel hopping on the track with a flow that you might remember from xxx talking about how he enjoys some of Radiohead's music and even though the instrumental here is just very pretty it's sparkling it feels like a dream some of Danny's lyrics just feel nightmarish he's stacking for abortion he's trying to get creative with spam because it seems like that's all he has to eat and there's a moment here where he feels the need to address some societal racism - and the next track here clean up is a song that as well the instrumental feels heavenly it feels pretty but Danny's lyrics man they're heavy sort of him acknowledging his addictions with pills with smoking really with everything and how it's affecting his relations with his family with his daughter spots like this really make me think that man maybe Danny is sort of on the cusp of a major change in his life where he's going to be giving this stuff up but part of me also thinks how could that possibly happen Danny's kind of been playing the field for the past few years as this underground party icon a rapper whose personality and in lyricism and success is is heavily indebted to drugs drug culture and later on this LP Danny drops the track dope song which opens up the second half it's a track where it seems like Danny Brown is kind of lashing out at his past and getting tired of other rappers kind of telling this 10 year old story about something that they did it seems like he'd rather keep things fresh keep things new keep things forward-thinking and essentially says here on this song that this is his last dope song again there are spots on here where it feels like Danny goes deeper into his introspective side than he ever has before but on the second half of this LP it feels like Danny goes further into his party animal side than he ever has before - you have tracks on here like smoking and drinking one of the catchy ER songs on this LP really infectious chorus really loud over-the-top instrumental of course a hybrid of EDM and trap here - Danny kind of talking about his vices coming down to his depression and wanting to get away from that in the second verse of this track there's also the song dip on here two equally influenced by EDM and trap he really does kind of put himself at the forefront of malli culture in hip-hop takes shots at other rappers that sort of embrace it or mention it to gain attention and I think that's why Danny goes so deep lyrically into the malli experience with this track because he feels like he can kind of give that more detail than anybody else can and then on top of that lyrically with getting into his zone I feel like we get a bit of a watch the throne reference here and I would go so far as to say maybe a little freak nasty influence with the dip then a beaut if we did it seems like Danny is is literally with the instrumentals and with the lyrical content on the second half of this tract trying to put himself in that party atmosphere as much as possible to kind of alleviate a lot of the torture and a lot of the that occurs on the first half of this LP now these EDM trap hybrids that I just mentioned I like them I enjoy them and in a way I was expecting tracks like this to pop up on this album considering that that's how so many of Danny's biggest singles between the release of xxx and old were going but I think after a while on the second half of this LP instrumentally and lyrically things get a little one-dimensional they get kind of redundant it really does feel like Danny isn't trying to put as much effort into his lyrics and that his cadence is so over the top on a lot of these tracks that it's hard to really read into them unless you're going on rap genius or something like that it seems like this desire to just be as crazy as you possibly can over these Diplo inspired beats is just kind of the goal here just create a party atmosphere and that's it that's essentially what he's serving up on tracks like break it and handstand which are kind of like twerk anthems and after he releases these two tracks the album doesn't really redeem itself either delivering the song way up here with AB soul where I feel like both him and Danny put together some pretty unmemorable verses and then there's Kush coma which even though ASAP Rocky has been added to the track since its original release I'm still not really crazy about the song instrumentally the track to me feels just jumbled the hook is kind of gaudy and again we just have a lot of lyricism that isn't hitting me as hard as some of Danny's grittier stuff from the first half of this LP the grittier stuff from xxx as well as just the over-the-top nasty in-your-face stuff from xxx as well that was just laugh out loud hilarious and there are some other spots on here too where I feel like Danny is trying to reconcile his old self with his new self and he really gets some mixed results like on the track 25 bucks which lyrically and and hook wise as well I think is a great track but he's all over this kind of trashy electronic which house influenced instrumental with purity ring on the hook just is not doing too much for me it really feels out of place sonically with the rest of the album especially the first two tracks that preceded then there is the song Wonder Bread which really I only wish was longer I like the odd flute led instrumental it really kind of feels like a twisted fairy tale or nursery rhyme or something like that with Danny talking about going down to the store to get bread and being confronted with the violence in his neighborhood and the drug fiends there as well then there's the track dubstep where it feels like there is a bit of dubstep influence in the keyboards and Danny embraces a bit of grime on this track as well which if you've been following his career between xxx and old he has been kind of over there in the UK networking with some artists in that genre - and I think lyrically with the guests that he brought on here's the song turns out really well just not too crazy about the instrumental and the very sugar-coated hook then there is float on toward the back end of this album with Charli XCX whose contributions are very subtle which is great and I think she complements the track well it's not a bad closer however it's not exactly the thrilling cliffhanger that thirty was at the back end of xxx though it's still a really introspective track I feel like Danny's very subdued vocals are almost buried in the beat a little bit too much and instead of me kind of sitting on the edge of my seat wondering where Danny is going to go next he ends up feeling a little beaten down by the process and just sort of the grind of driving himself crazy and wanting to make his next album better than his previous one truth be told the dynamic of this album even though Danny is on different instrumentals than he was before isn't too different from xxx were just seeing the same addiction the same problems and the same drugs and the same over-the-top attitude framed within a different part of Danny's career he still is hopeful that he will see his influence sort of play out in hip-hop music when he is 50 years old and considering how much personality Danny has whether I enjoy this album or not that may in fact happen now there were moments on here where I did enjoy the trap and EDM influences coming through and I felt like they were executed really tastefully in a way that still sort of maintained mean that edge that you expect from Danny tracks like dope-fiend rental or dope song and given these more shallow party tracks toward the back end of this album they still sound unique nobody is doing tracks like this quite like Danny is however it's still hard for me personally to not get sick of them at least a little bit as I'm listening to this album from beginning to end I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Danny Brown old forever 
313T1dQJ8fk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new one o tricks point never album r+ 7 1 o tricks point never is the pseudonym of electronic music composer Daniel o Patton whose productions usually sit on the experimental side of things embracing elements of ambient music of progressive synth music of drone of a little bit of noise a lot of the time the music he makes kind of sits somewhere between being somewhat epic and grand and also very Spacey or numbing he's also collaborated with quite a few artists and put out some side projects as well one of which and is kind of credited with starting this whole vaporwave thing the project that I failed to mention in my review of OneNote explained ever is last full-length LP replica but now that replica has been mentioned I have to say that that is my favorite album to come out of this project thus far mostly because I think that record takes such a strange unique and obtuse approach to producing sample-based music it's just like listening to these very somewhat ambient but odd and weirdly shaped plunder phonics compositions I'm finding are plus seven to be a continuation of this trend in Daniels music to produce stuff that is a bit more engaging is more eventful is more detailed however stylistically I find him drifting away from the samples upon samples upon samples that made replicas such a sonic treasure trove I have no clue what happened to my mouth right there instead of relying heavily on samples Daniel kind of rests on his laurels and goes back to using synthesizers really heavily which sound like they're produced via MIDI sequencing kind of a calling card for Daniel at this point I guess what I'm trying to say is that Daniels music feels like it's entirely generated inside of some computer program to the point where it just does not feel human anymore however still our plus seven is is kind of change for Daniel because I do think he puts in a lot more effort into finding some synth textures on on this record that yes while they do feel like they are composed in this very rigid way sonically it's it's very lush plus I would say that Daniels songs are pretty structured on this album as well not meandering so much not really kind of spacing out so much even when he seems to build up to a moment he kind of takes it away really quickly and goes down a completely different Road compositionally I feel like Daniel jumps all over the place but sonically a lot of what he pulls together is is very pretty it's very heavenly actually when it comes to synth textures on this record anyway I would say that Daniels number one influence is like cheesy kitschy new-age music from the 80s and 90s but he does it with a slightly experimental angle with kind of a progressive angle to the point where maybe we're listening to like post New Age here take the obviously synth generated chorus vocals what sounds like a children's chorus on the track chrome County which has these very relaxing sweet instrumental swells but then as the song progresses Daniel grabs these synth generated chorus vocals and stretches them out samples them and just slows them down to the point where you're getting these digital noisy just hissy stretch marks Daniels music can be kind of seductive but it can also be very otherworldly and and kind of like you're in the midst of this odd weird cuckoo-land where nothing makes sense like how he finishes this track up with this really epic grand organ solo that sounds amazing really moving but then as soon as it comes up it's like he just kind of fades the track out and cuts it down and just lets the album close which is sort of how the first track on here ends as well which is another track that I like we have the song Americans on here which I feel like borrows from this cheesy sense of relaxation by incorporating these just very commercial sounding synthesizers that are also simultaneously dated and like these jungle sounds there are these fake synth horns all over the track too but then sort of thrown into this mix that I would normally cringe at are these very tightly composed like progressive synthesizer arpeggios that make the track feel really primal it's an interesting juxtaposition of ideas but then around the 1 minute and 30 second mark of this track this music just starts to melt away into these somewhat jittery sounds that are kind of unpredictable and popping up and snapping at me really quickly the track eventually turns to its original sound and then kind of cuts things off and I don't know I feel like I'm left wanting more at the end of this song and a lot of other songs here too but then again a lot of what Daniel is doing on this album and maybe this is kind of an issue I had with replicas as well a lot of what's here is so unorthodox whose really to say how long or how short it should be all I know is that there are some tracks on here that I feel are maybe just completely uninteresting because of how short they are songs like he-she or cryo which to me don't even ever really get started into something that I would want to return to they don't even really fade into the following tracks all that well so I it's hard for me to sort of see what they do for this album I find tracks on here like zebra the the six-minute highlight off this record so much more interesting with it's really jittery synthetic opening with all these skipping tones it's really quickly skipping all I know is the tracks like this seemed to me like this really odd little gadget or toy that I don't know what its purpose is but I could just stare at it and just kind of like move it click it this way and then this weird thing pops out and it's just puzzling and maybe this entire album itself could be sort of perceived in that light too but I guess that doesn't stop me from thinking that some of this album's tracks or functions are less exciting than others I'm a little all over the place with this album in terms of what songs I like what songs I don't and I seem to dislike some like others for completely different reasons because of how different these songs feel and tone in vibe and sound and I like that daniel has come together with a record that so many of the songs here come from totally different worlds and yet they all feel like they're a part of our +7 nothing on this album sticks out to me as like whoa this doesn't belong here or this just doesn't stick with the whole theme or this doesn't really I guess I just don't find the tracks the content within the theme and the aura in the world that he creates on this record to be entertaining from beginning to end much of the time they are which is why I guess I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition but if you've given this one o tricks play never record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana R + 7 the needle drop forever 
m9xyc2YatdA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a final update when i talk about a bunch of records that have recently made their way into my personal record collection alright let's get straight into these of course like in our first our first our last few vinyl videos this record has been sent to me by our sponsor eclectic the official online record store of the eclectic music society movement eclectic society movement you can check them out via a link in the description box you can find this record over there and more bauhaus Oh Lord yes in the flat field now this is some really raw dark gothic post-punk magic maybe for some people gothic would be kind of taking a step too far but still really dark tortured again raw post-punk stuff reissue this is a reissue brand new spankin new copy if you're into bands like hold on saying got to do this um if you're into bands like Joy Division but you have not checked out Bauhaus you need to reevaluate your life priorities just saying the first track on this record and and the second one as well will hit you is just being yeah dark in in the same vein that that Joy Division can be but much more aggressive fierce and man I'm trying to remember is is it marked on the back here somewhere yes no it's not anyway the vocals on this record are so like the back of my throat hurts listening to them at some points and and it's just an exciting record for me it's just a terribly seething lis shadowy record but with just like a lot of propulsion coming from the base coming from the drums again thank you eclectic for sending me sending this record my way going on and not editing because we're doing it raw this record also actually there are quite a few records kind of in this same vein coming up a lot of rock records this time actually pretty much rock records sort of staying in the gothic sort of dark vein this record actually comes from a record label from my neck of the woods they also double as a record store but this is a record that they have put out themselves recently female with a pH City silk if you like dark synthesizer backed again somewhat somewhat gothic and and and tortured and moody music I can't exactly call it pop because it's not particularly poppy but it's not exactly a rock record either it's just really experimental somewhat minimal since just really strange off-putting music kind of disembodied vocals somewhat deadpan emotionless a very stone-cold record this record is with a few songs on the back end that that sort of surprised like there's this one with an interesting sample and it's and it's really just a beat and just a funky little groove but still very eerie and very odd and the closing track on this LP is is a bit of a piano ballad a very depressing piano ballad but still for the most part this record does not deviate too far from that very dark synth aesthetic and if that's the kind of record you're into then this is the kind of record that you're gonna want to check out female cities silk next record I picked up brand-new repressing with little surprise for me at least Brian Eno Brian Eno this uh here come the warm Jets Brian you know here come the warm Jets Brian you know a lot of you know that I love Brian Eno and a lot of people know that Brian Eno put out ambient stuff and that's sort of what he's most popular for and doing a lot of production for bands that sort of sold way more copies than his solo music did but Brian Eno put out some fantastic art pop and art rock stuff prior to working on the ambient stuff and this is my favorite record in that sort of era of his music you know we have taking Tiger mountains by strategy which I showed you guys in the collection in an earlier video but but this actually to me is the record that is a little sweeter on the ears and it has me and needles and the camels I there's just some really good guitar leads and guitar riffs and vocal melodies too on this record though maybe they don't always show really instantaneously off of first listen because Brian Eno is on this record is really a maximalist and that he jumbles up a lot of his songs with with really strange sounds because he's really one of those guys that sort of uses the studio as an instrument and you know so while you do have these sweeter more melodic and catchy er sounds throughout his songs on this record am taking Tiger Mountain you also kind of have this element of just a lot of unorthodox sounds floating throughout his songs but if you're looking for some early art pop with a lot of character there's a lot of strangeness to it I love this little insert pata that comes with the record and also sort of a surprise for me that that was not listed on the record at all I didn't even know it's like a blood red pressing with splashes of black which is pretty nice yeah so there you go Frank you know here come the warm Jets first split them up first split second I had that mixed up with Tiger Tiger Mountain the title anyway alright next going back to the post-punk going back to the stayin with the art rock stayin with the experimental rock père ubu modern dance yeah I was just feeling a post-punk vibe when I went to the record store I'm telling you parrot ooh boo fantastic band some really fantastic early records I mean I feel like they still have a lot of character in their newer stuff though I'm not as big of a fan of it but Dave Thomas one of the most eccentric vocalists in underground rock music ever like a guy who when you hear him you just there's no other person you could possibly mistake it for and if you're into post-punk music but you also like something with a strong rock and roll edge because para boos rips peri boos guitar parts and drum parts do keep very close to that rock and roll tradition but of course you know Dave's vocals over a lot of these tracks are just exciting and just electrifying is really the only way that uh I could I can put it and I haven't seen any markings on this record noting that it was repressed or anything like that and it certainly smells old and from the record sleeve and the label as well looks pretty old I mean I'm only seeing 1978 on here from which I understand is when it was originally printed and if something is repressed it's usually marked on the record somewhere and I've been kind of looking for looking for that and I certainly did you know pay for it to the point where I okay this has got to be a an original pressing and I sort of got that same deal with Mission of Burma looks like an original pressing of verses more post-punk love mission of Burma's early stuff love this records love signals calls and marches one of my favorite rock records ever and happy to get a pressing of it you know on the original record label printed in Boston made in Boston says right there if there's one song that you should check out off of this record look up Myka look up trem - that's another song and look up that's how I escaped my certain fate Mission of Burma versus again one of my favorite rock records on my favorite post-punk records still going really quick repressing but I mean you know that's that's because it's it's sort of it is just a repressing in general I mean you know these guys didn't really have that great of a start to their career because they refused to change their name so they say so is a sort of word around the campfire death for the whole world to see some really just hard-hitting rock-and-roll on this record Dan I mean there's no other way to put it there's no other way to see it if I mean a lot of people made a big deal this record when Drag City put it out and was like whoa this lost proto punk rock band with some really great songs like politicians in my eyes is one of my favorite songs off this record I mean everybody knows the keep on knockin but uh again really amazing that uh that Drag City sort of came across this record and took it upon themselves to put this album out or just you know put this song collection out and while I have already heard this record and I've been familiar with the song since Drag City did this reissue I saw the record now I was like you know what a lot of the songs on the record are freakin good and I just had to just had to grab it give it a listen put it in the collection because it deserves to be there all right something a bit more freakin y'all are you already know I have volume one this is volume 3 volume 2 is on the way Tonetta 777 hmm like I said I have volume 2 on the way I have volume 1 so and I'll have three volumes together like one big happy sexually disgruntled family so Tonetta third volume on black 10th press double CD thing here although from what I see the track listing on the back of the record is not synced in with the track listing that's actually on the album's themselves but I'm yet to sort of pop these CDs and so I don't know if it'll sync up with the CDs but um really good kind of last hurrah for Tonetta on this label because I don't think he's putting out music with them anymore because he just he just heard they did with all out putting out as many decent songs of his as they possibly could pressures own his biggest song Saddam yummy yummy pizza and glory hole which is one of my favourite Tonetta songs which I didn't know was on this record because on YouTube it's titled as small  big heart so again if you give that song and listen it's it's hilarious so yeah again some of my favourite Tonetta songs on here Obama's prize which i think is one of those poppier tracks with a sweet little keyboard in there and of course you know some some duds as well with how prolific he is and how much stuff he puts on here but I think this is actually a little more consistent than a volume one this double LP and heavy pressings - they did heavy pressings on this for something that is so low fie and rough around the edges but yeah number 357 of 500 so it says on here Tonetta 777 vol 3 that poor vinyl and this is gonna be our last record over here wipers youth of America new issue of this album on excuse me let's see jackpot records and zeno looks like a 2007 repressing um I know the I usually just put stuff in here that I'm buying that I like decided to buy this record on a whim because I had sort of heard about it but hadn't heard it and a lot of people sort of freaking out about it you know and recommending it to me because I like post-punk music an experimental rock so much however I can't really say at least for me it lived up to the hype very simple packaging on this record I mean roughly on this record you have pretty much six tracks the last of which is the title track and is the longest on the entire LP ten minutes long and while this record does have some great characteristics with experimental rock with post-punk I mean it and and art punk I think uh the recording was just really often and just really to rough around the edges and kind of kept the album from feeling more fantastic than it possibly could and I think that was also just a lack of great performances and songwriting like the opening track on here taking too long lyrically melodically riff rye riff wise as well incredibly underwhelming and it's not that interesting and I think the album continues down that road actually until when it's over which is probably the most interesting chord progression this album has to offer and I think most punk music or most punk influenced music has to offer it was sort of striking how you know sort of uninteresting a lot of the compositions on these tracks were and then to sort of hit me with this chord progression and this melody is really eerie dark melody that was really complex and constantly building and just really intense was great and then I actually think the final two tracks on the b-side were pretty interesting to know fair melodically is a little more interesting some of the other tracks on here and then the 10-minute long title track while it does start off like many other songs on here it does finish off in this really kind of kraut rocky in psychedelic very repetitive and minimal sort of way that is really strange and and sort of makes me want to return to this record again just to see if it'll actually grow on me but as of right now initial listens to this record not so crazy about it but yeah those are all pretty much all of the additions that have been made to the record collection in this vinyl video and that's it cool transition and that's it if you've given any of these records a listen what did you think of them love them hate them why also thanks again to our sponsor for this video eclectic and you have some more vinyl videos in this end slate here that you can watch as well and in the description find a playlist of all of my vinyl collection videos and you can just kind of peruse alphabetically up to the point at which I start just introducing new stuff my record collection cool cool Anthony fan tanto vinyl forever 
0sHytIgfhnU,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick little review of the new Mazzy Star album seasons of your day these guys are a West Coast rock band I would consider listening to them if you think of yourself as a big fan of Dream pop and they're maybe considering how many reverb Laden and and buzzy guitar-driven pop rock bands there are out there these days also you have to kind of consider the success of bands like Beach House as well with the potential of people liking Mazzy Star today because beach houses earliest stuff was incredibly indebted to what Mazzy stars music was now this is Mazzy stars first album in 17 years and in the meantime between these album releases key members hopes and of all and David robach we're working on other musical projects however I would hardly call their time away from putting out Mazzy Star Records prolific now a lot like the last My Bloody Valentine record some of you may already know that I dug that album this Mazzy Star album consists of material that was recorded between this huge hiatus so it should be no surprise that on this record Mazzy Star sounds exactly like how you remember them the instrumentation on these songs has tons of space they're played at a slow pace the melodies are shy the percussion is sparse hope Sandoval's vocals still sound as fantastic as they ever have they still have their main characteristics in that they feel a little aged dusty a lot of people would say smoky but simultaneously they are very light breezy and and youthful very young the guitars of course are slow-paced as well splashed with reverb the acoustic guitars yes but especially the electric guitars both of which have a slight country twang to them too sonically Mazzy Star has not changed a bit and it's kind of weird because I can't help but think of this band as well because they just came out with their first album in 17 years to the UK melodic death metal band carcass both bands have her with new records that are literally so close in sound to their most celebrated stuff you really kind of have to squint to see the difference both our albums that I like but neither our albums that I really feel like returning to at the end of the day honestly there are tracks on this new album of Mazzy stars like spoon and flying low that that to me are showing just how little direction the songwriting on this album can have at points to me these tracks just meander they don't really stay engaging from beginning to end and it's not like Mazzy Star hasn't written tracks that are this long before and there are other tracks on here that though they may be shorter they feel similarly stagnant in in how the songs progress like California or does someone have your baby now which is a track that to me exchanges the idea of putting together a direct song for this really incessant twangy slide acoustic guitar that just doesn't stay that interesting for the duration of the track there are other songs on here that instrumentally I think are a little more fleshed out something I could sink my teeth into a little bit more and also have a somewhat seductive country style to them songs like I've got to stop and lay myself down both of which yes our country but have a very kind of painful emotion coming from the melodies and the lyrics and are really so good that it's worth checking out the album just for these songs too yes enjoy these songs themselves but even see if the entire album appeals to you a little bit more than it did me and there are other spots to me where the instrumentation stands out like the very cutesy keyboards toward the end of the song Sparrow which I thought were very pretty and then there is the track common burn which I think to a very very slight degree hopes vocals come off a little more bright a little more bold then they are on other tracks here especially the softer sort of more deadpan vocals where I am getting a bit of a Velvet Underground influence which of course in Mazzy stars older stuff it's it's always been there again it's a pretty good album it sounds like and above all it's it's precious but is an album that I feel like I put above anything Mazzy Star has done in the past not particularly if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next that's it thank you for watching Anthony Fantana Mazzy Star 
XSyXBGObJBw,my needle drops what's up how's it going Joel good video-response thank you for trying to address my issues my questions and also before we get into this video can we all just appreciate that Joel was right about there being another miley shocker between now and the release of her new album good job Joel alright so right now you seem to have this issue about pop music and and maybe even indie music to becoming more homogeneous because everybody is prolifically pumping out all of these albums without any downtime between the album's to kind of progress their sound evolve their sound think about where they want to move next however I think there are just as many or maybe even more refer examples of artists releasing some of their best music in this really quick succession and still having an incredible impact on the world of music at large now given these bands didn't really release music good music great music for the long term but I think you could say that right now Bob Dylan for example with there being so much more space between his albums these days it wasn't any more inspired than the stuff he was releasing in the 60s and you have a band like Rush as well who it seems that these days they're they're allowing more space in between their album releases than they ever have but it's taken them up until I think the point of last year to actually put out an LP that some fans would agree is is just as pleasing as some of their old stuff the fact of the matter is is that there are plenty of artists out there who have contributed greatly to the culture of music to the world of music whether it be underground or popular or mainstream whatever and they sort of put out music really fast they crashed they burn and they left pretty little discographies that we all worship to this day and there are examples out there of artists who are bolder than your average pop star much bolder and being incredibly prolific is kind of their MO and honestly even though there are a lot of artists out there who are constantly putting out music I don't think the art of simmering has completely disappeared artists like PJ Harvey Tom Waits beach house Animal Collective Arcade Fire deer hunter and of Montreal to have all left a decent amount of space in between the record ordered I don't really think it's all coming down to space between albums or summertime but whether or not the artist in question is willing to challenge themselves with every release it may take an artist a little bit longer to challenge themselves and kind of push themselves to that next plateau it may take two to three years for some it may not my question to you is if creativity and music is going to continue to exist and there's going to be bold music somewhere in the future is that boldness going to be coming from the underground and I know there are chart toppers out there who make some fantastic music I just think that the underground is really where interesting music is at right now let me know you think Joel Anthony Fantana the questions this is conversation reflections Fred 
FRHf92JDVSQ,ah hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new to che amore amore album is surviving by these guys are a rock outfit this is their third full-length album and sonically they're sort of purveying sounds from the worlds of post-hardcore screamo with very strong lyrical narratives as well as maybe a little melodic hardcore their last album parting the sea between brightness and me I didn't enjoy quite a bit I thought there were some strong tracks on there but maybe I had some issues with a little bit of the the melodrama maybe I thought that the instrumentals weren't so diverse but to just kind of get straight into the point with this review I'm actually finding a little bit more to like on this new album of theirs now at their core on this record Touche is still the same kind of band that you've known them to be for the last two albums kind of still hanging in the same stylistic realms you've got that punk ferocity and aggression coming from the speed and just the intensity with which the instrumentation is played you've got incredibly emotional lyrics that are just delivered in this really dramatic over-the-top and of course screamed way they read more like a story if you get them down onto a piece of paper and they're delivered in a way that feels more like spoken word than anything of course the guitars on this album are written to be really melodic and captivating very anthemic and to me this record feels like these guys are starting to step toward making music in this style that is sort of big and bold by asking some bigger questions in the lyrics and by writing tracks that feel a little more multifaceted the first two tracks that kick this album off are pretty interconnected segwaying musically toward the beginning and end of the songs and they're really moving they're passionate and this album opens up with just exists a question sort of asking what do you want to be remembered for what's your legacy going to be do you want to have a legacy but ultimately the song in really sad way is kind of self-defeating realizing that there's so much in life to consider and worry about and just sort of wrack your brain over on top of it I have to swallow this concept of mortality and that my death will eventually come how can I even worry about how I'm going to be remembered after it the ending lyric I'm this track is fantastic too I'll just bow my head and leave out the back the next track on here kind of continues with that theme of Fame and success and legacy by talking about the humble beginnings of the band and now they're sort of here at their third album the question of whether or not it will be a success is kind of brought to the table and it's interesting to hear not only this band but a band in this style of music get so meta with what they do and how they feel about what they do and what the future is in it for them you get some lyrics on this track talking about not wanting to pretend to be passionate not wanting to pretend to be putting these feelings forward going further down that road talking about how putting everything that ails you out there for everyone to see and sort of take in and and obsess over gives you a pretty penny whether or not that is stated with a tongue-in-cheek is for you to decide I think but there's a lyric on this track talking about how they capitalize on your blood and I'm not really sure who they are but they're obviously referencing money being made off of what the band does so I'm guessing what labels record factories just record stores venues people who booked the next two tracks on this LP seem to be interconnected to musically thematically title wise to praise slash love anyone slash anything and it continues to deliver lyrics that talk about being admired and sort of looked at under this microscope that comes with the fame of being a very notable band in this Miche of a genre and of course we are delivered more anthemic guitars that are just pounding and just blood pumping and so life-affirming that appear around the 30-second mark on this track that get me really freaking excited and I feel like there is this refrain on the song that really sort of States toward the end of the ACK what this entertainer entertained relationship is like I don't owe you anything you don't owe me anything you're enjoying our music you're buying our music it doesn't really function beyond that we get more really climactic guitars especially toward the end of the track DNA and then lyrically we are delivered this story just about being connected to this person who is your father and kind of seeing his personality and his quirks kind of play out in you and there's this powerful lyric toward the end of this track that I think really kind of sums this up not only the the fact that you know the things that your parents are a lot of the time are in you genetically but there's also this desire to kind of evolve past that and break beyond that it is this is what I need to bury the years of debris to break the cycles of the cycles and stop living vicariously and start living for me it's intensely heavy thoughts like this that are packed into such short songs on this album this LP stands at a kind of average teetering on brief 30 minutes and yet we've got so much food for thought and we're not even really at the halfway point of the LP yet and the lyricism doesn't really lose steam into the second half of this LP either especially since you have tracks on here like Blue Angels which kind of addresses the issue of having these personal problems and then dealing with them trying to escape from them via substance abuse however even though there are many instrumental bits on this album that I'm really impressed with like the crushing guitars on the end of the track Harbor and I really like a lot of the musical segues that kind of link one track to another on this album making the whole LP seem really seamless and just together and holistic I guess there are downsides on here that I'm seeing because I'm not really that into what the band might be doing instrumentally like the song social caterpillar which isn't a bad tune but has this ending that lasts an entire minute where you've just got these trudging chords that I think are shooting for something epic but they just end feeling a little underwhelming then there is nonfiction which starts off as one of the quieter and more somber and just kind of chilled out tracks on the album with these Spacey very melancholy and twangy guitar leads that feel like they are totally akin just dead ringers for some early Modest Mouse stuff and as the guitars build and get more intense as the song continues on it just kind of feels like a little bit of post-rock a little bit of okay post rock and while I did like the track steps the really clean vocals that kind of hang in the background toward the end of the track didn't really do anything for me they really felt a little too clean and flat and robotic in comparison with the really intense vocals that were getting for the duration of this album this help II did end really strong though with the track is survived by which really is kind of the answer to the beginning of the album and this question or at least somewhat of an answer or a bit of a response to the question of legacy and Fame and momentum in a way we're kind of starting this album off worried and and sort of not knowing what the future holds and then it feels like this album ends off knowing that the answer in a way is music saying that sing a song that people will sing along to that way when you're gone they'll never forget you it feels really triumphant it feels again just like another amazingly life firming moment that's album holds overall not a bad album there are some tracks that in my opinion pale in comparison to others and on top of it I do think that there is more room for ambition in to shame more songwriting process but I was pretty impressed by the themes that they dealt out on this album and how just passionately they stuck to them if screamo is your drug of choice if just wordy rock is your drug of choice if melodic but intense punk music is your drug of choice then there is no reason that this shouldn't be a highlight for you this year I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing huh but if you've given this to shame or album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it i what do you think i should review next and that's it anthony Fantan oh oh and also new maker music music video review episode just click on my face anthony Fantana is survived by Touche Touche Touche forever 
nk-QWzy6ihQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and when some people are faced with a difficult task they turn to I don't know substances they drink they smoke or just indulge in some other kind of stress reliever but I have always wholeheartedly believed in the power of prayer our Lord who art in the trap' Paulo News I hate my easel come I usually don't get and the block because it is on the street and three is forgive us and letting it all as we forgive those who let it go all game against us give us the sake and were feeling down down and deliver us from the cocaine castle ASAP point in work and now that my soul feels cleanse let's review the new Drake album nothing was the same Drake is a Toronto rapper singer and songwriter and this is his third full-length commercial album though there were some tracks on his earlier mixtapes that I dug I couldn't really stand much of the songs on his debut album to be completely honest however since then when he went on to his sophomore album I think he kind of cleared the air of a little bit of the melodrama that I think surrounded his tracks and maybe liven up the emotions a bit to the point where they felt tangible and real and maybe something that I could actually sympathize with on top of that I think he cleaned up his singing a little bit and I think his sophomore LP that I reviewed a few years ago was instrumentally ambitious as well featuring a lot of atmospheric sounds and textures something that kind of reminded me a lot of the weekend and artists that Dre collaborated with on that album as well and a person I'm sure was influencing him a lot at the time instrumentally and and emotionally it just seemed like he was headed into territory that was a lot more introspective sad and emotional than most rappers are willing to go and what has Drake received so far for all of this sort of emotion trailblazing that he's done on all of his albums well a very polarizing reception in the hip-hop community with each Drake release I find it harder and harder to pick a side on the sort of love or hate bandwagon you could really love and appreciate Drake's music but then that kind of means accepting really how sappy it is sometimes not only that but sometimes I feel like Drake is being just as sneaky bitter and manipulative as the worst boy or girl friend you've ever had with his intentions behind writing some of these heartbroken or lovestruck songs on the opposite end of the spectrum you have haters who very shallowly bust on him and make fun of him for not living up to the incredibly masculine image that is sort of a standard in hip-hop music while there are some Drake songs that I don't really enjoy at all I do kind of see the music he's been making and sort of his place and hip-hop is being kind of necessary to this sea change that's going on right now having to do with how rappers should dress and act and how emotional they can be and another thing you can kind of take seriously with Drake is when he's rapping about his status and then what he's doing right now in his career because he is kind of financially and record sales wise at the top of his game but Drake is a guy that seems simultaneously really connected to his own personal life and is great at telling you stories about it and and really painting a vivid picture however he has a hard time connecting his life and what's happening in it to the outside world in a way that doesn't make you cringe take the track started from the bottom on this LP one of the tracks that dropped early from this album now after this track dropped a lot of people actually doubted the drake started from the bottom given his suburban upbringing and the fact that he was an actor on Degrassi and while I doubt that Drake was swimming in gold like Scrooge McDuck I still don't really see that as starting from the bottom plus I feel like in this same track Drake uses borrowing his uncle's car as proof that he struggled or had a hard time or started with little to nothing honestly Drake just needs to leave the struggle angle alone because he does so many other things well when it comes to talking about your past life there are other rappers that have grittier harder more awe-inspiring stories but it's not really the background of this track that's so kind of offensive and somewhat underwhelming it's really the chorus and the bars and the beat to the instrumental on this thing is trap influenced maybe a little bit of Club groove to the kick drums and it is just so bare-bones and uninteresting you've got these half-hearted courses that are apathetically recited verses that feature bars that are just incredibly unquote able and even when drake slips into the chorus on this track there's not even really a significant alteration in the instrumental it's just really an effortless song for Drake in my opinion even his flow on this track seems incredibly half-assed he's spitting at speed and a pace on this song that makes ASAP rocky look like Twista and while I didn't really think this track was terrible when it initially dropped listening to it in the context of all the songs on this album it just kind of seems like a forgettable footnote and the thing is this is usually the number one problem with all of Drake's records for every one worthwhile song or single he makes he also produces an awful one and a forgettable one however I think that Drake can continue to dominate the mainstream as long as he still releases some hot singles that are worthwhile and infectious on his albums however I don't really think that happens here on Drake's last LP you add Marvin's room you had headlines you had the bonus track the motto which were all just quote City Yolo but the singles on the cell pier just lackluster I mean all me with 2 Chainz a bonus track on here is just not that interesting you have 5 a.m. in Toronto which wasn't bad but does not appear on here at all not even as a bonus track and then you have hold on we're going home which is like this smooth synthetic grooving R&B pop tune that seems pretty nice feels like a combination of some old-school Michael Jackson combined with like ma it's got a great beat a sweet melody as well as a lot of themes of loving and commitment in the lyrics but at the end of the day I feel like the song is just lost potential lyrically Drake is incredibly sparse again we have another half-hearted chorus where the instrumental doesn't even change up or explode or create any kind of sensation of excitement that would make this song worth repeating and then you have lyrics on here that just make me like you're a good girl and you know it I know exactly who you could be it's like he's trying to get into the head of this girl telling her you know you should be this you could be that wouldn't it be so much nicer with the promise of affection and acceptance coming afterward thankfully there are some deeper cuts on this album that are actually enjoyable and show promise the opener on here Tuscan leather is a pretty nice start to the album there's some trap beats in this instrumental as well as some very chipmunks soulful vocals and there's some interesting beat changes on this thing too from the trap instrumental you go to this boom bap groove and then to some very beautiful synthesizers on the tail end of this thing lyrically Drake is aggressive he's convincing he's passionate he's great at painting a vivid picture of his life in a close proximity that's really when he's at his best but I feel like maybe he makes an overstep a little bit when he asks the listener ten years from now we'll see who's here and while I kind of wonder if Drake is going to be around still being as successful as he is ten years from now I potentially look forward to such a thing because at least I know I'm dealing with a guy who kind of has the long-term in mind and is willing to change with the times in order to continue making music that will entertain people the next track on here furthest thing another song on here that I think is worthwhile Drake kind of does that rap singing dichotomy that Drake fans love to love and Drake haters love to hate of course the lyrics are an ode to a relationship in ode to love and oh - Drake's lack of perfection and getting back together all tropes and themes we've heard from Drake before just kind of peppered in are some newer sort of updates about what Drake is doing now I really love the very hard-hitting beat change toward the last third of this track really captivating and Drake sounds great drops a killer verse - honestly I love listening to Drake when he comes through with those triumphant moments like you know he's at the top of the podium he's got the trophy high above his head yeah but still even in those moments Drizzy drops lines that make me dizzy because my eyes are constantly rolling like when he puts on his tough face and threatens other rappers with violence via his bodyguard after this we have the track we tank forever which kind of takes the same angle as girls like Beyonce where Drake basically NAB's a lyric or reference or a chorus from another popular artist titles the track after them and then hope that the provocative reference or title will get people to check this track out and buzz about it on the Internet and of course this song is not really about whoo tang at all it's about a relationship again we have another sparse very atmospheric instrumental here that doesn't come off that strong melodically just a lot of ethereal tones along with Drake rapping and singing and I feel like on this song again Drake favors sudden beat changes and just sparseness and and vastness and wandering this over just delivering a concise catchy memorable song you have this whoo tang sample in this whoo tang chorus being repeated and carried through on to the next track own it the song actually kind of feels like an extension of this track wu-tang forever and I got to say that these two tracks while they're not anything terrible they're not anything exciting either I can't really say anything that Drake is doing on these songs is offensive because a lot of it is stuff we've come to expect at this point it's not even annoying anymore it's just boring the only difference here is that Drake is rapping over slightly different production on this album and I have no idea what brought the instrumentals shift that nothing was the same features Drake is all over some incredibly nutty trap beats that are just not flattering for him at all and I know Drake has hopped onto stuff that features some trap influence before take the track headlines for example but those songs at least had some kind of pop sensibility to them take this on worse behavior for example terrible track really awful just like nails on a chalkboard instrumental and drakes bars are just weak as hell and his flow is just not that memorable either the only standout part of the track was the mini mace ripoff on the third verse we're just lying four line is just kind of referencing maces to see then there's the track the language which essentially kind of sounds like a future song sans the auto-tune and the lyrics on here get even more ridiculous with going platinum I look at my wrist and it's already platinum he really kind of pulled one from the Trinidad James lyric book on that one early on in his career when Drake was getting hot and sort of really building a buzz for himself he seemed new he seemed refreshing he seemed versatile he seemed kind of unpredictable like you just didn't know where this guy was going to go he was so successful at riding in this lane that he kind of carved out for himself but there was sort of this assumption in this belief among fans and critics that you know he could really go anywhere from here and I think what nothing was the same highlights exactly is that Drake really can't go anywhere from here not unless he does some soul-searching and a major overhaul of his sound and style because the tracks on here the sound the best are the ones that feel like well this is the kind of Drake that we've come to know and love like the track from time which has another spacious instrumental and some beautiful pianos beautiful vocals from Gina and the track is essentially Drake kind of sitting down and having a heart-to-heart with his parents talking about this rocky relationship that he's in the midst of right now and debating whether or not he should get back with this person chase her down it's just a really heartfelt and tasteful take on this relationship orientation Drake songs usually take then there's the song too much with Sam feh which is another beautiful track now I know there are a lot of moments on here that I'd mentioned that I didn't like but I got to say the worst track hands down on this album 305 my city I would actually put it in the running for the top five worst Drake songs ever the beat is so out there and experimental that it feels like it would be more fitting for an artist like little ugly mad I'm not pronouncing it like that shut up you've got this auto-tune are be vocal some reversed eerie tones that are sampled throughout this thing - chopped and screwed vocals trap hi-hats it just feels a lot like yeezus actually an incredibly unrewarding experiment and the Finnish are on here pound cake with jay-z we have just another atmospheric instrumental that all of them really blend together by the end of this album to be completely honest and it just feels like it fits in with the trend of the rest of this LP it is just not trying that hard even jay-z isn't trying that hard there are some decent bars in his verses but it feels like sometimes just like on Magna Carta Holy Grail he just tosses a bunch of crappy filler in there by repeating Kate Kate Kate Kate Kate whereas you know a younger JZ would have stopped and said hey you know what all that space we're wasting right here might want to say something interesting there overall gotta say this album a lot less interesting a lot less entertaining than take care take care even though I didn't love the LP it left me excited and looking forward to where Drake would go next and this album has me in the exact opposite realm it's not an awful album but it's filled with potholes and just boring moments and while I think Drake is is a worthwhile lyricist when it comes to just painting a picture of a tattered romance I feel like he preoccupies himself way way way too much with trying to be something more than that or appeal to rappers or appeal to hip-hop heads in a way that is more aggressive so they take him seriously in kind of a masculine light take the constant wu-tang references throughout this album while I'm sure that Drake likes some mood tang while I know that he appreciates at least some underground hip-hop I don't really see him making these references interestingly or tastefully it just seems like Drake's insecurity is driving him to make all of these experimental tracks all of these more aggressive tracks where he just constantly sounds silly I'm feeling a light five on this album transition but if you've given this Drake album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it I what do you think I should review next and that's it Drake nothing was the same forever 
PVvK_xMD8n0,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Bill Callahan album dream river bill Callahan is a singer-songwriter who underwent a pretty interesting musical evolution throughout the 80's 90's and 2000's under the singing songwriting pseudonym smog it was singer-songwriter music but with kind of a strange experimental edge in the later years of smog in the late 90s and 2000's things kind of smoothed out mellowed out a little bit really bill callahan was singing in a completely different way the songs the melody is the instrumentation it was all a bit more melancholy and it seemed like bill was embracing some sounds coming from the worlds of all country and Americana a little bit more maybe getting into some classic Neil Young albums stuff like that an influence that definitely shows up on this new LP as well Smaug dropped its last studio album in 2005 with Bill Callahan kind of switching to releasing music under his government name after that and since then bill has been releasing some very enjoyable albums like the LP the sophomore LP under his name sometimes I wish I were in Eagle album that featured a lot of very slow-moving folk instrumentation with Bill's very low soothing voice gracing it and emotionally bill comes off sometimes very urgent or sad but for the most part very very relaxing lyrically telling a lot of esoteric tales that to understand them you really have to be paying close attention and dive into them a little bit these were good things these were interesting moves but maybe there was such a thing as too much of a good thing when Bill Callahan came out with his next full-length LP apocalypse maybe it was a little too slow-moving to me maybe it was a little too uneventful to me maybe the stories were just a little too obscure for me to latch on to now bill Callahans new LP dream river walks down or really floats down that same gentle tranquil stream with more direct lyrics and more engaging instrumental performances I would actually say that in comparison with Apocalypse and maybe even sometimes I the instrumentation here relatively is kind of lively I feel like the album actually kicks off on a really engaging note with some really rustic electric and acoustic guitars stacked up with some beautiful fiddle embellishments and some shuffling drums all of which are beautifully played recorded and mixed there are even moments on this track and on this album in general where the instrumentation just kind of moves in this really live-in-the-moment way where it's all kind of digging into the groove really hard together toward the instrumental break in the middle of this opening track this actually happens and it really picks up the track for me and lyrically bill seems to be singing about this very relaxed moment of solitary drunkenness where he is singing about just kind of blankly staring at the carpet and chairs at this hotel bar people who are coming into the bar and hanging around unknowingly are sort of spending time with him keeping him company just by being in the same vicinity bill even goes further to say that the only two things he said that day were beer and thank you it's a kind of funny self-aware and maybe slightly self-deprecating track and bill vocally just sort of tumbles through this song and many on here with this very warbly baritone on the surface Bill's singing especially on this album with all of the you know sort of very obvious Americana instrumentation feels very mundane and kind of dusty but I feel like as I listen to this album more and more and and maybe as you do too if you give this thing a listen there's something also very warm and welcoming and inviting and just so sweet beautiful and and relaxing about the singing that bill continues to bring to the table and at least for me that is the sentiment that prevails on Dream River especially on the track small plane where again we have an instrumental and we have a story and we have a vocal that is incredibly soothing we have these very gentle interjections of electric guitar playing over these slow-moving guitar arpeggios and percussion lyrically bill kind of puts himself into the cockpit of a plane and talks about learning about flying early on in the track with someone teaching him and I'm not really sure what the relationship with this person is but to me at least it feels like there's a lot of love there maybe not a romantic love it's it's just the kind of love that feels like it's been there for a very long time or at least some kind of appreciation or some kind of long lasting relationship or a Queen's ship to the point where it doesn't need to be blatantly mentioned or talked about it just feels like it's there really this track focuses on on the journey in an odd way being in this plane learning to fly this plane going home in this plane lifting off landing having control losing control other people having control of you it's it's an interesting set of ideas thrown together in the lyrics here things that really make me just get a little emotional and kind of reflect a bit the issue with this song maybe a few others on here is that it feels like they end a little abruptly and and maybe that's because bill doesn't really write clear concise endings to some of these tracks because a lot of them wander a bit they meander a bit they kind of go where they pleased when they please and just kind of follow the narrative of bill's lyrics and while that's not necessarily a terrible thing it leads to these songs being either very linear or having slightly adventurous song structures it does leave me wanting more from some of these tracks because it feels like they've ventured out so far why and them here meanwhile there are other tracks on here that instrumentally aren't bad like ride my arrow and seagull but are maybe not as structurally built up and are just like kind of repetitive a bit and while again I feel like lyrically and in vocally Bill Callahan does step up to the plate and deliver something interesting I guess I wish the instrumentation was a little more engaging throughout maybe these moments remind me of some of the more underwhelming moments from Bill's last album but they're few and far between bill actually brings some instrumental diversity to this album and some heat I think with some really nice solos especially on the track javelin on landing the instrumental diversity carries on with the tracks spring which has some watery guitar effects on the rhythm guitar they're playing this riff that feels a little old-school little classic rock influenced and lyrically bill is kind of diving into this narrative into this poetry into this story about the changing of the seasons kind of being in the midst of this transition period between seasons in spring when it looks like just hell has frozen over and the skies are gray and everything is just dead and it's funny because on Bill's last LP he seemed to be so infatuated and so impressed with the beauty of nature and so many natural things and now he's saying everything is iying and tired of praise mountains don't need my accolades but maybe the most chilling track on this entire LP is summer painter something I think features some of bills most interesting introspective and and wonderful lyrics yet singing about how he would paint boats paint words on boats kind of comparing himself to a beaver that builds dams like something that just does this work mindlessly suddenly it just does this work because there's nothing else to do but also using these beavers as a metaphor to kind of block himself into this work like he's not changing his life he's not going anywhere he's not trying to do anything other than just this kind of work and as bill is singing a lot of these lyrics he's reaching into his upper register which he doesn't do too often and is sounding really nice and and very passionate and convincing doing so and then it seems that a hurricane rips through this area and even though there is more work than ever to do he kind of turns around and just abandons this life saying that I guess my rainy day came now again I love that bill reached up in that upper register of his voice I mean yeah it's it's it's not that high comparatively with with other singers but this shows up again on the final track on this LP - which is a really passionate closure it feels like a really warm goodbye even though there is imagery of winter in the air of coldness in here it's difficult to put into words but there's just a real sense of finish to the warmth and beauty of the melody on this track especially with the ascending harmonized car leads that sounds so pretty especially as bill is reaching up into that upper register of his overall the this is a really solid album for Bill I do enjoy it more than his last one and lyrically instrumentally I really got sucked into it all over this album there's just wonderfully played dry instrumentation really intimate setting and aesthetic really intricate interplay the poetic lyrics on the cell P the tender sweet emotions I know that as someone who reviews music and people who are huge fans of music it's really important to kind of stay current stay on top of trends stay in to what's hot what's creative what's fresh what's new but also every once in a while it's it's great to kind of stop smell the flowers and listen to something that is written and recorded really well and is grounded in in in in in a long-standing tradition because there's just something that is so human about what Bill is doing on this record you could feel the blood pumping through these songs my only real issues is that I find a few tracks to be kind of underwhelming and overall I wish the album was a little bit longer maybe either with a track or two or maybe taking some of those shorter songs that I think ended a bit abruptly or sort of making them a bit longer themselves feeling a light a decent eight on this thing transition but if you've given this album but listen why did you think it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantan Oh Bill Callahan dream River forever 
jZUq4bsM2VY,hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Flatbush zombies album better off dead Flatbush zombies are a new york hip hop trio consisting of Michi Darko zombie juice and Eric Ark Elliott I first heard of these guys not too long ago when they put out a mixtape titled drugs and honestly the tape didn't really stop me in my tracks enough to sort of make me want to review it so I figured I would kind of sit down and give a hard listen to this new project of theirs especially since they seem to be gaining more momentum behind this new one some of their biggest tracks so far have come off of this mixtape palm-trees Mraz and 222 plus the trio has been continuing to develop their sound and have been stretching out into different modern hip hop styles now a lot of you may be conscious of this new underground hip hop movement going on in New York right now beast coast you've got acts associated with this thing like pro era underachievers and of course Flatbush zombies and thus far Flatbush has kind of been the underdog in this movement I feel however at least artistically I think Flatbush zombies kind of come out ahead with this new project better off dead delivers a series of songs that are some of the boldest grimy as' in-your-face hip-hop that you're going to hear out of New York this year and even though this project stands pretty long at 19 tracks I think it's at least somewhat diverse diverse enough to want to listen to the entire thing on most fronts this project impresses 4:1 the production Eric Ark Elliott is a very sharp producer sharper than I've actually heard him on even his solo stuff with the opening track on here I love the way the heavy rock guitars the crushing drum fill the operatic vocal cut and the pluck strings come together and you know we have four sounds here that that seemingly come from different worlds but they come together to make a really ear grabbing intro you've got tracks on here like death and Nephilim and God bless the dead that all have kind of an atmospheric Spacey and somewhat psychedelic vibe something I think fans of the utter achievers would enjoy and there are other tracks on here that go that direction as well like palm trees and 222 but those songs are much more serene by comparison with their instrumentals especially palm trees which has these beautiful cooing vocals that are sampled and played throughout the track you've got boom bap cuts on here like club soda which is this really classy instrumental with these soaring vocals and a nice bounce to the groove the instrumental and regular and complex goes for this vibe as well also mindfuck which has a pretty nice sample coming from the Luis Enriquez back a lot of track prelude do which is a sample I had to look up listening to this mixtape because I remember hearing a sample of that song as well on a nonfiction track which is pretty awesome because I'm sure there's got to be a connection there because I read the zombie juice was influenced by ill bill there's the track Thugnificent on here which has this slow druggie auto-tune chorus it's not a terrible track I feel like the vocals were kind of annoying and we're sitting too well with me at first but as I trip through the tape more and more and more it kind of grew on me a little bit then there's the song live from Hell which is one of the few tracks on here that's produced by another person Harry fraud and the beat on this thing is absolutely killer like a trap nightmare really eerie synths and psychedelic trippy acid soaked guitar solos throughout this thing the only instrumental and chorus on here that I think is even more nightmarish is the song drug parade which maybe is one of the few moments where I think Flatbush zombies are so eccentric and so in-your-face that it gets a little obnoxious bolli the instrumentals on this album are a lot of things they're aggressive they're grimy they could be smooth and sweet and kind of chilled out and druggie they could be chilling an eerie and psychotic and unnerving as well but above all even when Flatbush zombies do something instrumentally that feels like it's a bit of a trip backwards they do a great job of keeping with the New York hardcore hip-hop tradition of being reckless witty gritty and Quaeda rebellious now as far as flow and lyrics go on this album Eric zombie juice and Meech all rap on this LP and they've all got kind of their own vocal style as well so it's not like you're hearing one MC after another and you really can't tell who is who in fact I think a few these guys actually have voices that were just made for rap like the genre was invented decades ago jest so that in the future we could hear a guy like me Chi Darko on the mic the dude has this gruff low baritone which sometimes he's not so rough with it sometimes he reaches into a mid-range which feels really smooth really natural but most of the time when you hear this guy's voice it's gonna be zany and remind you of a ton of different people just kind of mashed up together into this bloody pile of MC corpses there are moments when I hear his voice and I think a little bit of ol Dirty Bastard or maybe a member - of Onyx or Busta Rhymes and oddly enough I came from the Ying Yang Twins there are quite a few tracks on here that actually remind me of sort of that crunk era of southern hip-hop like the chorus on the track bliss which I mean Michy's vocals on that really sound to me like Kane's vocals whenever he would write a chorus and of course the flow on the track palm trees kind of reminds me of a slowed down version of the flow on the chorus get low and there are moments on here where the inflections and the flows of Meech and zombie juice kind of remind me of early horrorcore acts like grave diggers for example now zombie juice like I said before definitely an ill Bill influence that I read about but from the first moment I heard this guy's voice I was like man it really kind of sounds like he listens to a little bit of eazy-e now as far as vocal register zombie has a really great separation from each in the mix because his voice comes off so high so hyped so energetic to me comes off just as ear grabbing just maybe not as cartoony and as far as Eric he's a kind of middle-ground vocally not so low not so high and just a little bit of rasp now if there's a downside to the vocals and the cadences on this album and and this is essentially what kind of Drew me away from Flatbush zombies at first dating back to their drugs mixtape their vocals are so over the top there so just crazy a lot of the time they can kind of drown out their flow talents their lyrical talents and abilities and and the bright spots in the production to now as far as lyrics go these guys are again staying with that hardcore hip-hop tradition of being braggadocious a lot of wordplay of course insults are thrown into the mix grimy gritty while I wouldn't say their rhymes are smart or incredibly socially conscious to the point where you're like whoa these guys are really thinking about the world but I wouldn't really say they're dumb lyrically either there are plenty of moments on here where zombie juice or Meech approach issues of racial inequality and hypocrisy I mean that's really the entire theme of the opening track on here American Pie one of Michy's lines on this track sticks out to me about him having money now him having bread and people coming to him with their hands out and all they're going to get is their palms read from the bloodshed Oh Eric comes through with shots at the Miss America contest as well as the radio's blandness zombie juice has some things to say will it really some threats to make toward Michael Bloomberg and while Flatbush zombies do come through with some corny lines here and there like kick ass like Bernie Mac and Mac on these hoes what I think needs to be appreciated is that these guys have delivery the voice is on this thing especially me ch's it's it's it's interesting they feel grimy they feel hard they feel in your face but simultaneously whenever a line comes through as being kind of silly it's like his voice his delivery is cartoony enough to the point where it's kind of funny I think that comes through on the fuck fuck fuck fuck verse that he does on the track bliss on another verse where he's talking about being too mentally unstable to be fucking with them labels imagine him kind of yakety-yak and around these round tables and past these lines I think there are plenty of highlights throughout this project I think flat Barzani's even though there are some duds here and there they place great songs throughout better off dead like for one juices verse on the track mindfuck is incredibly urgent it's passionate the second half of the song death where Meech is rapping the serial killer verse he does on this song is fantastic cleverly referenced and entertaining verse gt-r's has this really smooth soulful chorus despite the fact that it's Meech singing on the song with his really rough voice and on the track regular and complex with meat rapping about rap being illegal and then him writing bars and being behind bars and ba-ba-ba-ba-ba continuing that rhyme scheme that was just another moment where i feel like he's kind of clever but very charismatic and just fun to listen to as far as features on here there is the song club soda which has action bronson on the final verse he really delivers his most understated feature that i've ever heard him do and danny brown on the opposite end of the spectrum on the song drug parade delivers the most animated over-the-top verse i've ever heard him do to the point where I can't even make out a lot of what he's saying I feel like he was up against these other rappers on this tape who also have incredibly eccentric voices and this track wasn't really a competition of bars but really who has the craziest freakin voice and the song Mraz are really hard hitting chorus on here that I like maybe one of the catchiest on the entire album has this really awesome beat change up with the synth line from Easy's boys in the hood coming through and then it goes back to the original instrumental again solid memorable and enjoyable moments occur throughout this thing originally I feel like there were some adjustments my ears needed to make or just my head needed to make to the voices and just how over-the-top they are on this album but once I got past that I was enjoying the lyricism I was enjoying the instrumentals I was enjoying the flows and overall I was just enjoying the personality that Flatbush zombies brought to the table of which there is a lot maybe better off dead is a little long-winded maybe there are some tracks that maybe this project could have done without but I think this is definitely one of the major highlights of this year as far as free rap projects go at least I'm feeling a light to decent ate on this thing transition but if you've given better off dead a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Flatbush zombies better off dead forever 
BDEDC-KNewI,yeah poke poke link link banana hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new machine drum album vapor City machine drum is the longtime pseudonym of electronic music producer Travis Stewart he has been making music under this name for well over 10 years at this point and over the years that he's put out music in this project he has sort of used it as a testing ground for numerous electronic music styles he's a very versatile producer with a sharp ear for sound I first talked about his work back in 2011 with the album rooms an album on which he brought a real stylistic shift embracing the worlds of Juke footwork future garage all in one go and while there were some standout tracks on this thing that I like tool I didn't enjoy kind of the vibe and the aesthetic that he was going for on this album maybe he embraced the very maximal tendencies of these genres a little bit too much because there were a number of songs on here that to me came off way too jumbled to even sort of be enjoyable or make sense of and now on this new LP machine drum is still hanging in that same stylistic realm but maybe the songs are actually coming together a little more focus actually a lot like that sepal cure album that he dropped that very same year simple cure being the collaborative duo of him and Praveen Sharma however I can't really say I was that much crazier about sepal cure than I was machine drum because with sepal here I felt like those eccentric tendencies that machine drum had those more experimental those noisier tendencies that machine drum had were kind of just sucked away to the point where the future garage the juke that was embraced on this album was just kind of very pastel colored not that memorable a little bit of a wallpaper background version of this style of music I thought this new LP from machine drum though vapor City seems to be a little bit of a middle ground however not quite as jumbled as rooms but maybe a little darker a little grittier a little bit more personality than sepal cure and what I also appreciate about this LP is that machine drum definitely brought a nice variety among the 10 tracks on this album there are more serene songs on here just prettier atmospheric songs and then we have some very hard grooving bangers as well like two of the lead singles off of this LP gunshot ah a track that has a really interesting intricate and constantly shifting rhythm some very warm sub bass and some tight vocal edits and then there's eyes don't lie which is me my favorite track on this entire LP the groove even harder but kind of has a sway to it that to me makes the track feel really unique the bass is crushing in the the kind of pitch shifted and and manipulated and somewhat ghostly vocal sample is incredibly hypnotic as don't as there are a few tracks on here that kind of come out of left field like vision which is this somewhat short very textured very grainy drone of a track but maybe what's even more surprising to me is the track you still lie which actually feels like a bit of electronic psychedelic dream pop something I would expect more from an artist's like washed-out actually the song features all these rippling handclaps and and swelling synth chords as well as these lead vocals that that are very somewhat deadpan not that emotive but cavernous with reverb what I think Machinedrum actually fell short of on this is that the track honestly is not that memorable which in my opinion is sort of the issue with a lot of music that tries to go for this vibe I was just sort of hoping that Machinedrum would change things up by actually making something that hit a little harder had a bit more impacted memorability I feel like he attempts that with this really sharp synth lead but to me this song sticks out like a sore thumb in the flow of this album just because it feels so stylistically out there and because it's it's just not as much of a highlight as many of the other songs on here are for me and there are other highlights on here outside of the two lead singles that are a little lower in energy but still have some pretty creative ideas a song baby it's you bill with this really slow-burning introduction it really kind of gets the tension set and it has kind of a future garage groove to it especially with the vocal edits but I found some of the sounds surrounding this vocal edit to be kind of glitchy which I dug a lot there is a song infinite us the longest track on this album a song that has these really nice arpeggios sparkling throughout the track these constantly ascending chords a very fast beat in these vocal edits that feel like they're treated with auto-tune a little bit warbling in the background it's a bit of an odd track I feel like the fast pace of the song catches my ear but maybe it's a little long-winded and then there Center your love which has some pretty nice female vocal edits as well as some rich pianos and some guitars too overall it's it's not a bad mix of tracks from Machinedrum maybe not that cohesive of an album and and I will say that maybe track 4 track 4 track it's not as hard hitting his rooms because a lot of the time and I feel like this is what made room so exciting for some people is the album feels like a little bit of a barrage machine drum came through with a lot more clarity on this album and I think it makes it more enjoyable more listenable just more approachable there are a few tracks on here that feel forgettable but I think I prefer this LP over his last one I'm feeling a life 7 on this thing transition but if you've given this Machinedrum album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Machinedrum vapor City only the strong Subscribe forever 
LanA47ffqlg,ah my needle drops and Joel let's make this quick I have a face to shave I'm a little under the weather I have a copy of Grand Theft Auto 5 that needs playing some Tonetta vinyl that needs listening a friend's furniture that needs moving thank you for pointing out just how calculated this whole Miley Cyrus wrecking ball video and VMAs performance probably is but maybe before we move on there's one more thing worth noting a lot of people were talking about what was most offensive to them about this VMA performance was not really the sexual content of the dancing really it was more Miley capitalizing on twerk culture via hip-hop culture via black culture trying to make it seem as if it was cool for her to do this by having other black women with her twerking on stage all I know is that she will continue riding this cultural capitalization train until it stops making her money all right let's put this thing to bed and smother it with a pillow when it least expects also in your video response you talked about the dark future you perceive for pop music because you may see a trend right now of artists emphasizing image over the quality of the music they're releasing or even just really coming out with an image that seems way more fussed over calculated and pre-plan I don't really think that's the future for us I think that's kind of the now actually I think we've kind of been in that position for a while I actually think Britney Spears is in that boat I think Marky Mark is in that boat and I think a lot of hair metal bands are in that boat however I do get where you're coming from there are a load of different artists out there who get plenty of buzz and attention simply because they have a provocative music video or really eccentric look or some kind of massive sexual appeal and the reason I think the general public gets caught up in this stuff is that we're an incredibly visual culture we have been for a long time I just think right now this side of our culture has been exacerbated by 27 inch computer screen monitors YouTube the internet smartphones big-budget movies with fantastic CGI graphics even looking back to some of the best pop music ever written ever released ever to make it onto the charts a lot of that stuff is is most fondly remembered for the fashion that was around at the time what the artists wore the iconic album cover what I think is important to acknowledge is that we have plenty of artists today who in this new visual age are embracing the visual embracing the musical and in doing great things with both and no matter how appealing the image is the thing is is that image has a shelf life to it and a lot of the images that are centered around music are culture based and sort of trend based and if the song if the music behind the image is truly that awful it's not really going to have a long shelf life I mean when was the last time you heard someone speak fondly of LFOs summer girls where do you think shelf life sort of sits right now with people finding out about a majority of the music they listen to on the internet and constantly bombarding themselves with new artists new albums new singles all the time to the point where it seems like everything that was hot last year only a year ago is just like a distant memory Anthony Fantan oh the needle drop the daily guru image forever [Music] [Music] 
rmE2I04VFX0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd creepeth and it's time for a review of the new Keo album huh Bardot ko dot is an experimental rock outfit that is masterminded by versatile singer composer and multi-instrumentalist tobe driver I first got into his music through his modeling of the well when I was sort of on the lookout for some modern prog rock that didn't suck modern progressive rock with an edge keeps the rock in progressive rock as well as a little bit of doom metal and death metal they actually came out with an album a few years ago in 2009 after a very long long long hiatus it was an album whose budget was actually collected through fan donations but since this maudlin record came out Toby drivers taken his musical efforts and focused them back on Keio dot which is essentially the band he pulled together after madlyn went south in the early 2000s and you could actually argue that the move from maudlin to KO dot was actually great for Toby's career the very first album that ko ever put out actually came out on sadiq records which is John Zorn's record label which if you're an experimental rock outfit and you're looking for some kind of endorsement in the experimental rock world that will get your career going and get people paying attention to you that is it now over the years Kyodai has embraced a series of different stylistic influences as well as personnel and despite that their music has always stayed relatively consistent until in my opinion about 2010 with the album coyote which i think is one of the more austere and just kind of up to sand difficult albums to come out of this project difficult to the point where that there was just not much in the way of enjoy ability and then I think things got even less entertaining with the next full-length Keo album Gamma Knife which is the most low fire recording the band has ever delivered to their audience part of me sort of assumed that KO dot was down for the count at this point it's been about 10 years since their first full-length album and you know not many bands make it to that point and still sound great but then all of a sudden ko dot Toby driver comes out of nowhere with this new album within a year's time and it's like 100 minutes long not only that but the recording on this thing is incredibly sharp done by Randall Dunn it didn't take long for me to realize that what I was listening to on this album was more ambitious more fully realized louder bigger and just more grandiose than than anything that Kyodai has been doing for it's two previous albums maybe even three of course the stylistic inspirations on this album are nothing new for Toby driver but maybe it's a little jarring for some fans to hear them all packed in so tightly into this one 100 minute LP you have art rock on here prog rock avant-garde metal heavy metal black metal death metal jazz fusion post rock maybe a little bit of sludge metal some chamber music too as well as just some beautiful chorus vocals it's a very diverse album but somehow Toby gets it to flow pretty well even though I think he really kind of left some of what happens on this LP up to chance maybe just really up to pure improvisation that much is clear from the opening track on this album the song is called the black stone it features Jason Byron who Toby has worked with before doing guttural vocals on this track and and basically this track involves a lot of just strung out guitars who are playing phrases and playing noises that feel almost random at points they are accented with drums a little bit of strings and even though there may be some chords and some melodies that that seem to be agreed upon between all these musicians it feels like all of them are just kind of reacting to one another in the moment to make this very intense and and tightly knit performance and typically I'm into this sort of thing but the sporadic rushes of guitars and drums on on this track didn't exactly stay entertaining for the six or so minutes that they last before the song goes into this chilling frenzy of blasts beat drums and really intense vocals and just these ascending guitars and sentences and I didn't really find Byron's gutturals to be that fantastic either maybe kind of limited in in dynamics and abilities I think there were moments on the beginning of this track where his voice sounded maybe a little cartoonish and just not that chilling thankfully the next track on this thing crown in the muck is a little more consistent a little more coherent there's some ominous horn harmonies on this track some great guitar lines time signatures switch up a little bit I love the slow heavy and passionate explosive guitars toward the finish of this song and the doubled-up shouted vocals it was almost kind of a punk vibe to this track coming from the vocals that I really liked the screams were just manic as hell song thief right after seems to be kind of a continuation of this same sort of rock intensity except there are some incredibly psychedelic reverb effects being thrown all over the vocals and a lot of the instrumentation making everything bleed into one another there's some very fast and intense playing all over this track and then Toby driver and company sort of make this switch from black metal influenced intensity to the soaring clean vocals a la Mike Patton however this element of surprise we're doing this now we've changed gears this does lead to some of the tracks on here feeling kind of gimmicky gaudy kind of like the song vision adjustment to another wavelength which goes straight from in the middle of the track cacophonous death metal inspired instrumentation to kind of quirky tongue-in-cheek flute jazz and you know it just feels to me to be a shame to waste such good playing in such good musicianship I'm kind of a semi ironic thrill I like mr. bungle as much as the next guy but this track isn't really doing that for me fortunately this sort of thing is is sort of a rarity on Hobart Oh a lot of the song structures on this album do take twists and do take turns but they are coherent and they flow pretty well like the song first matter which is this very slow burning synthesizer back piece of goth rock with some pretty good vocals a nice melody that I liked quite a bit and there's a beat change up in the latter half of the track that that really sucks the groove out of the song and I think suspends the song in this really dissonant atmosphere that leaves the track feeling really tense and keeps me on the edge of my seat the track is a little long-winded at 9 minutes long without a significant amount of changes in between the beginning and the end but it's still a highlight for me where I think padding songs out and maybe writing songs to be a little longer than they need to be is a bigger issue is the song the second operation which in my opinions are named for a good majority of its 13 minute runtime with some very somber vocals and guitars now given the vocals do feel pretty emotive actually there are some moments where they are telling a story and it feels like a bit of musical theater and unless you read into the lyrics before listening to this album you wouldn't really know how fitting that vibe actually is given that this album tells a very detailed lyrical story literally with the lyrics at the end of one track segwaying directly into the lyrics of the next track and the story is about a poet and a stone that falls down from the sky it scares the townspeople that sort of are staring at it and gawking at it the poet takes the rock back home with him in some kind of freak experiment involving a lightning rod the stone explodes there's a seed inside of it that is a crazy inscription on it he goes and takes the seed buries it comes back the next stage of the forest where he buried it to find that there's a river there now he builds a boat gets into the river with the boat and I'm not really going to go that much further than that and spoil the story for you but on that track where the boat is introduced which is titled he built him a boat actually loved the vocal melody I love the chorus vocals that are in the background on this track really epic and they feel almost operatic in a sense this is my favorite track easily from the entire album there's so much passion coming from the instrumentation on this song if you only listen to one song from this album make it this song so the storyline in this album is is is insane to say the least I think my only major issue with it though is that it doesn't really feel like soundtrack why's that the vibe of a lot of these songs don't really fit at least what I perceive to be the vibe coming from what's actually being told in the lyrics if the lyrics are actually even audible because there are a number of tracks here where the lyrics are just literally screamed or shouted or they're delivered with death metal vocals or they're buried under a ton of instrumentation there's only a handful of tracks on this pretty long album where Toby drivers vocals are actually very clean intelligible to the point where you can make out everything you say but case in point the song floodgate this song is easily the most noisy cacophonous heavy and just a chaotic song on this entire album with just instrumentation playing fast and as noisily as possible just pile on top of each other and there's nothing really about the story at this point in the song that in my opinion would warrant this kind of intensity this kind of ferocity I mean merely what happens in the story at this point is that the poet comes across the river that was created by the forest and the seed that he planted the night before I mean I get that the song is titled floodgate and maybe that the flood the waters are open they're rushing so the instrumentation is rushing and it's loud as possible but still I mean I feel like there are different ways to go about that vibe than to create something that's so scary that's so evil and that's so wretched because literally that's how this song sounds so even though I like the arc of the storyline and I like the instrumental arc of the music on this album I feel like there are a handful of points where they don't really lock in together all that well another example would be the closing track on this album the song passing the river which is the tenth track on here instrumentally I think is about as good a closing track as you're going to get and yet there's another chapter to this story and instead of maybe bringing in a song that maybe has a bit of a sense of closure to it we get this kind of quirky jazz fusion instrumental that has these long winded solos that lasts until the song is is 14 minutes long overall I gotta say I was impressed with this record I enjoyed this record quite a bit I'm happy to see ko doc come through with a project that once again feels ambitious recorded well intense and just at some points a thrill to listen to however I thought that the concept that this album came through with was executed really only in an O a way it's like this album was trying to deliver this really grand story line but instead kind of threw dirt on top of it by bringing together instrumentals that sort of buried that storyline whether it be with some loud guitars or just some obscure or very vocals but other than that I think kayo dot pulled together a really solid LP I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this kayo dot album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it also over at the maker music channel you can find

C-R3xTRHw9M,hi everyone Anthony Santana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new MGM's no no time look at me like this car when you finish you shouldn't look like this okay um could I have some no I hate Cal Church esta MGMT self-titled album these guys re indie electronic indie pop duo or they were at one time within the span of a few years they went from that to just complete psychedelic pop and rock it was a pretty surprising transition from their first album oracular spectacular to their sophomore LP congratulations even though there were elements of psychedelic rock and pop on their debut the fact of the matter is is that congratulations was a much more ambitious grandiose and kind of out there record not quite as sweet with the pop appeal and it ended up disappointing a lot of the fans that they collected off of the backs of great singles like electric feel and kids and time to pretend I defended that change they made in my videos not only because I love it when bands get ambitious and try to reach for the stars but I thought congratulations was a good record and MGMT must have found the process of making a record kind of on their own terms rewarding because it seems that they are doing it once again with this new LP that I'm sure will earn them even more backlash from whatever fans they have left before even a single song was released from this self-titled album MGMT was saying that our next record it's gonna be weirder so watch out and the forecast started to look like just that after they got Dave Freeman Fredman back to produce the record who produced their first album also produce music with Mercury Rev Flaming Lips Plus MGMT dropped a few tracks before this album came out like alien days and your life is a lie and even though songs were more off-kilter than what they had put on congratulations now like I said earlier this record MGMT does have a little bit of a tie to the Flaming Lips and I would say that shows up influence wise on on some of the songs especially with Flaming Lips more recent stuff the very fuzzy ominous and effects soaked track mystery disease feels a lot like something The Flaming Lips might have put on their embryonic record and the song a good sadness which is a very vast track it's a very spacious atmospheric track this I think would have slipped in pretty nicely to the new Flaming Lips record had that LP been maybe a little lighter in mood a little more cheerful cheerful light-hearted those are definitely two words I would use to describe this album as a whole with the exception of a couple of little tracks many of the songs here feel pretty absurd maybe a little silly and intentionally so the sound the MGMT are going for on on pretty much every track here is just really cacophonous noisy lots of conflicting signals going on between the instrumentation this album production-wise is compressed as hell everything in the mix here is just so pressed and so squeezed in and so claustrophobic it's it's kind of like a casserole even the quietest tracks on here have a bit of digital fuzz on them from all the compression thrown onto these tracks and you know a lot of people have pointed at this record because of that have said oh loudness war brick walled however I don't really think MGMT compressed the songs on this record for the same reasons that a mainstream pop star looking for radio play may have their record heavily compressed I think the reason that this album sounds so crackling is that they legitimately tried to experiment a little bit and come together with a uniform sound and just kind of make a record that has again this this very Bhoomi very overwhelming quality to it however there's really only so far that I feel like I could defend this production choice because it does really kill the dynamic range of the instrumentation especially on the quieter tracks and it does kind of grate on my ears and wear on me as I am listening to this album all the way through it does get a little suffocating I think the space in the breathing room is really kind of necessary when you're talking about enjoying a tracks such as astro-man C which is such a spacious odd an experimental track I can't really tell why I'm not enjoying this track is it because MGMT sound play is legitimately not that interesting or is it because the way this album was produced kind of kills off the richness and the textures and sort of what makes these sounds have body one thing I know for sure there are a number of tracks on here where it seems like MGMT kind of emphasizes experimentation and just strangeness over putting together a sweet punchy and melodic psych pop tune and to be completely honest I sort of find tracks like this to be a little bit of an unrewarding jumble in kind of the same way that some tracks on the last animal collective were a little shaky for me and I didn't really connect with any of them emotionally because a lot of them felt just clouded by all of these sounds just all this noise that didn't really necessarily need to be there because it didn't make the track more exciting or more interesting I really do end up preferring the sweeter side that this record has to offer like the track alien days which has these beautiful woodwind melodies as well as colourful keys it's a very fun melodic and quirky track I think the lyrics are kind of silly and playful the song mystery disease is another great track much darker than many of the songs on here but a very coherent and melodic song that sticks out and there's the song your life is a lie which is a little repetitive yeah but I think it's a hilarious track I mean really tongue-in-cheek really absurd the lyrics are top-notch they're sharp they are clever and the riff the really hypnotic sort of broken record riff on this thing with the booming production I mean one kind of complements the other and then there's the song plenty of girls and the see another track on here that I like a lot of course lyrically the song is about what the title says it's funny plenty of girls in the sea overall this is not a bad album I think MGMT put together some serious bright spots across this tracklist it is admirably odd at points but there are just too many things working against this album for me to just really love it I'm feeling a strong five - Ally six on this MGMT album transition what did you think of this album did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it I want to thank monkey for being in this video

HJ4X8Zuovrs,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet stuffiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new crystal stilts album nature new are crystal stilts are a New York rock band who I've been a pretty big fan of ever since about two thousand eight when I first heard their album a light of night which in my opinion was a pretty good spacey trippy odd and and somewhat off-putting psychedelic and garage rock album I think the band hit a bit of a creative peak in 2011 with the album in love with oblivion which was one of my favorite rock albums of that year still is it's done shake the shackles I described this album in my review as a pure rock and roll nightmare lots of reverb on these guitars very onymous ominous melodies and tons of energy and just momentum coming from the tightness of the band playing together and of course the very deadpan low-pitched and disembodied vocals a front man Jamie Townsend kind of was the cherry on top of this whole thing the sonic variety was much bigger than it was on their last LP I think this was just a fantastic album for crystal stilts they ended up following this album up with with a somewhat lackluster EP pretty soon after and now they have dished out a new full-length album which while maybe I didn't find it as disappointing as the EP that they followed in love with oblivion up with I'm not really warming up to this thing to the point where I love it head over heels on this album the band goes into a decidedly less energetic psychedelic and experimental direction I would say but to what end I'm not really sure a lot of the instrumentation on this thing is is much more audible not so smothered in effects but the only thing getting rid of the effects has exposed is is the band's incredibly simple approach to song and melody writing and and performing it hasn't really added any kind of newfound depth or this aha moment where I'm like oh crystal stilts doesn't sound too bad without the effects as much as I like many of the songs from crystal stilts previous records I'm not so sure how game I would be to hear any of them acoustic or with all the effects stripped back for me the effects the reverb you know just the studio trickery was a part of the fun on tracks like electrons rising and spirit in front of me crystal stilts are sounding like a slightly slower and less detailed less layered version of their former selves one of the few tracks that sounded actually good with some of the effects trip back was the song future folklore which had this really swagger filled guitar riff some schmaltzy organs on this thing as well as this floor tom bass drum beat this song just romps it bounces around it just has that smooth just danceable again swagger that I think crystal stilts should bring to the table if they're gonna strip some of these eerie sounds back there was just a really captivating energy to this track it kind of felt like a slightly creepy take on a guitar riff for just a song idea from Velvet Underground's white light/white Heat what I think the band really tried to do on this record is is make an album that is not so odd or off-putting her eerie or scary or nightmarish but maybe put forth an album that's a lot prettier because there are a good handful of tracks on here that feature some strings some layered arranged strings like the song star crawl or the track memory room which is also an acoustic ballad and the song phases forever to which also has woodwinds in it that sound nice the song sticks and stones is definitely one of the more light and airy songs that crystal stilts have ever put together with kind of a jangly sweet little rhythm guitar and JB Townsend kind of singing in his higher register which does sound odd but but in a way there is kind of a sweetness and innocence to it and even the title track on this LP feature some very soft rock instrumentation with this really eerie melody that kind of creeps in really delicately and and this kind of delicate approach isn't really something you usually hear on a crystal stilts album I i think the direction that crystal stilts are shooting for sounds really great on paper and I think it sounds really great instrumentally most of the time however I think there are moments on this album where some of the loose playing some of the loose and slow playing that the band delivers like on Star crawl and JB's vocals on pretty much every track don't really lend themselves to the beauty that I think they're trying to grab for and sometimes even though the melodies that they do employ on this album can be kind of pretty they're not enough they're they're they're really too simple and too short to kind of carry the weight of an entire track that feels really repetitive and kind of mundane sort of like world gone wrong overall I did like this LP I feel like crystal stilts have still kept their aesthetic while trying to change and sort of do something new for the band at least half of the songs on this thing I find to be really enjoyable and I have faith that into the future maybe they'll find a way to take some of these beautiful melodies and more delicate sounds and incorporate them with their strange and odd effects or go that roar out go that softer route but maybe bring a little bit detail into the process so that the song stay engaging from beginning to end I am feeling a light six on this album transition but what did you think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana crystal stilts nature noir forever 
V2T25eBfJng,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new weekend album kiss land the weekend is the somewhat experimental emotionally tortured and kind of dark and moody R&B project of Canadian singer-songwriter Abel Tesfaye personally I have a bit of a rocky history with this project despite Abel's pretty decent falsetto as well as some rave reviews I firmly believe that his big breakout project house of balloons that dropped in 2011 was one of the most unrewarding musical lessons I had that year the really thin production on this album ruined it for me as well as the even thinner lyrical topics which all kind of seemed like this desperate attempt to make excessive partying drug use and sex kind of introspective meaningful and deep we have the character that Abel puts himself in in these weekend songs indulging in just about everything as much as he possibly can all the while kind of painting himself is someone who is troubled sensitive and incredibly self-aware of the danger that I guess he's putting himself in impressively Abel dropped two more free projects within a year's time Thursday and echoes of silence and it was kind of weird because as people were cooling down on the project and I can understand why that was because Thursday was definitely not as entertaining or as grand or as ambitious as house of balloons for a lot of people but but I felt like I was warming up to what the weekend was doing especially when echoes of silence drop the production improved in a big way got way heavier more lush more vivid the songwriting felt a lot more straightforward and to the point a lot less moments where Abel was kind of just wandering over these repetitive beats with his vocals and to me on echoes of silence his voice sounded way more raw natural and just human and I think on that project as well the dark vibe that Abel had been going for this entire time really sort of hit home for me it actually felt real this is the first project I'd heard from the weekend that to me was kind of chilling I understand that dropping these projects within a year's time might have been a little bit of over saturation but I still don't see why that goes up silence doesn't get as much props as house of balloons now last year all of these projects got repackaged and were commercially sold as a trilogy which did kind of build the buzz up for this project again all of the previous projects to drop from the weekend did get cleaned up a little bit sonically and in my opinion even though I didn't really love house of balloons once this remaster came through I did like the sound a lot more so having heard these better sounds on this trilogy enjoying echoes of silence I was legitimately looking forward to whatever the weekend was gonna do next but then the single the lead single the title track for this album dropped in in my heart just sank the instrumental on this track was just glistening not as much darkness or edge in my opinion as some of the previous beats to drop from the weekend though I still think the atmosphere on this track was huge the bass and the drums were slow heavy kind of crushing but I think the most disappointing thing about it were Able's vocals his his singing and his lyrics on this song really the entire track felt like a rehash of everything he had been doing for the past three weekend projects not only that but it felt like Abel was backing away from writing those more straightforward songs and was getting back into that habit of just merely finding a beat finding a groove just repeating it over and over and then aimlessly singing your story over it in a really badly paced way unfortunately this really redundant songwriting style is exactly what Abel serves up for every single track on kiss land the production is still large is still atmospheric in a way kind of cinematic but what always ends up disappointing like I said earlier it's the pacing take the song adaptation for example it's just four minutes and 44 seconds but it feels like it goes on forever it's just got this really large slow lumbering beat that just repeats repeats and repeats and there's not much changing up on this song there's not much progression or alteration outside the story that Abel is trying to tell in his lyrics and if you dive into the lyrics like adapted to the models who adapted to the bottle they take it down like water just to burn away their sorrows it's clear that Abel is not changing his lyrical game up on this LP after listening to this album I'm absolutely convinced that the weekend is not as lyrical as some people make him out to be his stories are not as detail there is fleshed out or as meaningful as people believe they are and in my opinion taking these themes and in trying to make them really sad trying to make them really emotional to me just feels like throwing lipstick on a pig and those lyrics I just mentioned are from from a chorus where you have all these vocals stacked on top of one another something I think was placed into the track to kind of break up the monotony of the instrumental and Abel's voice but whenever that attempt is made it usually kind of comes out sounding ridiculous or just not that interesting the chorus on the song professional 2 is incredibly underwhelming and almost pointless and a non chorus I think the most notable change in pace on this entire album came on the song live for where I never looked more forward to a Drake verse in my entire life though the song wanderlust has kind of changed gears for the album it's it's this weird synth funk track with this upbeat funky groove that feels kind of Rick James inspired but still even this track doesn't develop that far past the funky groove it establishes at the beginning and once again were delivered another monotonous song just this time it's got kind of a catchy groove but I think maybe part of the issue with the weekend not only his songwriting style which does get kind of repetitive but the instrumentals on this track - which just don't show that much variation and a lot of the very very cloudy and Atmospheric sense surrounding these tracks kind of take away the body of the songs and probably give them less character in the long run because toward the end of this album Pharrell Williams actually has a remix of this song and it is way more enjoyable mostly because these scents are Way punchier and the instrumental itself is is just a lot more colorful a little fruitier if you want to say that and you know what the thing is even though the instrumentation feels a little more upbeat I feel like that inherent sadness and just that melancholy the weekend brings to the table it's it's still there overall I feel like able kind of went easy on us with this album by not delivering any stories that that felt fresh or new or bold for the weekend for not bringing any instrumentals to the table that had any true character outside of their overuse of reverb and their really really slow pace there are even moments where I feel like Abel's vocals are a little bit more subtle dainty and just kind of understated than his vocals in the past even the last track on this album there are some effects on his vocals that kind of obscure his voice and make it difficult to even make out what he's saying and if the weekend has been consistent with anything up to this point it has been having intelligible lyrics while I think the weekend still has some potential to come through with something interesting in the future and and still has a defined sound in the R&B world when you hear a weekend song you know it's weekend song but overall this project just feels like a rehash of a lot of moments from the weekends previous stuff but done in a slightly less interesting way while this record wasn't terrible to me it wasn't you know the worst thing in the world there were some good points but the good points that I heard here I've already really heard from from this project I'm feeling a light five on this thing honestly transition but if you've given this weekend album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana weekend kiss land forever 
TN1sp6Tb5ng,hi everyone Anthony finish scored over here oh we stopped yes meanwhile you started you startled show right on the latest live installment of the needle drop and rock it out blog yeah on youtube live on the internet live for you to watch live right now at the moment this second we have quite a few segments in district episode of the live rocket outlawed needle drop togetherness Jam of the century we are going to be talking about liquid abuzz and the questions rumors circulating around the new arcade fire single reflektor a lot of people have heard it I've enjoyed it Sammy's enjoyed it will also be talking about dive AK Zachary Cole Smith getting busted for many decks of heroin person will also be doing a collaborative review of the new man man album who only pond in we're going to have one the only the magical mystical oh so irresistible liebe Hart the one and only on on the show AAO interview talking about his new record with the David liebe Hart band quit yes that and you know and for those people who are sitting there thinking that David leave over yes that David liebe Hart some people say when they do live shows on youtube or streaming on any other streaming sites they sail we've got an action-packed show and then it's just one dude talking about his pimples and playing an awful guitar riff that he had written the night before cuz you thought was going to be cool those aren't action-packed what we have for you today is super actiontec we've got guests topics reviews Anthony myself I guess if you can call me action-packed I suppose I'll put myself in that category for the next hour or so um we've been chuckling uh off camera before the broadcast started about some of the things we were going to be discussing up primarily the the dive sky ferreira issue which we'll get to later um but I guess the first thing that we do want to tackle on on today's live broadcast as evenings live broadcast would be uh the new arcade fire single the deflector which was produced by one James Murphy of LCD soundsystem featuring david bowie in the background on vox vocals he is going somewhere I assume you have the vinyl cover I'll keep it going I'm gonna keep going ok he it's gone but uh yes so for those you that have not heard the single yet um you are either deaf or you're just completely lazy and you just have not wanted to spend any time with arcade fire's new single or you're just not a fan of Arcade Fire in any case uh it is recommended that you give the single listen because it is definitely different much more different than what Arcade Fire has normally done in the past it's much more dancey uh when I listen to it for the first of all the track is nearly eight minutes long which means you've got plenty of time to do some dancing to this record secondly how it sounds to me when I first heard it I will do it about like four or five times in a row before passing proper judgment on it uh my my judgment on it is it's a really good track I enjoy it very much and it sounds like 80's club cocaine muzik where you've got the band on stage in the 80s and they're just like up on stage win butler with the same haircut that would work in the 80s that kind of flock of seagulls but not just hanging over his eyeball and he's just like switching back and forth and regime is doing this weird little dance right next to them and as they are singing and people are doing dances all these lights in the club studio 54s are just splashing the dance floor everywhere and people are just doing huge rails cocaine in the VIP section because that's what gets their buzz on to the song Anthony are you a fan though of the fact that arcade fire now going in a bit more of a dancey direction much more different direction than their previous releases the suburbs Neon Bible and funeral uh and the fact that James Murphy has now pretty much like landed his claws his hooks deeply into the band and their sound and is now coming up with uh with this with this new thing single record your thoughts you you you you you you you we've been hearing or I've been hearing Sammy's completely disappeared anyway at least with this one track that I've been hearing inside of this advertisement that is kind of it getting passed around and with they're going to be Sam he's gone again he's disappeared once more um considering that you know we're going to have a record that has so many tracks on it maybe we're going to get an album that stylistically is a little all over the place but you know somehow someway Arcade Fire will find a way to kind of make it okay apparently apparently Sammy is leaving and then he's going to come back and you know hopefully uh hopefully he works things out but also i just want to mention you guys that later in the show when we have David liebe Hart on just so just after we have David on um we're going to be taking your comments your questions so right now anything that you guys drop in terms of a question or a comment into the dip into the comment box underneath this video will be looked at and if you want to drop a question specifically for David liebe Hart we can asking that question later when we're

be with us and he'll be sort of answering whatever questions that you guys throw at him as well cool cool alright we are uh let me see I'm gonna pass Sammy this link over here the show again just to I

people stopped here in your words was let's just talk about this dive thing fuck it let's talk monday reflectors been talked about way too much anyway moving on to some other more topical topics um for those either don't know hey by the way i'm sami from the rocket i'll blog obviously you know your host Anthony of the needle drop thank you for hosting this this week I appreciate it um die Zachary Cole Smith a way fish indie rock star and his a model / musician girlfriend sky ferreira uh were arrested in upstate New York recently and I believe its saga News New York if i'm not mistaken uh they were driving down a highway when they were pulled over why were they pulled over because the car they were driving a was a stolen vehicle number one number two zachary cole smith AKA dive or deve depending on how you want to pronounce it is two eyes the middle of it it's a stupid spelling um is they uh yes forty two decks of heroin if i'm not mistaken forty two decks of heroin he was caught within sky ferreira had a bit of ecstasy on her and so what happened what happened was is uh yeah they were taken booked and were released on bail a few hours later not before a glamorous mugshot was posted of the via this uh wanna be Bonnie and Clyde indie-rock lame duo um online and I can't hear you again well I haven't said anything oh yeah it's anything I thought you just fucking with me no I'm sort of reacting the things that you're saying because you know let like let let's just get straight into it yes I III just have a hard time you know uh thinking of sort of you know uh rock music still kind of having this drug induced rebellion to it especially you know music as kind of like slow and just kind of light-hearted and as just very breezy as dives music arm I I just uh I I just again i just find it uh I guess he was caught with heroin but I just think it's kind of a preposterous in a way like is heroin really in fashion right now like considering how much money we as indie rock and just independent music fans assume and always hear that artists are not making is heroin really a worthwhile investment in your career I mean considering that you know I I personally believe that if you want to put a substance in your body it should be legal for you to do that but where we live right now that's not really the case and that's not really legal and it seems like doing heroin you're kind of putting all of that on the line you know and and and you know uh again we're talking about a musical scene a musical world right now where audiences are so fickle already and you know possibly doing a bit of jail time and sort of being out of the scene for an extended period of time could you know be more of a hurt to your hurt to your career than a help it may not even be so much that it's his money um because I think it's safe to say that a good majority of indie rock artists make pittance and the majority of the money that they do make is on touring more merch but let us look at the other party in this case sky ferreira who is not just a musician but is also a model print model video model whatever you want to call her so uh of the two of them I feel it's safe to say that she is the bread winner of this couple and being the model that she is um models tend to make a bit more money when doing national print ads international print dad so forth and so on and M heroine may seem to fit a bit more of the mo you can get your hands on if you have a bit more cash to burn so ultimately I don't think that it's a dive or deaves a thing to get heroin but because he's with a certain group of people that affiliate I assume with his girlfriend um heroine could maybe find its way into his hand how's that Zachary Cole Smith is just like this really innocent dude and like sky ferreira is just like yeah I'll hold this can you hold this heroin for me if you hold these are you right to next everyone for me baby no oh what I'm saying is that uh here's you also bring up the fact that um the the type of music scene that we're dealing with your primarily indie rock for one of these guys to go to jail maybe a bit of a blemish on their career but the thing is is uh there used to be days when rock stars were people that you had to break the wall you had to do something a bit rebellious you had to do something a bit out of sorts to not only like get your rock credibility but at the same time to prove to people that this is this is what you did this is who you work this was your lifestyle in the 70s and the a lipid look at nothing like rock stars of like the 70s and the 80s is out of that drugs were rampant you know what the fan reaction was those guys are fucking awesome now because a lot of rock stars now fall into this indie rock label on it they have to fit a certain a type of bill which means based on a lot of the rock stars that I see a lot of these up a lot of these indie rock stars that I see um waifish very timid very oh I don't well make my light music for you to listen to her like right these little hipster Williamsburg pussy anthems and for them to do anything outside of that scope automatically puts them in this in this in this in this I site of oh my god what the hell are you doing this is like this is not your thing why are you doing this thing which is why when I read this story today I'm like you're not Bonnie and Clyde like you can't drive down first of all where'd you even get a stolen vehicle from second of all where God's name do you get 42 decks of heroin from third the ecstasy I can understand your girlfriend's a model she's probably out clubbing she's like a bunch of X to make herself feel better and she wants to feel the music um which is probably better than hers and um yeah so like I said where the X comes from 42 necks of heroin in the stolen car I mean if you were cooler if you were just like maybe a better musician a better rock star maybe ah we done we done but say the last thing alright one last thing if you were cooler if you were a better rock sharp you were better musician I'd be like you know what I can't be mad at him you tried to have his gangster moment you tried to go GTA and I mean I guess it's cool ah what or maybe or maybe think about it GTA 5 comes out tomorrow maybe all this is just a promotion for the game in some weird way you ever think about that 42 next Rivera one in a stolen car with a model girlfriend who has ecstasy also I want to mention that this is the fifth grand theft auto game that they have passed on having you and me as radio show hosts which is bullshit which is bullshit it is bullshit whose penises do we have to a sever in order to get on those airwaves because who do we have to shoot with a combat shotgun while flying in a helicopter I'd say max new into a pickup truck which is licensed in the county of san andreas or vice city depending on which one you prefer I kind of like san andreas a little bit one by city and then then get out of the helicopter and then go grab a meal at the clucking bell right and bundling before having sex with a prostitute and then slicing her throat width and then taking the money that we just gave her for simulated fellate fellatio acts who do we have to do all that to in order to get on this damn call rockstar games let's get Lazlo on the phone let's get Lazlo on the phone in a couple weeks and have him explain himself cuz this is nonsense we'll have our people call his people indeed and we'll have lunch brunch right let's move on let's move on talk about the new man man album yes and can I say before this review um please for those of you that are watching when when Anthony is reviewing an album please listen to it because he knows what he's talking about I will give you an example this this guy is responsible for me discovering bands like torch discovering event bands like FL attack both of which were excellent recommendations and we were discussing where we're going to review on the show today and he said let's review the new men man i am not all that familiar with madman's catalog with their music I know them as a band I know they've been around for a little bit but I'm not that familiar with their music I am now glad that I listen to this record we're going to review it because it's phenomenal I think it's phenomenal but to give you a little insight on the album Anthony school them a little bit man man man is a Philadelphia band and damn this is there this is their fifth full-length LP on Oni pond it's a one of a few records that they've come out with so far on anti records and um found out about this band way back in two thousand four when I was the music director of the college radio station that I was working at at the time with their album the man in the blue turban with a face still have a CD copy of it over there along with a CD copy of six demon bag my two favorite man man albums and you know their music features a lot of Eastern European music uh thrown in there with some horns and some strings just some of the melodies that they play they were kind of getting popular around the same time that bands like uh let's see what's the name of that band oh man Gogol Bordello as well as a little bit of Beirut uh you know there was just this kind of a hawk and a hacksaw you know there was just like this popularity with that Eastern European sound of the handful of bands and dumb in my opinion man man was easily the most eccentric out of all of them I feel like on their third and fourth albums uh rabbit hats and fit in life fantastic um they got a little stale for me I feel like the tunes weren't as great and they were trying to pump up some of the weird and wacky instrumentation just to kind of make up for that and just make a really out there record just an over-the-top record and um I think on this new LP of theirs on Oni pond especially on tracks like a head-on which is one of the I think the lead single from this LP yes you really they really sort of settled down a little bit I think taint things down a bit uh get back to writing some decent tunes and um I think maybe they're a little bit better and a little bit uh easier to sort of take um without so much over the top instrumentation in their music and kind of you know because they're their music is already so instrumentally layered they have with Christopher Powell one of the best drummers in indie rock today and the frontman Honus Honus of the band even without all that wacky instrumentation as we heard I think last year with the band mister heavenly or the year before which is a collaboration he did with uh the dude nick diamonds from uh from islands um uh he already has such a unique voice that doesn't really need you know um uh just a lot of bells and whistles to sound different kind of stick out and just be unique um so I'm gonna let Sammy talk first because he seems to be absolutely glowing about high record buddy okay so I stream the album on YouTube you guys can actually check out the album over at youtube.com slash anti records if you'd like to listen to it from beginning to end um I did not think that I was going to dance like a mod throughout pretty much the entire record like it's the dancing that I was doing shit was amazing I look like one of those like extras from the Charlie Brown cartoons when they would dance like you know like this that's exactly what I was dancing light and I did it because it was so much fun like you said the drummer the drumming on this album phenomenal the / it's like a percussion machine you can't stop you can't help but to move to this record you know I think one of the things about this record that sticks out to me more than any other man man album it's so groove heavy almost every track has such a danceable groove to absolutely you know and not like a four to the floor kind of groove or anything like that um like like usual excuse me ma'am man sort of dances around with different musical influences there's one track that I have noted here sparks that it's it's an influence that pops up on a lot of Man Man albums it kind of has like a blinky cute quaint 50s teen pop Motown kind of feel to the piano on there and then there is the song loot my body which may be has the craziest most hard-hitting body rocking groove on the entire album you know and say those two those two tracks specifically man like sparks that here say it like I wrote it down to its sock hop rock yeah like yesterday 19 soda jerk lock and at first when I was listening to it like a but like about a minute and a half two minutes into it I was like you know what the song is missing the female backup singers who sing the ooze and then they just showed up and then they just showed up then and the thing and the thing is on previous manman albums they they had been there too you know I mean I think the one thing that works against this LP is just how similar at times this record sounds to previous man man albums but i think uh maybe better than their last full-length LP because I feel like since rabbit habits man man has been moving in a slightly poppier direction because there are some seriously melancholy moments on their first two records and maybe that's what I miss a lot on this album um there are some songs on here like deep cover for example and head on have kind of a sad tone to them you know very sad sort of slower ballad on you know but rarely does this album get in my opinion depressing um but maybe this is the first time I'm starting to feel like they're really beginning to make up for that with just how uh how much I get sort of enthralled by what's going on instrumentally especially with the drumming and there's this one track on there I can't remember the name of it right now I like made a note of it um but it had almost 0 was kingship that has almost like this dub reggae feel to the groove with Eddie baseline and the bit bit bit bit bit like groove coming from the keyboard you know with that one specifically like I was listening to it and it I mean it sounded it sounded like a video game to me was a head to said weird dark almost 8 bit kind of fits it almost felt like if you're playing a video game it belongs along unlike an underwater cave level like it's it like that's that's the rivet of Appa it was like ecco the dolphin but with a leather jacket like that's really like the vibe I was getting with that woman but it was great though like I tell you what though the one thing the one track that kind of threw me off uh was actually the single um head on it head-on sing right yeah it's maybe their most straightforward just kind of clean just yeah and and that's and that's the one part that kind of threw me I mean the violins were very nice touch I really enjoyed the string section in the song but what I really wish that track had done because this this whole album had a very to me very like New Age speakeasy kind of sound to it you know away yeah and I and I dug that but like what I wished about that one single specifically is that I wish that this one had more of like an open studio vibe kind of like how like in the 1950s 1960s like Old Capitol Records albums you know like those recording or so would that would record a capitol records at you could just hear the room you know you can hear like this yeah it's a it's a very close album it's very loud album it's it's it's clearly see here's the thing this is why I think you might like man man's older stuff because their older stuff sounds very ranh in the moment kind of like you're listening to a full band play rather their newer stuff feels way more studio clean um and you know since since they've gone in that direction I feel like their music has lost a bit of a natural ferocious energy to it um but I mean but still I feel like they deliver some great grooves yeah is this it's not that I hate the studio sound because the way that they pulled it off on this record it definitely works I think that this record may have needed more of that studio sound to it just because of all the grooves and the type of the type of songs were composing but on that one song specifically I think just to have kind of give it a nice little break from the rest of it from the rest of the album because I feel like that was one of the tracks that one and deep cover if I'm thinking about this in terms of like like like I said New Age speakeasy um it's one of those songs were like you would stop dancing and you would go sit down have your drink relax for a minute before you go back onto the dance floor with your girl and start swing dancing to this stuff or like or like mod dancing whatever but I kind of wish it had that that more open room live feel to it um as opposed to as opposed to that much more closed kind of posture phobic kind of studios um but the album itself I thought it was I thought it was great man I mean like if even tracks like like Paul's grotesque um fangs fangs to me was like what stuck out to me about fangs specifically were the lyrics and the story that they were telling him that song about like this you know lyrics about this woman who's very dangerous very mysterious can they almost had like a vibe of like a swing song like like a like a Minnie the moocher kind of thing but like a but a much more opposite direction you know said I'm saying no I hear what you're saying that kind of music really influences their stuff in a big way and it's like a Honus Honus always kind of has a lot of songs on man man's albums that are infatuated with women who are kind of trouble than right very you know uh devilish that's that's really the theme he always kind of goes for you know kind of that darker take on love but um but yeah I mean I'm enjoying the album it has a lot of the factors that you would look for and enjoy in a man man album but maybe is a little bit punchier in their previous two which are something that I think was really necessary if they were gonna go with this cleaner sound oh god only pond is out now on anti records I'm digging it Sammy seems to be really digging it I really like I think it's a great record now we need to go on our into our next segment we have our guest on the show who's our guest mr. David liebe Hart hi David you're in the shadows I could hardly see it going it's good to see I'm in the shadows i'm outside Adam Papa Gans apartment building I'm here what's happening it's good to hear from you what's happening with you David how are you I'm going to be going on tour to Australia doing up my punk rock van and I'm going to be I'm just a after I'm then I'm also going to have a punk rock out band out this out with burger records I'm the and it's uh I sing about growing up and going to school and the fun things I had and things I've been through well I just wanted to tell everybody here watching that David liebe Hart if you're not familiar with him he is a songwriter a puppeteer most famous for his work in the juniors Christian Science Bible lesson program and Tim and Eric awesome show great job and he has a new album out like he said with the David liebe Hart band uh like you said it's out on burger records I believe it's also available on evil weevil records David I didn't know is on that too okay I mean I say I've seen it on the evil weevil records website for twelve dollars mom and uh and and you know many of you may have caught David singing songs and writing songs uh performing songs with puppets of his on the Tim and Eric awesome show great job but now david has sort of led his singing and his songwriting style to punk rock music with the David liebe Hart band and um I'm just sort of curious David wat why the transition and sort of what about try new and different things I grew up with rock and roll and and and ribbon and blues and I just wanted to do something creative to grow in a different style I also do contemporary Christian music my musics for CCL I Christian copyright licensing international a lot of the big mega churches use my music by religious music that has a rock and roll melodies to it I actually wanted to ask you about um you do a cover of the him take my life on the album which is actually pretty rowdy yeah yeah I put that that take my life and let it be i gave this the the traditional name of facelift to my own original music hmm and evidence this is sami man that's nice to meet you um what I wanted to know is uh yuh yuh uh yuh you grew up in illinois near chicago in the suburbs correct yes i did I grew up in park forest illinois but they they made a mistake on the internet i was born and raised in chicago not park for stella noi i first lived in chicago illinois and whoever put up the thing on the internet needs to switch it around they got my age right but they didn't get the I was born and raised in Chicago and then my parents moved to park forest in the and the and 68 that's right well I actually just moved to Chicago this past year and there was that I was watching a performance of yours today were you were talking about how you were like not a fan of the suburbs when you were a kid there wasn't really much going on you really want to just a party in the north side of Chicago for her up for girls and whatnot um like what were some of your favorite hangout spots outside you were killed I they had a place in the park for small called the pickle barrel a lot of us teenagers hung up down we I'm out there then we went on the north side where where the happening was happening where we met a lot of girls and party with a lot of girls from the north side of Chicago went to different dances and and if night clubs what was it seemed like the bat back Oh back then on the north side because I mean now I don't know if you've been a Chicago recently but if you go to north side of Chicago now you've got you know Lakeview in wrigleyville those neighborhoods and it's become much more college centric a lot of college kids going to like all the bars near wrigley field and whatnot but we were like you know what was it like to have fun and like to just go out in Chicago in the north side that was well back then we I met a lot of girls that were going to northwestern college I dated them stayed overnight with them and party with them and and we just enjoyed our life it was a it was the difficulty teenagers do the same things only is the different style of clothes and different lifestyle things but it was just basically the same thing with his party to enjoy life all right um David uh actually you know speaking of girls you actually write quite a bit about girls on this new album of yours on the song with uh to erics um you actually try to date you try to get with Erics girl on the track am I right yeah and in any got mad at me and told me that wasn't cool when he was when it wasn't gonna go for it he put me in his place and and you knew that it was his girl like at first going into that whole thing or you didn't know like yeah I wrote a song about it you know that I uh that I that I have fell in love with Eric's girlfriend and he told me he wasn't gonna have it that way and and eric is in the David liebe Hart bandwidth you correct yeah the but he's broken off and made his own band now and I'm like everybody's had a spin-off and moved on to do their own thing erica is now working with a guy named Sean and doing music with him and and so uh and then after the Banyan's adams quest to move on to do another is to but i am interested in getting a new band started but um you know speaking about kind of backing off of that situation you don't seem like the kind of person that would see a lot of logic in fighting over a woman especially with the two dicks and the dicks fighting tracks ah on album Derek I wrote a song cathodic fighting is he is a song its kind of sexually just like the two dears would fight over the female deer the two guys with what battle off a fight with the UH the dicks over the girl and the one that would win we get to spend the night with a girl whole night mm-hmm shake like that in real life man you could just like jeweled her just due for a female anymore like I have to have game I have to like come on come out of with the right now yeah be somebody else's woman did ya leave David Lee bar has game Sammy's oh I know that I'm not questioning his game clearly he's got it I'm not worried about this guy at all he's doing very very well I mean right now he's very shadowy and mysterious and women like that alone oh yeah yeah I like to be a shell joining those beautiful women out there and David one more question about a song off this album I'm sort of wondering what sparked the passionate pretty sure that you made to Betty White on this album well I always it um I always enjoyed betty white as a performer I remember her she had a show called life with Betty when she was younger and she was very attractive fact didn't Betty White was beautiful when she was on the variety shows and everything and she was cute when she did a show called life with Betty in the 50s that was when I was a little boy I don't up age cause black don't crack but I was you know for in the fifties and I remember Betty White was a really hot like Mary Tyler Moore on a show called life with Betty I remember she was if you look at they'll get those old videos of her she was very hot and then she had a lot she was very classy on The Mary Tyler Moore Show trying to date that uh Ted Knight right yeah no I remember unlike reruns of The Mary Tyler Moore Show like I'll Nick at Nite when I was younger my parents like and I would watch side shell and stuff yeah she was she was a classy lady on that shelf yeah Sheba does age but she even tried to get with I felt that I felt she would have been a better match for at night in Georgia angles I know Georgia angles and personally from that would be both were were in the same church circle oh really science so it's val kilmer christian science and and robin williams was raised in Christian Science but he ended up in the Episcopal Church now because of like the tribute is Betty White I mean have you attempted to send that song to her camp just see if I should respond do I have I when she was doing um when she was doing her I tried to share the song with her manager and with the cast of the show that she was doing and they never responded that i did send them a copy just like i sent the song about ellijay DeGeneres jelly too generous but she never responded back to me okay you know so they don't know the that someone admired them and they should have responded I wanted to get on her new show where she's a bad about teasing old people right right right yeah I've seen that I mean well because of your working out with with tim and eric and and the other work that you do I mean have there been celebrities that have reached out to you and have wanted to work with you because I know you've done stuff with with john c reilly as well so I mean happen I have uh I have the I have reached out I've mailed out all my pictures and wrist has managed to all the new TV shows that are coming out but I just haven't heard from anybody I'm with the jacks kenadi talent agency and what doesn't seem to be fair is alive at a lot of production companies are not advertising in the trade papers like backstage of the all the new tone the fall season is all out with all the new TV shows and none of the cab the places where you can mail the resumes or send them electronically is out in backstage a variety or The Hollywood Reporter so it's a it's very hard to to find out where they're doing the new shows because a it's got it secretive I assumed I don't care at all because I'm try i'm still trying out there so i have to feel things out then go to different studios and drop off my pictures andres I assume you could hopefully get a little bit helping tim and eric right i mean you've got them in your corner well Tim and Eric right now out doing anything uh-uh Tim Heidecker just came from doing a movie in the south I don't know if the name of it is um Eric well heimer they just finished doing the Eric Andre show season 2 which I tried to get on but Clark rankers didn't feel I was cast right for that would be cast for that show and I've also wanted to get on comedy bang bang with that they're doing but I they said they don't uh have a part for me in Clark rankers just most of the casting for those shows oh so I mailed out my pictures and resumes but I helped a girl get on the on the Eric Andre show but she got me in trouble at the mosaic church where she was going it's really attractive blonde girl it was ushering at the mosaic church she's all sure the doctor from the Tim and Eric awesome show great job I am she says I'll go out with you if you can help me get on a Tim and Eric show so I she was cool with me the first eight months of see her at the mosaic church mosaic church replaced the fifth Church of Christ scientists and Hollywood on the corner of la brea in Hollywood so after I helped her get on the Eric Andre show and she was doing very well as is what about that date and then she says I have to get your number first I gave her my phone number and then I got chewed Anna security guard welcomed me what are you doing harassing the young girls at the mosaic church for I said she's the one who was interested in going out with me so this is well you can't come back until you can't be asking the girls out so I said well I wish was ever free freedom freedom speech so it's kind of it's so it is kind of day I guess via the ministers they're all want the girls for themselves I don't know what oh man David oh no you got got Duke man that she she's like I know she girl the Duke to Duke out of me but that's okay that's better fish in the sea than her absolutely man on to the next one and then that's and kind of an exercise video and only one of the girls showed up with the attitude at burger records which I thought was pretty cold and Shelby what I thought was my favorite fan she didn't even show up to support her own self and she even lives I grew up and Orange counties I'm very disappointed in Shelby shhh well David liebe Hart you you're

albums but you look homey a scumbag cuz I'm not laughing at him I thought this was hilarious we're laughing because David liebe hearts grand personality brings us joy it was hilarious how do you not let I'm gonna tell a funny story about David liebe Hart yeah me a funny story III ran into him and I didn't bring this up because I didn't know if he'd remember because he's David liebe Hart he's he's he has millions of fans it is his women sleeping with him left and right who were trying to do Liam Cayenne you know I I saw him on the streets in downtown Austin when I was a South by Southwest ran up on the guy and I was like oh my god it's David liebe Hart and you know I was like hey how you doing man I love your stuff songs are hilarious songs are great um you know let me let me get with you and I will do a picture and James Quall of Tim and Eric awesome show great job was actually there too on a few good yeah there's a part and James awesome so they were both there and you know it courses that was the South by Southwest was it not this is a South by Southwest and my girlfriend my girlfriend took this picture and um David liebe Hart and then this is the kind of guy David liebe Hart is this is why if you have a girlfriend you need to be careful around David liebe Hart because I you know my girlfriend comes up to take the picture he looks at my girlfriend he says and he says that she is a beautiful soul food girl a beautiful soul food girl and with lines like that I mean he's just charming women left and right he's like melted butter just oozing with charm and grace personality I mean he's a winner that guy just exemplifies the word chain in champion of the world I'd like Judah Friedlander no it's David liebe Hart who is el campeón de mundo mi mean right now a majority of what people are sort of throwing out at me are just sort of album what do I think about whatever album related questions which you know whatever not really feel like answering that right now um one person's like what was it like getting interviewed by Nardwuar I did Sammy actually what a lot of people don't know is family Sammy actually watch that whole interview go down I was in the room he was in the room I've been a fan of Nardwuar four years at this point I've been watching the ton of his interviews on on youtube as I'm sure many of you all of you have uh and then Anthony he and I were talking before stop by and he said yes so I'm doing this interview with Nardwuar I was like what I was like like interviewing an artist with him he's like no no he's interviewing me that's awesome okay when is this happening I want to be there for this so literally I flew into austin got in the cab with my friend Alex we drove into downtown Austin i literally just threw my bags in my hotel room ran to the convention center and timed it out perfectly Nardwuar anthony were there we walked through this incredibly labyrinthine path through the convention center to get to this secret back room where naugahyde set up a makeshift studio and what you saw what you guys saw it was about what like a like a 12 to 14 minute interview the one that ended up on YouTube you're attending okay yeah uh the actual interview itself went for close to an hour because when a lot of people like talked about like how Nardwuar research is second to none it's impeccable um what you're seeing on the interviews because a lot of his interviews are usually like about 8 to 10 minutes tops that is but the tip of the iceberg that you're seeing the amount of stuff he dug up on Anthony anything I've been friends for what two three years at this point man yeah okay okay the stuff that nerd war was bringing out I knew none of it none of it about Anthony Fantana I don't like I am a bad friend cuz I know nothing about this kid apparently none of whores bring it out like uh Newsweek articles that Anthony was I quoted in and and and how certain albums had it tied to him like especially stuffing like dick Kennedy's and then an autographed stuff from jello biafra and just my mind was blown there's actually like if you head over to Nardwuar spod cast website you could hear the whole interview all the way through right like I my mouth was a gate the entire time just in awe of like how much research this guy had done and this was a guy that Anthony had never met before lord knows when they're gonna meet again lord knows when they gonna speak again but just within that hour I learned more about Anthony needle drop then I have in the three years I've known this kid and it just honestly before the jubilation I felt towards my friend getting interviewed by somebody like no more I felt like a scumbag cuz I had no clue about anything about my friends passed other than he once had hair and he once worked at NPR that's the extent that i do about Anthony Fantino didn't get any more than that but it was ridiculous I like I wish the uncut version on video was available because it's it's it's really cool to see not more work and actually manage it's amazing I was I was blown away I was blown away yeah I was pretty cool just sort of being face to face with him and kind of just seeing you know just him at work he's got a lot of notes that he's shuffling through I mean I think there are probably even questions and comments that he had written there that he didn't even bring up you know just like tidbits of information that he didn't even go into um that uh you know actually I I know that for a fact you know there are a few things off camera that he brought up that he didn't even mention in the interview that I was like what you know that too zakum it was crazy how much he knew and how much he was able to dig up and I'm thinking okay and I'm paying myself like is when I do interviews I don't I mean I prep but I'm not like doing like you know I'm not super deep digging which I probably should there might be a good idea to do um time no man just his game is just at an all time Wow level like it's unbelievable man it's it's it's ridiculous um one thing I was surprised about is that he didn't ask me about how I used to work at a pizza place which is a very well-documented thing right where I assume he probably knew but you know I'm surprised he wasn't like so you started working there on this day or some shit or something like that or like because he have to the interview was over he brought up that one professor from your college who was like a sex offender or something yeah that was great and he was like I didn't want to bring that up in the interview with Anthony's mother she's like what you know these things what on earth program are you using to like are you with the fans that to quote out of the creator are you with the fans cuz yeah I was like uh how did the know that ah yeah um I mean he had to have known that I worked at a pizza place for some time I you know I'm just surprised that he wasn't like okay the the last pizza that you've ever cut before you were before he stopped working at the pizza place was a pepperoni onions on something something like what I didn't even know that like and he's like I know because I ordered it you know some some fucked up shit like that hey listen man Luke Sherman is asking us what our favorite midnight snack is favorite midnight snack favorite midnight snack what's yours I think my favorite midnight snack is probably cold veggie pizza or like um I don't know like an apple the grass granny smith apple Oh is a crisp juicy granny smith apple I take the fuji apples man that's my that's my jam right there fuji apples are okay it's all about granny smiths it's all about Gala apples and it's all about pink lady apples okay okay i see you going with the much more indie apples I see personally I'm much more fan of getting a bag of green or red seedless grapes depending on your preference and what you do is you throw them in your freezer for two days uh-huh you take them out and you eat them they're like little ice popsicles that you just in your mouth it's it's phenomenal and at midnight I've never tried that oh man grapes in your freezer is no joke dude do that like tonight if you have grapes I will I will try that this week right or if you just get super drunk and you come home from the bar a fat daryl is phenomenal I'm 31 years old I can't really eat those anymore because it'll just go straight to my thighs but if fat daryl is a fat girl is no but i'm on the edge of my seat waiting that daryl is one of the legendary fat sandwiches you could get at the grease trucks at rutgers university of fat daryl is my favorite concoction which is a a long roll split down the middle and inside of it you throw in chicken fingers french fries mozzarella sticks and marinara sauce at 2am after a long night of drinking nothing is better than that you will go to sleep for three days after eating something like that but it would be the best / worst decision of your life down you sound sounds like a poutine nightmare it is divine fat Darrell if any of you guys live in jersey and you know exactly I'm talking about because you've been to rutgers you've been to the trucks and you know exactly I'm talking about and I don't need to explain myself anymore any more than that ok are all right then why um I'm just imagining french fries in marinara sauce on a bun dude

TxBRICiy0KU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Denzel Currie album nostalgia 64 Denzel curry is a young southern rapper from South Florida who has ties to the Rader clan which is this southern hip hop outfit affiliated with MC Space Ghost purp and him together with the Rader clan are largely responsible for this resurgence of dark atmospheric Memphis inspired hip-hop classic artists like three 6 mafia Juicy J coupes - whose music comes out in a big way in the music of little ugly man Space Ghost purp Halik maul and Denzel - and denzel's take on this very dark bleak Memphis rap style combines elements of cloud wraps and very atmospheric effects at times in his music as well as modern and hard-hitting trap rap some chopped and screwed stuff - and there's a little bit of early horrorcore eeriness kind of lurching and some of the songs here - the soldier is not denzel's first project but he seems to be gaining more attention than ever off of this and while at first I didn't really see the appeal of this thing the more I listened to it the more that I saw that there was a lot of potential in what Denzel is doing at its most surface level if you're not really digging deep into this album Denzel essentially sounds like another young rapper whose voice is not really that distinct he just kind of sounds like an aggressive young dude his instrumentals are very trap inspired some of the hooks on this thing are really grimy an in-your-face and loud kind of like as if they were Waka Flocka Flame inspired however I think what's going on on this LP runs a lot deeper than that for one this is a pretty dark record and the instrumentals are incredibly crushing with the bass like the song dark and violent whose instrumental is very very spacious and chilling and even the song Zone 3 one of the more hard-hitting tracks on this LP even has a bit of darkness there in the instrumental coming from the sort of repetitive sense and Denzel is pretty consistent throughout this LP until the very very end with this very morbid and tortured vibe now though I did like the beats on this album a lot they really fit with denzel's aggressive style when he's trying to go hard they fit with his ear your style when he's trying to tell a bit more of a story just get really dark get kind of in your head with with something kind of sickening they really fit the bill but where I really ended up being the most impressed with this LP was with denzel's flow and his lyrics I don't get me wrong there are moments on this LP kind of like the song widescreen where Denzel sort of sounds like just any young rapper who has a pretty decent flow but there are moments on this album where it really feels like he has something sort of significant to say like on the track Zone 3 which essentially is a bit of a grim painting of where he comes from in South Florida and being someone from that area there are some Trayvon Martin references in this track as well as other moments on this project but what feels even more cutting is the next song on here parents where essentially Denzel is dealing with a few people who he's describing in some verses who are sort of the result of crappy parenting we have a girl who's stripping and getting naked and letting guys basically take advantage of her physically just to pay the bills we have another person who essentially over spends money all the time doesn't know what to do with his life still lives with his mother and on the song dark and violent we kind of had this character who sees no other options in front of him other than committing crime to kind of get ahead and make a way for himself in the world and there's a beat change up a significant beat change up in the second half of the song where essentially we're introduced to the character in the first half of this track and then we're sort of let into this first-person view story of him pulling off a bank heist and another thing that kind of hit me on this album is sort of denzel's willingness to sort of mix these dark aggressive themes with with things that for him are kind of either fun or nostalgic I mean obviously in the title we have a reference to Nintendo 64 we have rob banks on one track sort of name checking Charmander on the song mystical virus we have the main character of this track screaming out in pain in fear like he's Sindel the character from the Mortal Kombat video game series and even on zone 3 Denzel paints this picture of a drive-by not killing somebody who was meant to kill and then the guys involved in the drive-by getting out and cutting his hands off leaving him with nubs like the Powerpuff Girls you have some more hard-hitting tracks on here like threats and and talk that maybe the most dumb angry just in your face tracks on this entire LP but still very catchy really energetic and just kind of wrapped me up and just how mad they are really where this album gets kind of shaky for me is the second cache we have a bit of a love song on here with like me where denzel lyrically it's it's not bad I feel like his flow is a little less smooth than it is at times and he sings a little bit toward the end of the track which doesn't turn out too well in his favor it's a little confusing to me considering that he already has a good singer guesting on this track who performs really well on the hook but this isn't even really the worst moment on the album for me still here I think Denzel maintains his personality I think its tracks like bends where in my opinion because of his flow the lyrical content on this track which is honestly a little shallow and his his voice as well which i think is still kind of yet to come into its own he sounds like just any young rapper who's just swagging and kind of rapping about drugs and material things and the song denny cascade this track would be purely generic and forgettable too if it weren't for the really epic and dark beat change up in the second half and the clothes are on here a bit of cloud wrap with some awful awful singing and some lyrics that really just kind of breezed by me it was just a very uneventful closer still toward the end of the cell P I admire denzel's attempts at kind of breaking up the vibe of this album trying to deliver something a little different toward the end but I feel like as the album changes up its style and just it's emotional feel denzel drifts away from what his strong points are I feel like he could either consistently deliver these dark tracks which I think he does very well or find a way to be a little more captivating or unique on these more lighthearted and maybe just less serious songs still not a bad project and and something that I feel is going to keep me in to with whatever this dude is doing next I'm feeling a light to decent 7:00 transition but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Denzel Curie forever 
Tbztguruy6c,"my needle drops the music guru here to talk about something that I feel like has been on the lips of many people as of late who follow popular music Miley Cyrus it's no secret that as of late Miley Cyrus has been undergoing a bit of a stylistic evolution within the public eye edgy or haircut edgy or clothing some videos of her twerking surfacing onto the internet and all of these things kind of snowballed into this incredibly cringe-worthy twerk fest at this year's VMAs and this was probably one of the most buzzed-about events on MTV's network in a very long time even Miley herself reporting that there were over 300,000 tweets per minute going out relating to this performance and instead of being morally outraged over the fact that ASAP rocky threw Jason Collins under the bus for being gay people just seem to be mortified by the fact that Miley Cyrus was serving up the same kind of over sexualized PAP that pop music fans demand every day it's not like Rihanna's music isn't incredibly sexual it's not like she doesn't put forward the sexual image it's not like Katy Perry doesn't put forth a sexual image it's not like Ke$ha doesn't put forth a sexual image it's not like Lady Gaga has imposed new - good handful of times I find it funny that Will Smith's family was gawking at Miley Cyrus on stage given that their daughter Willow Smith just had a single titled summer fling she's 12 the fact of the matter is that most pop artists use a sexual image sexy clothing or sexy lyrics to push their careers forward and that goes for the boys and the girls whether it be pop divas or rappers who consistently throw sexual imagery in their lyrics or even boy bands who though they're not quite as sexualized as some female pop stars are still the objects of affection of many young girls and there are plenty of artists who are darlings and the so called progressive and forward-thinking indie community that feel in my opinion just as desperate with their attempts to be sexy Lana Del Rey sleighbells Charli XCX part of me thought that yeah maybe people are hung up on the fact that Miley Cyrus used to be this innocent tween pop star Disney affiliated but the thing is there are plenty of P in the public eye now who were doing raunchy stuff given their innocent Disney past Christina Aguilera Britney Spears Justin Timberlake Selena Gomez was in that Spring Breakers movie but still maybe Miley crossed a line maybe she got a little too raunchy for the general public especially with her new wrecking ball video where she seen licking a sledgehammer and is completely nude and a handful of shots but really ask yourself here did Miley Cyrus really step that far past this constantly shifting line of what sexual behavior is appropriate because what constitutes today is trying hard to be sexy could be commonplace tomorrow the thing is nobody's truly offended we're just kind of having a hard time swallowing Miley doing this especially since she's so over-the-top with it I really think that nobody watching this video nobody watching her videos has the right to be offended be angry really be anything except neutral on what Miley is doing because everybody is guilty of having been sucked in by an artists sexual appeal or a songs sexual appeal Anthony Fantana Miley Cyrus sex twerking being offended forever [Music] you "
u3qbwIl1l-Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new Janelle Monae album The Electric Lady Janelle Monae is an R&B and art pop singer-songwriter who turned heads in a big way back in 2010 with her album the ark Android easily one of the most ambitious and conceptual records in R&B music to come out in a very long time and the thing about this album is that it's a sequel the second and third suite in an ongoing series that Janelle Monae is kind of penning as she puts out more albums and this narrative that Janelle Monae is penning it has Afrocentric themes futuristic themes science fiction themes and even though Janelle Monae comes through really heavy with concept I think she delivers music as well that is just as grand as her conceptual ambitions the arc Android proved Janelle Monae was an incredibly versatile artist delivering tracks that were influenced by jazz baroque pop funk soul hip-hop now even though the third suite on this album was a little disjointed it's still an incredibly impressive LP and while the storyline the the narrative that Janelle Monae pulls together on her records isn't necessarily like a/b c/d one point to another point to what she does instead is just creates this entirely different world in her mind gives you glimpses of it through her music and through her lyrics and then plays inside of this playground she's created to expel some great songs about love free expression oppression people living in harmony gender equality racial struggle and I would say these themes come through in a really strong way on this new LP as well in fact The Electric Lady adds two more suites to the ongoing metropolis series and puts another empty circle at the end of all of it implying that there is more to come and honestly I have no problem whatsoever with implying that as long as Janelle monáe's music stays this funky stays this thematic stays this interesting lyrically and stays really well arranged instrumentally the most apparent thing to me on this record what really hit me as I was tripping through it and this could be a good or a bad thing are Janelle monáe's influence is for one prince who she also counts as a collaborator on this LP also the Jackson 5 Marvin Gaye Stevie Wonder Destiny's Child Solange is actually on this LP as well as Erykah Badu who's on this album as well we will get more to the influences later but another thing that hit me about this record is just how accessible it is at some points even though Janelle Monae seems to be like in her own little galaxy there's no denying the huge amount of popularity growth that has occurred from her first album to the arc Android to this new LP and I feel like her wanting to bend to those wins a little bit is displayed big time in this LPS two primary singles dance apocalyptic and queen but still even when trying to appeal in a really big way I feel like Janelle Monae puts effort into her lyrics giving them a little extra subversiveness that you could read into the song Queen has this raunchy raunchy groove and Funkadelics style keyboards playing throughout the track and lyrically it's it's really a song about being kind of the boldest person you can be and not worrying about who that offends or worries or makes uncomfortable the groove is okay it's a little corny but the end of the track is is actually fantastic really gets lifted up with these wonderful strength sections and Janelle Monae bust this rap verse with a flow that she returns to at a few other points on this album which she feels like she needs to say something poignant but the verse that she ends this track off with one of the most politically charged moments I've ever heard in a piece of her music it's a really inspirational gripping and kind of beautiful declaration of self and even catchy or dance apocalyptic to me has a bit of a retro vibe coming from the instrumentation like an old-school rhythm and blues pop kind of thing going and lyrically it seems to kind of delve into being driven crazy and being boxed in by just the limitations of the modern world the food tastes like crap you have allergies from the animals that you have as house pets your bathing and bathing and bathing but nothing really gets the funk off it's really the most bubblegum I've ever heard Janelle Monae get especially with kind of the Juicy J reference right at the beginning of the track but to me instrumentally and MA - this song has a bit of a corny quality to it just like Queen does in comparison with previous singles like cold war or especially tightrope these two lead singles definitely don't have the same amount of class or wonder or charisma but to me those two tracks which is the poppy or highlights off this album as far as the other tracks go on here Janelle Monae again kind of gets back to the grand smooth funky and pristine tracks that made the arc Android so good the song electric lady the title track off of the selfie has a hard groove bright bright since in the background and just has this smooth funky feels the instrumentation that I love Solange Knowles sounds great on the track and there's just something about the instrumentation especially some of the background vocals - after the chorus that really reminds me of like some late 90s early 2000s mainstream R&B type stuff and the thing is the R&B influences don't stop here on this album of course it's never been any secret that you're now Moana is influenced by R&B music she makes R&B music but it's almost as if nearly every track here kind of tributes a different flavor or a different era of R&B song prime time with Miguel one of my favorite tracks on here a beautiful ballad really to me kind of feels like it's it's a tip of the hat to the slow jam the song it's code which is an all right track it's a track that to me feels a little generic and style and melody and and maybe that's because it feels like a carbon copy of a Jackson 5 track there's the song get a woman which is this really jumpy hyper upbeat ballad with a really strong lyrical message and it feels kind of like something Stevie Wonder would have made back in the day it's not a bad track I feel like Janelle Monae tries to progress this sound forward by throwing a lot of effects on her vocals on some of the instrumentation - but it just ends up feeling kind of muddy and unrewarding and there are a few other tracks on her which feel like these smooth soul ballads with a really reflective personal theme going on in lyrics tracks like victory really good tune on here as well as Dorothy Dandridge eyes and the song what an experience feels like just this pure soulful 80s R&B with some electronic drums and some really strong listening synthesizers and as the song moves along it's got a little bit of a pop reggae thing going on on the back end with some upstroke guitars and as cheesy as some of that stuff was it's actually a really good song beautiful tune nice mix on the instrumentation it has a nice pristine sound to it and just refrain to this track to finish the album ah feel so fitting really what an experience The Electric Lady was overall I had a lot of positive things to say about this record the production the songs the instrumentation janelle monae singing of course which is always fantastic the interludes where you kind of have this really eccentric radio DJ talking about this robot culture that this music is set in are not only sort of eye-opening but hilarious but where the shortcomings come through on this record is in Janelle monáe's influences more than on the ark Android and on her debut EP she kind of does this dance of death with a lot of them trying to get as close as possible to them without completely drowning out her own style her own essence sometimes that works like on victory and in other moments like I said with its code it kind of just sounds like a regular old Jackson 5 track and then on top of that there are moments of fast paced pop Souls such as rock and roll and the song look into my eyes which is a sweet little piece of baroque pop that both sound like songs that could have been on Janelle monáe's last album however even though I can draw a lot of comparisons between the arc Android and The Electric Lady it's a different album at least different enough for me with its interludes and guest appearances its songs its production aesthetic it's slightly more political lyrics and the fact that all together these songs kind of feel like an all-around tribute to the world of R&B music from its inception up to the current day I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition but if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it janelle monae the arc Android Anthony Fantana forever 
28ikdznA3lc,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled factory floor album factory floor is a musical trio hailing from the UK this is their second full-length album depending on whether or not what they previously released actually qualifies as an album either way I've really been looking forward to this album merely because I loved one of the singles that drop previous to this thing I love this band's sonic aesthetic essentially factory floor makes old school dance music really rigid rudimentary electronic dance music with influences coming from old school house some acid house - and it's likely strip a lot of these sounds back to be as simple and as minimal as possible reappropriation a lot of old-school drum machine sounds and synth textures in the process and undeniably these guys pulled together some really hard edged grooves do they have momentum down to a science on this LP and a lot of their other tracks - these are beats that you just have to kind of move to however I would not say the factory floor songs are all that melodic or traditionally structured like a song with a verse chorus so on and so forth but what does that really matter there are plenty of great dance songs that aren't however it's like factory floor really wants to bring this point home like this is not poppy dance music don't you understand we're trying to keep this thing as noisy and is weird as we possibly can almost to the point where it feels like there's a really strong industrial music vibe coming off of the music that factory floor makes or a post-punk vibe and neither are that surprising considering one of the members of this trio collaborated with two members of throbbing gristle last year on a strange little industrial music & Noise album called transverse got it right here check it out it might lift your skirt on this new LP factory floor works to make these very accessible dance grooves weird by slathering them with very monotone drab moaning dead Panvel goals vocals that are so intentionally drab they kind of kill the fun mood that the dance beats bring this was a key feature of factory floors last release as well and doing this on their tracks can kind of be a little bit of a double-edged sword there are moments where factory floor with these very odd vocals and these hard edge dance beats come through with a piece of dance music that is authentically weird and kind of refreshing because of that weirdness however there are spots on this album as well where I'm not really sure what to do should I dance or should I just stand here stone-faced and be kind of weirded out as far as highlights off of this LP go there is the song fall back a track that I heard earlier this year that I mentioned in the beginning of this video that I absolutely love I love the unpredictable synth notes on this thing the really crisp crispy drums as well as the kind of pulsating bass line and Nick voids disconnected vocals feel oddly sexy this song to me is just a weird combination of being entrancing and hypnotic but also kind of wild and edgy as well as emotionally numbing and off-putting there are other songs on here too that I feel like hit that perfect balance tracks like how you say or work out which is a track that is well deserving of its title and has this synth riff that really reminds me of early Daft Punk now even though there are moments on the selkie like how you say where it feels like nick void is trying to be a little more lyrical with her vocals it is the fact that she is always singing with the deadest of deadpans that kind of makes this album feel slightly one-dimensional I guess the vocal style does make this album get a little old a little fast I mean yeah it is kind of something that factory floor specializes in and it's something that I could signify as being a factory floor thing I would know a factory floor song if I heard it because of these vocals but I wouldn't necessarily say that Nick void singing makes the songs enjoyable plus on top of it many of the tracks on this album are very similar in concept and I guess you could say that a lot of the sounds that this album puts forward won't be too unfamiliar to you as well if you are into many ADFA records release so unfortunately even though I really dug the song fall back and a few other songs on here overall this album didn't end up feeling as refreshing to me or as radical to me as I had hoped I feel like many of these tracks standing alone would work really well in a DJ set for a kind of off-kilter dance party but as far as a listening experience to almost a full hour of music on this thing while I liked many of the tracks on here I did kind of feel like I was stuck in dance music limbo like I was just in one place for way longer than I actually wanted to be overall I got to say I feel a decent 6 on this LP transition but if you've given this factory floor album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana only the strong subscribe all mistakes are intentional factory floor self-titled forever 
02FAk9TYCas,Anthony Fantino here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Holy Ghost album dynamics Holy Ghost is in New York synth pop duo that is incredibly influenced by disco electro disco but a new wave as well and this is their sophomore full-length LP I've been highly anticipating it especially since their debut album that came out in 2011 on DFA records was when I favorite albums of that year for me the band's debut is just a little slice of dance music bliss memorable choruses really sharp melodies hard just fun grooves and on top of it some of the tracks had an interesting lyrical angle to them whether it be some kind of funny personal perception like the track do it again which was a bit of a critique on dance music scenes and there's the track Jam for Jerry which was sort of in tribute to a friend of theirs who had recently passed of course James Murphy was meddling in the production on that album and it led to just an immaculately sharp and modern dance music sound for the band and he returns for this sophomore album as well making sure that the instrumentation sounds vivid and just punchy as well as so colorful I would say the only weak thing that holy ghosts whole ensemble is the vocals the thing about their debut is that the songs were just too good to deny and while I wasn't exactly expecting some kind of night and day difference between the vocals on the band's debut and the vocals on the sophomore record of theirs at least I was hoping for an album where again the songs were just too good to deny and admittedly I did get some solid tracks on this record I got some very good tracks on this record and the production is is actually still phenomenal I would actually say it's a little more detailed and layered than it was on the band's debut there are loads of different textures on this thing whether they be buzzing bouncing bass lines they're sharp sporadic bleeps and bloops really atmospheric beautiful icy chai very airy elongated notes that kind of hang in the background wonderfully as well but the vocals again they're there a little bit for the most part on these songs they're just kind of passable not really reaching too far up or down and pitch or coming off that passionate or fiery either and this can especially be an issue when you have a track that has a very repetitive verse melody where you're not really getting a lot of just mmm I still find the lyrics to be pretty interesting self-aware the song okay kind of details this story that for me feels like dealing with a bit of relationship trouble and the song dum disco ideas literally seems to be some kind of jumbled mess of phrases and ideas having to do with the band running on a really tight schedule playing on a set playing on a stage needing water going to this place going to that place and the song I want to be your hand is maybe one of the strangest love songs I've heard in a while sonically it sort of sounds like a piece of adult contemporary soft rock from the 80s the band plays it off well with some really great production and a really catchy chorus though and some sort of silly lyrics that I hope are tongue-in-cheek if anything the song actually reminds me of something aerial pink would do in the middle and maybe my favorite track on here has got to be it must be the weather dude this is one of those tracks that makes me feel like not only this holy ghost play this retro vintage style of pop music of synthesizer pop music but they make music in this genre that sounds as awesome to me as the older stuff as the classic stuff not only do the vocals on the verses on this track feel a lot more passionate to me but the layers of this song ah the way it kicks off wow the lead vocals those little background vocals that sort of chime in when you're nearing the chorus it must be the way and as the song progresses you get these stretches of time where you're just getting these little beat interludes awesome fills it's it's such a wonderful track it just it makes me feel like I'm listening to just the magic of Toto and just slowed down and smooth that and sexified and and speaking of influence there are some moments on this LP where I feel like I'm hearing guitar parts drum beats or bass lines that sound identical to guitar parts drum beats and bass lines from the three fantastic LCD Soundsystem albums now of course James Murphy had his hands in the production of this album it still kind of sticks in the back of my head when I listen to tracks such as changing of the gaurd where the guitars and drums kind of sound like something out of Daft Punk is playing at my house or dumb disco ideas whose intro sounds a lot like US v them while I don't really mind Holy Ghost directly borrowing from one of the greatest modern dance music projects on the planet why sort of take this influence and only bring it as far as a few grooves in your production sound why not take a note from the eccentricity or the over-the-top vocals it's that lack of boldness that makes songs like bridge-and-tunnel for example while they do have a really fun disco a string section laid on to the track pretty ambitious I feel like this song and maybe a few others on here embrace more dance music stereotypes then they really need to and the ending of this album while it's not bad it's not as strong as it could be certainly not as strong as the ending of their last LP the song don't look down just kind of feels like a slightly rehashed and an underwhelming New Order song and the song in the red it's a little too short to be exciting though it is very pretty I wish it was more developed and sort of brought a bit more closure and I'm kind of left wondering here where is one of the better tracks to drop before this album came out teenagers and heat fantastic song and it's actually just left off this album entirely overall I think this is a relatively solid dance music record if you're looking for dance music with some slightly sharp vocals really catchy hooks some fantastic production and grooves give this thing a listen I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this record transition but what do you think of this Holy Ghost album do you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Holy Ghost dynamics cute puppy forever 
a7VwXB21fQ8,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a track review of Arcade Fire song reflektor Arcade Fire Canadian artpop indie rock chamber pop outfit hailing from Canada Grammy award-winning as you may already know I love their last full-length album the suburbs I enjoy their previous two full-length albums quite a bit as well now they have a new album on the way titled reflector and they have dropped the title track from the album and listening to the song I'm pretty excited for the LP but I think this track may worry some people because it is kind of a stylistic shift for Arcade Fire now some people were kind of disappointed in the stylistic shift that went on on their last full-length album especially the very prevalent Bruce Springsteen influence that came through on a lot of tracks didn't necessarily ruin the album for me but some people are kind of hesitant when it comes to jumping into the whole change thing and in this track definitely brings a bit of that with a strong disco influence the band kicks this track off with a very nocturnal bassline and drum beat with some hand percussion in there - feels kind of like a loop as far as the hand percussion goes I didn't really see the appeal of what Arcade Fire was doing toward the beginning of this track I wasn't really seeing the band's take on this genre it just kind of felt like a generic reinterpretation maybe with a slightly Moody or edge however as the track progressed and it didn't take that long because I think the first huge peak of instrumentation that comes off really tense is around the 3-minute 30-second mark on this song it's really there that I feel like wow this is our Kade fire bringing to disco the kind of refinement and instrumental intensity and the kind of passion that only they could bring to the table Regina's vocals and winds vocals sound great sort of intertwined together this track to me kind of feels like just if you'll allow me to be kind of cliche for a second they feel like star-crossed lovers on this just propulsive disco beat and the music just keeps intensifying and not only is it really groovy but it's really epic too with these very sharp minor tones synth leads the sultry horns hanging in the background some string sections that might be since but either way they bring that nice atmospheric texture to just make this track feel really huge vast open lofty like it's being performed on this giant stage yeah it's disco yeah it's danceable but it's just so urgent it's like disco for the end of the world and even though a lot of this track sounds similar because the Arcade Fire is trying to keep this song in a similar structure just keep that groove going keep the pace of this track going because it is a dance song I feel like the various waves of instrumentation there's a point when like I said at the 3:30 mark where everything just kind of hangs it's a little tense there's a moment of explosion after that where we hear a little bit of backing vocals from David Bowie himself toward the back end of the track is when I feel like a lot of the backing instrumentation really starts interjecting adding to the funkiness of the song it's a track that in my opinion is just super super sexy emotional and fire it's got me pretty excited for this LP actually maybe a little bit more than the track the suburbs did before the release of the suburbs and if I am not mistaken this album is actually coming out of my birthday October 28th so that will be quite the gift if you've given this track listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why do you enjoy this disco this dance direction that the Arcade Fire is going in with this track I will say that even if you are disappointed just like the Arcade Fire's last album there were a few songs that kind of stuck out stylistically or maybe a little bit poppier maybe had a little bit more punch to them a little bit more of a wider appeal and maybe this song will fall into that category when we actually do get the full-length reflector I kind of see it being a stretch of the imagination to have every single song on that album having a disco vibe having a dance vibe to it even though I do think the band pulls it off really well on this release transition thank you for watching the arcade fire reflector single yeah forever its track review tract reviews 
oefX916-gYw,ah hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Chelsea wolf album pain is beauty Chelsea wolf a mistake California singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist and darkened songstress of the seventh circle and she initially caught my ear back in 2011 with this album overhear apocalypse and that album is really difficult to put in a nutshell because Chelsea wolf does not really stay in one spot sonically on this LP really the only common threads throughout that album are her very beautiful voice which is slathered and reverb off in the distance but has some incredible range and passion to it and the generally dark depressive and just shadowy a cult vibe that her music brings to the table there were elements of rock music on their experimental music some folk music as well sludge metal a bit of noise black metal especially with the retching vocals at the start of this thing and while their influences may be a little obvious artists like PJ Harvey some Sonic Youth a little bit of Radiohead as well some swans too she in my opinion brings them very successfully into her world and just blends them into her darkness so that they don't really feel like she's pulling directly from them any given time you're just not deafened by the reminder that she sounds like a B C and D and as far as the production aesthetic that she goes for while I don't really care for reverb to be overused much of the time and Chelsea does lay it on in a way where her songs do feel cavernous I feel like her melodies her vocals and just her very sharp and kind of at times noisy instrumentation really cut through this reverb and and connect with me in a very intimate way even though it all feels kind of like it's hanging out in this very black pitch black and because she's a little unpredictable because she really kind of stretches out on her albums I was excited to hear where she would go next would she come through with a more uniform sound or would she kind of try to reach out more and essentially Chelsea's answer to this was reach out more coming through with songs that have some electronics in them actually track track track tracks like the warden one of the songs to drop before the release of this album which is essentially some really gothic moody synthesizer pop the throbbing electronics and what sounds kind of like a sample the cousteau guitar on this track are very pretty I didn't really care for Chelsea's vocals on this song because they didn't really feel as intense as I expect her vocals to be but I did really like the creepy and kind of subtle sad melancholy tune that this track had to offer [Music] and the song destruction makes the world burn brighter while I do like the very just sour and kind of dark guitar interludes happening in between the verses as soon as the song hits it kind of feels like Chelsea is embracing a little bit of Beach rock or garage rock kind of in that bleached best coast Vivian girls Frankie rose sort of vain again a track that I'm not all too crazy about the vocals especially the vocal melody which to me is just way too sleepy just not that memorable really one of the reasons I don't care for a lot of artists who shoot for this sound a couple tracks on the first half of this thing are bust sure however there are a lot of highlights to the song Farrell love that kicks this album off more throbbing electronics just like the warden but way more intense and heavy especially toward the back end of the song where Chelsea is layering on just piles and piles of arranged instrumentation and just really chilling sounds I feel like that acoustic album she came out with before the release of this has really refined that element of extra instrumentation incorporation though the beginning of this track is a little repetitive the ending of it is so climactic and just so oh worth it and if there is a single vibe or idea that you can boil a lot of the tracks on this album down to its that on this LP Chelsea delivers a lot of slow burning and building songs that you may or may not get impatient with before the point they actually blossom in a pretty depressive fashion the song we hit a wall towards its finish has these intense string sections the track house of metal which kicks off of the drum machine ends with this really eerie plinky melody and some wispy strings - a huge atmosphere on this track and while these tracks are great it's really the second-half of pain is beauty where I feel like Chelsea kind of lights the world on fire songs like sick are total surprise they start off huge instrumentally with some really twisted vocal effects on Chelsea's singing and then around the middle point of the track it introduces some space into the atmosphere and then kelsey is singing against what feels like some progressives sent instrumental with these arpeggiated ascending and descending synth lines Chelsey's layering of instrumentation is definitely more impressive here than it was on our last full-length and on top of that her exploration into other sounds and and musical ideas and genres for the most part are successful I would say that this album has all of the great points that her last full-length did except it's a little more refined and well assembled for sure Pena's beauty is not as ferocious or as scary as Sharptooth as apocalypsis but chelsea still brings good songs to the table and a ton of sonic variety like the very tense and uncomfortable track kings or the delicate song reigns with this 3/4 time signature and some beautiful backing instrumentation or the very full key and kind of pj harvey inspired they'll clap when you're gone as far as downsides on this thing go yeah there were some tracks that again I wasn't too crazy about and there are other tracks too that I feel like meet somewhat abrupt endings but man are there moments on this thing instrumentally I feel like are so freakin beautiful that it's it's like I'm watching some kind of just moving scene in a movie or something just really emotionally instrumentally melodically and sonically intense I'm just loving this album it's it's just a beautifully depressive listen I'm feeling a decent 8 on this thing I hope hope hope you give it a listen don't let the variety throw you off and just see if it grows on you transition if you're given this Chelsea wolf album listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana only the strong subscribe pain is beauty forever

Vcjy0dr42gc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Arctic Monkeys album I am Arctic Monkeys are a uk-based rock band who a while ago now burst out of the musical scene with a fast catchy and instantaneously enjoyable full-length album whatever people say I am that's what I'm not and in my humble opinion it seems like ever since the band came out with that album this incredibly catchy ferocious and fun rock album they have just gotten more and more tame and unentertaining it's like there's just been a downward slope in energy with every Arctic Monkeys release and I just don't know why their speed and their catchy hooks and just their energy was what was so appealing about them when they first came out and I feel like they have just been trying to make may be more subtle music more mature music however I don't really feel like the songwriting the lyricism or the instrumentation has really stepped in to fill that void where the energy and the excitement once stood now rock music even though there is some incredibly commercial stuff out there even some of the most mainstream and popular and successful bands that have big singles or have had big singles on the charts have at least a little bit of subversiveness to them whether it be through a distortion pedal or through just a groove that you've got to move to like the new Franz Ferdinand LP yeah the songwriting isn't that deep a lot of lyrics about love and having fun so on and so forth but man do they know how to rock groove sorry I'm not really planning on reviewing the album at this point but but that's kind of my review I guess what I'm trying to get at is there is no reason what so ever ever there's no reason you can't come up with a reason there isn't a reason that a rock album an album somehow falling into the category or referencing or living off of the tradition of rock music should sound as flat bland middle-of-the-road as calculated and as predictable as am i can't even say that a.m. is is a more commercial move for the Arctic Monkeys because even commercial music to a slight degree has some kind of appeal to it in that it's a little viral it's catchy it sticks in your head usually I can at least count on the Arctic Monkeys to bring a heavy riff or two or at least a single that maybe I'll repeat to myself for the next few days or even a passionate vocal from Alex Turner however that does not happen on a single song here not a song not one song even the song number one party anthem is just an ironically titled snoozer piano ballad that just has nothing memorable about it whatsoever and while a lot of the kind of subtle ballad like moments the Arctic Monkeys pull together are passable they're tolerable they're kind of like background wallpaper music it's the heavy spots heavy in quotes that are the most offensive songs like are you mine just kind of feel like a bad way stripes impression whereas the song arabela maybe the worst song on this entire album not only because it doesn't really rock even though it tries to but it blatantly rips off the Black Sabbath song just blatantly absolutely no shame in ripping this rip off whatsoever and while copying and showing off your influences is not necessarily a bad thing to me I feel like the worst thing about the Arctic Monkeys pulling off this Sabbath riff is that well they don't pull it off you're going to rip off a Black Sabbath riffed at least play it so that the riff has power it has energy and you actually want to Bob your head to it don't play it like your grandma's gonna listen to it it's it's whatever you know I apologize to the grandmas there are grandmas out there who have way more guts in this album and in a nutshell that's essentially what the Arctic Monkeys had delivered and you know I hope it's not the case but I just have this feeling in my gut that makes me think that they'll continue to deliver just gutless rock music gutless to the most extreme degree the most gutless that you could be just I'm feeling a probably a decent three on this album transition if you've given this Arctic Monkeys album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it did you find it actually had some good riffs and momentum some energy some passion and if you did why anthony Fantan oh thank you for watching only the strong subscribe all mistakes we're intentional Arctic Monkeys am forever

kfGzy69KKe4,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dizzy Wright mixtape the Golden Age this guy is a Nevada rapper and a double XL freshman this is his latest project and a lot of you people asked me to review this a lot of people want to know what I think of this project and I am completely confused as to why this project or why dizzy right in general are popular I guess I just have a hard time seeing what's so exciting about dizzy writes personality flow lyrics or the instrumentals that he chooses for the most part a lot of what his songs consist of are just kind of trap music flavored weed raps to me this dude is like half of a Wiz Khalifa now if you follow rap music I'm sure a lot of you do you know and I know that there are plenty of rappers out there who try a little too hard and come off corny in the process whether or not they're trying to be really emotional and be meaningful and we can't take them seriously because their statements are so shallow or just not all that well put or if they're just trying too hard to be cool and swag Dow however in the case of dizzy Wright I don't really know what he tries to do I don't really feel like he tries to do anything he's just so middle-of-the-road all the time he rarely ever takes a chance he does not make bold statements he does not pick bold instrumentals most of the instrumentals this guy rides on in general and on this tape are either some of the most forgettable trap beats you've ever heard in your life or this boom bap flavored blandness something that sounds like 9th wonder produced it however he himself would never put out these beats because he knew that they were just kind of not that good now as far as Dizzy's lyricism topically we have again a lot of weed raps success raps there are a few tracks where I feel like he kind of goes hard on here relatively but for the most part his Cadence's and his inflections are are pretty understated for sure he has flow he sounds very comfortable in front of mic but maybe that's the problem here because it sounds like on a lot of these tracks II doesn't put that much effort into trying to put together a memorable personality or narrative in some of these tracks even a lot of the hooks that this guy puts together completely put me to sleep whether they are the trap flavored hooks like on a track such as fashion or even some of the female lead R&B flavored hooks it's just again so generic like this guy does not try to take a step in a bold or memorable direction not on one moment on this tape now I do appreciate that there are some tracks especially toward the beginning of this album that do touch down on some positive themes like loving one another work ethic having Drive having motivation these are all things that I think are great but it's not like dizzy delivers them with any kind of urgency or passion I don't even think his perception or a lot of what he says about these themes are all that unique or memorable there's this one ridiculous line on the song world peace where he says essentially that he smokes weed until the pole goes away he's an advocate of world peace I guess it would kind of be hard to engage in widespread war if everybody on the face of the planet is completely baked out of their minds but you know it's a philosophy plus it's not long before he starts diving into these generic poppy trap rap songs that don't really have that much personality either and it feels like he's just putting them together because he thinks they'll be popular tracks like can't stop or fashion still moving or about that life overall for me this mixtape from dizzy Wright is just a little too smooth smooth to the point where there's no Peaks no valleys it's just like this one bland hip-hop drone that kind of hangs in the background because there's nothing about it that really sticks out for sure dizzy right can rap there's nothing on this tape that strikes me as being incredibly horrible but there's nothing really that feels all that memorable or great either I feel like if dizzy Wright were to step out of his comfort zone and say something was actually worth remembering or ride an instrumental was actually ear grabbing then he could be a notable rapper that's worth talking about but until that happens I feel like the vibe that he goes for on this mixtape and in general is about as common as a number two pencil I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this mixtape transition if you've given this dizzy right mixtape a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why did you agree with what I said do you completely disagree if you did I'm very interested in knowing what you think makes this thing so notable and and something that sticks out to you very interested actually alright this review is my opinion only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan Oh dizzy write forever 
EMYmf-RZql0,my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new Holograms album forever Holograms re Swedish post-punk outfit who last year put out their full-length debut on captured tracks records a nice fast intense little self-titled album and now about 14 months later here we are with a new full-length it's another installment of post-punk revival ISM and as you guys may know I am not usually one to just praise nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia but I think there have been some inventive and refreshing acts to sort of toy with these darker sounds in post-punk music as of late but when it comes to Holograms I do feel like they are less distinct the band songs are pretty steeped in these classic post-punk and synth punk influences however in my opinion on their last full-length album they made up for this issue easily with just some raw energy and some really catchy songwriting with singles like ABC city or deeper tracks on the record like Orfeo or memories of sweat the band's performances just had this intense energy the vocals while over-the-top and maybe a little out of control were really passionate and captivating while stylistically Holograms wasn't really adventurous I do feel like they had this art of post-punk songwriting down to a hard science and I did like the fact that the band's approach was kind of poppy and just instantaneous however I feel like on this new record of theirs forever they're trying to change their sound in their direction up a little bit I really think the band is trying to come off loftier a bit darker on this thing with moodier guitars a bit more reverb all over everything and an increase in the use of synthesizers and synthesizers of a different tone to on the band's last full-length LP whenever a synth would hop into a track it was usually bright loud and noisy whereas on this album the synthesizers a much smooth they're much more darker like they would slide really nicely into a Joy Division single or like a goth rock song and we do see Holograms on this record experimenting with trying to write longer songs on the whole of the album not really dropping in for just a 1 minute and 40 second batch fest while I do appreciate that the band made an attempt to change and believe me this is a change that they needed to make but here I feel like they're taking away some of that raw energy and trying to build up their songs without a solid foundation case in point one of the things they string these songs out with guitar solos guitar solos that are not really that exciting and just kind of feel like the band is putting it there just to pad the song out like on the song of sacred state the opener to this album or the song at test stupa whose title is actually more edgy than its guitar playing it's actually a reference to this practice in Nordic society where elderly people or those who are just no longer of use to the town that they were living in would just sort of hop off this cliff to their death but let it be known that there are some people that do not even believe that this practice was common or even existed still for a song title this gloomy and for a band this ferocious on a majority of its songs the guitar solo here just kind of feels like a very tame and limited rehash of the theme melody of this song itself now occasionally I do feel like Holograms ambition pays off like the rush of building drums and rolling snares on the track rush with these intense guitars just tightly locking in with them I feel like Holograms have reached a new level of tightness with this track especially with the incredibly climactic finish to this song really loud really powerful and there is the closing track on here to lay us down which for me is the only honest-to-god ballad on this album not a bad thing I love that the band comes through with some slightly more melodic vocals and some really huge tubular bells what sounds like tubular bells on the chorus just building the track higher and higher but for every triumphant moment for me there is at least one kind of well mning spot and even though holograms last full-length record wasn't really all that original I do feel like that album did have some kind of element of diversity to it you had these harder faster more in-your-face tracks poppier tracks slower more depressing songs that are bleak as hell but on forever it seems like Holograms is trying to deliver a series of variants on the same synth backed goth Punk song now there are tracks on here that stick out like flesh and bone or meditations songs that are a testament to the fact that hologram still has an immense talent for hook writing which really makes refrains as basic and as simple as I'm so tired pretty freakin catchy and something that most likely you will be singing along with by the end of the song especially since the vocals are so passionate and the band repeats some of these refrains a lot of times overall I didn't really hear anything on this album that I thought was awful and I still enjoy the songs that dropped ahead of the release of forever a lot I feel like they stick out on their own but when you bring them all together this album becomes this homogenous piece of post-punk revival ISM I'm feeling a strong six on this record transition if you've given this Holograms album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional this review is only my opinion also I want to mention that I have a new music video review video over at the maker youtube channel go check that out via a link down there or on my face and that's it Anthony Fantana Holograms forever forever 
93EA4JIEgWI,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new Jonathan Rado album Law & Order Jonathan Rado singer-songwriter who you might know from the singing songwriting duo Fox agem who came out with two great full-length projects recently a reissue of the album take the kids off Broadway on jag Jaguar records and earlier this year we are the 21st century ambassadors of peace and magic which was on the same label and what I enjoyed so much about these records especially take the kids off Broadway is that John and and Sam were able to take all of these elements of 60s psychedelic pop and rock classic rock to sort of mash them together in this really jarring way but on top of just sort of being masters of manipulating a lot of these old vintage retro rock and pop sounds Sam and John I thought were really good songwriters wrote great choruses deliver great lyrics and had a lot of passion coming through on the vocals too so of course when I heard that this thing was coming out I was really excited to hear John's talents portrayed in a solo capacity but was somewhat shocked to hear this album fall very short of my expectations usually I'm not the kind of person that goes into solo efforts expecting to be completely blown away anyway because no matter how great the original band may be as soon as an artist is out of their element really anything goes and I feel like Law & Order is a testament to that fact to start with the performances the singing is really lackluster on a lot of these songs either it's not that passionate or captivating or I hear John straining in his upper register a lot on these songs making him kind of unlistenable their songs on here like hand in mine which essentially feel like a bad Adam Greene impersonation and then there are tracks such as looking for a girl like you where we are privy to this horrible falsetto which is just ear piercing Lee it hurts it literally hurts to listen to partially it's because the fall said it was not performed all that well plus there's a heap of distortion on this thing making it pretty unintelligible and on top of that it's not really mixed or eq'd all that well either it's really enough to make you want an instrumental track of which there are a few on here like the song dance away your ego which essentially is just some throwaway cheesy organ rock that I'm never gonna remember and truth is I kind of want to forget it because of how many mistakes are going on in the playing on this track it's like the drums and the guitars aren't even in sync some of the time it's just kind of a little old-school pop rock groove that John can't seem to pull together instrumentally I think the closest that John comes to delivering a decent song is the track faces the melody especially through the guitar leads is really sharp it's catchy but honestly stylistically the song doesn't have all that much personality to it it's not that distinct it's steeped a little bit too much in that whole Brit pop mod rock tradition to be memorable on its own accord and this is surprising to me because because John through Fox agem has a history of taking these sounds and doing something crazy over the top and etc quit them but here on this album we see John treating these sounds he's not even really treating them he's just kind of copying them in this really unflattering way if the production and the singing and the songwriting were up to snuff that would be one thing but man even as kind of a nostalgic trip back this album does not work unfortunately Jonathan Rado on Law & Order when he is not delivering some some bad performances or some weak singing he is just indulging in some generic songwriting that has some very middle-of-the-road retro rock and pop sounds with the exception of the track pot of gold which is a pretty nice drum machine back piece of synth pop and I want a Fela which is like this distorted fuzz doubt psyche rock nightmare that reminds me of something ty Segall would do Segal I will never know occasionally there is a decent tune on here and Jonathan does do a good job of capturing these retro sounds and vibes but I still think a majority this thing is is pretty unlistenable I'm feeling a light for on this album transition if you've given this John Rado album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Jonathan Rado Law & Order forever

you won't just gather a few other reps interruptor Jones alright well I see the cynic is a he's a bronx rapper he's a few projects deep right now is put out some mixtapes in the past but this is his first full-length album which I believe he's trying to sell I've heard verses from him in the past he was featured on that hot sugar EP that was dropped last year but he really really made a lasting impression on me earlier this year when I heard him drop a verse on to that Milo mixtape cavalcade you know he doesn't just rap with anybody and vice versa you got to be able to step to Milo lyrically and philosophically and YC brings plenty of that on this new album of his gnk is a little bit of a concept album dealing with race religion and God power and ego topics that have been touched down upon multiple times in hip-hop music but rarely does it come off as focused and as well thought-out and is well produced as what I'm hearing here the beats on this project are done by Frank Drake a producer who I'm not particularly familiar with but I do think working with him track for track has resulted in a great project it seems like by working with one dude every twist and turn YC is able to make topically and philosophically Frank Drake is there to accompany it with a very well fitting instrumental like the track the pox which is the first full-length song on this album and with the very drum heavy verses on this track and it's the space around these rhythms with YC flowing over these beats really well it kind of feels like the start of something it's really cinematic it's like a gathering a sermon is beginning and the really grainy keyboard keys that kind of feel like they were played out on a Mellotron or something like that they sound gorgeous and just kiss the intro of this track and the hook really well with the run so that's you can't and this track fits into the overall theme of this album in numerous ways to POC Shakur kind of being revered as a hip-hop God fitting in with that God theme and the PAC's also kind of sounds like the PAC's which is an interesting play on words and the song heavenly I love the instrumental here as well with the soulful vocal sampling and the very jazzy horns it's very beautiful uplifting instrumental and YC comes through with an uplifting message lyrically as well trying to get the listener to think more of themselves and think more directly about their relation to God however even though this seems like a good thing on this track there is sort of a dark side to the mentions of God and religion on this album they come through the strongest on the song God complex a track that is kind of surprised for why I see the cynic because he sings on this song from back to front with a vocal melody that kind of sounds like Suzanne Vegas Tom's diner which is pretty interesting considering that song was sampled on the Milo mixtape that YC appeared on earlier this year I'm just sort of imagining Milo and YC like jam and some Suzanne Vega or something Y C's vocal melody does get a little repetitive throughout the song and it becomes pretty apparent pretty fast that he isn't the greatest singer in the world but he does hold his own he doesn't really sing outside of his vocal range on this track and it's really the lyrics that kind of Wow and keep this song engaging YC talking about how godly he is and using his powers to strike fear in people because he kind of needs people to worship Him in order to feel good about himself in the lyrics he says he'll part the widest ocean and bust the world wide open and with the instrumental in the background just with these plucked beautiful strings being played it just has this really dramatic theatrical element to it that is really fitting the same kind of mentality and in portrayal runs through other tracks on here - like molotovs at Poseidon or power trip except these songs go a little bit harder have some more aggressive instrumentals and you really hear y'see rap on these tracks especially at the star of molotovs episode in which I mean it's it's not a deep set of lyrics that kick this track off but you've just got to kind of imagine what he's saying at the beginning of this song and some interesting and powerful imagery of him being godlike a shooting at Zeus you know I'm cutting through my noose I'm pulling up my roots every bars like this large powerful grandiose gesture that if you think about it actually being a reality it's pretty scary that someone would be that but you do have moments on here like on the track power trip where why see kind of puts his godlike image into a fetal position sort of portraying that there are some chinks in this armor this more vulnerable side of why see is also on display on tracks like the heaviest cross where he kind of directly addresses the fact that he's a musician and he has his issues just like any musician does putting themselves out there when dealing with people that don't like their music whether it be through hateful comments or sort of very critical blog reviews he kind of just comes to the conclusion that this because of his line of work is his cross to bear it's his issue to deal with and then after this he quickly moves on to his mother having her own cross to bear raising kids getting her master's so on and so forth closing track on here being God's her breaks that fourth wall again and addresses the listener directly either thanking them for listening or asking them to kind of take part in spreading the word on this music he again kind of displays a bit of weakness by saying that he feels threatened because he's a free open thinker and that's kind of a dangerous thing for someone to be while I do think it is a really personal and introspective finish to the album I guess my issue is that I didn't really see this song pulling the whole concept of this album together into kind of a nice tight little package that's really my biggest letdown with this LP though even though YC doesn't meticulously assemble this album together in this flawlessly segwayed concept album it doesn't necessarily mean that the songs themselves are bad actually a majority of them are great the only shortcoming on some of the tracks here I think are the hooks why see maybe a god but I think hooks sometimes are kind of his kryptonite either they don't add to the song in a way that's all that meaningful or at least meaningful in an obvious way kind of like on the song Murphy's Law which I think the hook only really makes sense after the second verse when he's kind of talking about the evolution of the mind 999 because on the hook he's essentially saying fuck bitches get money i think the only hook on here that i really disliked was the chorus on know-it-alls not necessarily because it didn't make sense to me but why cease singing on this track is incredibly off pitch and not really in a cute or interesting way just really kind of killed the hook here for me still lyrically it is a very interesting song that plays into ycs relationship I think his relationship with God and when you dive into this album overall even though I feel like it doesn't all tie together in a very clean way it does portray this really deep and personal back-and-forth struggle with these issues that this album addresses like I said earlier God power ego race the last of which is specifically address on the track the n-word all I know is this sort of mental wrestling match is is really interesting blow-for-blow so as far as his lyrics go I find YC to be really fascinating dude vocally I think he does have some personality he's got a bit of a speech impediment that comes through on his vocals a bit but he seems to sidestep it sometimes it doesn't ruin his verses or make them difficult to listen to in my opinion it adds character and as far as his flows go he changes him up he has a good command of flow I wouldn't say he goes ultra fast a lot of the time really he's kind of keeping it at a mid pace to focus on delivering a message in the lyrics I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this album turn so yes I am heavily endorsing this why see the cynic album right now definitely check this thing out if you're an artist like A Tribe Called Quest Kara's one most def del the funky homosapien this review is my opinion only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional magic happy magic love you YC the cynic gnk forever

CYKt8BRwoDc,my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new underachievers mixtape EP project the Lords of Flatbush underachievers hard-hitting New York rap duo that dropped a pretty good mixtape much earlier this year through brain feeder indigo ISM I wouldn't say I loved it I enjoyed it I still enjoy it listen to it every once in a while I think it's pretty interesting that the duo brings across a nice blend of different hip hop influences some of that southern stuff some of that boom-bap stuff some of that cloud wrap stuff but it's not like they have one track that sits in one direction and one track that sits in another it really comes together in sort of a seamless fashion with beats that feel kind of trippy layered psychedelic the instrumentals are seriously mystical on this project and for the most part the lyrics kind of tip their hat in that direction - it's a - and a que have some incredibly aggressive flows however I saw that there were some shortcomings in the lyrics as far as diversity goes while the underachievers do have a really solid theme together having to do with souls and third eyes and just higher levels of thinking of course a lot of drug use as well it feels like a lot of the tracks are more based on buzzwords than they are narratives or just some really quotable lines still I dig the underachievers vibe I'm looking forward to when they drop another full-length project into the future but it seems that we had this little EP size deal with Lords of Flatbush to kind of hold us over some production on this thing done by lex luger trap music titin lex luger kind of a risk factor for the underachievers a lot of people who sort of perceive that music to be ignorant see the underachievers being a kind of a higher-level mentally and I feel like jumping on with Lex for this project has its positives it has its negatives for one I do not find the instrumentals on this tape to be as wonderfully melodic as the stuff I was hearing on indigo ISM however it is a little more hard-hitting it is a bit catchy er sometimes a K and it settle their flows down into a simpler more southern vibe to maybe gain some more appeal factor if that is the case though I don't really see them delivering the kinds of infectious and overly repetitive hooks that you would typically hear from an artist that usually rides these kinds of beats I could actually hear maybe even Chief Keef just yelling something ridiculous over some of these instrumentals toward the middle and back end of this project there are some beats that feel like they could totally slip into the Indigo ISM tracklisting like melody of the free a fantastically soulful and jazzy instrumental that I think is my favorite of the bunch however my biggest disappointment on this tape other than some of the beats and maybe some of the vocals sounding a little muddy in the recording is that the lyrics are not that surprising and I feel like the underachievers really could have used a bit of a change or development with their lyricism while again the flows are aggressive when they need to be to just keep things kind of hard in your face and just high energy there aren't many tracks where the underachievers venture out of their comfort zone just kind of shouting again those buzzwords and kind of making sure that you don't go too many lines without hearing at least one of them there are some tracks on here where it feels like the underachievers do try to come together with a concept like this on fake fans or melody of the free which are tracks where the underachievers really try to dissect the fame that they've received since the Indigo ISM tape got so popular dealing with people who are into their stuff but maybe not right or die I guess overall I was just a little underwhelmed by this thing I was hoping that the lex luger production because I heard that this tape was coming through the woodwork would be a bit more hard-hitting and while I guess I don't expect the underachievers to say anything incredibly deep over this lex luger production I'm still kind of waiting for the moment when they say something a little heavier a little loftier something that really delivers on the promise that is essentially brought to the table by the fact that they're constantly talking about their knowledge their enlightenment their third eye their higher state of thought when that comes through I'll be psyched until then I'm really kind of feeling a light too decent five on this thing but if you've given the Lords of Flatbush a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan Oh forever 
9W7aWYbjd6c,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dawn of midi album dis no mia dawn of midi is a california instrumental music outfit whose musical influences really reach far and wide experimental jazz minimalism and electronic music are among the many things sort of play out in the many tunes on this album and that list of influences had me pretty freaking psyched to check this thing out it really kind of seemed like it was definitely something that was up my alley there are albums in the recent past that i have praised pretty heavily for bringing together elements of acoustic instrumentation acoustic sounds and executing them in a way that feels sort of chilly repetitive techno or house music influenced artists like for tet or john hopkins or even that new portico crash no record what sounds like a guitar some upright bass piano and various pieces of percussion and executing them in a way that feels really rigid mechanical on the surface it sounded really cool with these off-kilter bass lines that only consisted of a few notes very minimal minimal piano leads this is hand these just twittering rhythm sections all the instrumentation is just in this busy lockstep as if it's just all the inner workings of a grandfather clock or something like that and while dawn of midi is really that rigid they're also really that sterile to the point where a lot of the grooves that these guys are rocking honest to god kind of sound like i'm listening to a broken record kind of skipping over and over and over and over and over and who it doesn't really add much to these songs emotionally or compositionally I think pretty much all the songs on this LP build up a little bit and then reach a point of plateau where they just kind of hit this tension and never really release it resolve it or even build it higher even as the band is introducing or subtracting pieces of instrumentation so yeah for me the grooves are a little too mechanical not all that visceral but I guess on top of that there's not much melody to a lot of these tracks either even though there are elements of tone to this album it's like every piece of instrumentation only adds into the track in a rhythmic way even when you do get a baseline that feels a tad bit embellished or a little piano that ascends or descends further than two or three notes it comes off so simple that it's really hardly worth remembering so while dawn of MIDI definitely has a vibe and has succeeded in creating an instrumental blend that is really stiff clearly it's intentional it just doesn't add up much to me plus by the end of the record a lot of the Tambor's and sounds that they're working with just gets stale mostly because the Tambor's and the grooves these very sterile against sterile grooves are really all you can focus on for the duration of this record it's not like there is an element of melody or a strong element of sound play to kind of pull your attention away from those things really those are the only things you could think of for this entire LP and they only go so far as being interesting I'm feeling a decent five on this album but what did you think of this dawn of MIDI album did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is about it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional this review is my opinion anthony Fantana dawn of midi forever 
F74Lu3d3goI,everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and just going to take my glasses off for a second because it's hot in here and it's time for a vinyl update where essentially we look at some recent vinyl additions to my record collection yeah hey we're gonna do this one raw just like we always do trying to keep things as unedited as possible because you know these are just kind of chill they're laid-back chairs squeaking all that good stuff alright this first record actually comes from the eclectic music Society of coolness they have an online record store this album and more are available there the sponsor of this video here we go Outkast a Clemen I all right I'll cast a criminai classic album from this southern hip hop duo Andre 3000 big boy for a lot of people this is their favorite Outkast album I can understand why not only are Andre and Big Boi at the top of their spitting game but there are some great songs on this LP like the return of the G or return of the G rather which you know has a deeper meaning some social commentary going on with that track and then you have tracks like the art of storytelling parts 1 & 2 another song that's really worth re another two songs that are really worth reading into and this record where records rather spread across three different LPS sometimes two tracks to a side though that's not much of a surprise considering how long some of the tracks on this LP are like seven minutes and up pretty long for hip hop songs you know the Outkast is not screwing around on on this album they weren't rather and these are all out of order because I was listening to it earlier and you could definitely tell not only from the incredibly smooth melodic and colorful instrumentals on these LPS that Outkast on these records these twelve inches rather that Outkast is huge influence on modern artists you know specifically Big KRIT but I mean southern hip hop maybe not in general with the whole app thing going on right now but I mean but when it comes to people talking about southern hip-hop outcasts if you're talking about the greats are mention always mentioned again that record came from the good people over at eclectic cool cool alright this next one is another hip-hop album reissue recent reissue from lighting the Attic records pendulum records digua planets blowout combs Ishmael Butler over here mister butterfly on this album and of course the rest of diggable planets as well but you remember Ishmael if you've been listening to more modern hip-hop stuff from Shabazz Palaces and this is a classic of there's maybe some people prefer there I believe this is their second album some people prefer their debut a little bit more because they had some more accessible songs but if you listen to this this is a bit more of an interesting release if you're into that Shabazz Palaces stuff more because you could tell even back in the 90s that things were heading in that direction because of the vocals and the singing and the really smooth subtle flows and just the jazz rap sounds just now with Shabazz Palaces it's much more strained and psychedelic and trippy and just odd in terms of the the sampling in just the shape of the instrumentals but I mean it's it's cool to listen back to this and sort of see the connections you know and and and see what things at this time are sort of still being carried out right now in the Shabazz Palaces project now for this reissue they put together some good packaging not only is this just a huge thick sleeve just to hold all of it but you've got like this nice big sheet opening we're essentially kind of they're giving you a little bit of background on blowout comb and just Shabazz Palaces around this time in their career you've got these great great record sleeves that not only kind of go a little bit into some of the members of that you know give you all the credits and everything for all the songs just kind of these additional Doodlebug branches out you know it's it's it's a really sort of in-depth package for this record this is a poster I believe we've got a poster over here as well I mean it wouldn't be a an epic reissue without a poster look at that look at that how many rooms do you think this was on in the 90s you know people were just like putting this on there Wally yeah I'm really into take about planets bro I don't know people are always saying bro back then I was I was alive back then I distinctly do not remember people saying bro a lot at least to me anyway people probably saying hey little kid and more awesomeness in the packaging um you know if you're into Shabazz Palaces I would get into this and if you're into diggable planets and you only own this record on CD or just digitally it's it's a really worthwhile reissue so there you go next another compilation from analog Africa Diablo stay or eat them all 1975 to 1985 part 1 even though this comes from sort of that 10-year era of music this picture on the front looks much older looks like it came from 10 maybe even 20 years previous but but you know still um not a bad compilation 4 sides on this thing almost 16 tracks a lot of Latin music a lot of Latin grooves I wasn't completely enthralled with the tunes on this thing or at least most of them they just had a whole ton of just crews upon grooves upon Latin grooves on this thing and you know they were talking about the the calling this rather the Colombian melting pot on the front and kind of insinuating that this is sort of Afrobeat music fused with Latin music and then maybe you could sort of make that claim with the you know afro-colombian blend not blend but but what I want to say you know afro-colombian people of on top of the fact that you know you have these songs that are just very hypnotic very repetitive on the groove but uh maybe I was looking for something just a little bit tuneful and and for something this groove based I didn't find some of the songs on here to be that hard-hitting or sort of you know getting me and kind of a wild like oh crap I have to move to this um but still you know if you're looking for some Latin flavors that are groove heavy then definitely check this thing out next another groove oriented record but of a completely different variety public image limited second edition aka metal box this is essentially their sophomore album their metal box album reissued and retitled as second edition since I guess they didn't want to continue calling a metal box since when they reissued it they just couldn't go continue continuing to call it metal box since it's no longer in a metal box but essentially here this is John Lydon of the Sex Pistols forming a new band after these Sex Pistols had essentially dissipated experimental rock post-punk dance in floyd influenced music music that was influenced by the dance music of that time in the 70s but incredibly noisy just bleak kind of dark and depressing yet exciting and aggressive and just sort of an all-out groovy sort of assault really sharp just ear piercing guitars on this thing as well as John Lydon is just very manic vocals I'm digging the cover art on this thing sort of the Warped pictures of the band members and yeah just like a really intense record not only other faster moments the latter moments just like wow but the slower just like more depressing moments like Swan Lake the opening track on this LP one of the slowest and just sort of weirdest tracks on the entire thing are just kind of like so you know if you're looking for something little out there because this is definitely less conventional than their sec then than their debut record but is still buy a lot of critics haled a lot more for being a lot bolder and just more odd you know if you're looking for something like that to check it out all right this next record fast these guys are a German rock outfit who are incredibly interesting in terms of their backstory and just sort of some of the stuff that they did outside of their music getting a really huge payday from Polydor records for their debut album going on to Virgin Records and selling a 12-inch album their third record I believe for the price of a single so a full-length record for the price of a single and ended up rocketing the record up the charts for how cheaply they sold it and they sort of sold it that cheap just to just prove a point about the charts and that kind of stuff or at least how the charts worked at the time um and and yeah it's just basically some psychedelic rock a little bit of drone stuff on here experimental rock crap rock on here but the songs that are going to stick out most are the ones that are kind of like these oddball rock and roll songs there there is a kind of like a two-track thing going on this record you do have these weirder more abstract songs that are just kind of sonic explorations that are really interesting and then you've got these rock tunes that I imagine are maybe at least slightly tongue-in-cheek that kind of remind me of our Stevie more in a sense with how slightly goofy they are but still incredibly enjoyable and just fun you wouldn't think that a record this odd would have a sleeve that's just kind of so simple and bare but you know Faust was always pretty unconventional with their uh gonna continue Foust was always pretty unconventional with their with their cover art and it's got a really cool sleeve in here you know actually sort of giving a picture of this Faust and Henry cow tour dates thing um Henry cow another experimental rock band that you should definitely get into enry cow and let's do this toad endless night these guys are sludge metal band bringing black metal together with sledge metal and I reviewed their record recently this one oh oh look at this occult ritual going on over here this thing is heavy as hell as oh and really dark too though I didn't love this thing I do wish it was longer and I do wish the songs had a bit more variety to them this is a good thing this is a good good thing again heavy as hell and I think when I gave it a listen on vinyl it struck me as being a lot more bassy than when I was just listening to the mp3s of this thing and this final couple of records that I'm going to mention are not really records that you should listen to simply for you know just sitting back and like ah or maybe you're that kind of person you know if you are let me know um wow wow wow I have two of these and there's a reason I have two because these records come as a set if you go to heavy listening calm you could pick up these records if you'd like um they're a bit of an interesting experiment basically both of these albums or both of these twelve inches on both sides have a single Neverending I guess it sort of ends until you hit the end of the record has a single just long lasting low-end frequency that just plays continuously and essentially what they expect you to do is take these records put them on turntables maybe in a DJ set maybe you just set up two different stereos and then you set up the turntables and you essentially just kind of hang around and create your own and create a rumble or sort of do whatever you want with them in terms of pitch control I think these records are kind of like an instrument in that you can take them hook them up to a DJ set and you could adjust the pitches play intervals and I guess sort of in a way play them kind of like trombones I'm sure for people who have DJ sets or DJ set up where you can you know do some scratching with these things where you can you know adjust the tones where you can add some reverb or some echoes and really kind of get weird with the effects these could be an interesting little tool over here so yes Wow Wow over a heavy listening comm I don't think they come cheap but if you can get a hold of these and you think that you know you can perform with them that you can do something with them you know playing out or make some kind of you know just live sound experience with them then definitely get into this you know or if you know I imagine you wouldn't have a DJ setup if you weren't going to be playing out all that often but I guess what I'm getting at is if you want to try to do something in the comfort of your own home um you know just make sure that you have the setup to do so if you actually go forward and get this that's a that's all that's all I'm saying I guess but again if you could do something with this live do look into it because it could definitely be an interesting experiment and yeah that's it those are the records that I am going to talk about in this video in this vinyl update thank you for watching what did you think of these records have you listened to any of them love them hate them why I guess what I want to say at this point in the video is that over there you can click on a playlist where you could watch my entire vinyl collection video series because I know I'm just kind of showing you the new stuff but all the old stuff and just all of my other records in alphabetical order with newer vinyl T updates on top of that are all thrown into this playlist okay cool Anthony Fantana vinyl forever 
kVZXrqUYKyA,my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new king cruel album six feet beneath the moon quickly before I get into this review I want to mention something in my last review I feel like I need to respond there was just a bit of back-and-forth with me and just a few other people and essentially I was wearing a really good shirt in that video it's it's right over there display it put display the shirt despite us oh yeah it's it's yellow black kind of flannel pattern I really I really love it it's it's really becoming one of my new favorite shirts and I thank those who commented on it kink rule is a singer-songwriter based out of the UK this is his first album first full-length album under this name of his he changed his name and about and a 2010 beginning a 2011 when he signed a true panther sounds before then he was known as zoo kid had some band camp music up that was grabbing a lot of buzz eventually he put out an EP on true panther sounds that I reviewed enjoyed quite a bit I felt like some of the songs on this thing were a little half-baked I also wish it were longer above all things that were presented on this EP I really dug kink rules aesthetic with the bare bones instrumentation the really sharp reverb guitar and his voice uh his voice this dude is a low tone crooner and I love singers like that but more than most people that sing in this register he makes music that just is sharp it's bright it's stark King cruel instrumentally tends to run a little minimal and even when he does have some more backing instrumentation he usually leaves it so spacious that there's just a lot of room around everything ah but it feels like king cruel tries to take this very little amount of instrumentation and make it as loud and as expressive as possible with these guitar strumming patterns that emphasize these just really tiny sharp up strokes he's just really fluid with these strumming patterns and his vocals which are just really emotive eccentric loud and raw yelling a lot of the time I wouldn't say screaming but he does just have some force to the way that he sings to the point where he loses control of his pitch and really his composure part of what makes this album so good and so entertaining is that few artists are this early in their career and have such a defined sound and on top of that it helps that kink rule has sharpened his songwriting chops up a little bit he was able to effectively build up excitement for this album with some really good singles to drop before this thing the song rock bottom which unfortunately does not make it on to this LPS tracklist it's a shame very good song would have added to this thing in my opinion but the song easy easy which kicks this album off from the moment the guitar strumming pattern comes in and and King cruel sings the same ooh boo boo somos boo I'm just hooked that thick accent that voice the vivid lyricism that's coming through with the storytelling and even when he just loses control of his voice in the chorus and just wails on these guitar chords it's such an explosive point in the song and still with just those vocals and those guitars it feels incredibly powerful it's like I'm listening to some sort of intimate performance and he's just plugged an electric guitar into a small amp and is playing in a chapel or in a stone underpass underneath a downtown London Bridge it's a great track to me though I don't think it's necessarily going to be for everybody because of kink rules voice it's a bit of an acquired taste however if this track does not turn you off I would say just continue on if you are into this track though there are still some questions that are worth asking will King cruel stay so minimal and so simple that the entire album will sound essentially the same will he be able to come through with a diverse LP for the 50 minutes that this thing lasts and I don't really feel like he runs into those problems per se kink rule does change things up instrumentally from track to track carrying his vocals with either guitar synthesizers some loop drumbeats some background vocals from himself or even a little bit of piano and there's kind of a fresh approach in how he brings these vintage pop and rock aesthetics together with some subtle trip-hop and hip hop beats there are moments where it kind of feels like he's doing a little spoken-word slash rapping and I love the fact that he's able to incorporate some of these older sounds but not have this album feeling like a throwback or some kind of pointless tribute to an essentially dead musical movement however what I think is going to grab people even more than the genre labels for this album are the emotions of this album this thing is such a drag however the sad and kind of wild demeanor can only go so far if the songs aren't great all the way through because there were tracks on this thing that had me wondering whether or not they needed to be here if the cell P really needed to be 50 minutes long there are a handful of tracks on this thing that don't do too much for me like the track 4 & 2 which for all of its instrumentation loop drum beats and the watery synthesizers some sound effects and these really noodley guitar lines that play throughout the track there's not really a solid tune coming out of any of it and I like kink rules voice over the track but it just kind of feels like vocally he is just wandering this track to me feels like really half of a track stretched out to three minutes long and I feel pretty much the same way about the track sealing and baby blue meanwhile the crocodile and Neptune estate two tracks on here that aren't terrible but they don't really feel like they need to be five minutes long again we kind of have a case of kink rule stretching out ideas that don't really stay interesting for the duration of the song and the only change is the only significant changes he's bringing throughout the track is that he's just going wild on his vocals though I will say the instrumental to Neptune estate is one of my favorite instrumentals off of this LP with it's awesome swelling soulful horns I got to say my initial listens to this LP were pretty exciting I was actually really thrilled to get through this album the first few times certainly because of all the talent that's clearly on display with King cruise just very unique voice his Wetty sysm his sound and his production his blend of influences all positives for him but his vocals really started to wear thin for me on the more musically vague tracks still there are some fantastic songs on this LP like borderline the second track off of this thing I love the way that Qing cruel uses these meandering vocal lines on the verses and contrast them with a beautifully melodic hook that just like takes my breath away every time I listen to it the way it just kind of floats up with these just ethereal tones in the background on top of his skipping guitar rhythms and the song a lizard state may be my favorite track on here I love the fact that Qing crew lands on top of a really fiery horn riff and a great horn solo too on this track put some tight intense drumming I think in the future might be fantastic to hear him write more concise songs like this and do it over a full band the last couple songs on this LP are beautiful ballads in my opinion really kind of bring that dreary edge home for this thing overall I really dug on this LP I'm feeling a light a decent 7 on it but if you've given this King cruel album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is about it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional I want to give a shout out to you Jonah Anthony Fantana King cruel six feet beneath the moon forever 
YFTUk2n9QCU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ASAP ferg album trap Lord ASAP ferg New York based rapper member of the ASAP mob and this is an album that I have been dreading reviewing a little bit to be completely honest partially because of the singles that came out before this album was released like the song work as well as the track Shabba Ranks really huge trap music influence on these songs however lyrically and just sort of flow and and vocal wise what ASAP ferg was sort of reminding me of was kind of like a goofier version of ASAP rocky if you can imagine that I guess there are elements of his shtick that you could also liken to rap artists such as Trinidad James little B waka flocka flames but he clearly has this deeper appreciation for the classics in hip hop and great instrumentals and good flows and overall just a more holistic aesthetic because this album as weird and as goofy and as bad as it can be sometimes does feel like it flows really well from track to track with interludes that segue and bring tracks together and just sort of make trap Lorde kind of a seamless experience and also on this LP I think ASAP ferg brings a ton of humor and charisma and just some personality that may not have been completely apparent just from the earlier singles and from where I've heard him featured before still despite I guess some initial reservations Ferg does come through in a lot of ways on this LP especially instrumentally definitely ASAP Rocky's great taste in beats have been passed over to Ferg for this project a lot like ASAP Rocky's last album you're getting these elements of trap rap southern hip hop chopped and screwed Memphis stuff on top of a little bit of cloud wrap making things really cavernous muscle bruised consistently on this LP the instrumentals are loud they're epic their dark they've got a lot of synth textures and flavors I love the opening track from this thing let it go the beginning of this album is actually pretty solid for the first 30 tracks but let it go man with the hand percussion and the kind of Middle Eastern to me synthesizers over these trap beats to me kind of feels like ASAP ferg is this trap Sultan in the middle of this smokey harem the song Shabba Ranks definitely brings that vibe to me too I dig that song as well that has grown on me but I do think the song gets a little shaky toward the end with Ferg's flow getting kind of just a little weak and ridiculous but it's not like the song didn't start ridiculously with it being kind of in tribute to this 90's dancehall rageh star that just kind of plays into the overall absurdity of ASAP Ferg's personality and this album really I think my favorite tracks on this album are songs like this and Lord where essentially you have these trap instrumentals just hitting really hard and just having a lot of reverb on them a lot of Darkness coming from the melodies on these tracks to me the synthesizers on Lord are incredibly sinister as well as on the song Fergie Vicious and the remix for work which is cold and as hard as hell especially with the schoolboy q verse on the back end of this track and I actually dug the song Mertes something quite a bit too with waka flocka flame which has this awesome opera sample going on in the instrumental not usually something I like in my hip-hop beats but it was kind of applied subtly enough to help out the rising action of the song and just sounded great it wasn't strung out too long it wasn't to God he was just in the background first let's second added some character Tertre and of course over these instrumentals another kind of melodic component that you get his first voice when he is singing if he is doing it well and you can manage to tolerate it there is some serious Bone Thugs influence coming through on this thing again just like that Live Love ASAP just like the long live ASAP but Ferg does take it a step further and invites bone thugs-n-harmony onto this album for a feature on the track Lord that I just mentioned and it is fantastic just machinegun flows one after another really thrilling exciting other hip-hop greats are attributed on this LP like on the song out my face with be real from Cypress Hill the first verse on this track onyx is on the song bringing these really loud scream choruses sticky-fingers from onyx has a verse - I think we're Fergus little shaky is when he is pulling together some hooks or structuring songs or even singing singing is really the Achilles heel of this project hood Pope while maybe hearing ASAP ferg sing might be funny or sort of entertaining for a minute there's no reason it should be lasting for three minutes and 30 seconds on top of that the track for outh I can't think of anything less sexy than hearing ASAP ferg sing as if it's some kind of kid cudi Drake collaboration about a threesome and as far as the closer on this LP goes cocaine Castle I can appreciate that lyrically Ferg is trying to come in and and say hey listen drugs will destroy your life except I need my album trap Lord and I'm rapping about trapping and murdering people throughout much of this thing there are some spots where the choruses feel a little half-assed or obvious like dump dump and the track didn't want to do that while I do think it's kind of silly that again ASAP Ferg raps about murdering people quite a bit and yet seems to want to make this track hear about his friend getting murdered over his chain either way what really ends up killing this song off is the incredibly long vocal interlude in the middle where you have one person telling another person about the entire incident on the phone and then the person being called getting angry about it still despite that handful of complaints I don't think this is a bad album it's incredibly fun ignorant silly and just ridiculous again it's not like there's this incredible depth to the lyrics and when ASAP ferg does manage to bring that for me it's kind of like thankfully this album doesn't make you have to choose between highbrow and lowbrow all too often it's an interesting blend of both the ASAP mob I think is doing a fantastic job of bringing this absurd ignorance together with just kind of high fashion and more refined aesthetics I guess that's how you could put it I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing but if you've given trap Lorde what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional shout out to V Bannon Anthony Fan Tan Oh ASAP ferg trap Lord forever 
RrqqzJfc6qk,my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where I review a track it's the new death grip song birds if you don't know Death Grips by now they are an experimental hip-hop trio from the Sacramento area in California they put out one of my favorite hip hop albums in 2011 and two of my favorite hip hop albums last year in 2012 they have a new full-length LP which they say is going to be released on their own label third world's in 2014 sort of in tandem or with support from gram old records which is kind of an interesting and funny music business connection considering that the band completely sploded their last record deal by allowing their album to prematurely leak and all their fans pretty much downloaded it plus it has a penis on the cover the latest little tidbit of excitement having to do with Death Grips is this new track of there's birds and this track brings up a lot of questions for me about where Death Grips is gonna go from here especially in the experimental hip hop realm where they have trail blazed a little bit to the point where they have just brought a lot of attention to themselves to the genre rappers and producers hopping on this bandwagon and just sort of trying things out for themselves most notably Kanye West recently with his new full-length LP we could have been somebody you had to bet somebody take it back to the first pilot when you tried to first matter and Captain Ellie and I'm sweaty well as excited as I was to try this track out it felt a little bit like kind of Death Grips as usual with some newer ideas and just some some slight changes of pace one of the viewers of this show points out Nick Palmer there are some interesting samples going on in this track one of which I'm pretty sure is Muttley who is a cartoon character that you might be familiar with if you grew up watching hanna-barbera's laff-a-lympics there's just this weird quiet laughing sound that's happening going on very subtly in the background like the 106 point and of course there are a league of other noises flow throughout this track that are just as esoteric and obscure that's the thing about Death Grips they're so freakin esoteric puzzling and cryptic and maybe the reason that they continue to sort of stay on the lips of so many people who are generally music fans and people who are in the music press is that we haven't really technically figured them out yet it seems like they continually do things that are bad and horrible for their careers and we're kind of stuck wondering what's their motive to start with the track instrumentally I do dig this song quite a bit it has this blazing opener with these warped vocals screaming this refrain over and over and over but it's so twisted and manipulated that it feels like it's synthesized electronically generated then these murky synths and dissonant scents and electronic drums come just bashing in just thickening the track up and once this all kind of breaks away after a really quick like punk music style drum beat it sort of slips into this very quiet subtle and kind of spacious spot where hurry chopped up and skipped out vocals sort of deliver some verses and behind this is a very eerie eerie melody that sounds like it's being played by a guitar of some sort but that could have been sampled from somewhere else the melody to me feels almost as if like it's got a little bit in common with a corne single falling away from me from their life is peachy album of all things but anyway at this moment not only is the melody kind of pretty it's captivating I think just this instrumental alone without emcee rides vocals are one of Death Grips more interesting instrumentals but with everything being so straight back I feel personally that they're trying to put some kind of emphasis on the lyrics here there's definitely some symbolism going on here having to do with birds and power but the more that I read through the lyrics the more confused I am about them what their overall messages and if some of them are even right there's one thing in the lyrics that makes me feel like there might be some typos is when MC Wright says that he had a bluebird but now it's dead but written out it says that it is did there are moments where I catch statements from this track like about attitude or life being wore which are expressions that Death Grips has kind of made in the past however the statement that power is cheap and the mention of Jesus to Jesus does not come up often in Death Grips music I wonder why but it spots like this that have some people sort of guessing that this track in some way or another might be some kind of Kanye West disc but honestly that's not a statement that I feel personally willing to make because just about every supposition that I've read people making about this song feels like kind of a stretch because you can only really pull out a few lines or words from this thing and be like ah that's what this means but what about the rest of it lyrically the entirety of the song doesn't really bring me to any one conclusion and being disjointed may be intentional maybe it's just supposed to be addressing or bringing up a bunch of different topics still I feel like that kind of loses some impact overall with this track I feel like I have been tossed this puzzle that wasn't really meant to be figured out however Death Grips knows full well that everybody's gonna grab onto this thing and be like what's it mean what's it mean but if you've given this track of listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Death Grips birds forever and here's

aqANxjB58wA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Giulia holter album loud city song first off just want to say I'm happy I'm back happy I'm doing reviews again for you guys I missed you I even missed Cal you're really hurry life missed me yes I did I missed you so much I even wrote a song just for you oh boy sing it I will I will well I didn't actually write a song you're an idiot I hate you so much Julia halter is a California singer songwriter she has several studio records under her belt this is the latest and she is a musician who I have been a little weary of because of her past work for a while because of how dreamy much of it tends to be and while that aesthetic isn't bad there wasn't much vocally or musically that was kind of stopping me in my tracks and making me say wow holy crap however this new LP of hers is a slight change of pace and enough of a change of pace to get me to say wow holy crap for the most part Julia's songs are still abstract slow burning ballads but the instrumentation on Cloud City song feels very very upfront Center tangible detailed yes their synthesizers on this LP yes there are vocals on this LP but these songs are also beautifully layered in these just tangible strings and horns making for a record that yes is is art pop yes is dream pop it has some characteristics of chamber music and a bit of jazz in here too I would actually say a bit of musical theater seems to seep through on the opening track to this thing world which features Julia halter singing these very dramatic lines which are delivered with this faint delicate singing style Julie being very subtle and tender on this track and she comes through with these kind of abstract lines tipping her hat two hats as well as misters and mothers cities this no named girl who is singing on the fifth floor of an apartment building which she later reveals to be herself she's asking herself questions like how can I escape you what am I looking for in you there's this great sense of longing that sort of permeates nearly every track on this album even as the music gets increasingly more bubbly bright cloudy blissful like the song maximum layout which has these very puffy string sections gently pulsating against these wailing strings that are just crying away in the background Julia comes through with her beautiful voice again on this track but is much more animated than on the previous song and brings through a little bit of whispered spoken word on this track as well which is a technique she uses at a few other points on this thing too for example the song in the green wild which for a good chunk of the song features just Julia kind of blending these elements of singing and talking against this very busy upright bass line it's kind of a fun captivating more playful side of Julia and on the flip side we have more spoken word right at the beginning of the track horns surrounding me which maybe isn't spoken word as much as it is just straight creepy with Julia recording herself or somebody else running from what sounds like horns through the woods whispering oh my god they're getting me it's kind of like the Blair Witch Project but like PLA re4 blaring horns music joke however this is one of the tracks that maybe I wasn't completely enamored with because Julia was getting drowned out a bit by the horn she is kind of a subtle singer however maybe that was kind of the point with the horns surrounding her because after all her voice does cut through the mists of instrumentation beautifully on the track hello stranger and this of course is a nice contrast from one of the more harder hitting songs on this LP maxims to which features these multi-tracked vocals from Julia in this tense rising instrumentation Julia does bring quite a bit of diversity to the table on this thing I am really impressed with the fact that she has these more animated tracks these songs that have more hard-hitting instrumentation just these really serene songs these beautiful songs these songs that are just more odd and kind of obtuse and off-putting and yet it all kind of has this thread of Beauty running throughout all of it toward the end of this LP Julia continues to deliver some pretty decent songs like he is running through my eyes which is a very beautiful piano ballad and this is a true heart is maybe the most bubbly fancy-free track on this entire LP it's kind of like a psychedelic dreamy prance romp around through Candyland however the last track on this thing highlights one of the major overall issues that I do have with this record record with so many of these songs and this album in general being so abstract in terms of structure or flow there are a lot of moments where I feel like these tracks come through with legit endings that feel like they deliver some kind of closure or some kind of cool-down point where I feel like the finish is coming the last track on this thing doesn't feel all too climactic or even really like a finisher for what themes and ideas are presented on loud city song for the most part lyrically it brings a lot of the same themes that were delivered on the opening track here maybe it's a bit of a reprieve I guess this LP doesn't really end with a significant change because so much of what's here is based upon Julia's surroundings and and those haven't changed by the end of the album or at least that's what it feels like this LP is is really more of a space that can be wandered through as opposed to some kind of urgent tale that has a beginning and a middle and an end which is pretty interesting considering how much pop music influences this album and that's typically the mentality that that flows through that kind of music overall to me the mood the style the production the singing the songwriting and melodies on this thing incredibly solid very enjoyable occasionally Julia does come off very Kate bushy really kind of wears her influences on those sleeves but it doesn't ruin the experience for me because I think she's come together with a solid record that she could call her own I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing but what do you think do you love loud city song do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next only the strong subscribe all mistakes or intentional Anthony

VfeDoYdR2po,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Earl Sweatshirt album Doris Earl Sweatshirt California rapper member of the infamous Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all hip hop collective and this is the long-awaited follow-up to his debut tape that came out a handful of years ago and maybe it wouldn't have taken him so long to follow it up had he not been sent away to a trouble boy's camp in Samoa by his mother and I in no way whatsoever questioned the parenting abilities of mrs. sweatshirt however I do wonder whether or not that sort of stalling prevented this album from being as as big as it could have possibly been because when Odd Future was first getting huge it was like there was an incredible demand to hear music with the hole-free earl hype tyler the creator saying that earl is is far better a rapper than he is and the mixtape that he dropped itself shows that he is one of the better MCS and odd future in general definitely with Earl you don't get the cheap production the weak flows the bad singing that sometimes appear on odd future releases however I don't really feel like he ends up coming ahead of the pack on Doris what Earl serves up well on this LP are Flo's wordplay and just a really strong mood maybe mood is the strongest characteristic of this entire LP this album is dark it's nocturnal it's pretty low-key kind of surreal in some ways I do feel like this album is a mature growth past that dark side that odd future used to have in its earliest stuff and that shows to me because lyrically Earl is is going for a lot less shock value and I think he has brought the best best instrumentals that have appeared on any Odd Future project across the board you have Earl himself doing production and co-production under the name random black dude on this LP the wu-tang as the RZA is on this thing as well as The Neptunes I think the only instrumentals that I didn't dig were the one that opened this LP up it just sounded like chopped and screwed molasses to me the beat that Tyler put together on Sasquatch kind of sounded like a wolf throw away drops this awful line saying that he used to be dope but now he's not dope anymore but Chris and Rihanna are fucking so there's still hope oh shit he went there which is there's nothing worse than someone who thinks they're being controversial when they're not I don't even think someone on the view would have batted an eye at that line maybe my least favorite song on this LP overall the one with Mac Miller on a guild was the title the song for me was really too slow to be exciting too sparse to be interesting and to hear Earl and Mac Miller just pitch shifted lower for a full few verses which were pretty empty substance wise was just terrible still I was happy to hear a group of instrumentals that covered a wide array of hip-hop flavors from the more synthetic stuff to jazz rap and boom bap the song Burgundy brings these grand horns and pianos with this awesome little synth lead in the background instrumentally to me the song hive is kind of like an improvement on this yonkers formula and the track Chum kind of has that rough synthesizer odd future flavor to it but it's balanced out a little bit with these weird piano samples i love the heavy thick base on Centurian bad bad not good kills it on horse and the beat that the RZA brought to the table wasn't bad could have come from any era could have just been a throw away for him but I feel like it worked itself into the album well but when it comes to features Doris starts to get a little inconsistent especially right at the start of this thing with la flair who brings this just boring flow boring tough-talking bland verse and very little in the way of personality another feature that completely disappointed me on this thing the RZA I'm molasses horrifyingly underutilized on this track a frugal Foods Booch really bringing a hip-hop giant down to that odd future level the features I ended up liking were Frank Ocean who had some interesting wordplay about his sexuality on Sunday and just a very personal verse on this song there was Domo Genesis who completely surprised me on this thing I've heard him on some tracks from wool for you sounded pretty good but he came out very hungry on doris actually to the elite field as far as vince staples goes to me a more interesting rapper than earl on this album to when he spit some bars though I will say that part of what makes him so appealing is that he sounds like a baby Snoop Dogg but still to me vince staples seems to have this kind of charismatic quiet swaggy badass tough-talking persona down tools hit like pool sticks the way IQ shit Oh as far as Earl goes he's hard to make heads or tails of sometimes occasionally on doors he'll come through with a song where the intentions are very very clear Chum where he's getting incredibly personal talking about his non-existent relationship with his father growing up a whole series of things burgandy delves into his current mind stay and sort of has him dealing with his fans in a way hearing them say dude we don't care how you feel we just want bars and Sunday seems kind of like a tender personal moment for Earl as well dealing with some of the love and some of the turbulence going on in his life due to drugs or just the trouble he's been getting in or his fame and music career however to me this song has an incredibly weak hook not only do the lyrics not really jump off the page to me but it's delivered with absolutely no enthusiasm whatsoever there are moments where I kind of wonder whether or not Earl wants to be here but I think what really ends up killing this thing is that when we drift away from the more focused tracks and get into songs they just have one loose bar after another the album becomes a little shallow and kind of forgettable and there are moments like this where lyrically earl is an interesting emcee other spots where he says his mama raised him a prophet and instead of rhyming that with prophet he rhymes it with dollar incentive which of course does not rhyme but you get it I also dug the line where he said he spits blizzard as' and then goes to eat venison with Saint Nicholas it's moments like this where he really reminds me of MF DOOM where you have this guy putting himself into these weird ridiculous abstract situations where he's just doing something that's kind of evil or villainous but delivery wise even though he has flow he is just such an unenthusiastic and just kind of lackluster guy to listen to for the length of an entire LP he doesn't bring a lot of different ideas and a lot of diversity to the table at least when it comes to his rap style I don't really feel like this is going to be an explosive release for Odd Future because of how narrow the appeal of this album is and I think in a way it could kind of be a grower if it weren't for the fact that when I dig deeper into the LP there's not much to find other than some witty word play here and there other than that this LP kind of delivers up the same sort of cocky violin blunt blowing immaturity that a lot of odd future releases do just maybe with a bit more talent and focus I did like this thing I just think it's too underwhelming and full of potholes for me to be completely enamored with it but what do you think of Doris do you love this album do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony

zxL1xbQa20k,No okay hi everyone anthem if you did we're gonna do a review of the new no age album an object these guys were a California rock duo this is their latest full-length LP no age if you haven't heard of them they're definitely a group you want to get into if you're into lo-fi rock lo-fi indie noise rock and pop punk music I would say that no age delivers rock and roll that has this high extreme amount of energy and just distortion and volume but also there's a lot of sound play in their music too with some ambient interludes outros and intros legitimately beautiful walls of ethereal guitar sound and even though toying with a lot of these Styles has earned them comparisons to great acts like Dinosaur Jr Pixies My Bloody Valentine and slow dive Sonic Youth Mission of Burma there isn't one band I would specifically say that no age sounds exactly like whether you're talking about stuff coming out today or in the past because I don't feel like there's a single band in the underground right now that is making noise rock with the same kind of detail especially ethereal details that no age typically does even at their most lo-fi back in 2007 their songs were incredibly textured and colorful loaded with sounds that were conjured from guitar feedback guitar freak-outs loops effects I feel like the band really kind of came to a pinnacle with their sound and broke out with it on the 2008 album nouns an LP that I loved from front to back it's exciting thrilling tense sort of simple melodically but still very catchy the band ended up following that album with a pretty decent EP that in my opinion showed them working with a better recording quality some newer sounds I felt like there were some really interesting progressions coming over the horizon but the band's next album everything in between unfortunately I did not enjoy it quite as much as nouns or even weirdo rippers I felt like there was an element of reservation on this album that kind of held it back and kept it from being as exciting it was almost as if a lot of the sounds that no age was working with instead of being wild and free and kind of having this visceral rock edge were kind of a little more mid paced and subdued in order to make a recording that was a bit cleaner a little more sterile this album made me kind of miss their low fire which is exactly the direction they're headed in on this new LP and it's really difficult for me to describe this LP describe how it makes me feel because it's sort of threw me for a loop it is a bit of a surprise because I feel like no age does go for a different vibe on this album and and truly part of me really enjoys it but part of me is is very cold toward it as well as far as positives go that give this album personality this is definitely no wages most abstract album it's one of the more experimental albums in their catalogue I would say it's actually pretty even tempered and consistent to a lot of no ages previous material featured tracks that were very very slow soft or ambient and then bunched those up with tracks that were high speed aggressive and fiery while neither was necessarily bad it's it's not like no age really found a way to make these slower tracks meld with the faster tracks without making them kind of feel like just merely a forgettable interlude or a detour on this LP with nearly every song on here featuring pretty much the same recording quality it's made for an album that doesn't really feel like a mix tape or a compilation it feels like a bit of a concept LP a part of me also kind of wonders whether or not this will go down as no ages most boring album and if not that it's definitely the album so far in their catalogue that has the narrowest appeal because when I think about it in respect to previous material songs like come on stimming for example which is maybe the only track on this LP that I could say has legitimate single potential even when no age tries to be ferocious on this album I'm not really finding a lot of power in this decidedly muddy muddy muddy recording I would say there's actually kind of a dullness that persists throughout this entire LP again I use the word decidedly because no age has worked in low fight sounds before I would say that there was kind of a similar dullness to their last album I'm positively sure they're conscious of how this album sounds how this album feels and how it might impact how people perceive their music I feel like deadening the sounds a little bit has actually made the music on this LP really live up to the title that they have given this album an object because it really makes me feel like I'm listening to music that I can only observe like it's this thing that is separate for me and it's like sitting there on the table and I'm just kind of staring at it as opposed to the music on nouns which I felt was something that just bled out of my speakers like a giant destruction rainbow of psychedelic punk magic Jake Jake Jake Jake Jake Jake scrambling my emotions and consciousness and object feels like so much more of a static experience it's like that soundscape side overtakes the Punk side on this LP and takes a group of songs written in no ages typical style for the most part and then melts them fries them strips them back a little bit until we have these tracks that feel brittle and and warm and crackle II and claustrophobic I really feel like no II just trying to get back to the basics of their earlier stuff and make a recording that has some kind of beauty in its flaws in its shortcomings in its damaged and broken presentation and emotionally there's a little bit of a shift on this album too because for sure there are a lot of songs on this album that are pretty moody and Dean spuntz vocals on this LP definitely convey that as well he's not really singing in that high-pitched nasally Yelp that blazed so many of the Bands faster tracks on previous LPS though there are occasions where it seems like he reaches up into that register for the most part he is kind of howling in this much lower voice on this album and it seems to have a bit of a sadness to it even though there have been a lot of changes on this LP I feel like no age is stuck to their pretty simple melodies songwriting and vocal style and I feel like they're putting just as much detail sonically noise wise into their tracks if you compare to their last full-length album I just feel that it's a lot less obvious because this is not a loud record you've got all of these sounds being squeezed into this incredibly small space and a lot of them drown each other out really cancel each other out because again this recording is very opaque and another thing that sort of takes the guts right out of these tracks or takes the excitement out of them is that a lot of tracks here forgo drums completely or have drums that are just barely audible and while that has led to an object being way less intense part of me loved hearing the band move into this slightly more difficult territory whether it be with somber songs like I won't be your generator which lyrically I feel are very sort of depressing Dean sort of singing on this track about not allowing this person to abuse him or sort of get power from him anymore whether that be through having control over him or some kind of emotional command and while he doesn't come across as the best vocalists of all time on this record he falls very short of that mark I feel there's an element of vulnerability kind of in the same way that a Kimya Dawson song would be admirable and the song and impression a track where Dean does reach up into that more nasally register of his though he is singing a little deadpan on this track there is still some kind of painful emotion in his voice and I just love the tenderness of the ambient sounds kind of floating in the background behind his voice against these very subtle guitars and the strings I assume their strings that pop in toward the end of the track they just really seep in very slowly they're gorgeous one of the more beautiful moments I've heard on a sub pop record this year there are some louder tracks on here but they can be just as off-putting honestly the opening track on here no ground has just one single snare just mixed up with all these very fuzzy fuzzy guitars it has such a demo kind of feel to ABBA teens lower vocals all over this tracker kind of wild they're weird while it did catch me in this really weird way at first I found it to be slightly alluring the more I listen to it there's a pretty audible bassline on this track too which is also kind of a rarity and no ages music and the song lock box I like that we have this weird floor tom role mixed very loudly in the left channel and that's pretty much all we're hearing in terms of percussion for a majority of the track I just have to emphasize again how strict back this album feels it's like no age was really trying to take everything they had built up until this point smash it down into its most basic foundation and then just redo everything it's like we've really hit the reset button and while has led to some interesting ideas sounds noises and aesthetics and I feel that no age has delivered some songs on here that do shine past the low fire recording they didn't need a good recording to be captivating there are still songs on this record that I do find to be completely boring and Moe's like we would have benefited from some more vivid or more high-pitched or distorted sounds I'm kind of feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Thomas and Vice Portugal who I recently did a little interview with you can find a link for that in the description box only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan oh no age forever 
FK0W-k8K2ew,oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new washed out album para kasam washed out is the solo pop music project of music producer Ernest green who gained widespread attention across the music blogosphere in 2009 via some songs from his life of leisure EP and not only did the songs on this EP have a smooth psychedelic sexy dreamy vibe to them but a lot of music fans were labeling this aesthetic that Ernest was going for as being a new genre entirely chillwave and while I did find the album he followed up that EP with to be kind of dull appoints I definitely saw the appeal I think washed-out is maybe the only chillwave era artist who actually stuck to his guns but was actually able to mature the sounds that he was working with with some more interesting instrumentation better sound quality and production I think the only point where this album really lacked for me was in the songwriting which had a serious sameness quality to it throughout the LP though the grooves on this thing were great now as far as para kasam goes I would say that washed out strong points continue to be strong points and weak points continue to be weak points really though I would say on this album in comparison with washed-out slash full-length LP there is more attention to melodic detail and instrumental detail I would say there's more instrumental diversity on this thing too in a lot of ways it feels like washed out as usual and yet there are spots where it feels like he's pursuing some different musical ideas but trying to capture them in this washed out aesthetic like on the first full-length track off of this thing it all feels right with these up stroked acoustic guitars it totally has a reggae vibe to it even the percussion feels subtly tropical at points I think the only thing hiding this influence a little bit is just how hazy the song is and a very blatant psychedelic pop influences especially coming from these string melody on this thing the sudden break in momentum that the song hits after the verse is kind of this slow syrupy chorus while I don't really care for the sudden transition I do like the contrast of these two parts of the song overall it's a great track kick this thing off even if overall the vocals do feel a little too subdued for me yes I do know that at this point this is Ernest green style this is most likely what he's going to continue delivering on subsequent albums still for the length of an entire album it doesn't convey much of anything to me other than this sense of listlessness or bliss there are points where I do feel a little underwhelmed by the lack of surprises being presented on this thing like the track don't give up which is a nice piece of Balearic be if we're going to look at this thing from a percussive standpoint and the melody on the chorus here is pretty nimble too a lot busier than what you'll usually hear from washed out but in terms of the verses the groove the vocal melody it all feels eerily similar to something he had done on his previous album however the track waitlist to me is is one of my favorites on here because what's happening here to me feels like kind of a rarity from washed-out it is an honest-to-god ballad with the vocal melody really leading the way on this thing as opposed to the beat the very slow spacious drum machines and Cynthia Peggy rose on the track had me feeling like I was listening to this syrupy piece of New Wave I know washed-out has always had very prevalent eighties music influence going on in his tracks but this is the first time where I feel like I'm hearing a sincere re-creation going on here as well as the song fall back with these very tight sixteenth note high hats just very busy beat on this song and this vocal phrasing that really reminds me of Bernard Sumner there are tracks on here that I really enjoy highlights just like the previous few washed out releases but again there are tracks here that I just feel do nothing for me or have this real kind of hollowness to them tracks that I just wish had a bit more body to them a bit more detail the song all I know for example for all intents and purposes to me sounds like the soundtrack to a car commercial nearly every sound in this song has no personality to it if it wasn't for the hazy effects and the vocals I would have never guessed this track was from washed-out the very gentle piano arpeggios and the basic root note bass lines playing out this AED chord progression it's boring I feel like the tracks one chance to redeem itself came around the solo or the interlude that was placed in there which has I'm not sure I can't tell if it's a horn or it's a string or it's just some MIDI instrument either way it just plays a handful of do-nothing notes that really have nothing behind them it's like they were randomized I think the closing track on this LP has a similarly basic vibe to it too that keeps what could have been a pretty good song from being an interestingly detailed or layered beautiful piece of music again and again and again washed out misses out on making some good tracks because the effects kind of take hold and the music really sits on the back burner again Ernest green excels when it comes to creating vibes moods addition out grooves if those are your primary focuses if those are your primary interests and music then forget what I say and get this record because there's definitely some better production and a better sound set and an interesting array of influences going on with this LP from psychedelic pop to Caribbean music and dream pop as well as synth pop and new wave however on the musical side of things there's just not enough diversity on this LP really and these very subtle changes in influence and instrumentation just aren't enough to keep this album from feeling a little monotonous I'm really kind of feeling a strong 6on on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Flying Lotus and eclectic only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony fan tanto washed out forever 
ZTneUDSEF2I,it's here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a freaking review of the new Big Sean track control Big Sean is a Detroit rapper he's been coming up through Kanye West's GOOD Music circuit for a few years now made his commercial debut in 2011 with the album finally famous and I gotta say and get straight to the point so that we can get into this song Big Sean in my opinion is easily one of the most average rappers to hit the mainstream in a while now in my opinion Big Sean isn't even really that much of a lyrical rapper really more of a pop rapper but still as a pop rapper he lacks style he lacks even a gimmick which I think even puts emcees like Rick Ross ahead of this guy unless I know Big Sean is on the track by reading the the feature credit after the song title most of the time he just comes off like a faceless emcee to me and if you don't believe me today when I googled his name his face didn't even come up first why was i googling Big Sean because he has a new album coming out on the way and he has dropped a non-album single or a non-album track he says because of a sample that may be the case however the kind of hip-hop that we're hearing on this track just like grimy straightforward spittin verses Posse cut kind of shit that is not really Big Sean's style it's not really his strong point sure I think on paper a lot of people wouldn't assume that was the strong point of ASAP Rocky either this song to me has a lot in common with the one train track of his last full-length LP really feels like he's going for roughly the same thing on this song with just having a lot of bars stacked on top of each other with a really straightforward hard-hitting but epic instrumental that feels kind of a refined despite the fact that it is so bangin but to get into Big Sean's verse a little bit there isn't much in terms of what he said that stuck out to me yeah he was talking about making it getting bigger doing some name-dropping a case spray compared that to Cologne and on top of all of this it's almost as if he was wrapping his bars straight off of a teleprompter because the dude has like zero personality zero inflection and zero passion on this verse even as he was saying that Detroit is is mayor 'less and surprisingly the short final verse on on this while it is pretty decent for Jay Electronica he finishes the song off it's very poetic I dig that one line he throws out there where he earth wind and fired the verse but rained on the hook but still I feel like even he doesn't come off with a lot of fire on this verse I don't really feel like he took advantage of this opportunity to appear on a Big Sean track try to get heard by some new listeners and on top of it he drops this one line about signing to the rock which really is that the best career choice you've made you really want to reference that in the words of absol you had a release date but now it's never the truth is is that it's the verse from Kendrick Lamar that makes this entire song and the thing that's kind of weird is that Big Sean sort of let this happen though I do feel like people who listen closely to this track do sort of get the hostility do get the subtleties of some of the stuff that Kendrick is saying on this song but what a lot of people are freaking out about with this track is that Kendrick is directly calling out other rappers saying names saying that hey listen it's sort of nothing personal but I'm trying to murder you figuratively people who are into the competition of the hip-hop game sort of understand where Kendrick is coming from however some people sort of say that what he's saying on this verse is sort of taking things a little too far and I could sort of understand why a verse like what we're hearing on this track they don't come out that often usually the bragging and the name-calling and and all of that is sort of more faceless he calls up ASAP Rocky Tyler the Creator J Cole Meek Mill Jay Electronica Big Sean Mac Miller Pusha T Drake Big KRIT some of these guys I'm a pretty big fan of but I mean honestly when I take all of their previous projects and measure them up against Kendricks previous project there there's no contest really I think he could have called that dudes like Joey badass as well and you know the thing is while a lot of these MCS are responsible for kind of changing the modern hip-hop landscape over the past few years still the question is are they trying to be as conceptual as Kendrick in their music are they trying to be at that high artistic bar I feel like this verse and just Kendrick in general with what he's saying he's trying to put this competitive edge in hip-hop on more of an artistic streak than sort of I'm obviously a better rapper because I have more of this I have more of that I'm selling more copies while a lot of people are gonna get hung up over sort of the the name dropping on this track and sort of calling people out Kendrick goes so much further on this verse that that's sort of worth reading into he attacks sort of a lot of social norms that are following hip-hop around these days he's like fuck your clubs don't pop a pill for me all these rappers that are taking Molly will be turned into rich spoiled white girls that are partying too much and crashing their Porsches because they're irresponsible foolish children essentially as what he's saying I'm unsociable I'm uncoachable I'm not wearing this designer shit and why all this hostility I mean really think about it a lot of people complain all the time about rappers selling out or changing their tune as soon as they get famous so on and so forth think about the kind of music that Kendrick was making on the album section 80 and the kind of messages that he was putting forward then imagine that guy getting famous and actually sticking to his philosophy as he's getting bigger and bigger and essentially being put smack dab in the middle of the world that he's criticizing so heavily on that album and essentially to me where the aggression is aimed on this verse is to like change all of this mindless Molly shit into something a little more substantial and maybe it's your opinion that sort of going about changing things by competing with rappers in a more traditional way by sort of being I'm the best this pump in your chest out all of that is a little counterintuitive however I feel like at least Kendrick has come closer to raising a significant amount of awareness with his more mainstream appeal than a lot of people have with their own ground appeal you know and not to knock anybody's efforts on on the mainstream or or the underground level I mean obviously the underground is where Kendrick came from originally and for a guy that has such an accessible sound his music is is fantastic and far from dumb down yeah maybe on his albums he tends to be a little subtle you have to read into his stuff a bit but maybe that's why he's trying to be Overton in-your-face on this track and on this verse and just sort of tell you straight forward what he's thinking and how he's feeling if you've given this track of listen if you've read into the verses on this thing what did you think of him who had the best one what did you think of specifically what was being said in Kendricks and that's it Anthony Fantana control big sean forever you 
WlKQsXvfcds,toad endless night hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd going to do a review here of the new toad album endless night toad a Phoenix rock band this is their latest album mini album sort of though this release is pretty short doesn't even hit that 30 minute mark it is a pretty powerful piece of rock music now these guys even though their name is towed in great big fat capital letters it's actually an acronym for take over and destroy which is actually a pretty badass name and as much as I love hearing something extraordinarily fast heavy melodic or moving being well-rounded in all of these things is is kind of a quality that is overlooked at times especially on the more extreme side of music however endless night takes all these things into a cow across its five songs tracklist it's a group of songs that work in multiple layers crushing heavy riffs that occasionally play slow are fast at times especially when the band is going down a more black metal road with the blast be drumming but a lot of the time you're going to find this LP two going at kind of a mid pace a lot of the grooves that these riffs are playing have a bit of a heavy metal vibe to them or maybe even some rock and roll swagger there's some organ and in synth keys that feel kind of retro throughout this LP as well really kind of bringing in a cult vibe to the table and on top of all of that take over and destroy has a pretty strong sense of melody to melodies that are dark and are sinister and romanticized again pulling from that very clear black metal influence throughout these songs which also plays out on the blast beats that I mentioned tremolo picket ours and some vocals that are really really ferocious bloody raw sometimes blending elements of black metal and death metal it's a really seamless blend at times of these extreme and not so extreme Rock styles and really when I think of all the genres that influence take over and destroy I really am reminded of Keller talk however take over and destroy comes to a very different musical conclusion as they feel much darker and I feel have a little bit more finesse at times like the very chilling pianos and hellish melodies that play at the title track on this LP even though the very crushing guitarists that come in after this intro change the vibe alot images of candles and pentagrams and hooded cloaks and demons all of this is sort of still at the core of takeover and destroys music and they continue to emphasize this vibe when the songs get heavier with some harmonized guitar leads some very sort of deadpan background vocals or even some very morbid lyricism which at times can be kind of cosmic and otherworldly really this LP feels like a sort of short soundtrack to a very devilish ritual and hooks on this LP can be kind of catchy as well especially with how ferocious and just over-the-top the vocals can be and I'm also digging how when toad attempts to stretch some of these songs out past the six-minute mark there are some successes as well with some really climactic builds of harmonious guitars and synthesizers which make for a pretty haunting contrast from the pummeling riffs they usually back up most of the verses on this LP now I love the ambition that makes toad write some of these longer songs or just in general right multi-phased songs but occasionally it doesn't go over amazingly like on the intro track from the selfie as well as the second track where I feel like some of the slower moments instantaneously just bust right back into the heavier spots kind of ruining or not even really fully appreciating the tension that these slower spots had built up to this point still the latter half of this LP is pretty solid the third track howling house is pretty interesting in its transitions it has this 68 intro breaks into these 44 blast beats goes back into the 68 on the latter part of the track over the 68 time signatures bringing some really moody guitar leads the song boundaries of flesh has some fast and sludgy riffs that remind me of some of more intense moments from high on fires last full-length LP but also brings in some cleanly sung and eerie vocals on the second half of the song that worked pretty nicely and as far as the closing track goes on this thing maybe one of the more cohesive songs on this thing with this very slow intro a lot of heavy metal guitar heroism going on in the middle of the song and then the very end just building up to this huge climactic finish overall I dug this LP a lot it's loud it's heavy its destructive it's memorable with the vocals and melodies just burning just on fire throughout this thing however I did end up kind of wanting more material more length from not only some of these songs but just this album in general and I guess there is one more thing that kind of hinders this LP for me it's that there is kind of a sameness that runs across many of these tracks in terms of some of the vocal deliveries or just the sound and the vibe of these riffs and it is a positive and that it makes this help you feel really cohesive and maybe even conceptual in a sense but then again there is kind of a stagnation to that as well I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing if you've given them a listen what did you think did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's X this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to friends family God country and apple pie only the strong subscribe all mistakes were in church you know Anthony Fantan Oh toad forever you 
7mDFyxgWRcg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new modern life is war album fever hunting modern life is war as an Iowa rock band and their music fit into a pretty huge trend that dominated hardcore music about ten years ago around that time there was a mountain of different bands that were approaching hardcore punk music with a much more melodic edge and when I say melodic I don't necessarily mean the kind of clean vocally sung and kind of accessible poppier choruses that that were brought to the table by bands like that religion or propoganda or ignite as good as those bands are not really the direction I'm talking about I'm talking more through harmonious guitar chords really slow and anthemic lead guitars or solos like most hardcore punk music intensity still played a vital role in the records that we're talking about here from modern life is war and these other bands but this intensity played out and more of a dramatic some would say melodramatic way than it did just an outright aggressive one things were a bit more subtle darker emotionally dismal groups like life long tragedy and ruin her and have heart killing the dream and and more than life took a similar approach as well it hasn't been that long since modern life is wort disbanded they disbanded after their third full-length LP however it almost feels like an eternity when you consider how fast the musical trend they survived in grew and sort of dissipated however not to crap on the efforts of a band like modern life is war or their legacy because I feel like what happened ten years ago in hardcore music was a necessary step to a lot of the very dark dismal heavy and melodic hardcore influenced music that we're hearing today especially when you consider that heavier and darker is exactly how they left us on their last full-length album before they disbanded her sort of went on this hiatus but there are a few surprises with this LP for one this album not as heavy as their last full-length it seems almost as if they've abandoned that idea of being a heavier band and have gone back to just sort of a more dynamic sound and also I would say the other surprise with this LP is that it doesn't really sound like modern life is war ever stopped making music I know from the ALF years in between albums isn't an immense amount of time but still considering that they disbanded for a moment and now our back it's like they never even skipped a beat really the vocals are as impassioned as ever the guitars sound really melodic the drums have a nice intensity to them really propel the songs I feel like maybe there's a little bit more dynamics to modern life as war instrumentally honestly I see them having more in common with groups like Touche amor or La Dispute at this point now as far as the tunes on this LP go when the instrumentation I feel like modern life is war has really delivered they're doing what they usually do just as well as they've ever done it and I've done it and I love the driving bass in the shrill guitar chords on the track health wealth and peace just an example of how with simplicity modern life is work and pulled together these really captivating punk anthems anthemic again is just another word I keep using on these tracks like the anthemic descending guitar chords on the second half of the track chasing my tail just about this epic and it's just huge and as ambitious as you can expect a really rough heavy and intense just frothing at the mouth punk song to be and the very slow-moving guitar peji us on tracks like blind or breeding are just another example of how a band like modern life is war feels more sad and moody in their punk aesthetic than they are aggressive the title track on here is a really pretty and sinister stick in my head melody that I dig and the song dark water has a kind of bluesy characteristic to the riff that they play throughout this song which is not completely surprising considering that this same band had a really interesting take on these songs Stagg early on their last full-length if there is a weakness on this LP for me it's really kind of lyrically I feel like on this album maybe more than other modern life is where LP is the lyrics are a little too repetitive or don't fully explore some of the topics that I feel like are being addressed here I almost feel as if tracks like media for example which is a great song with fantastic guitars really pumps me up but the refrain on this thing could really have been I don't know shortened and then the extra space could have been used to bring together some verses or just another part of the refrain that would have been memorable or would have sort of talked more in depth about what exactly the song is trying to highlight same goes for old fears new frontiers or brothers-in-arms forever and there are other points on this LP where I feel like where for example we're talking about time slipping away friends slipping away and even though I am saddened by the idea of this I think with age I've kind of just grown okay with this fact and we're not really that upset by it things change however groups like Lotte dispute for example are able to take things like letters being sent to you but coming less and less and being stranded in your hometown and sort of taking all these specifics and turning it into a poem that I think for even somebody who isn't directly connected with that emotion or feeling that way can just it rushes back you know feels powerful still having said all of that I think that modern life is war has pulled together a really good comeback record and if you're looking for a punk album that has a lot of passion has a lot of melody and has again some anthemic and memorable songs do give this thing a listen I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to absol and I want to give a shout out to the dude who made a mad video response to my tech 9 review we disagree but you're still a cool dude I like you man only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan Oh modern light is war
