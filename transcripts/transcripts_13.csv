E3vb_2TmFgc,hi everyone Bethany can't a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a new episode of the greatest segment to ever grace this godforsaken channel the it came from man camp where we show you the best and the brightest of the self uploaded unsigned internet music world and we have a special bunch of artists for you today I want to shout out Austin for helping me pull this segment together and all of the band camps that I mentioned in this video are linked down there in the description box God why is that so hard let's kick it off with the self-titled acronym album of please eat the fucking sandwich bitch which is a very vulgar but also very polite band name this is some allegedly Indian cyber grind the thing is 15 tracks on this very band camp page this project also released the sequel to this album and occasionally the music breaks away from this whole electronic grindcore thing and favors like some electronic smooth very easygoing instrumentals with kind of poppy since there are amazing track titles on this thing like oMG duh and kitten Zilla part 2 if you're into internet punk and noise and grind then you should definitely check this one out this next one is maybe my favorite in this collection of it is the desperate mixtape from Felicia geisha who has a voice and delivery not too unlike Internet rapper kitty this is kind of a cloud rat project as well and if you didn't know Felicia geisha is actually a part of the beta boys collective additive who are like a rap crew that were kind of like the goth edgy version of Odd Future or something they probably won't like that comparison but you know whatever Felicia geishas rap songs are very airy and ethereal and have a dark twist to them she has kind of a I don't know almost like a valley girl affectation to her voice there's a song in here about how she shoots up a school to promote her mixtape on the song UTI which might stand for urinary tract infection there's a line on here about a sitting on someone's face and pooping in their eye bars also on this same Bandcamp you can check out a mixtape featuring all the other beta boys it is definitely a special experience especially given that there are tracks on this thing title baby fucker and daddies come ease these guys also have a really weird tumblr loaded with pictures that I I don't get it it seems like the only purpose this tumblr serves is to confuse anybody who's curious about the beta boys also I have to make note that on this band camp we have tags making this album searchable underneath the words autism and fedora this next project I'm gonna have a fun time pronouncing it is from an artist who goes by the name of impossible nothing and it is the phone phone phone me nomicon phone me own mo na nan Nik this thing is easily the most ambitious beat music project I've ever seen ever heard of I don't think there's a more ambitious beat music project this thing is 26 tracks long each track is named after a letter in the English alphabet and every single track is ten minutes long so you're talking 26 10 minute long tracks which adds up to four point three hours of music all of which are loud as fuck because the album was compressed so heavily it seems like in the mastering process to the point where the the beats distort a little bit and I have not heard all four hours of this album so you know if like at like the 8 minute mark on track K you know he goes on some kind of racist diatribe or something obviously man but from what I've heard on the songs that I've heard so far these tracks progressed pretty amazingly across the 10-minute run times of each song so it's not like he just kind of delivers the same idea and repeats it ad nauseam for 10 minutes some of these instrumentals are pretty progressively structured so this is not just some kind of silly joke project or anything I actually think there are amazing ideas behind this project and the the person who's spearheading this whole thing he's a bit of an eccentric you can check this amazing little interview quote here where he talks about people sitting in a circle or a hoop but it's a clearly this weird way that he thinks that is displayed in the interviews with him that I've read up on that I think drives him to make such a wild and creative project this next one is called Nick Cage dropped the bees this is a really crappy mashup music featuring vocal clips from several different Nick Cage movies being brought together with some really tinny just badly produced Beats movies like Wicker Man and vampires kiss all the songs are like 1 to 2 minutes Nick Cage is faces photoshopped unto an eggplant on the front cover the tags feature words such as fug step and how did it get burned how did I get burned I have a pretty big issue with this project and it's not what the concept I actually think the concept is pretty hilarious and maybe even necessary in the internet age my issue is that this project did not go far enough this did not take this joke far enough the instrumentals aren't even really that good he didn't even sample that many Nic Cage movies there were so many other films and Nic Cage has been in that were terrible that were most definitely worth sampling so try a little harder next time that's my advice essentially this next one is from Australia an artist named Lake and the project is in a lake house and this is a beautiful record selling currently for a thousand Australian right now which is like $50 Americans so that's a fucking bargain and this thing is kind of like a mix of horrible meme and abstract rap songs and almost ambient soundscapes the layers on some of these experimental tracks are like psychedelic in a way and have a mess of instrumentation the description is pretty interesting too I don't know I guess I've just never really heard an album that combined these two worlds under one horrific album cover which the more that I look at it the less sense it makes to me and the more I hate it and the more I hate myself and finally we are going to give a nod to Brett dog with the album welcome to the dog house and this thing is easily the worst mashup album ever and I say that because it's the worst mashup album I've ever heard I've heard a lot of mashup records and I've heard a lot of terrible mashups but I think this is the worst mashup record ever I mean it's awful it doesn't but Anthony you know it's it's not that bad you know it's the worst mashup record ever all of the sounds don't even coalesce into anything that makes a lick of sense and I don't mean this as an insult to Brett dogs abilities to pull together a mashup record I mean to say this because I think this was actually his intention I think Brett dogs set out to make the worst mashup record of all time the description of this project is pretty colorful and we have wonderful tags such as next level going global getting money and futuristic some of the tags in this tag list here are actually written in Lee speak and I imagine that they're probably like some SEO wizards out there looking at that cringing the clicks the clicks you're losing I recommend this record if you want to give yourself a headache challenge yourself make a friend hate you and that is gonna do it for this month's episode of it came from Bangkok thank you for watching you guys should know my twitter by now you can always hit me up on there submit some strange internet albums and internet music for this segment if you would like to and yeah that's about it Rainier and thank you for watching this episode of it came from Van Camp the opening visuals to this segment are by liquid diamond the song the theme song to this segment is by mr. hot dad their information and their stuff is linked down there in the description and to the side of me you can also check out the two previous episodes of it came from band camp subscribe have a nice day eat your fruits and vegetables and play some smash 
EEyuuVLuElc,review Autechre what do you was just don't know if I'm man enough for four hours of IEM hi everyone strange the name Anton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the numerous Anantha record strangers singer-songwriter Marissa Nadler back with her second full-length album four sacred bones records in the past I would only say I casually enjoyed some of Marissa Nadler tracks I've never really loved a full-length album of hers from beginning to end I thought her last record for sacred bones was just a little too sparse for my taste however some of the teaser tracks from this new album over here piqued my interest specifically the song Janie in love where I heard Nadler 'z typically wintery spacious and ethereal sound kind of fleshed out a little bit with some great backing instrumentation making her songs just a little more structured a little more dynamic and just have a little more presence and pretty much all these tracks across the board have more instrumentation added to them so we have some percussion some keys some strings some bass electric guitar now even though there's an instrumental change here I wouldn't really say there's a big change of vibe or style here because Marissa nailers music is still incredibly slow beautiful alluring patient this is not a poppy catchy punchy snappy record Marissa still very much maintains her incredibly subtle sound but in the case of this record not so subtle that this album is hard to listen to or difficult to make heads or tails out of or just all the details everything that these songs are doing just all kind of gets swallowed in the same my new show there are actually some great choruses on this record that do swell very subtly and beautifully I'd say they blossom gorgeously on the surface this album is very pretty to the ears and it only delivers more details and some interesting lyrical ideas - as I honed in on it now if the added instrumentation provides anything to this record it is versatility from the very skeletal and acoustic and chilling shadow show Diane to the dramatic drum fills and organ chords on the song nothing feels the same we also have the song skyscraper which feels pretty bulky with its fingerpick guitars but also behind these acoustic guitars there's this growing ominous drone of what seems like deep bass and some high-pitched tones too at some points in the track the title track here has kind of a very slow almost heavy country feel in a way it reminds me of that earth album hex funny thing that I honestly did not know when I was recording this review is that Earth's hex and this numerous and Adler album were both in fact produced by the same person Randall Dunn he's got the best ears in the game I got the best ears in the game like when the band stopped making pure drone metal and started kind of fusing this drone sound into more of a folky western aesthetic with twangy guitars and tracks like all the colors of the dark and dissolve to me reflect a much older style of songwriting even though these tracks are very ethereal and they're slowed down it feels like the chord progressions and the melodies and sometimes the arranged instrumentation if sped up and just played a little more lively could fit a vintage vocal pop or a traditional pop song from the 50s or the 60s I love that on this record Marissa is able to maintain her style and keep ur musical identity in intact while trying so many different things and taking so many musical risks and also it's great that her vocals on this album are pretty readable to her vocals aren't really stuffed away behind the instrumentation or just so awash in atmosphere that it's difficult to connect with them her voice is quiet but sometimes it's audibly trembling with emotion or calling out very smoothly and beautifully which is also incredibly engaging and captivating the lyrics on the album what I can make of them which is most of them sometimes her voice is so soft that it's it's hard to make total sense of everything that she's saying but many of the lyrics I can make out I like some of the tracks seem to be about people who she knows personally just as a very clear idea of like Janie in love where she describes this person as a natural disaster and she's like causing things to blow up causing the earth to crumble the song shadow show Diane which seems to be about Marisa window watching from her apartment and sort of seeing things happening in other people's apartment windows other lyrics are very eerie and also abstract like on the title track here where we have this haunting refrain where Marissa's singing over and over that she's a stranger now she's a stranger now there's kind of two sides to Marissa Nadler on this record maybe not two sides separated by a bold line but maybe more like a spectrum there are moments where she comes off as this very aged and experienced songwriter with a kind of weary voice singing songs about love and introspection and just relationships telling stories and relaying personal experiences and then in other moments she reads more like a mystical Frost which with magical music powers delivering these beautiful siren vocals and some kind of jeroni heavy instrumentation that reminds me a little bit of a Chelsea wolf my only real issues with this record is that I think instrumentally this album could have gone a little farther it could have been a little meteor it could have been a little more up front but I'm loving the steps that Marissa and her collaborators on this record have taken thus far on this album and I only look forward to seeing them push what they're making here a little further on whatever they do in the future and a handful of tracks here including waking or the intro track for example do and a little abruptly and are just generally a little too short in my opinion I mean I think that was just possibly a little more here especially on a track like waking which definitely was one of my favorite musical moments on here and the song hungry is the ghost there are elements of this track that I like but it was just maybe a little too Spacey in comparison with some of the other tracks here I think the song kind of devolves into a somewhat tedious drone really and that the song tuned at the core of this instrumentation gets lost in that a little bit but outside of that I think this record is really great this is definitely one of the better singer-songwriter records I've heard this year this is my favorite Marissa Nadler records so far in her discography I think it's her best album thus far in terms of instrumental presentation and from what I can tell this is easily one of the strongest set of songs that she has delivered to record yet and I think I'm gonna leave it at that I'm feeling eight decent to strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best push it out of your next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't die Merson Adler strangers forever 
73Kl42LqEqM,y'all have been the wanderer Anthony Fantana how do I find you on twitter I just don't know do I easy answer just look up the word meme I pop right the fuck up the word melon - hi everyone Carthon AC tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new car seat headrests record teens of denial car seat headrest is the musical project masterminded by singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist mr. Will Toledo quickly following up his Matador Records debut last year a teens of style and I'm kind of thinking is this like a sister album of some sort teens of style teens of denial but this new album here seems like a really big change of pace if these albums are related in some kind of conceptual way it's it's not very obvious on the surface because this new record over here seems like such a jump up in ambition right from the crash which is an hour and 11 minutes long across 12 tracks and my issue with that potentially is are these track lengths justified I thought some of the songwriting on the last record was kind of lackluster and I can imagine some of those really forgettable songs stretched out to like 10 or 11 minutes and me just not enjoying them at all plus I was kind of wondering if on their next record car seat headrests really kind of come into their own because will Toledo have for a while now is very boldly been wearing his influences on his sleeve in his music to the point where he drowns in his influences occasionally this album going into it I thought this could either be a really overly long patience testing record that I'm going to hate or the ambitious kick this project needed to keep fans engaged now the sound of the recording here is still kind of low five will is keeping it very close to that bedroom pop and rock aesthetic but this album is noticeably punchier than teens of style the mixes here seem a little more instrumentally dense - with pianos and background vocals and occasional shots of strings or like some horns being added to the bass rock instrumentation and these extra bits of sound elevate the brittle guitars and the really clipping sort of fuzz doubt vocals really nicely the singing is still delivered in this slow lazy kind of boot rub a dictation and it's the kind of thing I think listeners are either gonna love or just totally hate not only because the vocals on this record just sounds so akin to like Julian Casablancas on any given stroke song but also because it does slightly feel like put on however will Toledo does break out of this vocal delivery occasionally on this album to go into his upper register and deliver some crack passionate almost manic singing I am noticing on this record that will is making a bigger effort to deliver some very direct lyrics sort of like on the song Joe gets kicked out of school buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh which is a kind of funny and also sad piece of storytelling from will where he is going through what seems like a really bad high he's paranoid of the police outside he's paranoid of his friends inside occasionally on the record I think the mix is a little aggravating it's almost like the polar opposite issue of what I had with teens of style where a lot of the time the vocals were kind of muffled and thrown into the background just didn't really have that much presence here the vocals really muscled out the instrumentation a lot of the time which kind of just fights chaotically in the background the foundation of the instrumentation is a little quieter than I would like it sometimes except for in the case of the song Vincent where for a great deal of the track there is this horrid a to note guitar line that just just roaring over this kind of funky rock instrumentation that sounds great it's like I'm listening to a 200 dollar guitar alternating between open E and open a with the cheapest sort of built-in distortion that comes out of whatever secondhand amp it's being played out of and I don't know if I mean that yet in the worst way or the best way possible because I actually do like the song here quite a bit and it seems like there's a lot of instrumental chemistry on this record too and I enjoy a lot of wills lyrics on this cut because that is Amira frames are great and this song I think is one of many moments on the record where I think will songwriting has definitely upped itself a notch the structures on these tracks are more ambitious the instrumental breaks and interludes outros intros bridges are better there are actually some super memorable choruses on this record from the noisy and kind of tension building jam at the end of connect the dots to the very awesome and syncopated guitar drum hits on the intro track fill in the blank this album seems so much more focused and again that comes through in the very straightforward lyrics right from the beginning of the album we get this strong narrative of will being angry at people and the world in general kind of invalidating his feelings then we have all these kind of drug narratives coming through on songs like destroyed by hippy powers as well as drunk driving which is not only a track about just drunk driving being a bad idea but the feelings of depression and emptiness that sort of lead will to this point the song just what I needed another track that I really liked on the record from what I've read was actually supposed to incorporate the car song of the same title however he had to rewrite the song will did because the track didn't get cleared and then a bunch of vinyl records that actually had the song printed on it were destroyed but you can still kind of hear the influence of the car song in the very steady mid-paced rhythm guitars on the verses I like the weary vocal delivery on this track which seems very earnest and the funny and smart lyrics on this track too about waiting for some good porn feelings of empty and the whole idea of taking advice though the advice that he is talking about in this tractor seems kind of generic and just not really all that helpful which I think might have been the point of the track on 1937 State Park we see an unhinged will Toledo where he tells a story about being taken down by the cops crying on his way home bottling up all this pain and hiding it from someone because he says his pain is his own and I guess you just won't let it go and the only major issue I have with this record lyrically is probably on the song unforgiving girl where the last portion of the track is dominated by this refrain of it's an unforgiving world but she's not an unforgiving girl but but then in a way will kind of makes up for it on the song cosmic hero with these really heavy one-liners that actually kind of make you think how sad life is where if you want X it comes at the price of why the song also builds into a monstrous instrumental ending that I like a lot we also have toward the back end of this album the 11 minute monster The Ballad of Costa Concordia which is very slow pain ballad with another big ending where we'll kind of delivers these very confessional spoken word vocals where he essentially admits to just not knowing how to navigate life not because he is a totally useless person or anything like that but he's just dealing with a lot of these struggles and issues of just kind of figuring out how to be a mature functioning adult in those late teens and early 20s and it's almost like at the end of this song I'm at the following track - he comes to this conclusion of I just give up and I'm never getting a job you can agree or disagree with the philosophy of the record but it's sort of interesting from the beginning to the end of the album we kind of see this emotional metamorphosis of will we see him move from being worried and neurotic and depressed and feeling empty to this guy who has essentially just dropped all of these hang-ups we have a very serene closing track on the record to sort of end things off on a positive and easygoing note but that's pretty much the end of the album however this hopefully is not the end of will Toledo and his story will continue on to the next record and hopefully it's as interesting to listen to as well written as passionately delivered and as musically engaging as this record over here I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this album transition have you given this car seat headrest record a listen do you love it if you hate it but would you rate it here the best year the best which should i review next hit the light if you like please subscribe please don't die watch more videos share with your mom hope you enjoyed this record car seat headrests teens of denial forever 
508UImyIFu0,this guy made a type over here he says we need more memo videos but I think what he was trying to say is we need more emo videos and that's true I haven't really been um doing a lot of wait hold on he he meant to say meme videos hi everyone said name Boitano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new modern baseball record huh today huh Dan a hood and a ghost that these guys are a Pennsylvania band and this is their new album on run for cover records and if you're familiar with the run for cover records you know those bands on run for cover records they are playing that sweet suburban blues emo now in the past I have been pretty critical of the current crop of emo bands out there many of them bring absolutely no new ideas to the table and just rehash pretty much everything that any seminal a mimo band has done in the 90s and the 2000s except with like way less songwriting talent however this modern baseball record did in fact take me by surprise now it's not reinventing the genera or anything like that it's got some indie and punk roots which are mellowed out into some very melodic and poetic pop rock the mix is pretty good and showcases very vividly the guitars the bass the vocals the drums everything is coming through loud and clear it's super crisp from what I understand this is the band's first record that is not self recorded and it sounds like they have transitioned pretty nicely from the self recording phase to the studio phase the performances are lively they are energetic they're in the moment there's definitely chemistry to the performances on this record that can most definitely be said of the vocals which are usually pretty passionate and compelling and emotional though I will say that their voices they're not so distinct that I could pick them easily out of a lineup but they do hold their own they actually hold the tune on these songs the singing on this record doesn't just like devolve into obnoxious painful whinging and what I think is truly the selling point of this record is is that the band here they're really pinning sharp sing-along choruses on a lot of these tracks since I started listening to this thing there are a lot of musical moments that are still stuck in my head like the track the wedding singer the really sweet guitar lick the album opens up with me me me a sweet little melody that coasts beautifully over the driving guitars and bass now the lyrics also are nothing all that revolutionary a lot of middle-class lethargy and malaise and sadness very sentimental at points but occasionally self-aware enough for a touch of self critique or introspection kind of breaking the fourth wall a little bit and mentioning the band I guess what I can congratulate this album on though is that they're not too melodramatic and I think the chorus on the closer just another face is fantastic as well I also like the lyrical dynamic of this track where essentially the song dives into a lot of self-doubt a lot of I guess low self-esteem but then looks forward to the future with a lot of hope and ambition it's a little bittersweet and poses the idea that the potential that this person holds is just not yet seen and he's working toward that I also thought the abrupt ending on the song I am what it was pretty funny given that the mantra at the very end of the track is tell me this is forever tell me this this book so there are some smart parts of this album the issue the main issue that I think for a lot of people is going to be is just that it's so steeped in the the general sound of nearly every significant emo band out there that has a kind of accessible sound it's also criminally short and I think a few tracks panel in comparison to others maybe because the choruses weren't that good or in the case of breathing in stereo the the whole track kind of blurs by and an aggressive but forgettable display but like a lot of good emo records and I think this is a decent emo occurred this album has a strong element of catharsis to it there's a great sense of just kind of letting it all out on this record learning about yourself in the process of going through hardship there's some pretty great anthemic ODEs to life's difficulties on this album that I thought were pretty nice some emo purists like this guy over here might think that the album is a little too poppy and nothing altogether new and you know I'm not arguing against that I agree I just don't necessarily think that a poppy emo record or an emo record that doesn't bring that many new ideas to the table isn't the worst thing in the world as long as there's good tunes on it tunes that are memorable lyrics that are worth singing along with if this LP unfortunately is not the exciting reinvention that emo is long overdue for but for an album that celebrates what made emo so good in the 2000s I think it's decent I'm feeling a strong six to eight seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen there's a lot of did you hate it what was your radio the best you're the best which would I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe

and this fantastic interview is conducted by the needle drop contributor mr. jeremy has said enjoy hello hey hi how are you I'm good how you doing I'm doing well thanks what are you doing really I'm still eating yeah what kind of doughnut is it good it's very good it's cinnamon sugar doughnut that sounds pretty good right now oh I'm not gonna be chomping during our interview oh that's they'll try to keep it you're good okay so you're about to release your new record uh how do you feel about how do you feel about the record hmm sorry I'm feeling really good about this doughnut okay no that's good I'm really proud of it mmm we worked on it for a little over a year in total between like the writing and demoing and recording and stuff and I think it's my best work yet so I'm very very excited to put it out in the world yeah I was gonna ask about the writing because it's been I mean it's been a few years since magic tricks who didn't came out and I was wondering if you were writing that whole time or like what was going on well that first record was I released it on my own and then it was re-released a year later by bada bing in 2013 and then after that release happened we ended up touring a lot I toured for a couple years on that album did my first full national tours and Europe so I was pretty much out on the road for the majority of that gap and really only got home last in the last year or so oh well it's her right it I'm yeah it was a lot of touring I am we really squeeze the lemon on that record and really got the most out of did you start writing anything on the tour like start including new stuff in your in your shows I did yeah there's some of the songs like Black Star has been around for a minute I was playing that live and that's gone through some changes and also another song called right that I've been playing that for a couple years and that used to be called motorcycle and it was a completely different song but yeah I'm trying it was really think of how that could have been called motorcycle I think it's somewhere online there recordings of somewhere like I'm Dee Trotter or something that I sleep that song but yeah those those two in particular were songs that were written in that period kind of on the road and I got to play live and workshop and got to see them change over time which was really cool you know it sounds like a nice experience to kind of witness it firsthand mm-hmm yeah it's cool and sometimes it can be frustrating because there are changes that I want to make to the songs but if I'm touring I can't really I don't have time to take it back into the shop and work on it so sometimes it can be a little frustrating to perform them when I feel like you know they're they're ready to go back into the shop and just get work like tuned up um but it can also be really cool because I think I hear music differently when I'm onstage I hear my songs differently when I'm in front of people mm-hmm it's just how it's just I guess that that's just the visceral experience of just standing in front of someone telling them something you know just instantly changes how I hear things and I think it's yeah I think it's oftentimes there are things that in rehearsal or in writing and like a lot man I'm not sure if this is gonna work but then I'll get in front of an audience and I'm like oh this totally works or like this should this should be longer or this should be shorter so yeah there's just some things that I feel as much as I'd like to work in the what I call it in the shop and on my own writing it's really important to get get in front of people and play the music live because there's a lot of things you just don't realize until you get out there yeah it definitely so yeah for those who don't know the record coming out it's called black teri cat it comes out June 3rd on anti so I was going to ask you what is what are you trying to get across or what do you hope people get from this record and how does that sort of differ from magic tricks well I first of all I just hope that people enjoy the music and take take what they will from it I like I like the idea of just our art being able to speak for itself and people just having their own opinions so I hope that is engaging for people and and they can live with live inside of the music what I was doing in my writing on this album that's different from my first record is the lyrics the lyric I was trying to be a little bit more specific with myself and challenging myself to use words in a different way I used to just be maybe a little bit more vague and abstract with my use of words and just focus on the sounds that they made and as opposed to their meeting and I still do that in this record a little bit but for instance Mexican chef is a song that I wrote the lyrics for first and that's never happened I've never known lyrics first and that just kind of came out of observing restaurant setting up for the night I was walking down the street and just saw kind of like the lion chefs in the back of the restaurant blasting shaitaan music and bachata I mean all you know pretty much every restaurant that I walked by and then in the front of the restaurant the host liked the hosts and the waitstaff playing different you know different different soundscapes and just seeing these two worlds and kind of this in this invisible workforce that was powering these bougie restaurants and i just thought it was really funny made me laugh and i started mumbling these lyrics that i thought were just gonna be a story or a poem or something mm-hmm and when I got back but that was like a it's a song yeah and it definitely sounds like one of them more like observational songs on the record yeah so there's there's that and then there's also songs like I won't say where I was also just playing with my voice and different ways of using it singing speaking but then also trying to challenge myself to talk a little bit about ethnicity and about how I feel being a brown girl in America right now and just it was really hard in that time not to think about those things because there was just a huge kind of uprising the black lives matter movement me I'm just a lot of gun violence that was happening it was just all over everywhere I went so it was really hard to not think about that while I was writing this record and usually that's something that I feel I wouldn't have confronted in my music writing maybe I maybe I'm just I've just been hesitant to say the wrong thing or to not be informed and to not want to be another person just adding to the noise of genius uninformed people just blah all the time yeah but I decided that it was actually just more important to challenge myself to say something for the first time and just I felt that that was a weak point in my lyric writing that I that I could and I wanted to just be more specific so some of those themes of like race and of my my ethnicity and how I identify some of those things creep into some of the lyrics on the record as well mm-hmm so would you say this record is generally more autobiographical than magic trix was or just more specific I think I was just being more specific there are you know there's a lot of personal experience in the record in this record and magic tricks and just a lot of it is based off of either myself or people that I know and it's just kind of like all mixed up in a soup together kind of like a dream that you have I don't know like those dreams that you wake up and you're like you're in your childhood home and then you open the door and you're in a supermarket and then you go to the next and it's all mmm soup all mixed together of these different experiences that's I think that that's how I when I'm thinking about you know people and when I'm writing that's kind of how they come together yeah so what we're taught in fluence is what were some of the like musical influences that we're gonna passing through at the time so I got really into hip-hop in the last two years I discovered slum village for the first time and I was going back and listening to Karis 1 and that was kind of a really Hewitt was a huge turning point for me of just that it just became my new palette that I was listening to every day and in my writing I think I just started to hone in more on these beats and the idea of layering beats and also hitting my vocals maybe in a more MC like way I guess I was also inspired by Kendricks Kendricks picked the butterfly album mm-hmm that come out and I was listening at all these voices on the album his voice but many different voices that he explores in it and I was so inspired by that thinking cool I'm you know my primary instrument is my voice mm-hmm and I really wanted to explore different ways of using that so I think on this album there was a focus a big focus on the vocal performance and really getting these vocal sounds right uh-huh or getting getting them to be the focal point and and yeah and the music writing I think it's a continuation of some of the the kind of adventurous writing for my first record but I just feel that it's maybe a bit more beat oriented on this album and yeah yeah cuz uh magic ya know it does because magic tricks was very like that it wasn't entirely but it was very excuse me it was very keyboards and drums and this one it feels like meteor there's more beats there's like in addition to the drums there's a lot of bass on this record mm-hmm was that you playing the bass yeah well I played the bass on some of the record and then I had a couple of their bassist come up and and track some songs okay as well but I did I wrote a lot of this record on bass which I also think kind of changed the sound of the songs and of my writing a little bit just I just picked it up and it's cool to to write on an instrument that you're not familiar with because it takes you out of the same patterns that you may have had so for me I was just really used to writing on keyboard or singing all my parts out which I still do but picking up that bass I wrote lonely lover on that I wrote Mexican chef that way so there's a number of songs on the record that we're just written on bass I won't say it was written on bass yeah so there so yeah that that bass texture I would have what I found out about actually making this album it's that a lot of times I thought the drums on a record is what makes me dance but I realized that it's actually the bass that makes me dance ya know yeah like I was listening to let us lie in the family stone and Rufus and just listening - yeah like tell me something good Rufus listening to that fat bassline and just realizing that's what's making me dance right now and you've got a few of those fat bass lines on this thing yeah it was really fun it was a fun discovery to have with the bass on that on those tracks yeah so lyrically I remember one of the things that struck me about your first record was the sort of like I guess what I would describe isn't it like an internal like circularity like there's a lot of phrases and and melodies that kind of Rick her like motifs throughout the record and I didn't really I don't think I noticed any really of that this time and I was wondering if there was sort of this conscious decision didn't do not do that kind of trick again huh that's interesting I don't think I like that circularity and I consider that to be one of the things that I've explored a lie am i writing I like the idea of reusing and recycling so I like to start with a with a really simple figure whether it be like a rhythmic figure or a baseline or melody and then I basically chop it up and flip it around and syncopate it differently and I reuse a lot of economize I try to do a lot with a little you know and start so I think that that process was still definitely it's definitely a part of my writing today and on this album certainly that's interesting I hadn't thought of the recurring motifs but I do in this album not being as president have to go back now and listen yeah maybe well maybe maybe the circularity kind of zoned in you know and and and kind of went more to you know song specific because it's kind of sounds like what you're talking about like maybe within a specific song that happens but I mean on magic chicks they were like you know um like hair receding and let's go out there like that's kind of what I was talking about yeah those are two songs so yeah let's go out is born out of hair receding sand came out of that and on this album there is we have a couple interludes in there that kind of reuse and like quote these different motifs that are coming through so like Romeo which is the firt which is like how the album starts his was the beginning of lonely lover that used to be the intro of lonely lover okay and I just and I used that kind of as an intro of the album but that that piece of music was like this extent was kind of this extended version of lonely lover with all this vocal lease over it but then eventually got into that lonely lower baseline um so that it's interesting those are connected and then just like I was written off of lonely lover so the end of lonely lover actually goes into just like I and has some of the same it might it's like starts a half step up from lonely lover like I'm not like that yeah yeah yeah and that's so just like I was born out of little ever bass playing so it's still there some of that yeah some of that stuff is still there I think it's I think it's just the way that I that I write that I'm riffing on an idea and then I just keep going with it for however far I can take it mhm so I think inevitably those connections happen but maybe sometimes they're not as apparent like maybe in this album the songs kind of stand more on their own well it kind of feel felt that way as I listen to it um but now that you say that I mean it that doesn't make a lot of sense no didn't thinking about those the specific ones in my head so yeah I would that so it's still there it's just maybe a little bit a smaller scale or see or something yeah that's interesting that's good cuz like that means I get I got away with it I got away with the same idea like four times over my head yeah yeah and you brought up the interludes I was going to ask about how you choose those or why you choose them or like where you place them well I was listening again I was listening to a little hip-hop and mixtapes up in time and I kind of late in the in the record making process we kind of recorded track most of the record I started being obsessed with mixtapes and I was listening to Pete Rock and all this stuff and I was like man I want to make a mixtape which I don't think this album is amazing enough not I don't think I achieved and that's totally not what I was doing but I was inspired by that aesthetic and this feeling of songs being born out of each other and having just pop it also live band playing some of those interludes like there's one called 5 which is keyboard and drums figure about four years ago it's just kind of like this late-night jam that we had it's called five because I think mark was playing quintuplets really had like there's not a story behind it other than the music that was happening yeah but that figure just kind of we just played at that one time and we just always remembered it stuck around and I just wanted to have some of that plane just that feeling of a band playing for you on the album I'm in-between these songs you know and had that be kind of my mixtape aesthetic so yeah there's a couple a couple of those there's LL which is jam yeah yeah that's a ll is a jam off of Louie lover so that's like the bridge of Lily lover and that's just me playing it on bass and singing what's probably gonna be another song at some point or I'm not sure but yeah I kind of wanted to have that rawness and stuff like maybe song like half songs or ideas that are you know born out of different things on the album you know kind of weaving through I just I felt like I wanted something that was unfinished and like a little less polished yeah take you through yeah yeah I kinda reminds me of uh the last throwing muses record I don't know if you heard that I have not heard that um it's like super long but that's because they included sections of songs that were cut off so they're like there are like all these scraps just like at random places throughout the record of different songs that have already happened or they happen before the real song happened so it's like you get this outro before you actually get the real song that's cool yeah it was kind of this weird like you know mix and match kind of thing going on you know what I thought would be really cool you know all those songs like 80 songs that end with a fade-out and there's like really badass singing or ad-libbing that's happening like the police there's all these police songs and with a fade-out yeah and they're just singing some like probably the best Mele that you've heard yet in the song but it's just as they're fading out I wanted to have like some some kind of an album or a mixtape where you have like all the feet like it starts from the fade-out okay and you like reimagine like what the rest of the song would be if they had kept going and yeah that's interesting somebody should do that that sounds fun yeah something could be fun to make because you'd have to write like a whole record with songs that have fade outs but then kind of scrap that record and just pick up oh that's that sounds fun yeah all right so to shift a little bit I wanted to talk at least a little about you you're growing up because you're a Connecticut native like yeah way it's kind of fun wait so the needle drop is based in Connecticut yeah so there's something actually valid and cool happening in Connecticut yep we're coming from Connecticut yeah great okay it hasn't always been I mean it's kind of moved as uh as Anthony has moved but uh it's always been connecticut-based yeah he used to have a show on WNPR you don't know that no so that's yeah so it's kind of an extra reason why I wanted to talk to you about growing up in Connecticut because we uh you know there aren't too many no connecticut-based people who you know whether they stay or leave you know get sort of on the radar any there and it's kind of fun to have have someone get there so you're you uh you're Harford native right I am yeah so what was it like for you growing up there my family is great that's what yeah that was and I think to me that's what you know kind of the majority of like my memories and growing up the good stuff spend time with my family but yeah culturally it's tough Hartford is a really tough place there's not too much going on culturally at least when I was there and I just couldn't wait to leave honestly I was just I wanted to get out and when did you leave when I was 18 okay I moved to Boston I'm going to school there I did know and I could not wait to I wanted to live in this in a big city I wanted to move to New York but I think I just was like I need some time to get my thoughts together before I do that yeah Boston's kind of like a big city but it's a little calmer yeah yeah it's like really good for studying oh yeah it's very meditative that's distracting vibe I guess but yeah I grew up in Hartford my grandma lives near downtown still and I went to public schools in Hartford until about the third grade I think that then my mom was like okay I want you to finish school and I don't want you to get pregnant and I don't want me to join a gang so we're gonna have to pony up and put you in private school because literally like all of my friends we're getting pregnant at 13 and they were like yeah there was a lot of gang violence in the 90s still so yeah I was a little rough but then she took me out she's like you're doing this I'm her her only child so she was like you you gotta you gotta get this to get was really important for her for me to finish school and and do it so I was in Catholic school for the rest of my like for middle school in in high school which is an interesting experience and yeah I just I think Hartford growing up there I was very isolated and very naive and it's definitely not a big city and definitely just the lack of culture like in arts was what I'm referring to is it's tough but like music saved me and I I i was in this program for like it was supposed to be this summer program for like inner-city kids where you get to like pick an art that you do so I picked music and I learned about jazz through this program actually there's the first time I ever heard jazz and it was um just time to remember his name I think Michael got angka this composer dude really far out and he's having us build our own instruments out of recycled whatever we could find like PVC pipes and then he was teaching us about improvised music and that you could write scores you could invent your own notation and just write scores and you didn't have to you know have like there were different ways that you could write out music and different ways that you could compose and that was a really formative like early music experience I haven't Hartford that was super important I don't know if they'd still have that program I think it was run by the Greater Hartford Arts Academy oh yeah I went there for freshman year oh that is a school but they have summer programs getting confused yeah this is not a school this was it was just a non-profit like summer camp kind of vibe in downtown Hartford at the Civic Center which is abandoned I don't even know if it's still there but it was like this abandoned Civic Center where the Wailers used to play there I don't know like a hockey team yeah I feel like they might made a new one okay I don't know having been in that area in a while I don't go there alone not my mom but I kind of just go and see them and then leave yeah but yeah we were hanging out in the Civic Center which is Beit was basically like this huge abandoned kind of mall mm-hmm and these classes would happen and these abandoned storefronts so yeah it was really it was really cool and that was the first time I heard Miles Davis the first time I heard Coltrane we had a class where this guy was like breaking down Tupac and Coltrane like that was his he's like today we will talk about Tupac and Coltrane and I will tell you why this is spiritually transcending music so that that was some pretty dope stuff that happened yeah and hardly opening it was great but yeah other than that just learning about the ghettos in Hartford and how like the Puerto Rican community and ghettos were founded basically in the 70s they some of these manufacturers went to Puerto Rico to recruit workers to come and work at their factories for cheap and like you know I don't know if they promised them housing or what it is but that's basically why there's such a large concentration of Puerto Rican workers and some in some of Hartford yeah I've been trying to find more reading about it but that's interesting yeah it is and I had no because I would just always say like how did you end up here like why my mom Berto Rico my dad's from Cuba and I would just always ask my family how did you end up in this place in the middle of Connecticut its way here knowing like what's the deal but apparently it was for work and that's what everybody would say but say oh yeah a friend of mine said there was work or something but there was a concerted effort to actually bring Puerto Ricans to come and work for some of these factories no that's interesting yeah it's like untold story of hereford yeah now this is another like half informs you know information I'm giving you but I need to research more about it well I've done no research about it's good to me yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to that at some point yeah no that's actually that's a very interesting story so how then how much did growing up in your background influence what you do now like your art now um where does it yeah I mean definitely just I think all the things that a person experiences in their life somehow influences what they end up doing and shapes them and their work although I don't think that you are necessarily defined by your circumstances at all but yeah i'm i am inspired by my family and my culture where i come from but in my work i am just trying to create something new you know do my do my own thing and kind of I really love writing it's probably my favorite thing I love singing but writing is probably like the most fulfilling thing for me and I I like to explore just different ways of putting a song together mm-hmm would you ever write any other kind of writing like a novel or something I used to want to be a writer when I was a kid but then I got in a fight with words but I still haven't reconciled I'm trying this album is like I'm trying to reconcile my fat with words mm-hmm I don't know maybe someday so then how did you come to music as a career I just always I've always sung and made up music pieces and songs and different things um so I kind of I just never occurred to me that I would do anything else um and so it's just basically that's just what I do like there's not there was never any if there's another path yeah if there's a career or there's not a career like I'm still I'm just doing this you know it's just kind of like my it's my livelihood in in terms of just staying sane and or just being yeah being alive unless so in terms of like making money but yeah just what I do yeah how did a magic tricks come about them magic tricks came about I had been I've been composing a lot of kind of instrumental music for a while I stopped singing for a couple years and Matt liked a lot of the songs on magic tricks kind of came out of that period where I hadn't been singing for a while and I started writing songs like more mm-hmm I was I my idea was to write a bunch of stupid pop songs and like start start this band with my drummer called Bill and Clarissa where we would just play stupid stupid pop songs but that's such a good name panning out and I just started I was going through a hard time my dad was ill and I had just come back from Florida trying to set him up at this nursing home and it was just it was a really hard time personally and I just felt a huge urgency to just play music and I think that's where that album was born I just um I started playing keyboards which I was too shy to play in purse in public before because I'm not I don't consider myself to be a keyboardist mm-hm I kind of just plunk around but I don't have any technique or anything but I just felt so urgent about playing songs I'm singing and expressing myself so um in the course of like three months I just started playing keyboards and looping my voice and doing all this stuff and it just all happened really quickly because I think I was just emotionally urgent about playing music and then I yeah I've recorded this record with my drummer Marco and engineer Jeremy Lucas and I was just really urgent about putting it out so we put it out ourselves in 2012 and and that was kind of like the beginning of like touring for the first time and it's like putting myself out there I think before I just always have lived with you know writing song than singing but I never I guess I I have many interests and music and it was really hard for me to stop and just focus on one thing mm-hmm but magic trix was the beginning of me focusing on songwriting and singing and touring and making an album and what is that and just figuring all that out for the first time yeah so how did the recording process go for the new one who's playing with you on it so Marcos Marco bucho he's playing drums on it I played bass on a number of tracks and then we had a couple of our bassist come in Julian Smith plays upright bass on I won't say and then Jordan Cannella plays bass on a couple of tracks as well I have a freezer Campbell played sax and clarinet on some of the tracks and then I'm playing since on it and I'm singing yeah I mean there's there's still a large dose of keyboards on this yeah yeah it's definitely not as keyboards the first record was definitely like piano piano trio power trio kind of vibe but this this album yeah it definitely has more in the way of beats and bass lines and stuff but but yeah there's still there since layered since in there too so how did how did anti come into the fold anti came in Andy Culkin who started the label he saw me play at a show in California he was in the he was in the lobby I was opening for this band called man man okay yeah and he was at the show hanging out in the lobby while we were playing and he thought there was a DJ playing he thought it was like somebody like chopping up beats or doing something and then he came in and was like oh it's a bad okay and he approached me I always go to the merch table like right after the show and try to meet people and stuff and he came up to me and was like hey I have a label what who's putting out your next record like what's going on and I was just like oh man this is just another you know crazy bananas person I go yeah sure but luckily I wasn't like - I must have not been too rude or anything but yeah we just met at a show and well we connected with the music I wonder how often it happens that way anymore I don't know it happened to me a couple times actually that I met some really amazing like people that I admire that work work at record labels and put up letter records that I like I'm at a show like I got to meet John Poneman from Sub Pop had a show I was playing a festival in Poland of all places of all places yeah and I was just the week before I was thinking I was like how could I meet somebody from SubPop like how could that happen because I would love to just talk to them and just see what they're doing and like share my music and they're so great a little bit and I go to Poland and I'm playing the set you know and it was really fun and cool festival but that's the last place on earth that I thought met him and just somebody was like oh look over there there's those people are from Sub Pop I'm like no way that's crazy so I just I think I was just like high on adrenaline after the show and I walked up to to John Poneman not knowing who he was I'm just like hey I heard you work at Sub Pop like amazing you were at somebody's yeah but yeah it turns out like you saw the set and and yeah and we're friends just off of meeting at a show that's happened a couple times but yeah I guess so pop it in there Glenn big labels yeah it's kind of neat that they still do that yeah I'm the thing that you that I find is that you'd be surprised how many OGS are out there and they just are like the best people the music off it not all the time I guess is always the case but often times the music that I really really love is put out by and represented by some real oh geez and people that I actually admire and want to talk to and want to know that's wrong though yeah and I just I'm surprised a lot of times it just takes me back like oh yeah people actually listen to music like that's why a lot of us actually started doing this you know a lot of people that's why a lot of people started labels to begin with because their music fans and they aren't they didn't stop being music fans just because they have like a big label or they're yeah yeah and I mean probably they do get jaded but they're their music fans you know so it's it's really yeah it's it's cool it's a cool reminder every time that happens yeah that's nice mm-hmm so what will touring look like for this record what's who's gonna be on stage with you we're about we're trying out some new setups um I've been playing as a trio most recently I was playing keyboards and sampling and and I had a bass I have a basis that joined the band I used to be a duo but we have a bassist now who's playing electric and Moog okay and also doing some sampling and then marko on drums with his whole drum space station vibe he has incredible effects that he's doing live so he's not really into the whole drum pad thing mm-hmm he likes to he likes to do things analog so he effects his snares through guitar pedals and mics them and does all this amazing stuff he's an excellent drummer too he's amazing yeah he was crazy so I have yeah - two people joining me on stage now and I think we're gonna be eventually a quartet hopefully by the fall and hopefully tour as a quartet with me just being a little bit more free to just focus on my voice and my vocal performance and I'm also really curious about just getting into my body more not necessarily that I'm gonna be doing like dance routines or anything like that which is more connecting with my body and how that affects my voice because my instrument is inside my body and I feel disconnected from it a lot of times yeah so I I'm looking forward to just having yeah having that quartet setup kind of freed me up to to get into my singing have you been trying to have you been trying to repurpose old songs or do you - well it's funny because I've been playing I've been playing magic tricks for so long that it's I think that the songs have been growing on they're kind of on their own like without me doing much and some of them are kind of growing into this new kind of hip-hop soul funk inspired space which is cool to see them grow like that and but yeah I'll definitely be playing some of the older material on tour as well are you doing a full US tour yes hope hopefully I'll be able to announce more details about that soon okay so real quick before we we go I wanted to just ask if you do you have a favorite song on the album um right now that might change but like right now do you my favorite song album is called sebum which is yeah a b-side track yeah I was one of the ones that uh actually kind of you know caught my caught my ear call me curiosity a lot oh cool yeah that's probably one of my favorite tracks on the album because I got to really stretch out in my writing and it feels a little bit like a choose your own adventure by song like you know I know where you're like if you want to go down this way turn to page 43 yeah it's like yeah that's kind of it is kind of a wormhole and stream of thought stream of consciousness kind of writing and I feel but I also it's cohesive and it come you know there there are seconds left repeat and come back but I just was really happy about how I got to stretch out on that song and then also I was trying some things vocally like on that the song starts on this first verse I was thinking of singing how a percussionist would play mm-hmm so or like an MC and trying to chop my words up like that and and I it was it was a fun experimentation of like using my voice in different ways on that jac sounds like it'll kind of be fun to play live - yes and be fun to finger out yeah it's gonna be really interesting that so that song we recorded in bits and pieces and there's a lot of sampling done of ourselves of the bands so like we laid down the roads parts and the drum parts live but then just as a jam session and then we cut them up and like sampled ourselves and tried to make it sound like it was coming off and off of another record sonically so yeah there's a lot of sound stuff going on a lot of moving bits and pieces it's gonna be really a huge challenge to play it live but I'm really excited to do that I think in the next couple weeks we gotta get it together that's a big song yeah I have a relief show coming up on June 4th in Brooklyn where's that at baby's alright ok so that's gonna be kind of like my big show for the for the summer here on the Northeast yeah and then I have a show coming up in Philly and I'm going to Slovakia for a music festival again in little places some really cool label and other people there but I'm not expecting and yeah so I'm gonna be popping around a little bit in the summer and then coming back for a bigger tour in the fall cool well it sounds like you are you're in a good spot and you're really excited about what's going on with just nice yes I'm grateful that I get to share my music and that people want to talk to me about it you oq4 no problem thank you I really liked the record and I've been a fan for a while so I was very excited to to get to talk to you thanks Jeremy so yeah we're gonna put this up on the channel and we'll link people below to some information about your album great called black tarry cat comes out on June 3rd on anti and some of your tour dates and your website all that kind of stuff we'll let everybody know so yeah that's about it thank you so much for spending time with us today absolutely thinks like a great question yes thanks for the good answer yeah all right thank you too 
kgTq2cC2kUM,I thought this was going to be a gay guy giving me a tutorial on shade it's not what we're doing here somewhere we're doing here plan fatigue grant a know the Internet's boringest dumbest dumbest music nerd review Minh with the best teeth in the fucking game and it's time for a review of the new feller talk record natcher surge this is the third full-length album one of the most interesting and exciting metal bands out of Norway right now and they are known for their creative fusions of black metals and thrash metal some hardcore punk a little bit of hard rock and rock and roll some classic rock vibes coming out of some of the guitar riffs with a splash of black metal too coming through on the very harsh retched occasionally retched vocals the blast beat drumming their debut record that came out in 2010 which was produced by Kurt Balu of converge Fame amazing debut album rarely our debut records this good and the follow-up record they dropped a few years later was really more of the same it was actually another review on the internet that had pointed out to me that the translation of the title of this record literally means more which was fine the band had a pretty original and distinct sound and I think with this record they proved that it wasn't just some novelty that there was more than one album to this sound to the band there was a slight change of pace though on this record it seemed like the group was getting a little more melodic a little sweeter and cooler talk on this latest record over here continues to sweeten the deal with even more melody more dynamics less overtly punishing and aggressive music they're packing even more hard rock and classic rock riffs and anthemic guitar leads into their tracks to the point where the band no longer feels like a metal band toying with a little bit of classic rock they feel more like this revivalist hardrock group with a really heavy sound and screamed vocals which is necessarily a bad thing on paper just kind of makes the band's last record seem so much like a transitional moment in theory I'm totally for the band kind of flipping the balance of influences in their music because it could mean just another very refreshing record from Beller talk and while on their previous records I think they pulled off rage and aggression really well not only were these first two records visceral and exciting but they were also really catchy but now I'm not so sure if trying to go more accessible was really the way to go here this album isn't just more this album is kind of like more Part two because there are plenty of cuts on this thing and they're just 9 plenty of cuts on this thing that feel like they could have fit pretty snugly into the last album like the title track with its driving pumping guitar riffs and melodic guitar leads that feel like when I'm listening to them in my mind I get the image of a rogue motorcycle gang riding through the desert on a long stretch of abandoned Highway we also have the speedy hard-hitting and kind of Motorhead influenced riffs of the song bronze good and these cuts are ok it just doesn't seem like the band is taking all that many risks with some of the better songs on here the better songs are just kind of what you've come to expect from Cavell or talk then there are other cuts where there's a real instrumental change of pace for the band where we're getting these hardrock these vintage almost classic rock riffs they're layered with these melodic guitar leads sometimes they're harmonized they don't sound too bad but it's what the band does with them that I think doesn't really work and that's just lay them with the typically screamed vocals of the previous two albums which I enjoyed very much within the context of the black metal and thrash metal and heavy metal and hardcore punk sounds of those records but just kind of throwing these throat shredding screams on top of these very mid-paced swaggered hard rock riffs just doesn't read all that well to me even though they do have a veer metal a very heavy heavy and hard metal tone to them I think I would just much rather have a clean vocal over some of these cuts it's it's cool that the band is getting more dynamic instrumentally but I just think the vocals don't reflect the change of pace that the band is making compositionally the song 1985 I think is a prime example one of my least favorite tracks on the record then the tracks fart mess which has this Stevie Nicks esque intro with these tension building guitars is damn I'm not gonna Hannah Hannah Hannah and then over that the rockness lead guitars that you've ever heard damnit dicta to do without that fucking lighter would we doves sings songs and apps you sing him baby whoo some of the changes on this record I think have resulted in a couple decent tracks the opening cut is great not only is it enraging like a lot of the Bands previous material but you could tell they're trying to layer more harmonies and more melodic guitars into the mix so not only is the track hard-hitting not only is it throttling but it's really rich and grand and that black metal influence continues to with the blast beats hanging in the background and on the song Berserker to the hardrock the Punk the black metal influences all seem to co-exist really nicely too and then there's the longest cut on the album hex barn which is this nine minute epic pretty ambitious for Beller talk and it's got a nice tension building and intro I mean there's there's not really much more to the track that that left a big impression on me past that but I will say that this album is one of several moments on the record where it feels like there's a good amount of cleanly some background vocals to kind of balance out the harshness of the very prominent lead vocals throughout much of the record and that's something that I wish happened a little more if at least I wasn't going to get any clean lead vocals I don't think this is the worst thing that Keller talk could have put out but this is just not at the level of not only quality and songwriting and citement but also I guess cutting-edge ideas that I have expected from the band up until this point some tracks make me feel like they've painted themselves into a corner and merely feel like lesser cuts from previous records while others I think point to a direction that I'm not really enjoying with the band where they're primarily just dishing out all of these hard rock riffs and cliches and they're just delivering some very aggressive and abrasive vocals on top of them which to me isn't really that refreshing we're interesting of a combination I'm feeling a light two DS and six on this record Tran 
lgnyb1PGcWk,oh hey everyone brushed in hair tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kate Renata album 99.9% Kate Renata is a Montreal producer who has been at for a while but now with this new record over here he is putting out his debut his commercial debut for XL recording pretty big label pretty big jump nice you know moment in the career there and on this album he has amassed some pretty impressive features he seems to have a little bit of everything for everybody we have cream Riggins and bad bad not good on here for those who like their hip-hop views with jazz also alunageorge as well as little dragon for those who enjoy pop and indie pop and dance pop we have a little neo soul and some house on here appearances from Craig David and Anderson pack for you R&B heads with all these names on here there has to be at least one great song or a great single or something so I went into this album expecting some good music but I'm always kind of skeptical of these producer curated albums they're often inconsistent have a little bit of filler some of the performances are so-so there's definitely a lot here though for people who are aspiring producers and production buffs and beat nuts Kate Renata on this album showcases a level of versatility that I think most producers can only pray to achieve but he just reaches so far and wide on this record that the album ends up feeling more like a resume than it does in LP because across the 15 tracks here he does everything but specializes in nothing except for maybe good mixing practices and resonant bass and very crisp percussion and I do appreciate the effort that he makes to have some of the tracks here flow together cohesively like they segue into one another occasionally and I think it's great that on 99.9% Kate Renata was able to bring a lot of different music Styles and vibes together under one roof and have them coexist pretty effectively there's nothing on this album that seems so far outside of his talent level that it sounded awful or just that he shouldn't have done it there are a few underwhelming vocal guests but their appearances weren't really anything that I wasn't already anticipating given my familiarity with their previous work people like Sid of the Internet as well as goldlink and there are some collaborations on here that I wish were fleshed out a little more into not only a more structured and more superior song but just because it felt like there was chemistry there and it should have led to something more than just simply a two-minute track given the fantastic drumming on the song where Kareem Riggins appears I wish that track was longer I wish bad bad not good had a little more presence on there cut to it feels less like a live performance or a collaboration and more like the band is kind of simply being sampled but on the tracks that I went into expecting something good because I already enjoyed the artists I wasn't disappointed and often I was really surprised at how well Kate Renata was actually able to cater to the sound and the style of the person he was working with case in point Craig David someone who I I haven't listened to probably in a decade and Kate Renata does a fantastic job of laying him on a track where he has that 2000s era R&B sound but he makes the instrumental little psychedelic with these kind of ghostly vocal samples the track featuring little dragon at the end sounded just like a cut that could have made it onto their last full-length LP with these driving dance rhythms and just very smooth lead vocals I also like the very soulful bubbly and kind of futuristic glowed up featuring Anderson Pak that was a pretty big single from this record and it holds up within the context of the album and the track drive me crazy surprised me not only with a kind of sparkling Spacey banger beat but also a very charismatic verse from vic mensa and the song also has this kind of eerie spectacular beat change up around the three minute and 30 second mark I don't really feel like I loved this track but I was impressed with the the sounds that are brought together the song was kind of like a fusion of the bubblegum house beats from the first Disclosure record with the kind of obscure crate Diggory of an artist like mad lib and Kate Renata is actually able to consistently bring that house vibe for the last third of this record just all of a sudden we kind of transition into a totally different style of electronic and dance music at one point in the album and while he sounds just as comfortable here I do think the material does leave a little to be desired I wish it was a little punchier left a stronger impression though much of this type of music does just simply read to me to something that would be played in like a dressing room at the mall just very airy and inconspicuous it wasn't terrible I mean it sounded just as decent as many other artists that make this very same type of music which is kind of funny considering that this is not really his calling card this is nice mo it sounds like he's merely dabbling in this kind of music and he's doing it well or doing it just about as well as anybody else who's making it and that's the thing even though the record does feel again like a resume and just merely like Kate Renata showing off everything that he can do he complements all of his guests really well on this record and I have no doubt that in the coming year so this album is going to earn him a lot of production credits because given how well he seems to work with so many different people on this album who wouldn't want to be from him especially given that he had a production credit on latest chance mixtape I mean it was one of my least favorite tracks on the tape but the instrumental really had nothing to do with why I didn't like the song I mean that singing was terrible and the hook was awful the album is decent I mean Kate Renaud is certainly talented but he didn't necessarily come together with a cohesive and a consistent record here you know I would love to hear an album with the producer guy is talented as this who is just kind of really taking the reins here and playing director and the guests he has on the record are just kind of merely playing a small role in a larger piece one last point I kind of want to make about the record is that I guess the reason it's not really impressing as a whole is that a lot of it doesn't really feel all that memorable to me I mean part of my feelings on the record I think can be boiled down to one moment on the album where we kind of have this Vogel snippet this skit where someone needs to be reminded of who Kate Renata is like and that's kind of how I feel like in a year so I likely will need to be reminded of this album because there's just not really a strong sense of personality or a strong sonic identity to it you know as I said I feel like I'm going to see this guy's face and see this guy's name more in the future because it sounds like he complements the artists that he collaborates with really well however this album mm over the place it's kind of like a chameleon you know it's hiding in the background it's blending in it's not trying to stand out necessarily I'm feeling a decent strong six on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate here the best you're the best or should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't die because if you do then you can't watch the videos goddammit Kate Renata 99.9% forever 
hYHaK_6IOAk,haha hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here you know it is before we get into this review of the new chance the rapper mixtape I am making an announcement about the music app symbol who I have been sort of doing some promos for lately it's a great music app for sharing music it's a lot like Instagram but you're kind of sharing songs instead of just images and a lot of people who have been following me on the app have been asking me dude when is an Android version of the app going to come out I have been given permission to show this picture and tell you guys that the Android beta version is coming in the full version is just around the corner more info down there in the description box and if you're not on an Android phone and you're not following the on symbol follow me I share lots of songs over there you know new songs that I'm listening to classic songs I'm listening to and yeah that's it guys alright let's get into the review what do both the needs hano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new chance the rapper mixtape coloring book Chano is a Chicago rapper and singer this is the follow-up project to his big break out hit mixtape acid rap which came out back in 2013 and fans have been dying for a follow-up since although maybe that social experiment album titled surf last year might have counted to some but not necessarily to me not only because there wasn't just a whole lot of chance on that project overall but I didn't really care for that project and honestly I wasn't head over heels for I wasn't in love with acid rap but I thought that was great potential in this project and of course in whatever chance would come out with in the future and I was certainly looking forward to this tape over here given that one of its lead singles angels was so goddamn good not only a witty funny blissful charismatic hip-hop track but also had these really strong influences coming from not only jazz but gospel to a combination of sounds that should feel familiar to chance the rapper fans at this point not only given his work with the social experiment on tracks such as Sunday candy but also his recent appearance on the new Kanye West album with ultra-light beam and as long as the verses and the production are consistent I could see a record fusing together jazz and hip hop and gospel as being a pretty awesome and ambitious undertaking and that is exactly the mix of influences we get on this tape with also some splashes from pop and some soul and a bit of a diversion into hip House on the song all night and even though we have a cool mix of musical styles on this record if we were to look at the features list on this album it seems a little less eclectic it's just kind of more of the same of what you would expect from the rap mainstream little Lane 2 Chainz t-pain Kanye West and the production on this thing is handled by a handful of different producers though much of it is credited to the social experiment which when I saw that I was a little worried given how weak and just out of whack I thought a lot of the mixing and the production was on surf and sadly and I do mean sadly emphasis on sadly it's an issue here too right from the start of the record which is majorly disappointing because there are some great ideas on this song all we got not only are the trumpet embellishments beautiful the lead melodies are great the grand Gospel vocals the choir vocals at the end of the track are fantastic I don't really mind chances verse on this track either it's not like amazing but he definitely starts the album off with a lot of energy and then at the 1 minute and 12 seconds on is completely ruined by what sounds like five auto-tune Kanye's all singing their way through a heart attack simultaneously and know it doesn't matter if this is intentional it's still awful it sounds terrible ruins tract not a good sound no not good at all the mix on this track is worse than like the original mix on the life of Pablo and yes I have heard the mix tape mix and the Apple music mix and neither sound good we also have an issue of song structure on the tracks summer friends which is one of the more underwhelming cuts on the tape but I think could have been a emotional and personal moment if not for the fact that what could have been the verse is just clashing against what could have been the chorus as they just kind of occur over one another at the same time throughout the track chances verses are at odds with what sounds like a cyborg Bon Iver crazy idea let the singing happen then once the singing is done let the rapping happen and then repeat that and you've got like a coherent song the song Juke Jam does not deliver unfortunately on it's very mouth-watering title instead it's a kind of uninspired slow jam featuring a soulless breathy feature from the Biebs and all night is one of the cheapest pieces of hip house I've heard in a while not only is the chorus totally insipid and obnoxious but this is another cut in the track listing here where the vocal mix is totally out of whack and chances singing while it's usually somewhat on point just goes full-fledged awful on this track we have the meandering smoke break with future which doesn't really add anything to the tape other than another feature credit I do like the instrumental which i think is kind of pretty but the track just makes too much of an emotional fuss over getting high and watching Netflix though I guess you can make an emotional fuss over anything that you used to do with somebody who you're really I don't know in love with or just have strong feelings for I mean I guess you could write a song about eating Twinkies and doing cartwheels but I'm not going to just totally beat this tape up for like 10 or 15 minutes because there are some good tracks on here there are highlights on here there's the track no problem with two chains and little Wayne I love the cue keyboards and the crispy drums and the bright inspiring gospel vocals sampled in the track it's not an amazing cut but it has a good chorus you know I know Pamela brown Ruby funny verse from chance though I will say there is a little more lyrical presence from 2 Chainz a little Wayne both of them seem to dominate the track a little bit more and the song completely avoids any major mixing issues that some of the other cuts here have then they're same drugs probably my favorite track on the record and a really great ballad a track that uses drug use as a metaphor for chance kind of drifting away from this person who he cares about quite a bit just kind of using the fact that they're not using the same drugs to say that they're not at the same point in life anymore and they've effectively drifted apart to me this track is really like the cocoa butter kisses of the album because you know we're kind of seeing drug use represent something of a separator between him and somebody who he cares about then we had the cut angels which was fantastic as a single and is still great in the context of the record the instrumental amazing one of chances best verses on the record on here - I love the line when he's talking about God splitting an atom with him and a lot of the closing tracks and the tracklist here tie the album up in a nice tight little gospel bow like would be really beautiful and inspiring how great which has these amazing huge just gargantuan gospel vocals for the first half of the track oh great so god I also love the line about how this is the kind of worship that makes Jesus come back a day early chances verse ends in an abrupt way though it seems like that's kind of implied in a funny way in his lyrics though the song itself finishes I don't know in a way that just leaves me with a cliffhanger I'm just not really that happy with how quickly the track just ends out of nowhere and I love the extra helping of group vocals the doo doo vocals on the track finish line - it's it's vocals like this that kind of remind me of Kanye's debut record college dropout how some of the great group vocals kind of popped up here and there throughout that record vocals that seem greatly inspired by either so or gospel or just choral music and later in the track the instrumental kind of transitions into something of like I don't know a bit of peppy 70s era jazz that sounds like it could be worked into a sitcom theme or something chants on here delivers a verse that is one of many moments on this album that is super personal super telling about everything that's been going on with him lately with his kid and his girl and trying to support them with his music and sharing his music around the world no-names verse embraces the religious themes of not only this track but much of the record and Kirk Franklin at the very end of the track kind of takes this preacher tone with his lyrics and and almost delivers a kind of poetic sermon at the back end of this cut and the blessings reprieves and the original blessings earlier in the tracklisting it was a little underwhelming at first but it definitely grew on me but this reprise I liked even more not only are the vocals that end the track off wonderful and very golden and luscious and beautiful and inspiring but chance I think lays down his best and most telling verse on the entire record here saying at one point that he's like mr. Mufasa he had to master stampedes this is one of many spots on the record where chance when he's at his best he again is charismatic he's inspiring he's warm he's inviting he's fun and he brings this infectious sense of optimism there's a lot of super enjoyable tracks in this track listening however this tape is just not as consistent as I would like it to be there are a few of chances worse songs here there are a few tracks that really should have been remixed could have been given a better mix and while chance is anti label in a sense he's obviously not against bogging his tape down in a bunch of trendy features and he's not beyond delivering a struggle bar or two either like they got to ask if they may Cinco DeMayo or that one line about giving sane a swirly this project is and vicious it's fun its grand but it is still flawed but those flaws don't completely tarnish the enjoyability of this project I do think overall this was certainly a show of growth past acid rap it's not as immediate or as snappy or as poppy as acid rap I will say that and I certainly admire a lot of the risks and a lot of the reaching chants had to do in order to make some of the huge songs on this record happen I'm feeling a life 7 on this thing transitioning and be given the sound listen did you love it did you hate it what did would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't die chance the rapper coloring book forever 
Ml54onIX-LU,all right hello everyone softening tanto here the Internet's busiest music Mary and it is time for a review of the new no new album hopelessness an Oni is the name of singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist formerly known as Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons Fame also Hercules and love affair and this is her first purely solo record under this brand new name and even though I like the singles teasing up to the release of this record I did have my reservations because in the past I've never really been in Antony and the Johnsons fan but when it came time to dive into this record I was pleasantly surprised by the material that was presented it was not the whimsically obtuse experience that I had expected this album in fact is actually synthetic it's really direct takes a ton of notes from synth pop glitch pop a little bit of art pop - and also features production from the likes of Hudson Mohawke and onenote Rick's point never so you know the instrumentals on this record are going to be super digital colorful vivid punchy and maybe a little abstract the instrumentation might not always flow with a note knees vocals in the way that it might have on those Antony and the Johnsons records where of course you had all that chamber instrumentation which followed very closely to the vocal performances but generally I liked the production I liked the beats I liked the instrumentals on this album they are very textured and they suffice now also becoming more straightforward on this record are the lyrics which are boldly political she leaves very little to the imagination on this record in terms of her intention she really kind of hits listeners over the head with what she's trying to say which isn't necessarily a bad thing if the songs are enjoyable take for example the song watch me which is a track about government surveillance whose narrative I think is actually kind of hilarious the way that she poses it we're talking about a protagonist here who is aware that she is being surveilled aware that she is being watched by the government but she sort of talks about the government as if it's her father she calls daddy she refers to in a loving way and says that it must love her because it's watching her all the time we also have the song 4 degrees which is a track about the environment in global warming a drone bomb me a song where essentially the protagonist of the track wishes to die because their whole world has been torn apart by war and specifically drone bombs drone bombs as well as mass graves and torture are themes that come up on the song Crysis 2 where essentially the listener is forced to along with an open e take on a bit of responsibility as an American for the horrible things that our government does every day to protect us and there is the song execution which is literally about execution capital punishment and direct comparisons are drawn between America and other countries that are seen as terrible in terms of their human rights violations but also make use of capital punishment the Saudis the Koreans the Chinese the politics on this thing are super heavy-handed some people are going to be turned off by right away however I personally see it as kind of refreshing to hear some serious urgency being delivered by a singer on some seriously life-or-death topics here because we live in an age where a lot of our political discussions boiled down to whining over first world problems on social media or like underneath BuzzFeed articles and the media isn't really doing any better facilitating smart political discussions because it flip on any news channel and is essentially like Hillary versus Trump 24/7 we're getting close to almost 20 years of war in the Middle East and with each year it seems like there's more and more just growing apathy to it and this is something that I think the title track of this album in a way addresses and kind of delivers a bit of a bleak outlook on the future as the song portrays of every human being almost like a virus that is continuing through this cycle of taking away more from earth and they are giving back I love the explosive emotional lyrical and musical finish of the track - it almost makes me wish that this was the final song of the entire album I get that she might have also wanted to make this point that she did on the song maro about the earth kind of being sucked dry but to me hopelessness was the the ideal finish because marrow to me is just kind of one of several moments on here where the message kind of trumps the music there's not much of a song there's not much of a melodic or really even an interesting sonic element to some of these tracks as an oak knees lyrics sort of take center stage now her vocal performances for the most part on this record are captivating or are at least attention-grabbing even if they're not always enjoyable because as I expected though not as much here as on those Antony and the Johnsons records but the vocals are still kind of an acquired taste this very deep expressive barato that just shakes so hard on some of these tracks occasionally in a really weird way slightly reminds me of Michael McDonald of the Doobie Brothers but not in a bad way just kind of one of those things that once I thought it I couldn't unhear it during some parts and while I don't mind a strange vocal in fact I'd rather vocalists try to be more eccentric than just bland and commercial and generic there are moments on here where I do think the singing goes a little overboard and it becomes more obnoxious than it is eclectic like on the track watch me where we're getting kind of all of these vocal embellishments hanging behind the instrumentation after the verses during watch baby and then on the song Obama Obama a track where I definitely understand the point of the song I mean Obama in a lot of respects has been a pretty great disappointment in terms of the piece and the other various systemic issues in the first world that a lot of people who would like to tend thought that he would fix right away or just be the solution to when in fact he wasn't and just kind of continued a lot of these awful see is that we hated so much about the Bush administration but this decent point is kind of swallowed in the very obtuse music and vocal delivery then we have the song violent men which is another okay point although this track just kind of feels more like a mantra and not so much like a coherent and interesting song and also that this track is kind of a funny point to make considering that we're on the verge of electing what could possibly be our first female president who will probably be just as hawkish as Obama maybe even more hawkish than the xenophobic dope that she's running against and even though there are points on this album that I like and that I can get behind some of the I guess you can call them arguments on this record though I don't want to completely use that word here because you know these are songs these are pieces of art these are expressions they're not five thousand word dissertations on the political issues being addressed in these tracks but still I do feel like the song execution though I do like it's sparkling sense and the galloping beat could use a little more nuance because I think directly comparing America's use of capital punishment to like Saudi Arabia where you could be punished in a variety of different ways including execution just for like same-sex relations it seems like a little bit of a jump a little bit of a jump I mean if you're going to bring up America in Saudi Arabia in the same track why not bring up the fact that we hypocritically criticize other countries for their human rights violations but very rarely Saudi Arabia and we continue to do tons and tons of business both financial and political with them and also I mean it's not that there aren't good arguments against capital punishment that I agree with there most certainly are it's just that this song isn't really one of them now there are other cuts in the tracklisting here that are not only great points or I think put together some great lyrics on a pertinent topic but are also musically chilling and beautiful drone bomb me prime example a track whose vocal performance I think is one of the most amazing on the entire record and really kind of puts me into the emotions of the character that Nokes me is trying to play on this song who again wishes for her own death because her life has just essentially been torn apart by this war that she's living in the middle of and the song four degrees to the course is on this track are just super passionate they're huge they're epic they're grandiose and the explosive song is kind of met with this mantra where she's singing over and over it's only four degrees it's only four degrees essentially kind of sweeping the urgency of the whole climate change thing under the rug while simultaneously singing about things like animal carcasses being dead in fields and fish being bellied up in the sea and kind of while sweeping climate change under the rug wishing for these things to happen demanding in a way for these things to happen then there's some heart-wrenching ballads on this thing too like I don't love you anymore which seems kind of like a departure from the political angle a lot of these songs take but given that almost every song surrounding this track is so socially conscious you have to assume that maybe there's a little subtext here going on but even if there isn't it's a beautiful tune very dreary very sad and then there's the kind of wonderful and inspirational but also very dismal why did you separate me from the earth which I think also kind of takes a bit of a an environmental angle putting into song I think the destruction of either the environment or just living organisms that didn't need to die there are a lot of songs on this record that I liked it's just that the album overall isn't really that consistent as some of the songs here I think are just structured in a really awkward way or don't have that much to them because it seems like the message kind of takes priority and sometimes that message isn't exactly stunning or well-developed and again I understand it's it's kind of hard to make a really coherent and sharp argument in song simply because you know again it's it's not like a article or a think piece or some kind of study or philosophical paper which is kind of a risk that you run when writing politically-charged music but having said that there are plenty of moments on this album I would say the majority not the vast majority but the majority nonetheless of the tracks on here where a quality message is married to a good tune some great production and a decent vocal performance I ended up liking this thing more than I expected I would and whatever an open e drops in the future I'm definitely going to be less hesitant to jump into it but I can't really say I thought the album was anything more than just kind of decent feeling eight DS and strong six on this record transition have you given these poppers a listen did you love them to jadam what would you rate amir the best year the best witch pup should i pit next this one 
MCAtnOD59Rw,hey everyone death vini kill Teno here the internet's least brutal music nerd and it's time for a review of the new gorgets EP please dust this is a brand new EP from Quebec death metal band gorgets and they have one of the most solid discographies in the genre so solid that they actually came back with their last full length album 2013's coloured sands it was ten years prior to that record to say a drop their last studio album and coloured sands the follow-up record the comeback record was great even when faced with the pressure of a comeback record gorgets does not fold they deliver once again and now they're back with this new EP it's 30 minutes long and it's pretty much just one long track one multifaceted piece so even though it is a little short and it's not another album making a record that is one long conceptual piece is an ambitious undertaking and this EPS one single track does justify its length because it is a very dynamic piece featuring lots of eerie and subtle interludes spacing out the very dissonant and discordant and ugly and heavy and savage and brutal passages of dizzying complex guitar riffs and relentless drumming there's even a deep ambient drone that kicks in around the 19 minute mark that kind of creates this calm before the storm of guitars that rush in right after that take on kind of like a sludge metal tone very heavy very Basie I like that the band is able to kind of jump between these dumi are slower heavier passages and also occasionally deliver these spots that are I don't know a little noisy and somewhat low fie and seem almost industrial the band continues on this EP to deliver this type of metal music that is it's very precise it's very dense it's very imperative all but it doesn't give in to this whole ultra slick production style and of course the result is that the mix and the recording is a little chaotic there's so much going on and occasionally just occasionally there is the rare performance imperfection but nothing that takes away from the overall experience of the record while yes it is hard to make complete heads or tails of what's going on here on your first or even second listen it's it's not really due to the recording of the mix or anything like that it's just the band writes and performs in a way where their music becomes this really intense tangled web the performances and the recording on this record they're organic they're fluid and they embody this really potent sense of Rage and some really thoughtful intricacies to when you actually can move beyond the aggression of these songs and kind of take in exactly what the guitars and drums are doing because the angular guitar riffs and the mathematically complicated drums on this thing do have an amazing chemistry this EP is epic it's cutthroat it's like lightning bolts being thrown down from the sky by Zeus himself it's crushing and visceral while also being a little soul sucking and kind of dismal a little depressing I think stylistically and musically this EP is very much akin to gore guts last record but they didn't just simply repackage a series of coloured sands afterthoughts here you know we got this very cohesive fluid long 30 minute piece which stands on its own not really a whole lot of complaints about the CP I'm really loving what I'm hearing feeling a like decent 8 on this thing transition have you getting this album illicit did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best or should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe please don't die Anthony Fantana Gore guts pleiades dust forever

SDvIm8A9_-I,ah hey everyone grinding time Hanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new skepta album konichiwa Skepta is a u-k rapper oh you can't review no more music from the UK uh why you're being from Gary and me ever since you did the James Blake review there was a braid out in your rare use again again he was just a boy Anthony's just a boy family skepta is also a producer and co-founder of boy better no records it's a sports full-length album people have been asking me just non-stop since it came out whether or not I've heard it yet as if it's like the greatest thing to come out of the grime scene in a long time and the buzz around this record is interesting considering just how many interesting hip-hop oriented records are coming out of the UK right now grind that Kano just dropped a really great album and then there's also that new baby father project from Dean Blunt where that record was very much a comment on the grind scene and I think it's only a matter of time before a British rapper starts making some like Drake or Kanye sized waves over here I think we're kind of long overdue for a British Invasion of some sort to sort of follow up the groundwork that artists like Dizzee Rascal and the streets have laid over here and it seems like artists from this side of the pond are definitely taking notice of the talent that's coming out of the UK right now especially in the case of skepta not only on this album do you see features from people like ASAP mobs ASAP nast you have Pharrell on this album but Skepta has also grabbed the attention of people like Kanye West and Drake of course this record also features grime heavy hitters like wily and skeptics so Skepta and this album are garnering quite a bit of attention and I think the opening track as well as the title of this album sort of acknowledges that in a way the idea of Skepta start of branching out and gaining this international acclaim and I can most certainly see Skepta hilarity growing off of the back of this record this thing has the aggressive delivery that a good grime record should have but also has a good focus on hooks choruses and production and the beats are actually pretty diverse across the length of this album there are actually a few where it seems like Skepta is reaching outside of the usual influences of grime and maybe incorporating some sounds that would appeal to a more American audience now this thing is twelve tracks it's 45 minutes it's pretty straight into the point it's not overstating its welcome or anything like that the longer songs on here many of them are actually padded out by these lengthy phone conversations that I guess kind of give you more context about Skepta set or just kind of where he is geographically in the kind of culture that he lives within in the grime scene but even though this album is short skepta does pack a lot into these pretty succinct and catchy songs we just have speedy flows and banger beats all over this thing but these are like banger beats from across the pond these aren't just like your southern trap flavored bangers or anything like that with you know just these rattling high hats and really straightforward kick drums and sub bass though there is a little influence of that from time to time on this thing these are bangers that are influenced by the world of electronic music coming from the UK you know there's a little bit of two step in here there's a little bit of dubstep in there there's a little bit of UK garage in there a little bit of drum and bass and almost each one of these heavy bustling beats is matched with an infectious refrain like the opening cut with the very melodic lead vocals on its hook Conejo or on the song lyrics lyrics for the vex come or on crime riddim we're essentially skepta writes a song about being searched by the police and being stripped down but he's not a Chippendale and I cannot forget the song it ain't safe it ain't safe block not even for the cops which has this kind of rickety set of high hats working to the track that feels a little southern but sort of like from the old school or something like I'm listening to us in three 6 mafia the song also comes complete with a very blatant little B reference in the lyrics I will also give it - the song ladies hit squad with ASAP nast also a pretty catchy hook but I do think this track is the worst song on the entire album not only because of ASAP nast s-- vocals on this thing sounds like he's kind of singing a leftover Drake melody but has kind of this rehired amo Genesis quality to his singing and not only that but the lyrics on the hook are pretty insipid and Skepta is trying to deliver these verses where the track is about sex about kind of seducing a woman and he doesn't really change up his delivery or his flow style on this cut at all so even though he's rapping about something very different from what he's rapping about on this on crime riddim he is still like sounding super aggressive and way too serious for the topic of the track quit talking numbers is also a fantastic song I will say the track owes much of its appeal to the instrumental and Pharrell's hook but I do like the Skepta actually comes through with a topical set of verses where he's pretty much very unenthusiastic about talking about or dealing with I guess these inner workings of the music industry and fraudulent people in the music industry he's much more focused on his artwork record I also like the tracks man and shut down both of them are incredibly gritty just hard as nails grime songs with resonant bass and bustling percussion and killer flows on the song man skeptic kind of paints himself as this lone wolf figure someone who just kind of sticks to his pack he doesn't socialize outside of his crew and these gangs that he says he runs with and he's kind of given people the side-eye who all of a sudden are coming up to him being like oh fam fam fam it's kind of like Skepta stake on the whole no new friends thing and there's even actually a point on the song where he brings it back to the days of MySpace beef aesthetically and instrumentally and in terms of the flows as well this album has a lot going for it I can't deny that and Skepta has a captivating delivery despite not being able to tone it down occasionally when it is necessary like on ladies hit squad and the closing track here where he's trying to I guess reason with this woman who is essentially saying sorry you know I'm not texting you back I'm just super busy and men's going out to try to make something of himself but even on the tracks that I like I can't help but feel like as I'm listening to them maybe there's some kind of inherent American hip-hop bias that's been ingrained in me because of where I'm from and just the kind of hip-hop that I grew up with because I feel like I'm listening to a completely different standard of like lyricism on this record or just many high-profile grime records than I am when I'm listening to a high-profile American rap record and not to say that Skepta is a terrible lyricist he certainly blows away you know your chief Keef's and your trinidad james' and I would much rather listen to the lyrics on this record than many of the bars from like Kanye's latest record or even Drake's latest record but there are some questionable lines on this record like that whole me but not literally detour on the opening track where yeah we we know we didn't need it qualified but then again we have a moment where Skepta says that he has been on the road for 10 years and that's a permanent mark that he's left that you can't smudge him from I loved that line I thought that was really great to metaphor but then there is the winning sheen line the Santa Clause never came to my house line the you think you're a killer but your name's not cam line there's also the return of the Mac I'm alive just like 2pac line or the whole Simon Cowell looking for a girl with that x-factor but I won't judge you line again I'll give it to Skepta that he can come through the topical track he could stay focused on that topic he can come through the hook and he has a great year for production as well the features are relatively solid on this project too but to me the most glaring issue is just kind of those 1 to 2 bars that work their way in almost every song that just make me wince a little bit aside from that I think this is a really solid record Skepta and many artists from the UK are continuing to make noise in hip-hop scene over there and it's a good noise especially on this album I'm feeling a decent strong 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you ready to hear the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe Oriol die anthony Fantana Skepta konichiwa forever 
WOCe4jXeDcY,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new James Break album the color in anything singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist and producer mr. James Blake back with his third commercial LP it's 77 minutes long comes three years after his sophomore effort overgrown and it's been a low-key couple of years for James Blake since the release of that album he had like that 200 press EP that modern soul teaser track which actually lands on this record he recently turned up on Beyonce's new album not only singing but with writing credits too which was awesome and now with no warning aside from a couple teaser tracks we have this new record just out of the blue new album BAM and I'm not really sure what to expect from it you know James Blake's last album I thought was decent while there were some good tunes on it it felt like he was kind of oversimplifying his sound going a little less abstract which I loved about his debut in order to come together with tunes that were just a little more coherent and accessible no doubt I would love to see James Blake get more adventurous but what side of James Blake are we going to be hearing on this new album because there are so many phases to this one single artist there's the art pop James Blake and the abstract dubstep and electronic music producer James Blake there's the piano somber ballad man James Blake there's the alternative R&B James Blake and the blue-eyed soul James Blake and he's never quite reconciled all these sides of his persona on one single release however with this album being as long as it is I kind of get the impression that James will be exploring a lot of sides of his musical persona on this album and possibly just letting his whims take him wherever he feels like going while you do get a taste of every little thing from James Blake on the 17 tracks on this record this album also kind of feels like I'm just simply peering into James musical sketchbook nothing feels super finished or developed or even polished sometimes which for die-hard fans could be really exciting hearing James and such a raw and intimate way but in my opinion of the kind of basic synth patches and the very dry percussion on a lot of these cuts don't exactly hold a candle to the really imaginative sound craft that got me into James's music in the first place on his debut and a lot of the songs at the core of these tracks aren't really well developed either though that's nothing all together new for James usually his songwriting style is pretty abstract doesn't exactly loop together into a series of very catchy and snappy verses and choruses even when he is trying to write something pretty sharp and to the point however with this release his tracks don't feel so much abstract or like they're trying to subvert you know this regular verse chorus verse formula as much as they just feel like bridges to nowhere sometimes or he's delivering tracks that just kind of redundantly cycle through the same musical ideas beat loops or like little vocal lines like on the song put that away and talk to me which is not only one of his most obnoxious productions yet but also just a really I don't know just a whiny song the track tries to put in an abstract way but this song to me smells like I'm listening to James essentially being frustrated that he's trying to connect intimately or communicate with somebody but they're not really there and I'm presuming that it's because their faces in like an electronic device or something and James doesn't exactly make a case for putting the phone away you know maybe this song is in fact influenced by something else and I'm totally wrong but still the demand that James tries to put on to this person he has in mind on this track just seems really I don't know bossy and it like like ease can I put it away there's the track I hope my life which easily has one of the worst synth leads to ever make it into a James Blake song so bad that not only it doesn't just have this really sour impression on my ears but I cannot get it out of my head I dislike it so much and then there are moments on this album where James certainly experiments with eyebrow-raising tracks like two men down which to me at the beginning of the track which is completely different from the second half the track starts off with these odd fractured pieces of instrumentation these moody guitars and kind of kooky percussion and James's vocals being just lost in a sea of reverb like he's singing from the bottom of a well or something and then suddenly the track transitions into these elevator friendly beats and keyboards and these high-pitched lead vocals it kind of sounds like James accidentally made sped up vaporwave and while it's definitely strange and experimental it doesn't really feel otherworldly er like I'm being transported to another place like I have been on James's previous albums instead I feel like I'm listening to a ballad with just some needless da fiddling on top or just laced into the instrumental there are few admirable fusions here of James's very soulful and passionate and kind of somber songwriting or piano ballad rhe matched with some admirable electronic tinkering like on radio silence or on love me in whatever way or on choose me which has kind of a gospel vibe to it and it's one of the few tracks here where the instrumental gets so much more dense and intense as it goes along and the various sounds that are added into the beat actually empower one another to create one of James's most complex and amazing productions yet I also like to track my willing heart which despite the fact that it sounds like a live take piano ballet with a bunch of electronic sounds added afterwards the track does come together well and it does make for I guess a kind of intimate feel to this song so there are most certainly highlights on this record moments where James pulls through with a good track however the song points has the pleasure of being the worst song James Blake has ever written recorded and released to the public for commercial sale the track starts off well enough as James kind of delivers this mantra of sad you're no longer here or sad you're no longer her the way that he says that last word it's kind of ambiguous and purposefully so it's like this person is no longer around but also maybe because they're no longer themselves but then James's vocals they start kind of cycling because they've been sampled and the beat of the song sort of starts to come to fruition and then comes some of the most unfeeling loops and sound effects that I've ever heard in one of his beats the grooves on this track had this kind of annoying cycle to them like I'm listening to a record skip then all of these really farty bass notes start popping in and then just one completely thankless and annoying like sound effect after another just popping uselessly into the beat only making the song more unlistenable with each new sound the song I need a forest fire is a duet with Bon Iver none other than mr. Justin Vernon and it actually goes off without a hitch it has kind of a sudden ending on here which again is one of the many moments where this album feels just kind of like rough ideas thrown together into an LP for the fans to kind of consume it's like a bunch of b-sides and spare ideas again that musical sketchbook and even though this track does feel a tad unfinished it does feel like a legitimately great piece of kind of futuristic synthetic soul and I think Justin's his vocals on this track they're really energetic especially at the beginning of the cover he's like oh and the song noise above our rocks is similarly soulful hip now Radek and alluring as well most definitely another highlight and modern soul also makes the ending of this project relatively strong and the closing track while I do think it is a good tune in James Blake once again comes through with a good vocal melody he's always good at pop it in with a quality vocal melody even if he does kind of cover it up with some lackluster or just needlessly cluttered production but on this track it's the exact opposite we don't get any beats we don't get any instrumental here it's just purely James's voice but he manipulates it with all these chorus effects so you're kind of hearing these lower harmonies these higher harmonies working together very closely with his voice from beginning to the end of the track and while again I do love the melodies of the track and I do think some of the harmonies that he works into the song are very creative I do think the kind of chorus effect gimmick of the song does get a little old after a while I'm really not sure what to say about this record it's a real mixed bag it is all over the place it is not cohesive at all they're certainly bright spots on here so my favorite James Blake tracks turn up on this record but I think some of his worst tracks turn up on this thing too and I sort of understand why James and company would promote this album as kind of like a surprise record because how do you promote a record like this not only is it so long but there's not really anything here in terms of a big single and you don't just want to come out and tell everybody hey guys it's just kind of like a random collection of b-sides and extra tracks and stuff like that because the material here in terms of the quality of the songwriting in terms of the quality of the production does not sound nearly as mulled over as overgrown or especially his debut I'm not saying James cheated everybody on this record or anything like that but he clearly just wanted people to interpret these songs that sort of face value and just kind of take them for what they were and not sort of put any kind of I guess expectations or assumptions in the mind of the listener when they went into trying this record because it's not like the production is so bad that this album is lo-fi or anything like that but this is definitely James Blake in the raw this is not a groomed James Blake album not only because some of the tracks do feel a little underdeveloped but the flow of all these tracks coming together they don't really complement each other all that much you know again James just kind of jumps all over the place and indulges and pretty much every sound inside of his musical style which I enjoy and appreciate from the standpoint of a music fan that's just kind of interested in James Blake as an artist because I'm curious as to what his songwriting and his creative process is it's sort of interesting in a way to hear him come through with these tracks that to me I think they kind of fall on their face but it sounds like James creating a track where he just has no inhibitions whatsoever but in that same breath this is not really an album I enjoy at least not all the way through and not an album I see myself coming back to anytime soon with the exception of just maybe a couple tracks here I'm feeling a light a decent five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe pour you'll die James Blake eat some cake no I'm sorry that was bad James Blake the color in anything forever 
f54M6_5201I,ah hey everybody Jill theny break tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new vector record terminal redux progressive intergalactic thrash metal band vector they are back with a new studio album their third studio album I believe though they did have that record out in 2006 though that album was very much kind of like demo quality many tracks on this record ended up getting re-recorded and put onto subsequent records so in a way this is their third full-length LP it is the follow-up five years later after 2011 s outer isolation terminal redux to my knowledge is pretty much all new material and it is over 70 minutes of material which might have had something to do with why it took so long to drop this because it is vectors mo2 pack they're very lengthy songs with dizzying guitar solos and dense details and multiple musical passages the black metal influence actually comes back pretty prominently on this record with some of the tremolo guitar Xand the blast beat drumming and there's also the sci-fi angle of vectors lyrics which goes super conceptual on this record and are delivered with the raspy Banshee howls of frontman David de Santo the band's music has always sat at a crossroad between being incredibly visceral and catchy but also extremely complex and very precise to vector has pursued this incredible technicality in their music while also not losing the punch and the excitement of their performances however I will say Terminal Redux is more complex than any record that vector has dropped thus far and it is a more difficult listen since all the songs actually weave together into a larger concept and not just a musical concept a lyrical one to the lyrics on these songs tell the tale of a sci-fi epic that rivals that of Star Wars and I haven't even completely made heads or tails of it sounds like the exploits of an intergalactic traveler with some pretty evil intentions he might have liked control over time or aging he is driven mad by the isolation of space I think and now he's looking for either revenge or trying to use his newfound power to force what he sees in his head as some kind of utopia or maybe he's just hungry for destruction and power again I have not fully digested the narrative of this record but for sure our protagonist here not not a good guy the stage is pretty much set in the first two tracks and then on the song liquid crystal disease some kind of plan unfolds where he's using technology screens which he kind of sees as parasitic to not only keep surveillance on people but also control them in some sort of way because what's good sci-fi without a little bit of commentary on the present-day and occasionally David DeSanto might actually sing from the standpoint of another person on the album it actually kind of makes the album like a thrash opera of some sort and the song ultimate artifice er it's almost as if some kind of infrastructure or plans are being built to destroy these regimes that our protagonist needs to just eliminate in order to execute his evil plan and then on the following track David actually details the genocide 'el attack it is literally a story album and I I won't spoil the rest of the story for you I will say though it is pretty riveting goes on for four more tracks so the entire tale isn't even near finished at this point and if we were looking at this album purely from a lyrical standpoint I would say this is their best and most interesting album however there's that musical that sonic element to the record which isn't bad it's kind of a mix of vector taking these brave risks doing what they've always done as well as they've always done it and also uh painting themselves into a corner a little bit the song mountains above the Sun is this short little guitar interlude which is kind of dreary very melodic but far from the best I've heard the band do in this style I was quickly reminded of the very superior guitar intro to the forest of legend track off of black future in 2009 whereas the fluttering guitar riff pull offs that are performed throughout the track Tara opticon seemed sort of like their borrowed straight from the title track of black future there are actually quite a few moments here where I just felt a little too much deja vu to that record and it doesn't help this since 2009 vectors production sound their guitar tones really everything about the way the band performs and sound hasn't really changed or progressed all that much and there are a few moments here where I think the story album format leaves a little bit to be desired in terms of the song structures on this album because sometimes it seems like certain moments might be drawn out or maybe there's not so much tension musically being built up to progress us to the next moment in the song because every single element of the music on this album is bending to the whim of the narrative which you're not really going to be following unless you're literally reading along with the lyrics it leaves much of the middle point of this album feeling kind of convoluted there even a few spare spots the middle of this record where the vocals aren't even really following what the music is doing rhythmically or they're delivering just a really muddy and kind of weak hook because David DeSanto needs to pack in so many words just to tell the narrative of this tale the first third and the last third of the record are the moments that to me are the most refreshing most interesting most well performed and written the song charging the void is an epic start to the record and tour the end of the track features these really amazing female background vocals something that I've never really heard on a thrash metal song before there's actually crescendo on this track the way that the Vogel's build on top of these really speedy pummeling visceral just quickly played guitar chords is really awesome it's one of the moments where just the the excitement and the aggressive thrash elements of the band come together with the melodic black metal elements of the band I also love the speedy galloping drums on this track the guitar riffs are moving a light speed I also think the theme melody of this track is really grand and like it sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi epic and the track is just an electrifying performance for nine minutes straight and the way Cygnus terminal glides right out of that song into a really dreary eerie melodic guitar interlude is nice it adds to the cohesion and flow of this album on a musical level not just a narrative level and there's a great build-up to the songs main riff on the verse to the rest of the track goes off without a hitch and on LCD this track to me is nothing all that new or refreshing four-vector but it's the band doing what they've done incredibly well on this cut - kind of reminds me of another track in the past where they've kind of added a bit of social commentary to their music like a fast-paced society later in the tracklisting hear the song pillars of sand is one of the few tracks here that balances complexity and catchy the guitar riffs on the chorus on this track are thunderous and the multi-layered harmonized guitar solos there at much of this song are rich they're illustrious and they just add a lot of color to the mix and collapse not only is this track an incredibly important point in the narrative of the story but it's a legitimate ballad in the tracklisting something that previously I didn't know vector was really capable of I mean sure different vocal styles have popped up on their records like of course outer isolation but here we have very cleanly sung vocals throughout much of this track and we have these very sparse and atmospheric and space abuse our passages that are kind of reminiscent of like some black album era Metallica and I'm not going to say that the clean vocals are totally perfect and go over without a hitch but they do have an eerie flat coldness to them that I think kind of represents the cold death grip of space now the closing track on here brings a lot of the same musical ideas of the intro back but does them bigger better and with more intensity it brings back those wonderful chorus vocals that started the album off so well and sort of fleshes them out into something even more grand this is not a bad album at all and vector is still unquestionably the most interesting band in thrash and the fact that they were actually able to follow through with an album as ambitious as this is proof of that because the cohesion of the narrative on this record is pretty stunning and David de Santos voice takes really well to this story for a few different reasons one he acts out the part so well of this character that he's kind of painted but also his voice just has so much character to it that it's almost as if he's you know really the character embodying the character in the music I mean his evil raspy high-pitched singing seems really fitting for someone who would do an evil deeds such as what is kind of described in this record the band's Icarus like trajectory toward the Sun as they are kind of chasing after this really technical conceptual album idea it has sapped some of the viscera and the excitement and the physicality out of their sound which made vector so interesting to listen to in the first place but I will say even my least favorite moments on this album I wouldn't really see them as worth skipping and the high points of this record are up so high that they're in the very space that vector sings about so passionately and they continue to show vector expanding the universe and the possibilities of thrash metal music in general in the future I would just like to see the band avoid treading water and indulging in just needless complications I would just like to continue to see more sonic exploration the additional vocals in the background were great the bass solo on here was fantastic the weird sound effects and tricks that they're able to pull off with like their whammy bars that sound almost like lasers coming out of UFOs were amazing too and those are my thoughts on this record it's a huge record it's a dense record there's a lot to it don't just assume whatever your thoughts are on it when you initially listen to it that those will continue to be your thoughts as you listen to the album more because again there's just so much to this album it's a difficult album to digest I've had this album since about when I saw the band live like well over a month or so ago and I'm still like working through it because again there's a lot to it between the story between the changing guitar passages and the over 70 minutes of material here there's a lot to this record and it's not just like another black future because each song on black future sort of stood really well on its own you could listen to each song and have a breather this album is like listening to one 70 minute long song so it is a toughy I'm digging it I'm hoping you're digging it too I'm feeling a strong 7 to a late 8 on this thing transition have you get in this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe that would be nice Anthony Fantana vector forever 
S35v1xtzdbk,spoiler the score Anthony gives in this video is greater than a zero mmm hi everyone Brittany Lauren Joe here ah the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for view of this new Radiohead album a moon shaped pool LP number nine from uk-based art rock outfit Radiohead five years later following up their last full-length album the King of Limbs which received mixed reviews personally wasn't too crazy about the album you could check out my review for it I'll link it at the back end in the end slate of this video going into this new album all I was really hoping for was something just a little more organic less robotic synthetic and calculated and I definitely got that especially in the tracks that teased up to this album like burn the witch which featured very fluid percussion sort of a linear song structure very beautiful acoustic string arrangements didn't sound synthetic or sort of out of a box or anything sounded like Jonny Greenwood probably arranged them for the song the string is also a pretty dissonant at one point I love Tom's soaring vocals on the hook and then we had the second single and video from this album the song daydreaming which was an even dreary er track with its very somber piano arpeggios Tom's voice sounding heart-wrenching swirling kind of psychedelic with very pretty arranged instrumentation popping up in the background some very unsettling reversed vocal effects at certain points in the song too the instrumentals on these songs had a sort of natural chemistry to them that the King of Limbs sort of lacked however though with these tracks and these are the singles from the record Radiohead sounded like they were moving in a direction which was very soft very subtle nuanced and maybe even depressing and that's in fact what happens on the rest of the album and an album like that naturally is not going to appeal to everybody they're going to be charges that it's too quiet it's boring it's underwhelming and I could certainly relate to that I didn't really care for the slowed down and very open and Spacey approach that Beck took to his last album and for a while now I have not been able to enjoy a national record but a moon shaped pool is not just super minimal melodies and bland ambience being passed off as legitimate mood music amongst these very vast and nocturnal sound scapes they're compelling songs and linear song structures much like what was on the King of Limbs but they go over much better here thanks to the more live and in the moment instrumentation Tom and Johnny and company do a great job of making sure that the instrumentals pick up more and more momentum as the song progresses and they keep things interesting with additional layers and chord changes and making sure the existing instrumentation in the mix is being played with a little more vigor take the song full stop for example maybe the most the King of Limbs ish track on the entire track listing here especially with it's cycling beat and bass line at the beginning of the song Tom's vocals quiver with a very odd crack in his voice as he's singing about having to take this really bad tasting medicine and then eventually the drums the bass the guitars kind of explode into this propulsive krautrock ish instrumental with these psychedelic swirls of melody popping up in the background and there's this really catchy kind of hypnotic mantra about the truth messing you up in the lyrics too it's kind of defeatist and many of the other tracks in the track listing here are equally dismal like with the song decks dark where lyrically Tom's coming in and telling the story about a UFO that comes in and sort of cripples humanity with this deafening sound a metaphor I'm sure when you're listening to Radiohead there's always some kind of subtext going on maybe something about impending doom on this track or an unordinary Radiohead attains a slice of bliss like on the song Desert Island Discs which is this droney very serene and kind of acoustic cut though the abrupt ending on here does kind of leave it feeling like a motif much of the rest of this record though is incredibly heartbreaking and very sad painfully sad like on daydreaming or with the fractured pianos and kind of wispy strings on the song glass eyes a track that sort of seems Tom describing feeling this paralyzing anxiety at the train station where he just kind of feels alienated and and distant from all of these people these people who he kind of envisions as having cold dead faces and just no emotional qualities to them he's kind of overwhelmed with this feeling and in the second verse he goes as far as to I guess kind of embraced this reclusive past surrounding himself with nature and just being away from people to rid himself of this pain I like the similarly scattered pianos on the intro of the song the numbers but the track actually develops into a very smooth easygoing piece of folk rock and the lyrics actually take kind of a a protest song tone you wouldn't really know it from just listening to the song instrumentally because again that folk rock element is so subtle but again Tom in lyrics here he is literally calling upon the people and saying that the system is a lie the song kind of has a mix of warning but also optimism that the future is within the the efforts of the people to get together and fight against the system that's oppressing them however a lot of what tom is saying on this track just seemed so general his point isn't very pointed I've read people talking about how this is a climate change song but really you could kind of interpret Leeds lyrics to mean many different things because again they are literally that general you know you do get that sense that it is a protest song but not a very focused one the final string crescendo on this track is beautiful though and the album's final sar intriguing - I love the eerie melodies and the Latin rhythms on the song present tense Tom sings on this song about distance being a weapon which it most certainly can be kind of using distance to hurt other people by depriving them of your presence or using distance as a self-defense weapon to keep other people from hurting you there's also these fantastic images of him dancing in the world crashing down around him but I'm mostly enamored with the instrumental on this track the very classy guitar arpeggios or beautiful background vocals the shuffling rhythms it's just a really well put together tune and I just love that it's so instantaneously catchy and captivating and yet like many other songs in the track listing here it's so subtle it's so soft Tinker Tailor is maybe the only track in the track listing where I would say the softer approach kind of leaves it feeling somewhat directionless but the album does end off strong with the beautiful but unsettling True Love Waits which if you just observe the title and listen to the gentle pianos you might think it's some kind of romantic statement when in fact when you dig deeper into the lyrics there's more painful sadness where Tom describes a relationship where essentially he is wasting time he's subjugated he is desperately trying to get this person to stay he's essentially compromising himself in every way possible just to avoid loneliness and there's no resolution there's no sort of silver lining to this cloud there's no ray of sunshine that comes down and kind of clears all this dreariness away Tom leaves us simply with that very like you know soul-crushing thought and that's it there's not really much more to say about this ending you know it's not like a big finish or anything like that it's just like hey man think about that this is a haunting it's a beautiful it's a powerfully sad record it's also very immersive and I would say the soft approach that the instrumentals take on this album is going to make this record a grower maybe not for Radiohead's most hardcore our fans who will really give anything they put out a shot but for people who might just be casual fans or kind of skeptical of this record it might take a few more lessons to kind of get into it but if you do find this album underwhelming completely understandable this is not the kind of record that you would put on for a party I wouldn't even necessarily recommend this album to first-time Radiohead listeners this is an album for midnight listens for introspective moments for those times in your life where you are having your soul crush because your greatest fears have come true this record is easy on the ears but very heavy on the heart I'm feeling a decent eight on this LP transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe or you'll die Anthony Fantana Radiohead forever 
4EvKa3-baDI,hey everybody Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a little review of this new little Aussie vert album slash mixtape Lulu's Ebert vs. the world this guy is a Philly rapper the hottest thing coming out of Pennsylvania right now he has a few projects under his belt at this point and a decent aesthetic these auto-tune glitzy atmospheric kind of wavy trap influenced rap ballads where he is spinning bars as much as he is singing kind of lean soaked occasionally the lyrics are kind of playful as lil Uzi vert makes these endearing references to kids cartoons or like the Scott Pilgrim franchise but mostly his lyrics deal in money women cars to me he comes off kind of like a blend of a lot of his contemporaries people like future or will yachty also young thug of course Fetty WAP and there's also production on this thing from people like Wonder Girl and Don Cannon as well as Metro boomin so you can kind of get a sense of what the instrumentals on this record are going to sound like now it's not the worst thing I've heard in this style there are certainly rappers who are a lot worse and a lot less tolerable who are producing music with this kind of trap ballad fusion my number one issue with this project though is just that it suffers from the saturation of the very sound the very style it exists within so much of what vert is doing on this project is incredibly cliche at this point I could see a few tracks here holding listeners over before the next big project from future or young thug comes out but I'm not really hearing anything that's going to carry vert over into the next year or so the production generally is pretty tight and I like a lot of the melodies and just a lot of the shiny synths coming out of this thing specifically on the song P's and Q's where we have what sounds like a accordian lead melodies coming through on the beat susie isn't exactly a riveting performer on this thing his rap style could use a lot of work and his singing voice doesn't exactly jump out at me as being all that recognizable or good or passionate at least futures voices kind of distinct I can recognize it pretty quickly at this point or I can at least recognize when somebody's trying to rip him off a guy like young thug has really eccentric quirks to his inflections in his voice while little yachty it seems like there's an element of tongue-in-cheek humor to how he sings vert though sounds kind of emotionally flat on a lot of these cuts it's really stylish in a way but there's nothing really all that compelling about it not to mention the fact that a lot of the vocal melodies that he sings are so mindless that you'd have to be high out of your mind not to get sick of them after 30 seconds I'm not really sure what else to say about this project because there's not that much to this project it could use better everything except for production I mean the songwriting could be better the rapping could be better the lyrics could be a lot better the singing could be a lot better this is just another rapper who essentially is being carried by the production of this project and you know I got to give it to producers like Metro boomin and Wonder Girl on this project because people like them make guys like vert listenable even though there are a lot of lackluster rappers right now at least there are some decent producers because seriously it is like they are carrying their careers with their production carrying them on their backs wearing them like backpacks I'm feeling too light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this tape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next and that's it guys Lulu's avert reverses the world forever 
IQjPWxS59rA,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time oh god it's time it's time for you of the new Death Grips album bottomless pit this is the latest full-length LP from experimental and industrial hip hop trio Death Grips featuring ride flatlander Zach hill though at this point in their career as a band they've been blending so many different genres and sounds together who knows what they're playing at this point the gang's all here the gang's back for a relatively straightforward release we had the teaser track hothead we did have though a really weird video featuring the late actress Karen black that originally teased the title of this project we also had the 2016 interview video that dropped that was not in fact an interview but a series of instrumentals that were released later into an EP and the band is also fresh off of a really great tour where they showed up to all the dates to my knowledge we also had some Instagram clips teasing the release of this thing of the really odd cover art on this album which I am still kind of yet to make heads or tails of the band released the lyrics to this album early which a friend of mine and I read online in a video which I will link down in the description you should watch it it was pretty fun and recently Death Grips actually put out a phone number on their Facebook account encouraging people to head to the phone number press one for trash and you could actually hear music from this album through the phone number which actually reminded me of They Might Be Giants old dial a song promo campaign like decades ago as you may already know I did love Death Grips last album which was a double LP the fans waited quite a long time for this double album to be completed one half of the record featuring some of the most disorienting and production in Death Grips repertoire yet while the other half of the double album featured elements of hardcore punk blaring guitars some of their most intense and catchy and visceral and to-the-point productions yet and given that deaf grips has kind of given fans a left hook with every new release they've pushed their sound tried something different I'm just really not sure what to expect from this new album every time I try to expect something they completely smash my expectations so now I'm just at the point where expectations with me for Death Grips albums have been just beaten out of me I expect nothing and this time I was surprised again because Death Grips have released an album that I think is kind of like a sequel to their 2012 album the Money Store like that album bottomless pit is incredibly direct it's tight it's very synthetic and it's very catchy it's kind of like their second pop record and and maybe this was a conscious effort and is something that is kind of reflected in the bit of cover art that shows the phrase very shallow listening because I don't think this record is going to require the re listens and the revisits that some of their previous material some of their post-money store material required to really kind of digest and make heads or tails of however I wouldn't call this simply a rehash of the Money Store sound of that catchy ER Death Grips sound for one there are roaring guitars occasionally on this album that were very much akin to the guitars that popped up on jenni death and also this album just seems like a culmination of all the production tricks that the band has learned and sort of employed into their sound since the release of the Money Store so now the production here is heavier these songs are just a series of cyberpunk bangers ready to turn dance one into a war zone rides vocals since the release of the Money Store have grown more animalistic the group's production more detailed I guess what I'm trying to say is that it only makes sense that if Death Grips were to go back to a sound that they would have to outdo themselves in some kind of way they would have to improve upon the formula and I guess in a way I think they do I mean this record doesn't come with the amazing you know initial impact that an album like the money store did because that album was just so groundbreaking in so many ways but the production and the recording on this record in my opinion is just phenomenal I mean the money store as punchy and as instantaneous as that album was there was certainly an element of rawness due to how low fie and rough the production was occasionally this album is just incredibly crisp and it's a crispness that I think Jenny death lacked too even though that was definitely the band's punchiest album to date because there were certainly moments especially on songs like centuries of damn where the guitars were so loud and they were so blaring they kind of blurred the mix a little bit and purposefully so I think because the the the end result was certainly an album that felt like a mosh pit that I was never gonna live to tell about bottomless pit though masters that same free-flowing rage but it also has deadly precision and just HD clarity Death Grips have essentially perfected the art of abrasive ear candy on this album and it's super admirable it's not so much them challenging themselves to do something new as much as they're challenging themselves to go back and do something a little bit better but simultaneously there are moments where the lyrics are kind of critiquing the existence of Death Grips or maybe this return like on the song at where ride essentially states in his lyrics that he could just totally Death Grips and get tired of this and just totally be done with it or on the song trash where obviously the song is very much a critique of the way people kind of use the Internet to just upload tons and tons of useless garbage but I think Death Grips kind of includes themselves in that critique too I will get more into the lyrics of this project as we go along but the sound of this album is incredible right from the start the song I keep giving bad people good ideas which features this really ear grabbing female lead vocal who I don't know who's singing maybe the liner notes of the album when they eventually do release the vinyl version of the record to the public will tell us but for right now I'm just not sure however I do love the refrain I keep giving that people good ideas I give giving bad people good it's totally punky and then just suddenly these roaring guitars these pummeling drums just bust right in general fight Rick thing sounds like something that could have come straight off of Jenni death rides vocals are twisted manipulated subtly to kind of sound really demonic and warped I also love the skittering symbols on the track too it's just an amazing barrage that just starts the album off in a Hellfire there's really just too much in this song going on to just bring up every single element in this review and that's true of nearly every track on this album like the enraging hothead I love the new mix on this track I think that bassline actually adds a lot to the song and the amazing overwhelming shots of just the the intensity that the band performs with in-between these very laid-back choruses is amazing it's like the enraging second half of the powers-that-be brought together with the disorienting rhythms of the first half of the powers-that-be with a bit of a grind core element in there the lyrics are extremely vulgar feature these gruesome drug use references but also I think the track is kind of a statement on the band's musical style and kind of their mystery that they're shrouded in spikes is the third track on the album and one of the catchiest songs Death Grips has ever written one of my favorite Death Grips songs period I love that this band is so many projects deep right now and with each album they're still coming out with at least a few of my favorite songs of theirs this thing in my opinion has a hook that rivals the fever which was my favorite song off of the Money Store and the track lyrically is essentially about kind of losing control over yourself and ride consistently makes reference to skidding skidding skidding and then sort of this hook pops in with just the repetition of spike spike spike spike spikes and I'm getting the impression that the spikes might be popping tires which he is skidding out on maybe that's what's being said here and the beat is just so oh I can't even begin to describe the roaring sense on this track just how buzzing and how abrasive they are and the way they just ground just like grind their way through the chorus on this drag it sounds fantastic and the bustling be - we have the song warping which is a much slower paced song features these Basie squelchy synthesizers occasionally death grips comes through with these just really noisy abrasive sense that to me sound like a little dubstep inspired but they're used in in a much weirder way the beat is really bombastic and rides vocals are kind of blurred a little bit with these psychedelic reverbs and echoes with each track the band is just kind of finding different sounds to express this consistent rage on the song at this track is one of the calmer songs and the track listing here kind of has this subdued vibe to it that's very reminiscent of a song like get got for example and this track I love the lyrics probably my favorite lyrics on the entire project ride his delivery on here he just sounds so over everything he's talking about he's so beyond caring he's so beyond giving a about anything that all these people are supposedly saying is really impressive or amazing or that these that want people to be impressed with them people that are impressed with themselves those people it seems ride is the least impressed with and there's a similarly measured delivery to the track trash as well as the song eight oh eight oh eight these tracks I think we're a great addition to the track listening in here because they definitely show that Death Grips has dynamics and I think that the instrumentation and the delivery of the the lyrics here is a little more subtle because they really wanted to bring the messages of these songs home like on trash where again they're talking about just the internet being uploaded with trash we upload trash more trash trash begets trash so on and so forth it's just kind of this dizzying cycle and then afterwards we have a toe a toe in a way where Death Grips is essentially talking about other people ripping off their sound to make their style much fresher it was nice that Death Grips worked in songs that they didn't blow out to the extreme like I know they could have because it makes the catchy or tracks the harder hitting tracks stand out so much more like bubbles buried in this jungle another one my favorite tracks on here this track to me has the catchy flow of an I've seen footage put together with the heavy lumbering beat of a why bitch got a lie and somehow it's slightly more overpowering kind of like Godzilla stomping out a major city I love the bass II kick drums and the growling synth leads a lyrical moment that sticks out to me on this track is when riot says if I ever let a bitch get used to me which definitely makes sense to me within the context of just kind of listening to the band's music because with each new Death Grips album there's some kind of mental adjustment that needs to be made to make sense of what the band is saying and doing conceptually the song Houdini another favorite of mine on here again incredibly catchy and an instrumental on here that sounds like a fusion between the factory floor and the dance floor and what ride is saying on this track it sounds like he's kind of poking fun at some clubber who's going to Church  is that a hairstyle also the rattling high hats on this track make this song sound almost trap influenced and I know you guys love that phrase the song BB poison another very heavy lumbering beat here and a set of lyrics that references in a very meta way the band's interactions with their audience specifically on their Twitter account where fans react in a very desperate way to the esoteric tweets and photos that they launched on their Twitter account because Death Grips fans a lot of the time and by the band themselves they're kind of kept in the dark in terms of what their music means or when their new music is being released or when they're gonna be playing a show or something so as a result I don't know there-there's a bit of a feeding frenzy kind of mentality that goes on when the band releases a bit of information or a weird piece of social media communique so it was interesting to kind of see the band address that in a piece of music however this track to me is is one of several moments on here also including the song ring a bell where even though I am into what's going on lyrically on this track I feel like what the band is doing instrumentally isn't quite as refreshing going back and revisiting these heavier lumbering very synthetic sounds it's okay but it's not like you know the the kick in the ass that I was hoping for in terms of just like you know really brutal aggressive production plus I feel like these sounds have kind of introduced themselves to me already prior on Death Grips other records so again going back and kind of referencing older sounds it's a double-edged sword you know if you're not sort of progressing and you're not improving in the way that Death Grips have on much of this record consistently then you're gonna have a few tracks that pale in comparison to others in the track listing but that's just kind of my view on this track I've heard many other people say they love this song for me it is a little bit of a lull but this lull does not last long because directly after again we have another one my favorite death grip songs ever three bedrooms in a good neighborhood which is this track that features not only one of their best instrumentals god it's so goddamn catchy but one of their best hooks and refrains too and the lyrics on this track really pop with all this like eye widening ly violent sexual images nylons on side bitches don't your table through my head my body through your bed we do have the very explosive closing track bottomless pit which is not as iconic as like a hacker or as an artificial death in the West East but it is incredibly aggressive and tops off the anger of the album very nicely and again the lyrics on this thing like I'll you in half and my  hatch in you lyrically this is one of Death Grips just look nastiest filthiest like most unsettling albums so far the lyrics on here even on the tracks that the instrumentals a couple of which there are that I just think are ok I'm really impressed with what's going on or at least I'm impressed with just how nasty or dismissive for example that ride is toward this woman that he has in mind on the song ringabel where he goes as far as to just call her a mosquito someone who's thirsty someone who's kind of suck off him in the band and tells her to try her luck in porn but to go back to this bottomless pit track again violent sexuality all over this song and in a way I think it kind of wraps up in a package the bands of BDSM like relationship that they have with their fans which they've referenced before in their music but maybe not you know in such a violent and angry way as they do on here in a very meta way the band references themselves and their relationship with their audience and it was kind of intriguing to see Death Grips do that in such an over way overall I really love this record I was super impressed with it I mean the production just nothing but tightly formed textured interesting and just really detailed bangers one banger after another just scratched all those itches of like hey it's catchy its aggressive it's really detailed it's odd and you know it's kind of taking me a little bit to figure out and kind of make heads or tails of what's happening here also the perform is on here our monstrous the lyrics on here are killer not a lyrical moment I wasn't impressed with prior you know there have been songs where lyrically you you know I'm a little underwhelmed or maybe maybe a lyric felt a little too edgy or something but here it felt like there were some very clear and pointed topics from one track to the next yeah lyrics production performances the flow of the album and the track listing all the songs here complimented each other really well there wasn't really a moment where I felt like the entire album lulled for too long not too many songs that I felt sounded the same as one another you know maybe a few tracks that were really really akin to material that Death Grips had put out in the past but you know nothing that sounded like oh the band's already kind of written this song three times on the record do they really need to go back and give us another one of these tracks welcome to another freaking fantastic Death Grips album the band has done it again you know it's like the is going on how do they keep putting out good freakin albums I'm feeling a decent strong nine on this one guys it's it's really great transition have you given this album a listen I know you have and you love it you probably enjoy it quite as put quite a bit probably as much as me because I mean it is a really good Death Grips album I haven't really seen a whole lot of complaints about it though I'm sure there are you know and those opinions are fine those opinions are valid too hope you guys are having a good one again thank you for watching what do you think I should review next besides Radiohead and James Blake and and all those very hyped albums that have dropped this past weekend that I had I'm going to review them joinder either Radiohead's coming Radiohead to come in forever

Evan Pugh Shaq he is a great culture critic and pop-culture writer for thoughtful videos on his YouTube channel which of course are linked below and in this video podcast we were going to be listening talking about you could tell I just spoke up or be talking about album promotion in the Internet age album rollouts in the internet age traditional album sort of promotion models the old school of album promotion just kind of from the standpoint of fans you know we're not PR people's so we're not talking about it in that respect but we're also talking about how all these new surprise albums are dropping how artists like Death Grips and Kanye West are completely breaking the album promotion mold so we talked about all of that in this episode and I hope you guys enjoy it now if you want to support this podcast you could do what you're doing now watch it on youtube comment share like this video you can also subscribe to our iTunes feed where you can find backlogged episodes of this podcast we have lots of great episodes that have come up in the past in this show lots of great guest so check those out you can get up-to-date episodes set straight to your email inbox for a small monthly fee through our support page which is linked down there in the description and you can use our Amazon Associates link if you live in the u.s. anything you buy off Amazon we get kicked back from it does not add to the overall price of whatever you're buying on Amazon use it to buy stuff you were going to buy anyway and that's it guys that's how you can support the podcast thank you very much for listening and let's just get to the episode hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd by now you know who it is and it's time for another episode of the needle drop podcast in this episode we are having a conversation with mr. Evan Pugh Shaq he is also known on YouTube as the nerd writer he is a culture critic and you know culture writer as I said and because it not does come in his name and on his YouTube channel you can catch thoughtful think pieces on art politics and pop culture things from the influence of dancehall on modern pop music to Trump's relation to democracy today and in this episode of the show we are going to be talking about the release process of new music and album rollouts from I guess the standpoint of fans because to my knowledge neither of us are in or have a history in PR and we're gonna be basically dissecting what that is in the internet age because album rollouts are certainly not what they used to be promotion the saturation of new music the dissemination of new music the Internet has revolutionized all of that and we'll be diving into that today talking about some modern releases some new releases and contemporary releases from the likes of Radiohead Beyonce James Blake Death Grips and more so evan thanks for coming on the show it's my pleasure to be here and you know I think I speak for the rest of your fans when I say why isn't the James Blake review uploaded yet because I have to do the Death Grips or first and that's not even uploaded yet so you're forgiven hey I got to do the Death Grips first people are pissed that I didn't review the leak and I and I waited for the the high quality version I think but hey you know there's no youtuber whose comments I enjoy reading more than yours yeah the comments section is a special place on my youtube needle drop comments the needle drop hence you know the I they can be kind of brutal sometimes a lot of them recently have centered around my hairline which is kind of confusing because it's been the same since like fucking 2009 I just have like very fine hair and when I shave my head you can lo and behold see the skin of my scalp so there's like you know kind of this like 9/11 truther style like conspiracy conversation going on about whether or not I'm balding on the internet I use your I use your hair at length as a way to determine I don't even look at the upload dates I just use it as a way to determine what period of time or the last time I grew my hair out it was cold and I just decided to do it during the warmer months now and I don't know why we'll see usually it doesn't take me too long to just get sick of having air and I get lazy and then I just want to shave it again and also simultaneously you know when I have hair on my head it's kind of weird because when I see pictures of myself and I see like you know logos and images of me and I just feel like man I'm just not being consistent with my brand right now and you know SAR the substantive things we will continue to talk about on the needle drop podcast stay tuned ok you are you're not an old man but you know you're of an age close to mine and you're old enough to remember a time in popular music when you weren't learning about everything that you were listening to via social media you weren't getting all of your media through the computer you were probably listening to new music that you enjoyed on things like the radio or maybe even hearing about new albums and artists that you cared for through channels like MTV absolutely so you know is is there anything that from time to time you kind of look back on in that era and that you kind of miss I you know the the one thing I sort of missed is like going to Best Buy or some store that carried just tons of CDs and just picking random stuff out and and going you know going back to my car which is where I to listen to most of my music and and discovering something that way I met I feel like the main change for me as the Internet has grown up is not so much in the way that I hear about music but in the way that I like I filter it through like the critical review universe like it's it's sort of what has happened me with films to it you know I'll never go see a film in the theatres unless I check Rotten Tomatoes because you know it's $15 for a movie I don't want to spend so much money on something that's not gonna be good so I look at that first and I end up doing that online with music too much turn out too and I sort of miss just listening to things without any knowledge of what it's actually gonna be like what's the the costs that you're trying to avoid wasting in instance of a new album though because you know a lot of the time that the music isn't necessarily costing you anything as much of the new releases today are available online to stream for free you know you're not paying that $15 entry fee like you would with a big blockbuster release I just think it's habit you know like I don't even really think that there is a cost reason there for music it's just you know there's so much music coming out and I've relatively recently got become obsessed with new music and ivory used to be really into sort of you know classic lots of classic music and I and I felt very stunted in my a my listening because my parents never really played that much music when I was growing up I never had that much of Education so even as I was like getting into high school and college I was still discovering all the things that you're sort of meant to have listened to and when I got into newer music and became obsessed with new releases and things were coming out you know it was like there was this huge wave of catch-up I had to do on the new music side too and so in order to parse what I should listen to in the same way where you'd be like what kind of book classic book should you read just to get a sort of overview of what what what's happened I went to review sites like pitchfork and other things and and and saw what they thought was great listened to it and and that gave me I guess a little bit of comfort knowing that I wasn't listening to crap but that's always something something had to plague me from the start so when it came time to kind of play this catch-up with new music and kind of get into the the current release process this was being done primarily through the internet for you absolutely yeah that's funny because when I first started using the the internet to find out about music I wasn't sort of using it at all to find out about new music I was using it to find out about old music or newer music that was just kind of like weird or obscure I used the Internet to get really into punk music and really old punk bands and I was I was just like collecting all of like these random Punk mp3s like they were Pokemon or something Kazaa and their soul seek and you know and and the more I don't know odd Punk or post-punk or noise rock or no wave bands that I could find out about from the 70s or the 80s like the better yeah but you know this thing is I was so far I just felt so like I I felt I had so much catch up to do in that field and you know it my out my sort of philosophy with books has always been you know there are so many classics out there that I felt almost required to like read all the classics before I even started getting into contemporary literature and that's that's this philosophy has carried over to music for me is that I just want to I want to be knowledgable in in all the things that one should listen to and I know that sort of you do by doing that you fall into this trap of of becoming dependent on the critical faculty and one of the things that your channel has helped me to do is just give me another kind of Lane for someone else's point of view and and by and by incorporating different people's sort of reviews of music I've been able to sort of triangulate my own taste and that's that's what's helped me get into sort of weirder and a wider realm of music this sort of acknowledgment or respect and awareness of the past that you can have through the internet because you can just access so much of it especially in the realm of popular music popular media it's it's really a double-edged sword I mean there's some people who seem so ignorant to the past and ignorant to the classics of art that they just so just plainly lack the fundamentals to put together a enjoyable or a coherent song and then on the flip side there are people who sort of use that easy access that we have to the Past as just an avenue to grab a really quick blueprint to just essentially be like well you know I'm just gonna kind of do a grunge thing and my records like just gonna sound like a grunge record and it's not gonna challenge anything or do anything different or bring a new sound or whatever it's I'm just gonna do some Kurt Cobain worship for like 10 tracks or so yeah I think I think really the the sort of main thing is that I struggle I think certain people definitely struggle with listening to music without context and I always am looking for the context in any in any kind of art that I'm consuming I'm trying to figure out what people think about it and you know the way that it was received at the time and the reviews that it got or the way that it's grown in the critical eye since it's been released and what you know I remember a couple years ago there was a Miley Cyrus album that can I forget what was but I I was like I'm gonna do an experiment and just try to was it was it bangers yeah it was bangers is the one before dead pets yep and I I said I was like I'm gonna sit down and listen to this and I'm gonna try to put everything I know about Miley Cyrus and the way that I feel about her life and the judgements I make on her personality out of my head and see if I can just like judge the music for what it is I thought it was genius and I thought it was the best album of the last 20 years that was the logical conclusion you had to come - exactly that's the only place this story could have possibly led to no but um the part where she was like rapping over at rap beat about being a southern belle you were just like this is just a story that's not being told in the American music mainstream exactly and it's a true American story but no I really think the real truth about that story is that I couldn't do it that I could not put the you know my knowledge of everything that came with it the context out of my mind I was just always there you know I think part of part of me really wanted to not like that Miley Cyrus album because of Miley Cyrus and that's not fair to Miley Cyrus or any artists that you're bringing to but I feel that even in this conversation about roll outs you know context is always going to be a huge part of how at least I consume art and music well the and and I feel like we're getting so off track of what we intended to talk about but I'm fine with that because you know we're having an interesting conversation context is something that some people bring up to me asking me or sort of accusing me of sometimes unfairly comparing the current work of an artist to the past work of an artist and I feel like that's just so impossible yeah you know I mean even if you blatantly try to erase any references you make to past work in a review or in your own head when sort of looking at a new album the reason that you're listening to the new Radiohead album which many of us will be is because of all the fantastic albums they put out in the past you know they're they're where they are now because of that material so to completely ignore it just seems kind of silly in my opinion I mean for sure each art each piece of art you know should be able to stand on I guess its own merits you know just because two pieces of our are different doesn't necessarily mean one is inferior to the other I sort of get the point that that that accusation is trying to make but to just simply ignore the past doesn't really make complete sense in my opinion and there's some artists that rely heavily on context in order for their art to kind of work within the time that it's being released you know take an artist like Drake for example you know so much of his music is about what's going on currently with him what's going on currently in the the sphere of hip-hop that's the case for a lot of modern rappers you know which is why some of them unfortunately their records aren't necessarily going to translate five ten years from now because much of what they were saying is just kind of in the past it's not what's happening right now you know it's not relevant information it's outdated news well I actually think that you know it's not too much of a digression from the topic that we were we're planning to talk about here which is roll you know album rollouts he sure has you know the Drake example is a perfect example you know when if you're reading this dropped and that was a surprise release one of the most successful surprise releases ever I guess in terms of the way that those you know those songs charted and sure made money for him you know I had such a feeling of I love that album and I loved you know being you know turning on Twitter and seeing it and going there and downloading it and that whole process to me was so enjoyable now you compare that to and the songs were good you compare that to views which just came out which had such a long build-up you know and that the actual release date wasn't announced till 2 close to the you know til to the release but all I could all I was you know I was there I was ready the hype was building you know he seemed have to be kind of you know getting better with every release and so it was supposed to be this like pothi OSIS of his style and the way that he you know he released or sort of built it up with you know signs in different cities around the world and the six symbol and the whole thing and you know dropping it could also also zero to 100 you know which was one of his most iconic singles yeah yeah which there was a lot of drama over that and hotline bling as well and hotline bling and and summer 16 which I didn't think was you know that horrible and also would end up on the album but we all thought it was gonna be on the album when he released it and sure I you know it dropped the album dropped and I'm sitting in my on my bed and it's late at night and I'm just so excited you know I'm ready to just what an image I'm Eric album drops I'm laying on my bed it's late at night the candles are lit and the flower petals and the six is cloudy and cold and I'm in Toronto no listening this now and the first song goes by and I'm like okay you know that was okay I think it's probably gonna get better as it goes along and then the second song and I'm like Jah man this is like sort of like it's so simple it's like not interesting sort of boring on but he's definitely gonna get better and I'm like really hoping and wanting this album to get so good and as it was dawning on Hanna and I was like making these you know making these these sort of bargains with myself as I was getting to the last like four tracks I was something okay these last four tracks okay it's gonna read that's funny by that point I had given up hope that I couldn't like let go of it and then when the album was over I actually listen to it again I wasn't do it twice that night and yeah and I was so disappointed with the whole thing and it's not like a horrible however anything but the context like what we're talking about the context is all built into that hype and the fact that it didn't live up to that pipe and what he had accomplished with previous releases it specifically the mixtape that was surprised released I think goes into the way that we all felt about that album or or feeling about that now that might disappear as time goes on but it's definitely part of the way that it rollouts play into our reception of an album I think you know another thing about the rollout of if you're reading this is too late and you know we sort of look at that album as like oh it's a surprise release and in a way it is but another thing that was sort of key to the conversation around that record is that simultaneously that was that whole conversation going on about how Birdman is ripping off little Wayne and he's keeping him from the Carter five coming out recently he was quoted as saying well actually I'm not the one that's keeping the the Carter five from coming out and there was this huge to do over whether or not this mixtape was kind of a jab or some kind of retaliation against that argument against that sort of beef that was going on and that Drake was putting this out really quickly it was like a mixtape and it was raw and he was going to drop it so that you can close out his contract with Cash Money but yet this new album is out on Cash Money I believe so that whole conversation is is just like what was completely missing from all the reviews and all the conversation reviews because there was there was definitely again a lot of theorizing that oh this is this supposed to be Drake's final album with Cash Money and and then he's gonna go independent and you know he's gonna go with little Wayne and they're gonna start their own label and buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh buh and now in retrospect it all just kind of seems or seemed like it was a part of this greater narrative that was being woven in order to just kind of generate conversation around the music and what was and what Drake was doing well that's one thing about Drake is that you were never really sure like what he's doing as a promotional tool you just have to sort of an error on the side that everything is promotional with him because you know he he's so savvy in it in his use of social media and it's not that he's it's not in what he posts that makes him savvy but it's what he doesn't post and it's the way that he lets stories kind of generate their own narrative and if it's working he doesn't correct and that's an example of that you know I just put something up on my um my Twitter account about about that very point because the this was something that was most certainly missing I think from like the past five years or so but I think artists have been getting smarter and smarter with it especially as bands like Death Grips have seen continued success with this but in the era of music that you and I grew up in there was a certain amount of mystery that separated you from the artists and the artwork that kept things interesting and intriguing and kept you on the edge of your seat and kept you waiting for the next release you know whereas nowadays or at least for the past five years or so it seems like in the age of social media it's all about trying to divulge every single shred of information that you can just to hold people's attention and now I think we're kind of going back to this value of mystery because it's it seems at least to me the artists who are actually lasting the longest holding the most attention getting fans to plug into the next record are the ones that at least spend a little time back in the shadows and don't spend all their time on social media and when they do it's only to add to the mystery and the cryptic message of I guess the narrative that they're spinning when they interact with their fans yeah and I think that that is you know that's something you can manufacture and it's something that you can manufacture a little too much - I mean yeah I I appreciate that that mystery and sort of not knowing admit that might be because you know of the way that we experienced albums in the past but even now I still appreciate not knowing too much in you know just thinking of like Beyonce's really release the amount of news coverage about how you know it was about the infidelity of jay-z I just felt like it was influencing the way that we were looking at that album and the its you know in an outsized way and when I listen to it obviously you hear that in there but I almost wish I had heard it without knowing that piece of information because it totally colored the way that I listened to it and were you pulling other things out of it yeah I was I mean I was pulling other things out of it but I was definitely pulling that one main factor out of it because of the information that I was given prior to listening to it and that is it and that was a surprise album you know yeah that was an album that did not have any kind of promotional materials besides well it dara formation it had formation and it had the tour and it had you know this I guess you could say that the Super Bowl was a little bit of the soft build up to it but as far as the rest of the tracks there you know you didn't know what you were getting and then this narrative started to start to develop and I sort of wish that it was completely you know that it was completely naked of any of that I guess I that's him you can't really prevent that but if you look at something like the James Blake album it just came out yesterday I'm not sure if you listen to it but you know that's something where I felt very much I felt very much like I was making my own decisions listening to it and it goes back to what we were saying I think that's thing about context and I think that's one of the advantages of the surprise release because you know if it's a true surprise release the critics aren't getting advanced copies of it either is that true would that be true you think yeah I think that would most certainly be true and there are some newer releases that the critics from what I understand are not getting advanced copies of and and a lot of them end up having to kind of scramble to get the review ASAP yeah also I definitely I definitely appreciate that and I've learned to sort of cherish this period of time between when a surprise release drops and the first reviews come out because this is like it could be any you know it could be the public could be reacting to in any way obviously can go on Twitter and see how people are saying or you go anywhere to see what people are saying directly about it but you know that's what I've learned to love about surprise releases and I think that really brings up the big question of this big question about rollouts is that is is it all a commercial choice is it all to do with the commercial prospects of the album or is there any artistic you know value to the way an album is released I think uh I think it's twofold I think there is artistic merit to how an album is released but it depends on how the artist is releasing it you know to go back to a band like Death Grips who and you know even the new Drake record you know because there were definitely some esoteric strange things about how that album was being promoted with the signs popping up around everywhere and that sort of thing you know and the way that Death Grips indulges in these really odd YouTube videos like one that featured the late Karen black an actress who was acting through like a script that the drummer for the band Zach Hill had written and they released that with like the title bottomless pit and it was just kind of like okay well you know our new album is titled bottomless pit here's this weird video of you know this late actress acting out this script that I had written out from a very you know awkwardly close angle and then they had dropped a video shortly after that titled interview 2016 and you know immediately fans just went apeshit because Death Grips does very little in the way of any interviews and then once he clicked on it it wasn't an interview at all it was just kind of a video of the guy interviewing the band yeah and and with nothing but just kind of like new instrumentals over it so like there's there's absolutely no audio of them talking at all in the video and then they ended up releasing that music as a short EP on on Apple music down the road so I definitely think there's artistic qualities to album releases yeah I mean if you decide to take that upon yourself for some bands like Radiohead which I was just talking about on Twitter in terms of album releases they kind of opted for the the basic package here for this new ever for this surprise album release surprise if you can call it that because you know we have had a song out we did know an album was coming out I believe their manager had said that there was an album dropping this year a few months ago but the thing is that just kind of makes sense for the band monetarily I think there's no sense in the Internet age for a band like Radiohead who has a fan base like they do that you know values their albums and values conversation about which albums of theirs are the best and and still have full faith in the band being able to drop one of their best records just dropping your music out of the blue and allowing the fans to kind of just share it with each other and share in it with each other and spread the word amongst themselves makes the most sense you know it makes way more sense than spending a small fortune on a PR campaign that is only going to shove the album down the throats of people who don't want to listen to the album anyway exactly and and and the thing is the music media the band has gained so much critical acclaim and has built up so much trust and so much I guess a social capital over the past decade or in the last decade they can essentially kind of kick back and sort of cash out on that now you know the they're seen as as a classic band in the eyes of many people anything that they do is going to be reported on you know and not ignored by any stretch of the imagination so let's compare the basic package to the most complicated possible rollout package you could ever imagine which would be sure the life of Pablo roll out sure yes is we're talking about like our Tia whether or not there's artistic value and in the way that it's release rarely do we get an artist who specifically says that the rollout and subsequent changing of the album is part of the artistic package and I sort of think that like he you know Kanye is a master at retro actively claiming intention on things that he was just sort of doing off the top of his head as it was happening sure that that roll out you know the way that it out on social media was you know insane it was insane and it was it was it was it was explicitly stated as a part of this like living album thing yeah I mean the album itself reflected the album itself reflected that once it actually came out you know while a lot of people did get down on it for sounding as messy as it did I thought the messiness I actually anticipated the messiness and the chaos of the album because that's just how the rollout seemed to be you know it's I got the impression that he was adjusting the album up to the very moments where it actually came out and it was adjusted further after that you know not only in the case of the song wolves but the mix that ended up on Apple music which Kanye said it would never be on Apple music it's never gonna be on iTunes but anyway the mix that ended up on Apple music was a totally different mix than the mix that was on the originally released version on title which was pirated by countless people yeah and then 30 hours has you know references to the Madison Square Garden Show sure in it so I mean there was clearly you know he played what he said would be the album at that show and you know me and I right that was just another entry into the Evan Pugh Shaq's listening you know romantic listening stories to albums I was listening to that with another youtuber who's a good friend of mine Tony Joe who does the channel every frame of painting we were listening you know to the stream of that just messaging back and forth so excited about all this you know so excited about all the different tracks and trying to sort of figure you know place all the different samples and then you know the album came out and there were already so many changes there is so much tweet activity between the Madison Square Garden Show and the release of the album and then like you say since the release officially went out there were additional changes now to me that is a fun thing to experience like I enjoyed experiencing that but I have to just say that you know I've long felt that the music should stand alone and be judged by itself and and when you just take Beyonce for example like I could care less about the movie I could care less about the video music videos that came out with Beyonce in a couple years ago to me what mattered I don't care about visual albums to me what matters is just the Sonics of it the the the specific songs and sure though as we move farther away from life of Pablo you know what I'm left with is just the just the individual songs and whether or not I still like them and they still hold up and I'm still listening to them you know three or four or five months down the road or a year down the road and I think that's kind of strange interesting thing that a rollout may have artistic value but it's an artistic value that that fades over time it eventually will not be remembered hmm and won't go into the way you judge the specific music yeah you know I think um I I fully agree with you that the music is ultimately what matters it's ultimately what matters to me you know and it totally sucks to hear a lackluster album that maybe had some great singles leading up to it and had a great rollout campaign and you were anticipating something great and you just ended up getting something met however there's so much music out there today that I personally would classify as being good there's so much good music out there that and and it's so rare that that artists understand this artists understand how rare it is that you actually produce something that is great and it's amazing and it's your masterpiece and it's the thing that people are gonna remember you from for four ten years on you know and and some artists have already produced that but yet they still have an entire career ahead of themselves so they've got to do something you know so having considered considered that we're we're of course gonna see crazy and creative and interesting rollout campaigns for albums come up because you know that there's got to be something to actually draw attention in to the album before it's released and just because an album that came out isn't the artists best work doesn't mean that it's not worth a listen or that it's not worth purchasing or that it's not entertaining you know I don't think while I do enjoy listening to great music I think needlessly pressuring yourself to as an artist always be putting out the best thing you've ever done and as a music listener always pressuring yourself to listen to the best thing that's ever been released is is just a needless pressure to put onto yourself you know and can potentially just suck the fun out of listening to music entirely so you know the the fact that there is just simply good music out there is fine and is completely normal so you know these album rollouts they're gonna happen because there are going to be records that don't necessarily stand the test of time and and and they need to get attention somehow so there are like I guess it'd be worth it to sort of go over the different all the different ways that you could draw an album because I'm thinking now I mean with with James Blake for you have the in saying type with like Kanye or Death Grips which it's just like completely balls to the wall crazy Maximus and yes it's maximalist and you know that there's absolutely no rhyme or reason to it whatsoever but yet it works you know if if if in 2009 I could go back in time and sort of talk with some of the PR people who I was you know making connections with as the needle drop was like a fledgling YouTube channel and just simply a blog and tell them that in the future one of the most popular bands in the underground was gonna be producing all their own music videos get kicked off of their own label for leaking their album release many of their albums for free and cancel tour day after tour day after tour date and no show after no show but fans are still crazy about them and love them and spend tens of money on their merch and so on and so forth they wouldn't believe it and and and yet it's happening you know before our very eyes so you know you do have these rollouts that are just completely insane and then you know I think you kind of have that basic that surprise album package but you know James Blake and Radiohead would both fall under I think yeah yeah and and I think you also still to this day have your very normal average album rollouts I mean my inbox is very much proof of that as I receive press releases every day for new albums being released you know it's just kind of a standard press release band photo band bio single has come out and maybe the singles doing well and grabbing attention and maybe it's not you know and if it's not that's it's it's kind of tough but then you also then you also have where it's release - because that's yeah yeah before you have where it's released and you have who it's released - because you have your you have your promos as well which unfortunately these days can come around to bite you like in the case of Bjork with her last record the promo of her album leaked and I believe her and her people made the decision to release the album to iTunes super early because the album had leaked to to the press and well the album was released the precedent leaked to the public so now I think a lot of artists are just kind of avoiding that problem entirely and even though these albums are surprise albums they're giving themselves a little more control over it by you know uh not doing any promos or anything and just releasing the album when they feel like releasing it so you know you do kind of still have that standard model fun functioning today which unfortunately I think a lot of these smaller groups and artists are sort of fed into the gears of because they just don't understand that this older model isn't necessarily going to function for them you know that they don't understand that this is an old tired model that hundreds and hundreds of other artists are currently working with and you know what's going to separate you from all those other artists who are doing the same kind of promotional campaign as you so yeah you have crazy you have surprised basic you have kind of the average normal package I'm not sure in other types of packages you have within that ul within that you have like the camp of people who do pay what you want you know release of Jeffrey or pay what you want or you have you know like Thom Yorke I think didn't he do a like a solo album on BitTorrent yeah he did that BitTorrent thing when did one on BitTorrent - I think or something like that and the group Rat King I believe did something on BitTorrent as well you know and and I think um this is also kind of the case for these other artists who are doing these records exclusively for these music streaming platforms they're almost like commissioned albums and singles you know sort of like future with his latest record - which seemed very much kind of like I don't know in a lot of ways just a bunch of dirty sprite - afterthoughts you also have a lot of these underground rappers that are doing kind of these exclusive mixtape releases with places like datpiff and so on and so forth and they're essentially being paid to do these mixtapes or maybe even paying I'm not totally sure how these rollouts happen but it seems like a big promotional campaign as soon as you hit the front page of one of these huge mixtape websites the first thing you see is one of these exclusive mixtapes or exclusive albums and you can download it just from that website and it's all just to kind of drive traffic to there I'm sure the artist is making something off of it it certainly allows them to tour behind this material and it gives them a lot of exposure but I'm not exactly sure what the monetary exchange is they're entirely yeah I think it's just I think this is basically a free-for-all I mean every because you know different things work for different people and they don't have to feed themselves into the same system everybody's trying to figure out like the exact right combination of release and monetization that works for them I mean I think I think we have the the chance to rapper mixtape coming out next Friday now he releases everything for free notoriously you have people like Radiohead who will say pay what you want you have you have people like this is a ridiculous cut but you michael cera releasing on Bandcamp without a pay what you want I don't know but I think you charge for that but you also kind of have like Miley Cyrus dropping that and say now yeah no we're - yes that pets record you have yeah that was that was what that was so sort of like cloyingly release directly after the VMAs that year oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah I did not I just did not like that again I cannot separate Miley Cyrus as a person Miley Cyrus her music but um and then you know you also have that traditional model working very well in the case of some bands on some record labels record labels like profound lure or season of mist or run for cover Records record labels that are very much on the very pulse or are kind of like in a way almost the heart pumping to keep a certain scene alive whether that scene be like the emo scene or the underground metal scene or in the case of there there are plenty of band camp based vaporwave labels like dream catalogue for example on which they release new albums every day digitally and on cassette and they do these short runs of these cassette vaporwave albums and they sell out of them in like 24 or 48 hours every time they come out with a new vaporwave album there's some guy out there with like the whole dream catalog cassette discography sitting in his bedroom it's so funny because my girlfriend last night we just said just asked me she was just asking me why our vinyls you know so cherished these days why don't they do that with cassettes anymore why aren't 8-track tapes being released and you know different different cassettes and CDs so I guess at least somewhere cassettes are being released but it brings up another good point which is you know this thing of the vinyl sales last year that were like more successful the way the most successful part of the music industry that ridiculous industry sure yeah they sold more than just digital sales yeah that's a role that's a role out question too I mean you know how in what forms you is it is it only gonna be digital from now on or do you have these like kind of like prestige merch items that people are gonna collect just because there's always gonna be hardcore fans there's always gonna be collectors out there and as long as they exist there's gonna be a market for that kind of thing you know it's just that now that music is primarily digital the the more casual listeners the more casual fans can just kind of enjoy music without the hassle that collectors and more passionate music fans would rather put themselves through you know I mean if digital music and streaming platforms are available in the 80s this is how people would be listening to music then you know we would have completely subverted the whole but we would have completely sidestepped the whole CD era you know and and now the CDs are like you know near dead but who knows maybe maybe they'll see like a resurgence at some point I feel like somebody will be the only form of media that never experiences a resurgence yeah because you're essentially just getting ones and zeros on it you can just get that in an mp3 yeah or am i jealous where am I just stuck in this time where it's impossible for me to see CDs as cool you know CDs I can only see them continuing in the sense that you know as long as CD players are still being installed in things there'll be CDs but also I can see them still surviving just based merely on that there's still a lot of great music on CD and you know people are gonna stumble across old albums on CD is that they want I mean you talked about Best Buy earlier I was in best buy this past Christmas because hey man you know I had to get I had to get my mom and my mother-in-law that new Adele album but but you know and they both enjoyed it and and and I had to get that on CD neither of them have functioning record players and also got podcast sponsored by Best Buy god I wish so you know but also while I was in there I saw like Metallica discography for like $25 so even post like yeah so just like hey you know I like a lot of these Metallica records but I don't own a physical copy of them or anything and I'm just like they're kind of cheap and I really would like to have an excuse to listen to them again every time I walk into Best Buy I walk out with the full box set of Dawson's Creek and every time well I mean how many times do you need to buy the same Dawson's Creek box set ever you mean you're buying a different season every time as many times as I have France talk about just give it you're giving it away that is my secular gift that's okay I see full see I see I thought it was more like friends would come over me like hey man you got that Dawson's Creek box set and you're like hell yeah I do and then they borrow it and they never give it back yes that is exactly exactly my life but I missed that and also I you know I remember going into Best Buy when I lived in LA while ago and I bought this is before I knew anything about like the Grateful Dead that was I was younger and I picked up working man's dead and I remember driving putting the album on and you know putting from the CDN and I pulled over in a parking lot because I could not believe what I was hearing and I just listened to the whole album just amazed cuz I had thought they were I thought the sound was gonna be different I didn't know what they were gonna be like and I was like wow this is this is amazing and that is something that I miss about that era for sure I don't think I'll ever pull over in a car for a digital release maybe not you know and also there's there's definitely going to be with digital releases less in the way of I guess this feeling of investment because you don't have to really go out of your way to you know hear or acquire a digital release you know but with music being as digital as it is it makes it easier to kind of incorporate it into your life and you could still certainly create meaningful moments around the music that you're listening to by incorporating it at certain times in your life I remember at one point I gave just out of I think in preparation for their latest album a solid listen to the Dirty Projectors album bida Orca and like immediately after listening to the record and I think I probably had a download of it at the time and then I just bought the CD later when I realized that I liked the album you know I had this whole shot of nostalgia from 2009 and it was like whoa you know I just like remembered all these 2009 things that was kind of you know which was kind of weird because I just remember listening to that album so much that year and and again you know even though there are some albums that I only have copies of digitally I still do enjoy them a lot and and and again I sort of you know create those moments in my life with the music by either listening to that music at certain times or maybe I was going through a certain something or a certain experience while I was really big into that album or just kind of sharing that music with with other people so you know while music is very much digital now you know I don't think it necessarily makes it any less meaningful you know of course not it's just it's just a matter of where I'm getting it like where I'm first hearing about it you know that that is almost exclusively now on my computer at home you know because I'm not picking up anything that I don't know and not somewhere else picking up something I'm you know I'm hearing about some kind of release on a website and I'm going that that was that was the big change for me of the music with revolution talking about rollouts is that when Spotify came out and started to become big it was like as soon as you heard about an album you can listen to it immediately you know if it was out you could get to it immediately and there were and there was no like going out to get it or you know I seen enough of a friend had it or something or trying to trying to get over somebody's house to listen to it it was the immediacy of hearing about it getting to read a review about it and then listening to it all at the same time that really revolutionized the way I think I listen to music it doesn't change the fact that I have a lot of meaningful experiences with new music it's just different and I feel like a lot of this roll out stuff is just a sort of modern rollouts are just a way of saying yeah this is how it works now you know there's nothing we can do it do about you know manufacturing the way you're going to hear this album so let's just let's just give it to you and let you make this you know the experiences for yourself and the decisions for yourself because we're not gonna be able to influence you one way or the other you know I still have no doubt that there are lots of rollouts today that are very very planned and measured and manufactured to go back to someone like Miley Cyrus you know I mean every detail of her persona and everything she does in the public eye from I'm sure this dead pets record to the whole wrecking ball video I mean all of that is planned to the T oh yeah but you know in the Internet age it seems like as far as album promotions and music creation - there's certainly more room and wiggle room for creativity and volatility I mean it seems like pretty much any artist from Beyonce to Kanye with the life of Pablo - Miley with dead pets - like Kid Cudi with speeding bullet to heaven can just drop an album out of nowhere can drop an amazing album can drop the worst album of their whole career while there are a lot of groups out there that are still giving a gun - while there's still a lot of groups out there that are still giving into the whole process of putting out a very formulaic a very measured a very focused group album where we have to put out a fucking song for we need to put out a hard song we need to put out a song for the ladies we need to put out a song for the club we need to put out a song for here and there and blahblahblah and it just ends up creating this completely personality list just formless unco he civ mess crap of a record a lot of artists are taking risks you know there aren't always great results with those risks but I see a lot of risks being taken and again even if I'm not loving the record it still makes for an interesting pop music popular music landscape to engage with I personally wouldn't want to be a music critic you know if I can use that dirty word during any other time other than maybe in the future you know I'm most curious about what music is going to be like after I'm dead personally it will be a full body experience hopefully by then Kanye will be releasing the life of Pablo part 5 v 27 he'll be doing a he'll be doing the LIFO it will just be a part of the life of album series where he just does a series of albums after the great you know artists and painters of the abstract of the Renaissance era you know will he'll get the life of Michelangelo and the life of Donatello and he'll just be you know hitting up all the great artists and 100 a hundred years from now he'll still be the most important artist for even four hundred more years after that but I will say just to maybe wrap this up but I think that one of the great things about the new landscape and you know I mean we talked about rollouts roll rollouts are definitely just symptomatic of the new musical landscape the way that a change changes with the way that the industry is but I think one and the way that the audience wants it yeah the way and the way it was really there I mean I think yeah I think what's really nice about it is that there's a lot of really huge mega ælis artists who are releasing albums with a lot of attention to album cycles and you know a complete package and I mean I know that there are singles or such as still a big part about everything but you know I do see a lot more risks being taken by ælis artists who are releasing albums without any you know particularly emphasized on singles and that that's exciting to me I mean I always will cherish just listening to an album from front to back and this is just giving me the opportunity release or whatever it is I'm like oh that's a nice package and I can't wait to just take that and go onto my bed and you know buy a plane ticket to Toronto and listen to it on the top of the CN Tower and really and really take in the icy icy cold R&B feel well also not as much unwavering attention paid to what time of year the album is being released - you know when I first started getting into this there was very much a certain flow and predictability to the album releases of the year you know I mean a lot of the biggest and best and most popular releases are being put out after tax season late spring during the summer when people are out of school and people are free and they're out and about and a lot of the more niche releases that labels don't think they're gonna sell as many of a lot of the smaller artists get released toward the beginning of the year right after Christmas when people aren't spending as much money or around the holidays or something like that and now it seems like anybody can drop a huge monstrous album at any time of the year really yeah and it's you know what it's it's really the the only sort of major art form that I guess not the only but it's it I just thinking of film and how that is still sowed you know the the industry is still so determinative of things like what you're talking about like when it's release in the year and you know how it's gonna perform and what it's released behind and the whole thing there's you know it's f initely been disadvantageous to certain you know to musicians in a way but this flattening of the landscape has just produced like so many weird sparks that that ya you you can't help but be excited about what's coming out alright my guest on this episode of the show has been mister Evan Pugh Shaq aka the nerd writer on YouTube we have a link to his Twitter and his YouTube channel down in the description check out his stuff and thanks for coming on and having this great conversation with me about the promotion of contemporary music in the age of social media it is my pleasure and I expect to see the James Blake review later on today only if you're writing it you write it for me sure sure sure I just have to finish my piece on how the US government spends money and then I'll get I'll get to work on the color and anything James okay well I have no doubt that you will speed through writing about that because you really want to get to writing about the James Blake review instead that's all I want to do alright thanks for coming on man 
kTqcOApCL8M,oh hey everyone hey Sami Roxanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Aesop Rock record the impossible kid songwriter producer and rap game wordsmith getting a text and he is back with a new record oh you don't you don't know who Aesop Rock is for the love of God listen to 2001's labor days his last full-length LP skeleton was pretty cool too that album was several years ago though so this is obviously following that up now and I'm not really sure what to expect from this record I liked skele thong I didn't love it but I liked it so from this new record over here I just kind of went into it looking for all of the things that make Aesop Rock one of the most creative lyricists and rappers alive today and I pretty much got that along with the things that occasionally turn me off about his music too that he just gets so esoteric in his symbolism in his lyrics that his songs essentially become puzzling like thousand quadrant Rubik's Cube booth and I assume that he sort of gets what's coming out of his mouth but then also I kind of get the sense that he's going so abstract with his lyrics that he's trying to completely subvert the audience's need to interpret and understand every piece of art that they consume he even goes as far as to acknowledge the impregnable lyrics of his tracks occasionally on the song shrunk which is attract about going to the shrink and the track is all about this back and forth this conversation this struggle that he's having with his shrink who he is refusing to let in but toward the end of the track he agrees to go back for another visit and in the song we get this lyric where she's essentially saying that when he goes so symbolic she can't get an honest diagnostic and he acknowledges that he's being guarded in this interaction with this shrink and maybe that's why he sort of opts for the type of lyricism that he does his songs that the the people who he's kind of bearing himself to in his music will sort of be more understanding and be more open-minded to what he's saying given that they put in so much effort to understand the very busy verbiage that he's put together to talk about what he's talking about still though I found this album pretty digestible in comparison with Aesop's previous material I don't know if it's just come from listening to many of his projects in the past or if he's actually just being more straightforward on this record but a lot of these song topics on here seem pretty plain as day though the lyrics were impressive and Aesop has even gone as far as to go on his Twitter to give a little hint or just a short explanation as to what each track on this album is about or is inspired by and not only are a lot of the song topics on this record pretty easy to comprehend but a lot of them are really personal too and I guess I can imagine that Aesop is pretty deep into his musical career at this point he has a lot to look back on whether that be his youth his experiences with other artists or even his family his brothers who he specifically mentions on a track we even get incredibly funny and odd concepts on here like with the song Kirby which is a song all about Aesop's brand new cat who in the track he talks about getting off of a cat lady for like 20 bucks he brings up vivid imagery of things like puke in the mane the meow Mix but that's just kind of a sup and his music it's a mix of hilariously eccentric and weird but also it just sounds so virtuous it sounds so dense and it sounds so well-executed that it's almost taking itself too seriously and his relentless and raspy flow and very rigid production that sounds like something that Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park would hop on top of doesn't necessarily help for example the song water tower which is a track about death a concept that Aesop has long been obsessed with and even claims he had a Liz that he didn't realize was dead for like a whole month but again that could be sort of the symbolism that he works in his tracks because in the grander scheme of the song it just serves as one of many examples of things just kind of coming and going through the cycle of life on this song which is one of the darker cuts he's made on this topic my biggest critique of Aesop Rock is just that he's an acquired taste the same things that turn people away from him are the things that draw the most hardcore fans of his in and I'm not really hearing anything on this album that his fans are going to be displeased with of course there's always going to be you know those one or two people that are like if blockhead didn't produce it it's not a good any sob rock album but it would be my opinion that that those people are wrong especially since again there is some decent production on here while I'm not the craziest about Aesop Rock as a producer I think he's done a better job of taking these rigid beats adding more interesting textures making some of the grooves a little smoother and making his production style as quirky and is idiosyncratic as his rap style and again I like a lot of the song concepts he goes into these tracks with I love the song rings which is a song where Aesop essentially goes back in his past getting a little sentimental over the fact that he used to love to illustrate used to love to draw but now as he's gotten older and has pursued other paths in life he's seen this once a very passionate talent of his kind of deteriorate on the song a lot of years we get some curmudgeon bars where he's kind of flabbergasted at the youth of today as he sort of talks about this girl who works at a juice bar who has these dreadlocks that she detaches as she wishes and a guy with like a lipstick neck tattoo who he tries to work his way out of an awkward conversation about his own tattoos with this guy at the Baskin Robbins serving him ice cream on tracks like dorks and lazy eye Aesop essentially embraces his outsider status and analyzes it in a really smart way either taking himself down for being pretentious for thinking himself as this great outsider but also just acknowledging and embracing and enjoying that that's the path that he's taken with lines like party over here I'll be over there because as vain and is narrow-minded as who I'm on the fringe I'm an outsider I'm different that mentality can be he also wears it like a badge of honor and doesn't fall prey to some of the trappings of that ideology of that outlook on life because he seems self-aware enough about it to critique it and make some funny bars about it the song blood sandwich as I alluded to earlier is a tale of two brothers two different stories one where his little brother is at like a baseball game you mean he's one of the players and there's this gopher that pops up and starts distracting the players and the parents and then the coach sees fit to just grab a bat and then just slaughter the thing in front of everybody it seemed like a really strange tale but hey you know he's known for his morbid vignettes and then another story where a brother of his wants to go to this ministry concert and his mom's like L know because she's just kind of afraid of all these satanic influences that are coming through in this really heavy experimental noisy music that he's into Aesop really does share some very personal stories on this record whether he's talking about the death of personal friends moving away from New York and even on the cuts that I find to be a little more abstract and difficult to read they're still quotables coming through again I'm not the craziest about his production though I do see improvements here songs like defender this is one of the smoothest funkiest beats I've heard Aesop ever put together sounds like something I could have heard MF DOOM on in the 2000s while there are moments like molecules that feature these rapid-fire synth arpeggios and it just seems so rigid and robotic and synthetic and the DJ cuts on this record just seems so cliche all this being said though I really like this record I think it's one of the better records Aesop Rock has come out with in a while it's one of his most personal efforts thus far and I like that he was able to kind of keep up the same level of lyrical talent that you hear in one of his albums but yeah it's also really instantaneous or at least it was for me there's really no reason not to try this album if you're into hip hop music if you're a hip hop fan if you're true-blue hip hop fan because this is a guy that is still making incredible music he's been making music for God the decades now I imagine and to hear somebody who is essentially a seasoned vet of the indie rap scene still come through with great material is inspiring that he's still working up to this level of creativity I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would your rating are the best you the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die wouldn't want that that would be bad Aesop Rock the impossible kid forever 
NGUVt3g2J7I,Tame Maxima hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album nonagon infinity king gizzard is an Australian psych rock outfit they are pretty prolific they've been putting out full-length record since 2012 and they've dropped eight full-length albums since then their last record and album I reviewed in 2015 was paper-mache dream balloon a bit of a concept record for the band not with huge overarching themes or anything like that but on this record they decided to just pick up simply acoustic instrumentation and write songs based simply on that and the result was a series very pretty enjoyable pleasant acoustic ballads with great melodies catchy hooks a lot of character very fun but now with this new record they are back at it again they have picked up the amplifiers they're turned up to 11 these tracks are not lightweight they're not kumbaya these tracks are intense they're high-octane they're in your face they're ballsy they're gutsy they're adrenaline fueled and one of the most interesting thing about the tracks on this record is that they actually flow into one another pretty seamlessly and the closing track has a really tight finish that actually glides right into the intro of the very first track on the album so you could theoretically listen to this record in a loop forever and the the experience of this element kind of felt that way too like once I was in there was no way out there was no 1 track that felt like oh this is the end thing this is the is the finish we're done here that moment just doesn't really present itself and I think that only kind of adds to the fact that the name of this record is nonagon infinity it's like I'm trapped inside of this geometric angle groove shape thing and it's just going on forever and ever and ever the performance is on this thing are actually blistering the pace and the momentum that the band keeps up from beginning to end here is really admirable the bass and drum grooves are super busy they're so tight they're just so yes and then on top of that the band lairs guitar after guitar after guitar just very wild and noisy solos are roaring chords maybe some catchy and sharp lead melodies that are occasionally harmonized with other guitars and taking from the detail and the subtlety that the band was working into their previous record their acoustic record they also make sure to work in some keyboards on here some harmonica some acoustic guitar so there is some instrumental balanced dynamics I do like the mix on this thing generally it is a little low file little rough around the edges seems hugely inspired by bands like the OCS but it's not so lo-fi that the mix is too muddy or it's too brittle there's a nice again balance between all the instrumentation here my one critique about the mix in the recording is that the vocals are a little buried and a little kind of tossed into the back however much of the time the lyrics are somewhat readable and the vocals do definitely serve a purpose in the mix here especially as the band uses them to guide us from one passage to another in these songs and on this album by just giving us these random shots of which are pretty wild and only add to the energy level of the album generally the rest of the instrumentation sounds great the harmonicas howl they sound wonderful the guitars are just so blaring and intense and in-your-face the bass is warm a little blurry and the drums are kind of crisp and the performances on these tracks are just so in the moment it's like being right up against the band at the most intense awesome amazing sweaty basement show performance that you've ever attended in your entire life and the band does a good job of again working in these awesome lead guitar melodies or these tracks that differ from one another enough so that even though this album is very visceral it's very fast it's very intense is very punky despite it being so big on the garage and the psych sound it's very punky as well it's it's not just this visceral blur you know there are most certainly highlights and moments where the band will break down the instrumentation to a lone guitar part or some drum fills and then maybe build up to another climax the track gamma knife is not only the catchy a song the track listing here but one of my favourite singles or teaser tracks of the year the song people vultures has some incredibly sinister lead melodies the song mr. beat has one of the most calm approaches of any song the track listing here and is actually kind of funky the organ on this track is really sweet - and kind of makes me feel like I'm listening to something that is also psychedelic but it's also got maybe a southern soul vibe to it - so not only are these songs well developed and have different passages and parts but the album itself the way all the tracks come together it seems like there's a lot of attention paid to that - yes and no because there is um I guess a sense of sameness across some parts of the record and I think that's intentional because the album is supposed to feel like a continual loop it's not like you're listening to something with a strong finish and a strong start very defined finish in a defined start I mean once the album sort of ends and kicks back over again to the very beginning that could glide into or out of the end of the album it's not like there's this need to end the record it's like I could actually go through it again so it's it's kind of like throwing yourself into I don't know one of those tilt awhirl rides that never really feels like it's over you know you're just continually spinning in a circle over and over and over and over and there's it's not like a roller coaster where it's kind of a journey a linear journey or something like that that sucks you in it locks you there and then it doesn't exactly give you a moment where compositionally it feels like oh this is this is done this is over not only was the band able to create that experience but they created it with a series of tracks that come together in two it feels like just one long ongoing track it's like a continual psycho acts infini there are other highlights in the tracklisting here I like to very tight and syncopated grooves on the song invisible face the instrumentation has this chugging along quality too on the song Road train where the vocals get really devilish and I think they're actually some satanic themes that come up in the lyrics too on the song wah-wah the band indulges in a little bit of heavy psyche again each track here has its own flavor but it all comes together so well and so seamlessly that it all feels like just different movements of a large conceptual piece of heavy punky intense psychedelic rock I'm really loving this record it's a pretty creative album and a great use of the fact that in the digital age you can throw a record like this into your iPhone or whatever you play music on you know just digital ones and zeros so on and so forth and literally just loop the album forever without interruption so creating a record that makes use of that function makes use of that ability for people to do that and execute that so well I think is great feeling a strong eight on this album transition hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album nonagon infinity king gizzard and the lizard wizard is an Aussie psych rock outfit they've been at it for years now they've been dropping full-length albums since like 2012 when they dropped eight records a full-length record since then their last album was 2015's paper-mache dream balloon an album where the band decided to go fully acoustic and the result was a series a very pleasant pretty detailed fun and catchy track 
lnjsDK73jgI,oh hey everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a track review where we just go into some new track that has dropped that needs some discussion new Radiohead track new Radiohead track Radiohead you probably already know they're in English art rock band they've been at it for a while now some other best records came out in the 2000s however I don't think they're past their prime I still think they're very capable of dropping some great full-length albums good the band you know really needs no introduction at this point their last full-length album the King of Limbs wasn't crazy about it thought it was decent many fans underwhelmed by the record a lot of mixed reviews for the record ok I understand there are people that love that album and think it's fantastic and I get it I get you I don't think it's a horrible album but sort of hoping that this new full-length album hopefully dropping in June hopefully dropping in June is great and I got to say I'm pretty impressed with the new single here far more than I was the teaser tracks leading up to the band's last full-length album burn the which is beautiful it's tense it's eerie Thom Yorke as you may already expect on the chorus here delivers these nazy ghostly howls and I love the backing instrumentation to the relentless rhythmic strings that just kind of prick at my eardrums like they're straight out of a horror movie soundtrack or something many fans have likened these strings to something that would come out of a Jonny Greenwood soundtrack they're just they're just so tight and they're just so on the rhythm of the track again they add that extreme tension to this otherwise very smooth and Atmospheric song and I love how in the second verse here the strings let up a little bit and give into sums very smooth and pretty Arrangements in counterpoint to Tom's lead vocals I also think the chord changes on the chorus here are great too boo boon how sort of deep and resonant the strings get at this point in the song and there are some electronics work into this track too it sounds like maybe a little synth bass or something definitely some sequenced symbols that are very tinny they pop really brightly in the mix and while I know Brady ahead is incorporated electronics very creatively in their music for a long time I appreciate it a little more when it's subtle in the way that it is here with the strings and the acoustic guitar the groove and the flow of this track is way more organic and loose but the performance is so tight and it's it's so great at building that intensity especially as the track glides from the verse to the chorus where the strings really swell under Tom's voice and the really dissonant noisy ending with the strings and what sounds like maybe some acoustic guitar being strummed very violently I love how it just creates this very unsettling finish it's not too hard it's not too aggressive it's not going to sort of beat you over the head or sort of violently grab your attention but while it is smooth it's also very subversive and I could foresee a Radiohead album working with those elements really well I mean they come together really well here hopefully that in fact happens with this new LP so really like in the track hoping you're liking the track - it's a good song I think it's a little bit of a grower but Radiohead fans are usually pretty patient with the band's material so I have no doubt that people who really care about the band will give this song enough listens for it to sort of warm up to them and yeah that's it Tran Radiohead album on the way I am excited I hope you excited for Radiohead Radiohead back 
-CYLxOZJDQw,uh.this channels like that that Groundhog Day movie you know every month I just kind of move through this cycle of reviews and some of them are positive some are negative you know whatever that's that's fine I can deal with that but no matter what happens after a full month cycle I always end up back here at the y-you know review we want to see you suffer Anthony we want to see you suffer the monthly segment where I talk about a series of Records that I didn't get a chance to review or I just didn't want to do a full review of and now I'm talking about them in a gauntlet in brief in this video because I am yes a masochist at heart so let's get it into X this is James Ford of simian Mobile Disco Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys and fuck this is James Ford of simian Mobile Disco Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys and Miles Kane of the rascals coming together again sophomore record here for the last Shadow Puppets and I don't know I guess I was just expecting this record to be guts here or take a few more risks or just be have a little more energy to it but what we have here is just a series of tracks that are very underwhelming very calm very measured overly arranged too much guest instrumentation on these Britpop and indie rock tracks it's just too middle-of-the-road to be that memorable I was hoping for a little more bite on this thing especially with a cut among the tracks on here titled is Dracula teeth these guys are back again post-hardcore noise rock outfit if you're looking for something in that sound in that genre give listen to this album you may already know that I love their last full-length LP this album is crowdfunded as well and it's decent it's just it's not really bringing too many new ideas in comparison with what the band was doing on their last album it seems very much in the named Vayne I think it's okay I guess I'm just kind of feeling nothing much to report on this album I'm not as into the production seems a little chaotic and not necessarily in the noise Rock sense kind of like the instrumentation wasn't like balanced all that well and there's like a lot of clashing going on in my opinion but outside of that you know it's it's a decent record it has the band's usual emphasis on angular crazy roaring noisy guitars also very eccentric lead vocals from and roof alkis who is definitely one of my favorite front men in post-hardcore period because again he is just such an oddball and has a lot of strange things to say and inserts a lot of interesting satire in his lyrics too again if you're looking for some post-hardcore some noise rock and you're just a die-hard for those sounds for the genres I don't think this thing is going to disappoint and again this was kind of a crowd funded effort there's not like a huge PR push behind it so this might have slipped through the cracks for you so definitely check it out if it has you may know Dave Harrington for the dark side project you may know him as a Nicholas Jar collaborator and on this new album over here he has come together with a large group pretty ambitious idea here to come together with so many musicians and make this experimental jazz rock ambient free improv album and the end result unfortunately is just so underwhelming like a lot of the tracks on here seem so spacey that they're near lifeless while the meteor cuts where the playing is a little more aggressive it's a little harder there's just nothing much to report like there's not that much in the way of strong interesting playing or interesting compositions or great interplay between a lot of these musicians they play together as if they have just met for the first time you know and so as a result there's not really that much chemistry on here if you're going to do a free improv record there's got to be some note of chemistry and and not even just simply free improv any kind of improvisation and I I guess that's just the issue with this album it's free improv its improvisational music with with no chemistry between musicians legendary experimental and industrial hip-hop project coming back many years without a record new album now and I was pretty interested in trying to sell Mount given that these guys are a bit of a precursor to this era today that we see in hip hop or there's so much experimental noisy alternative artists out there and now unfortunately the sound of this group is so dated and kind of stagnant and just doesn't really have an answer or I guess a suggestion for this type of sound I mean I guess you could say that they're saying they're staying true to themselves which if you're hardcore fan is cool but they're not really doing anything to kind of push their sound forward this was a pretty buzzed jazz album which I was excited to try out especially given that there are some great guest features on here most notably mr. Kumasi Washington however this album to me just read is so smooth it was so commercial didn't care for some of the guest singers was just kind of hoping for a harder more pure in a sense jazz record but instead I got something that was just a little too sugary and maybe pop friendly this was a post rock revision of a modern classical piece that just did not go over that well he's back with another collection of non sound track themes if you're John Carpenter fan if you enjoyed his last full-length album lost themes the original lost themes album I think you're going to like this the novelty has worn off a little bit so if you're kind of just a passing a fan if you're just a casual fan of the first record then you might not be that crazy about this one but I do think even though his compositional style is still pretty much the same the production is a little bit better I the instrumentation sounds fuller it's punchy air fans of eerie instrumental music try this out horror movie soundtrack obsessives try this out and fans of progressive synth music - for this one you better break out the eyeliner the leather straps and your your trench coat - because this is the fucking edgiest synth punk and like goth industrial rock that I've heard in a while this this one was nasty kind of one-dimensional but definitely nasty what happened on this one he had a perfectly good sound and now it's like I'm listening to a mix of dressing room house some actress and like someone at Rick's point never and none of those sounds even complement each other this guy is a California R&B singer and I was pretty excited for this record given that I liked songs like bourbon so much because the vocals just came off so passionate the song was so great however the album is almost an hour long and there's so many tracks on here that just don't add up to the character of an LP it's like the album is just so all over the place he doesn't know whether or not he wants to do kind of a modern alternative R&B sound or kind of a throwback to the 80s of there there's just not really a strong sense of identity to this record there are some good performances although occasionally the music does drown and its influence is a little bit but still good singing some decent performances a few deep cuts here and there that to me red is a little too commercial I think there's a lot of potential here it's just that there needs to be a sound there needs to be an identity and that needs to be pushed on the next record because this album was just a little too unsure of what direction to go in and another posthumous J Dilla release and don't get me wrong I do enjoy J Dilla's music and I do get that this is on his own kind of publishing a company page a so I'm sure that you know the money from this release is certainly going where it needs to go but it's also kind of put out in in conjunction with mass appeal still you know it's posthumous music it's just kind of a weird thing for me to review and support sometimes because you never know if the artist wanted their music to kind of be released or reimagined in the way that it is they can't exactly you know be there for the creative process you know since their music is essentially just kind of being thrown together and a series of rappers and performers are being put onto the music although it's great to your stoop dog on here I don't know if your J Dilla obsessive if your jazz rap obsessive then check this thing out you know you're going to regardless of whether I say this thing is great or it's not great or whatever I do think there are some lackluster moments on here but still it's not really the point you know I think there's some great moments as well it's just that sometimes posthumous releases especially releases that require the heavy doctoring that that ones like this one did they kind of just I don't know weird me out a little bit oh he is serious isn't he another Mogwai sound track record over here and fans assured me they assured me that this record it was so good it sounded just like a standalone album you didn't even need to listen to it like it was a sound track it held up completely on its own but I disagree it sounds like much of the more electronically driven material the band has been putting out as of late just a little less engaging and with compositions that aren't nearly as fleshed out or is interesting again on their own because it is a sound track so yeah if you're a Mogwai obsessive and a completist sure check it out but if you're just going to wait until their next studio record you're just kind of you know more casual fan you're not crazy about the soundtrack material they put out here you're not going to be missing anything huge on this one I I did not care for this record unfortunately I just found it to be so commercial and uninspired a lot like the last slaughterhouse commercial record it wasn't I guess is bland and his general Royce does a good job of putting a lot of very personal stuff on the line and really kind of expressing his own personal experiences now as a father and an aging rapper which was pretty nice but still you know there wasn't really anything I found that interesting about this record if you're a longtime fan and you just want to know what's going on with his life and his career because again there are personal moments on this record and you do kind of like his very fast flow and his aggressive braggadocious trash-talking detroy style then you're gonna like this record but I don't know that's not where I guess I'm at it's not really what I'm looking for and that ladies and gents is the latest why you know review um hope you're doing well Tran ah dition and that is the why you know review for this month thank you for watching you guys are the best what did you think of these records did you love the pain and why what do you think I should review next and subscribe click on one of the other videos over here you know I have a nice day do whatever guy forever 
4_U0dGWBHyY,Ami's and Chipman you've been waiting for it you'll be asking for it the dr. Drake PhD album review with any banannie the views from the guide and this she didn't say hey everyone use the denise shadow here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new drake record over here fuse this is the latest full-length album from rapping and singing sensation drake this is his highly anticipated new record once views from the 6 now just simply shortened to views and this is a follow-up to his last commercial project which was a retail mixtape titled if you're reading this it's too late a project that even I was impressed with up until that point not really considering myself a Drake fan you could even see that the project proceeding that mixtape nothing was the same what was not really a big fan of that definitely one of my least favorite Drake projects an album that is just too Spacey atmospheric and gutless for its own good a lot of the time although Drake did come through with some of his biggest and most memorable hits on this album started from the bottom worst behavior also hold on we're going home career-defining singles but going into this new album over here we only had like one great hit and that was hotline bling and that's almost a year old now and it's like a bonus track the other teaser tracks the leaked controla pop style one dance not really up to snuff for the light-skinned Keith Sweat especially considering how many surprise hits and and fan favorites that he's dropped over the past year or so between the if you're reading this is too late mixtape and the Meek Mill beef to me views is almost like that whole era of Drake's career is just erased and doesn't exist this is now just a direct sequel to missing it's not it's similarly emotional spacey cloudy we find Drake up in the clouds literally Photoshop very easily on top of Toronto's CN tower and he's taking this similarly Spacey and sad sound and really going the distance with it with a set of tracks that are well over an hour it's like an ear feature film length but I don't really think it justifies that length it's not like this project is conceptual or cinematic and I don't really hear anything that's gonna carry Drake over into the next year so we're gonna have to wait for a new project again to get into the tracks that led up to the release of this album pop style a very flaccid banger whose major highlight was actually a verse from Kanye West that does not make it on the cut of this album the entire track is handled by Drake now and there are of course some struggle bars on this track like I've got so many chains call me Channing Tatum as far as bangers ago it's week and again the song one dance it's one of several cuts on here where Drake tries to infuse this really gutless half-hearted dancehall vibe awful production on this track the B is a total mess various parts of the beat sounding like they're different sound quality's awful guest singing the song itself is mediocre Drake's vocals are just sniveling the track controla is slightly better but Drake sounds totally dorky on this track talking about Tings I don't know why our Canadian child actor turned rapper millionaire has decided to give us a little bit of fake patois but I want a dog it only further makes him sound out of place over this sort of instrumental and I don't care how big the check beanie man got was and speaking of money there's one track here that it really stuck out to me as hilariously classist the song child's play a song about a relationship where Drake is essentially fed up with what he sees as these really ghetto mannerisms of this girl that he's dating and he threatens to take her back to the hood if she doesn't I guess act accordingly she fights with him at the Cheesecake Factory which is definitely one of the top five most hilariously bad lines on this entire project she takes his Bugatti down to CVS to go get Kotex and Drake does the wussiest most passive-aggressive thing ever and instead of confronting her about it he hides the car keys it's like a story line out of a reality show where a old white CEO with more money than he knows what to do with has a fetish for black women and habitually picks them up at clubs and urban areas only to whisk them away to his expensive mansions and so on and so forth and then he tries to force them to act the way that he wants them to act and at the very end of the track Drake's vocals start fading out of nowhere maybe someone made an executive decision and decided yeah that's that's enough of that and in the song Drake assures us that he's treating this girl right because his mother raised him right but I'm not really sure if I can trust his side of the story considering just the level of douchebaggery in these lyrics in this song as well I believe he goes on to say that he lies to her about the number of women that have been in this bed that they're in together again just a really weird track and lyrics that just put a sour taste in my mouth then there are other cuts on here that are just lifeless rap songs with buh raring flows like the song 9 which features struggle bars like this or the cut faithful which has a badly placed pimp see feature that just seems like it's it shouldn't be there it just should not be there I don't see how he could possibly cosign struggle bars like this on this track and at the very end of this little snippet of vocals that are inserted into this track our EP Pepsi he says explicitly the only person in the game he with is bun B he literally says it in his verse so you're taking a man's rap verse a dead man's rap verse in which he explicitly says the only person he with is his partner in UGK you're putting it on some other rappers rap song and bun B on this track of course is nowhere to be found the feature if you could call it that just really makes no sense within the context of this song it's just there to add authenticity to Drake's rapping which was one of the big problems I had with nothing was the same this sense of insecurity in the rap game like Drake needs to prove himself despite his success to other rappers that he's a real rapper and part of the reason I liked if you're reading this is too late is that it seemed like there was this huge sense of confidence like Drake could not be shaken and now we're back to these passive-aggressive lines these whiney relationship bars these allusions to authenticity the best cuts on this record are the ones that could have snugly fit into if you're reading this is too late and had just sounded like it fit with the rest of the album tracks that are essentially laid back bangers with catchy flows that are kind of melodic but emotionally flat and calm sort of like the song pop style or still here or the song hype maybe my favorite track on the entire project there's also the cut with future Grammy which would have sounded nice on Drake and future's collaborative release that came out not too long ago and there's also cuts on here like views and Weston Road flows where Drake goes really biographical and deep into his past and his experiences before coming up in the rap game or sort of just being on the cusp of that which reminds me a lot of the song 6 p.m. in New York which was the closing track if you're reading this is too late and features lines that I actually liked on this record like they'd rather run up on me than run toward their goals and given that there are personal stories on this record of course some of those personal stories are going to be relationship driven because it's Drake you have the song you with me for example which features the beautiful bar you toying with it like Happy Meal God where the ghostwriters where where the ghostwriters on this one still I do like the vocal climax on the bridge of this track when Drake goes on about how other rappers sort of uh cut a check to steal this flow I like that part a lot Drake singing voice has come a long way since the days of thank me later but this track and others on here that sort of dive into Drake's relationships in the past there's nothing really that particularly juicy or interesting here again the the most I guess eyebrow-raising part is child's play and that part grabs my attention not even for a good reason the best of these relationship bars for me come at the closing verse of the song redemption where Drake is rapping about how they get things poppin in the master bedroom but ignore the skeletons in his closet and how she tries to tip the scales when he goes to weigh his options whoa and I like the very grand opening track - it sounds like something uh instrumentally that could have been on like a James Bond soundtrack or something it's just huge orchestral instrumentation and Drake's opening vocal line on this track is actually really pretty and ear grabbing and the song itself is about betrayal and Drake needing to keep his loved ones and his family closer because I guess over the past year so he feels kind of stabbed in the back maybe this could have had something to do with the whole Meek Mill beef but then even on this track - we get struggle bars he says that he saw potential in you like when Chrysler tried to make that one car that was just like the Bentley and that's literally what Drake says and it doesn't even like flow rhythmically with anything else that he's saying or singing it just kind of seems like this weird meandering simile that he tries to make the most struggled simile on this entire record it like Drake found a lot of these lines in Bob Pete's struggle Tain's orphanage for abandoned rap similes and seeing all these just starved ugly unloved similes just broke his heart so much that he decided to all give them a home on this record and I get it I get this some of the singing is nice and it's pleasant and it's catchy and I get this some of the beats are great too I like the dreamy mary j blige vocal layers and samples on the song Western Road flows feel no way I like the beat there too it's a little bit of a throwback kind of feels like a mix of 80s rap with some very glossy contemporary R&B keyboards - there are beat highlights here that I like though I do wish the production generally was a little punchy er a little more colorful a little more meat on the bones or just simply kind of going in that Moody and nocturnal direction that if you're reading this it's too late did all that being said there's no excuse for some of the lines on this record being as bad as they are number one because Drake right now in terms of relevance and his career is kind of at the top you would hope that he'd be putting out his best material at this point and number two he's had decent lines on his records before so why not repeat that here I mean bars heavy like triple XL is one of many very thin starving similes on this album that are just filler lines that just don't really add anything to this album they're not clever they're not interesting they're not funny they don't cause you to rewind they don't cause you to actually even remember what Drake is rapping about saying really anything it's it's forgettable and that's this album's biggest crime so much of what's here is forgettable there are highlights here for sure but they're not so great that they make me think of some of the best material that's come out across Drake's career and they're so few and far between among the 20 tracks on this album that they do very little to pull up the overall experience of this album the best track in my opinion is literally the clothes bonus track that again is almost a year old there's so much redundancy on here like we didn't need for three dancehall tracks there's so many just unmemorable bars and cuts and what is memorable is because it's just so in bad taste and then there are songs that are just total filler and didn't need to be here like the song without you which is just the same vocal line again and again and again for three minutes straight again with where the ghostwriters I mean we're the ghostwriters on this one if no bring them back and if ya hire twice as many ghost riders as you have going now I can't really say I like this record you know it's not the worst rap album I've heard all year but it's so underwhelming it's it's like nothing was the same but in a way worse because nothing was the same had better highlights and at least it kind of knew when to stop this album just goes on and on and on and on and as it continues it seems to deliver less and less and less and I'm just not really sure what to say about it other than that I mean here's some more struggle bars that I might have forgotten to mention I get green like Earth Day so terrible it's like Drake really wanted to put together some some crane worthy lines on this thing but I'm gonna stop here or else I'll just go on about this record forever I'm feeling a decent strong for on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you the best well should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe cuz this puppy wants you to Oh what a baby what a cute baby sorry does everybody wants to see you cuz you're such a cutie thanks forever

in May on sacred bones records we talked with her about this record the songwriting process her upcoming tour and the interview is conducted by contributor Jeremy Fassett alright so yeah I will just dive right in to our conversation today first off I wanted to ask just because I've been curious since I've been listening to the new record how does it feel to be sitting on a new record sort of like a month in advance of it being released like and you can't like it's not out in the world yet but you kind of you're still touring about it like how does that feel well it's you know it's exciting so far because the feedback has been really good and I just arrived in Portland Oregon to start fan practice and so I have some distraction now like you know focusing on other stuff which i think is a good thing because it can be hard to just kind of be in stasis waiting for something yeah that's because I was that's what I was curious about like like some people don't tour in the lead-up to the album so I'm always curious if they're just like sitting around waiting for it to come out and that must be such a strange feeling I feel like yeah alright so yeah and listening to the record strangers I think it's really great huh you're welcome I think it's so good I was a huge fan of July as well and so I've been sort of I don't know if I want to say inevitably but sort of without trying I've been drawing these parallels between them so I wanted to sort of ask if there is like a conscious decision to have this relate at all to July or do you not think it really it's at all to July I mean it definitely it can't help but relate sonically because it has the same producer and the same do same micro for the most part a lot of the same musicians as well so there's a stylistic tie the records are very different in some ways like July is very realist and Strangers is more surreal yeah I definitely saw that yeah even especially lyrically it's a very it's almost like July was very intimate and very personal and it felt I mean obviously I could be wrong but it felt like the personal pronouns were mostly your pronouns here that definitely doesn't feel like the case anymore at least not all the time yeah and there was something about like I was I've been describing it to myself as if July was sort of like the crisis moment itself then this album is sort of like after that like it's sort of the unsettled aftermath and so it feels very perplexing and almost like apocalyptic in a way it feels very desolate like all these characters and and there's a lot of things moving in and out of frame yeah definitely I think well the record kind of at first loosely I was drawn drawing a lot of comparisons to having a dream about the end of the world and a lot of the songs details is kind of calm after the storm so it's not really dealing with the actual action but more the aftermath yeah that's kind of how I felt too and I was gonna ask you about the characters in it because you there are a lot of named people throughout the story and I mean you've worked with that before for basically all of your albums there's always been some named characters that kind of weave in and out but this time they they at least by name they're new so I was kind of wondering about that too yeah you know to call so these people and the songs are for the most part real people um it's interesting because for instance Janie and love is a very personal song that kind of details me comparing like watching a friend fall a head-over-heels in love over and over again kind of comparing it to this kind of stasis and it it is about some unreal and them Katie I know also kind of about a friendship so but I kind of like that songs can be influenced by real life and real people but at the same time have like a more macro meaning yeah and I would I would I think I felt that way too as I listen because I would assume that most of them are at least at least somewhat based on real people but there's definitely this sort of otherworldly quality to it and I think it's totally true that you can have music that's very personal but it's sort of shot through this lens of the surreal and that's kind I don't know that's kind of how I felt about this record lyrically and sonically too though because I feel like it's also your most sonically intricate in a lot like at least since little Hills because I remember when little Hills came out there was a lot of new little details that were kind of cropping up along the edges of the songs and then July it was so subdued in a way and then strangers has a lot of these nice little touches did you arrange all those are or did the instrumentalists do I when I I'd the demo process for this record was really long I kind of felt a lot of pressure in some ways after July because it had to kind of resurrected my you know I mean it seemed like things picked up after that a little bit and so I felt and I had these great labels all of a sudden and I certainly had paid my like tort and put out a lot of records so I was really grateful to have a platform though so I felt a lot of pressure to write a record as good or better and that's sometimes it's you know that's that can be hard so one of my I said have a lot of guidelines for myself and one of them was to not write songs that reminded me of some zayed already written which spare enough and also I was writing for a band-like in mind like when I wrote Jenny in love I was I thought to myself this is gonna have instrumentation so a lot of the demos have most of the instrumentation lines like all the colors of the dark for instance had that string line as a synthesizer and so I brought a lot of the instrumental lines but then the instrumentalists kind of took what the ideas I put down and grew off of them and so when I first started writing songs I really never I was so concerned with the lyric and the melody and the guitar I didn't really think about the other layers for the first few records yeah and that's kind of another thing is gonna ask did these demos for the most part start as solo songs or can you play them all solo actually like I'm having band practice today in Portland and then I'm but then I'm going on towards Black Mountain solo so some of the songs are gonna sound really different alone like Janie and love I'm still trying to kind of figure out how to do it justice as a solo song yeah because the chorus especially has that giant squall of noise it's just which is so you know it's so it seems so fresh because a lot of your records have been very stripped down and subdued especially coming after July these songs here on strangers with these giant noisy passages um are kind of a nice surprise so I'd be interested to see how they would translate into a solo song yeah I mean I think definitely it sound really different I'm probably gonna have to go petal shopping get myself a rat pedal no just go for it and not be afraid to be loud when I'm alone too because I wanted to just finally I wrote songs thinking okay this is gonna have a rhythm section and I want to tour with a band and sometimes and I have that ability to have to have like some jammy moments yeah is your whole tour gonna be solo right now no so there's a lot of tours coming up but like there's blood I'm just going on tour on the west coast of Black Mountain and that's kind of a gonna get my feet wet again because I'm kind of hermetic and I haven't been playing since I got home from the July tour so it's kind of good way to get warmed up but then the all the rest of the touring is gonna be with band actually this band recognized two harmonies on Thrill Jockey is gonna be opening for me and then also adding to my backing band okay it's gonna be pretty cool like it'll be very ambient and they're they're good because they have a combination of ambient and heavy which is kind of what Randall Dunn can bring to the table as producer so have high hopes for like the translation live yeah I was gonna ask about working with Randall done because this is the second time you've worked with him and also the second album you've done on sacred bones what how did that transition come about from box of cedar your own label into sacred bones Louis you know self-releasing has a lot of pros and I definitely support people to do it and it was good for me at the time but I was spending a lot of time just like on the business side of things and music was becoming work and kind of took a break for a while but then sacred bones and Bella Union kind of came up at the same time I kind of decided that I wanted to try to get a label again and I have sacred bones had written caleb had written me years ago and I'm kind of a space cadet like I didn't mean I don't really I'm not too cute in on the indie music scene so I wasn't really aware at the time when he wrote me how cool that label was I'm just oblivious and then I was like oh shit so you know it all kind of fell into place around the same time and Randall had written me on Facebook and we had mutual friends from my early days of like I kind of started out came full circle with this kind of underground darker scene because my first booking agent booked earth and Boris and and me it seemed like at this time but out like a sore thumb in some ways but it made sense and others so I already knew Randall a little um and I wrote him back like let's do it I wanted to make sure that when I that it had a change he's great to work with it's we're friends and it's he's dark and like the same kind of music I do yeah it definitely sounds like it's a very symbiotic relationship and you can hear a marked change in the production from the self-titled and into July so I'm sure that that had something to do with that there's definitely a darker kind of thicker sound to these records yeah and you know I love like I loved working with Brian McTeer also in Philadelphia who did several other my early records but it just felt like time for trying something new and it wasn't anything like I really love Brian and his production - it's just kind of that was in a darker place emotionally and I wanted a music to kind of match the content and are you are you planning to continue the collaboration with Randall done yeah I'm actually gonna be recording in August after a bunch of touring an EP okay so and I we've talked about doing a Beach Boys cover of the song till I die which I really want to do yeah yeah that sounds great that actually sort of brings me to another question I had you do you've done a lot of covers you have a few cover record volumes I was just gonna ask kind of what draws you to making them at all and how you pick the ones that you end up covering yeah I mean I just loved singing songs that I like so and I taught myself how to record kind of by doing you know doing my demos and also the covers those volumes are kind of like I've let them up for a while I was selling them on Etsy and then I realized it probably wasn't supposed to be selling cover it and so now I kind of just put him up for free on soundcloud and i it's just fun because you can try different styles like my I think the Black Sabbath cover from this year it was my favorite one I've ever done oh yeah yeah I remember that one that came out yeah like it's my first time I've ever really done like lead electric guitar as opposed to rhythm and it was it really opened some doors for me in terms of like how much space I can get away with having and a song I don't need to be tethered to this constant ripp rhythm that it's just fun I mean I'd like to do a actual professionally recorded covers record at some time but then again I'm torn because I don't want to be known as like someone that does cover it when I'm I'd rather you know be known as a songwriter yeah I mean you've done them before I mean they've even been included on your LPS a couple times like especially a famous for the raincoat so I feel like there is sort of that stigma though of the songwriter who just plays covers and obviously that's not who you would be but if you put out a hole covers record I guess it's possible people might think that but I also feel like you could just kind of squeeze them in and you can play them live original material for me to be able to like please get away with one covers record that isn't recorded on my internal microphone with my macbook but I agree with that yeah all right so since we're talking about your projects that are not in your main discography I was I wanted to really ask about the mountain home record because I hope I love that record and I think it's so lovely and pretty and I feel like no one knows about it and I feel like that's so such a crime so I just wanted to ask how that record came to be well that's a long that's like 10 years ago mm-hmm you know so I was recording I recorded songs three with Greg weeks and Esper's and I was hanging out in Philly a lot and Joshua in Mountain Home and his girlfriend at the time Kristen had this band mountain home and they just they were recording at Greg weeks his dude basement studio and asked me to sing some sing I thought they meant like do a backup vocal here and then turned out they wanted me to sing the whole thing I was like okay sure it was fun I kind of we never performed it live they're not together anymore the band isn't together but I do think it's kind of a nice it is a really beautiful record I think Greg was a very talented producer yeah it's great do that anymore okay yeah cuz it's very pretty and spacious and it just feels like this nice little time capsule almost yeah it's certainly more tradi than I like you know what I mean by that like yeah definitely really influenced by traditional folk and the way that I am not really but um I really did like it and I it's nice memory brought back so what's it what's the difference between singing covers and then singing songs that other people have written and are asking you to sing for them well it's different with the with the collaborations or guest vocals that I've been doing you know now that I've kind of been chipping away for so many years people are giving me a lot of license kind of do what I want and that's nice because I really enjoy layering vocals and during harmony isn't writing these alyttle arrangements with cover songs sometimes I do feel like I am a little bit of I don't tend to change the songs too much because if a song is something that I will like enough to cover I usually just want to kind of pay homage to it and mm-hmm you know given my own interpretation but also not like change the melody too much so it's like less creative in some ways although it doesn't have to be I mean the solitude cover was a drastic reinterpretation so yeah I think some people it kind of fall into two camps like the one camp of if it's such a good song already then I'm not you know I'm not gonna change it too much but then I think other people almost take it too far in the other direction and then you know sometimes you lose the essence of the original song which is what inspired you to cover it in the first place yeah I mean there are certain songs I've never cover just cuz like if I loved a song a lot I like I would never cover wicked game because well fuck like it's perfect there's certain things I know I could just not do I kind of avoid covering Joni Mitchell songs because yeah she's like what can I do what can anyone do okay so aside from music you also have been doing visual art for a while and I have read that you generally see visual art as being kind of more private and music is kind of a little bit less private so I kind of just wanted to ask what if that's the case then what inspired you to do your own animated video for all the colors of the dark yeah I've been really interested in filmmaking and for a long time but I never really did it I was an illustration major so mostly my backgrounds in painting and drawing so I just started to teach myself claymation a couple years ago and found it very fun and I got the go-ahead to make my own video from the labels which was really excited about because I don't want the art to be so private it's just I'm really a perfectionist and I guess I have like hire a really high stake I want to do more of it I want to make it a lifelong pursuit and it's never you're never too old to start learning something new no of course not um do you are you making more videos for the album like personally yes I am well right now I'm working on finishing up the video for Janie and love but then I'm going to make - I wanna I kind of I'm very ambitious I want to make a video for every song then like make a DVD but yeah thing is that all the colors of the dark video took forever like all that little claymation set it's like 200 photographs for what one 15 second passage of a movement so you really have to be like crazy to get into that in the first place yeah I mean I come from a filmmaking background too so I definitely know a lot about the struggles of stop-motion and how it's it's it just takes so much patience and persistence I don't understand how people make you know to our movies every three years like I don't understand how they do it they have teams they do have teams that's true okay so I'm trying to understand how to pivot this conversation so you're based out of Boston right hmm so I was wondering if you could tell me and listeners what the art scene is like in Boston I would have no idea I'm real hermit I'm okay it's well I think Boston is a great place to live but I'm just not like a real network or type like I all the stuff that I do requires me to be alone to do it and so I mean I have a lot of friends that are artists and there's certainly a ton of great bands that have come out of Boston and a lot of great bands coming on a western mass but I really have to be honest that I keep to myself yeah I feel like I probably would too I just wanted to ask because you always hear about especially for music you hear about New York and LA but also like Chicago and Baltimore a lot these days and you don't hear about Boston too much and I there I just thought there has to be a a scene there there is like I think there's a big scene in western mass because you know dinosaur jr. came from there and like even nowadays like bands like speedy Ortiz came from there but then in Boston you have bands like quilt and um I mean I have friend Damon and Naomi lives there from Galilee 500 they're friends of mine and Glenn Jones the finger-picking Wizard is a really good friend of mine so like there are musicians but I'm just like I've never really kind of a loner in terms of like because I'm not in a band really so yeah that's true um yeah I was just curious about that because it isn't I mean you just named all these people that people do know of but for some reason Boston is always kind of left out of the conversation maybe that'll change you know enough bands keep coming out of Boston it's a real rock town knows like I've always felt like I'm not folky enough for like oh because I'm not like purist and traditional and I love reverb and like distortion and then I'm not like obviously not a rock band so I've it's hard to sometimes find that niche yeah I know you're sort of in between those two Wealth's with this record too because you have a lot more rock elements on this record yeah so when did you I wanted to ask when did you start playing music than if you were primarily visual art I was about 13 so 13 14 my older brother had a guitar and I just thought it was cool so it kind of I he showed me a few chords and I taught myself a lot of the rest and I was really into learning Bob Dylan's songs on the guitar but also like grunge rock was huge when I was growing up so I was learning whole and Nirvana mm-hmm and so if so then how did that kind of lead to a career in music when I was at art school I just got really much more serious about songwriting when I was about 18 um I just maybe was feeling stressed out about the pressure I was putting on myself to become this paint you know painter like at RISD is such a competitive environment and everybody's so talented that it can be kind of disel disillusioned just in chanting or whatever the word is yes I just started to kind of turn to my music more as a form of meditation and because I fine art was becoming a job or a homework open mic nights I mean I'm still I still have stage fright but I really like I always did I'm just kind of a little shy and what did some open mic nights at bars and then started playing little clubs and just really enjoy writing songs I still do which is great news ya know it's good that you haven't been disillusioned by that yet which is interesting because now music is your job which is sort of what it's like almost pushing you away from visual art but I wonder if you had gone to school for music if you would have ended up being a painter I probably would really fun about not being a trained musician because I approach the guitar like every time I pick it up I learn something new and that's I know that sounds really kind of cheesy like oh I I'm still just learning it and I don't think I'll ever stop which i think is fun I mean I kind of my next goal is to just really be shredding speaking of shredding just to interjected is that you shredding a lot on the new album hi playing guitar and but that distortion wall that is on hungry is the ghost hmm is not me if that is milky and that's his name he's a great he did second guitar he's a really good hand all over walls of distortion which I'm yeah so it's a combination what about the like acidic guitar leaked on the title track on strangers that's milky playing but I wrote the melody no I wrote it on a synth line and then it was like so the demo is which will probably release at some point this year are you can it's pretty interesting because you can hear all the licks but yeah like I'm kind of if I think that somebody like milky could bring a better tone than I could I'm not I don't really have anything to prove like yeah this point I'm just kind of like go for it because we had it's a nice collaborative effort in some ways when you're in the studio yeah I mean especially if you're working with a band it's I would assume that it would be nice to just kind of let them do their thing sometimes because I mean you invited them or asked them or you know corralled them all to play because you think they're very good so you know kind of just let them do their own thing I mean like the distortion wall in Hungary is the ghost I mean you didn't do it but that's that's okay like that's him you had had him on your album yeah exactly like I've had so many records just me yeah yeah like after the seven there's countless albums I just never are like songs I've never put out so it's just you get to a point where you want to do lots you want to collaborate and experiment you know real and fresh yeah and so speaking of those demos I did I read that for July you planned the melodies with the intent of harmonizing with them which is kind of why the harmonies were so important to that record did you do that this time around yeah I mean if you listen to the demo they sound a lot like the final record except it's there's no drums and there but the harmonies were we're also it's like but I think it started with July when I started considering harmony as part of the song not an afterthought so like two voices become one mm-hmm yeah and there's a there's I don't know if there's more or less harmony than on July but they're certainly around the same amount and again I think it has that same feeling because a lot of times harmonies feel like you know accessories and I don't think that's the case here good yeah I cut down on it because you know if you do too much it loses its power like yeah sometimes or something nothing more striking than a solitary voice crooning or and you don't want to drown that power out like I've the lonesome voice so I actually had to be consciously don't overdo it with the harmonies yeah and there are there are certain moments certain songs when there aren't any and it seems very purposeful that there aren't any kind of like on dissolve or holiday and from the last record because there aren't too many songs that have no harmonies but yeah it's they're both very stripped and sometimes I mean you know sometimes it's all you really need yeah actually my dissolve was more built up than the album version like I had the doo-wop in Motown back and I loved them the Randall was like you don't need it and we fought but I mean now I'm so glad I listened to him because it doesn't need it I mean it's it you don't need harmony isn't everything yeah well those beyond the demos if you release them yeah definitely I mean I want people to hear them cuz I there I have his love for loaf I also I kind of love both like early crunchy demo sounding things and really nicely recorded stuff so I think a lot of people would like that yeah I would be very insured to hear how a song like dissolve can would sound with more like meat to it because it is such a stripped song but there are a lot of moments on the record where you have just like a single sonic touch like specifically I was thinking of the opening track divers and the dust there's I think there's one moment of brushed cymbals mm-hmm and I was just I was just wondering out like what is your thought pattern behind those like why don't you why did why is there only one or how do you choose which spot to put those kind of little flourishes into well duh you know it's it's kind of like a give-and-take with listening their ideas that Randall has or divers of the dust I have wrote on guitar with it and actually sounded more like an early Elliot Smith track before when in the studio with down strum like really fast strum and I don't I'm really much better of a fingerstyle guitar player than a Strummer so I kind of wanted to try a different instrument so you know and it kind of just sounded so good without a lot of stuff so them we just purposely held back because we wanted it to be this barren wasteland desolate scene setting somewhere it would kind of suck you in yeah and I definitely think that it it gets that in that one brush symbol as is enough it just like it's just that one little one little you know like slipping your crack in the in the pavement so I'm probably gonna start going on thin ice to ask you to explain a song but there is one that I really really wanted to ask you about that seems to be perplexing me the most the song shadows show Diane I just was wondering if you could tell us a little about that song and how that came to me what your inspiration was for it yeah it's a weird one yeah well the record kind of bounces back and forth between real life and dream life and and surrealism and realism and that's definitely a moment of realism where it's actually like I live on a triple in a triple-decker and Jamaica Plain in Boston where you can see into other people's windows and like I certainly don't like make a hobby out of not of being a voyeur it's it's just I got this I don't know I think I was out on the porch and I accidentally like saw something I wasn't supposed to see and silhouette and I I joke jokingly said to my um I was like that is a shadow show the way that sounded but then I'm like I kind of made up this whole story in my head about the woman across the hall across the street that I could see her silhouette like and called her shadow show Diane and then the song is actually kind of just about like kind of quiet moments of me watching time pass and um as I kind of voyeuristically a observe other people's lives cuz they're civilians feeling I've always had as kind of like an outsider or it's not that I romanticize being that way but I just can't help help it and that song kinda feels like the quintessential outset you're looking at life from like a porch into somebody else's life so it's in other words it's actually a very literal song sure is yeah in a more literal than they let on yeah and shadows show Diane is the other person it's the person who you were watching yeah like Oh see I took it as the watcher maybe I should have put a comma in there or no shadow show Diane is like her title uh yeah that's okay that makes sense like if she had was in a beauty pageant that's beyond her sash that's so funny yeah cuz I listened to that you know the first time I was listening through and it really caught me off guard because it it you know it does sound like it is meant to be taken literally it but I just almost didn't want to I was like there has to be some other layer here then as I listen to it more I know there's something so alluring about it like and there's something so I don't know like dark about it it is a creepy sound actually Steven O'Malley from Sun oh he he's a friend of mine and he he wrote me about that song like cuz it's definitely not like a stand that's single or anything but it might be one of the weirder songs I've ever written he was like I like your where is Chuck palm buddies but that's funny ya know cuz it does maybe it's not a single but it definitely sticks out for that reason and it is also for other reason it is also one of the strum songs which kind of you know asserts itself a little bit at the beginning yeah and so speaking of narrators the other big question I had about the record was that the narrator's seem to shift a lot I don't know if that's true or if I'm just reading into it too much but there is a lot of you know difference there's there's a lot of references to things changing and then there's a lot of references to things and not changing and so I was kind curious about the dichotomy I know I noticed that too it kind of like I guess that's life I mean like some things never change mm-hmm but everything does that makes no sense how wishy-washy of me no like nothing feels the same for instance that song like on track side B it's very much like about Oh about not finding joy and the little things anymore a lot of the songs just have a micro and macro meaning like sure I kind of envisioned that song is somebody walking along after the world has ended and like they're looking for their house and there's like bird tracks and mmm and all this like kind of desolate stuff but also it's kind of a depression anthem I guess a lot of us like hungry is that ghosts certainly is like that kind of anthemic ode to emptiness yeah it's almost like this you know this big yeah almost like an ode like a big epic almost celebratory song but it's about something that's like very downcast which you know it's not a bad thing it's it's an interesting contrast what band is that is it this sure yes all right go on about other bands I have these like gigantic ODEs to really horrible things like you know yeah no I mean it's definitely something that I've been drawn to in the past I mean even like one of the first bands I ever got into was Rilo Kiley's and Jenny Lewis writes about like these utterly depressing things and then she'll sing them in this trippy way yeah have you kind of drawn to that my whole life I guess but yeah it's interesting that you say that nothing feels the same is sort of like after it's kind of like after the end of the world which I mean we all have this vision of the end of the world and it never seems to actually include the world no longer being there it's always still there you know like all these post-apocalypse books and movies and TV shows they all still have the world it's just different but I kind of liked the idea that especially the last two songs it actually does sort of seem to be going away because like dissolve I I sort of take that sort of literally to like it's kind of the last moment like you're just like leaving and that's it yeah that song I'm still trying to make um it has a ton of different meanings it kind of reminded me after I wrote it and you know that's double bear record tonight oh yeah like reminded me there was a good one reminding me a little bit of that same theme where it it's actually like switching back and forth with this these dreams and that's like kind of I mean originally waking was supposed to be the last song in the record in my head because it seems like waking up from The Wizard of Oz esque journey but then I decided to not hold so tight to the idea of a concept album because it's very limiting and I wanted each song to be its own identity and stand on its own yeah I definitely think that's the case I mean there there's a through line but it's not too rigid and you could in theory you could change the sequencing like in a live setting for example and it's not like the meeting is gone you know and I think sometimes the strict concept album that might happen you kind of feel like you have to play it in sequence every time yeah and I didn't want that I want to like make songs that people can enjoy on their own terms yeah and I yeah I think that's definitely come across so yeah I guess that's pretty much it I wanted to ask one less thing about the the Union Pool show I will be there I'm very excited I'm very excited for that OC you'll be solo for that I was going to ask have you I mean it's not necessarily that then I'm playing New York like again later that some later this summer with a full band so okay are you doing an are you doing an East Coast tour later this year yeah they're gonna announce the date soon but it's okay an epic tour of hopefully I'll be able to get through it without ya cuz I'd be interested then to see this album being toured solo and then to come back around in a few months and see it with the band that'd be that'd be pretty fun actually yeah and I've never been to Union pool so I don't even know if they're like are they too small to accommodate a band no no it's um they have fans all the time but I like the idea for that was just for me too because I've been off the road for a while and I have a history of stage fright um to kind of really ease myself back in so that I don't like you know what I mean yeah go freak out because this is the idea was kind of I actually enjoy playing when I can feel like I could my voice is filling the room I I kind of like small rooms mm-hmm cozy places less intimidating yeah I think um yeah the only time I actually have seen you perform once and it was when you opened for Y oak and Connecticut which was a few years ago theater yeah yeah it was at a theater and so the natural reverb of this space was so beautiful and I remember it was I think it was just you you might have had a cellist or something but that was yeah it it is really um kind of yeah yeah it really holds you captive when it's just like a single person singing out into a spacious room so I am sort of now that you know now that you told me that you are being solo at the album release show I'm sort of looking forward to that even more so yeah from anyone who doesn't know that's at Union pool in Brooklyn on May 18th and um Mary Latimer is opening that's correct yeah yeah I looked her stuff up to she's she's her music is very very beautiful she put she's a harpist yeah she it sure is beautiful she plays with it like ton of great people I mean she's played with Kurt Vile and like I know her just from like my Philly connections and um okay I wanted something really soothing for myself too because I you know the New York shows are a little bit of pressure just like people reviewing it not you know yeah I'm sure you'll be great so yeah so we will post this on the YouTube channel and we will link in the description box too so the listeners know we're going to link to all the info about your new album in your tour and you know have any more information that we need to put in there so yeah that's that's pretty much it thank you so much for talking with me today thank you guys thank you thank you thank you it's really fun 
SdfSu2LKucs,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new Shu Shu album Shu Shu plays the music of Twin Peaks experimental and post-punk music outfit Shu Shu new album well wild concept behind it totally crazy out of their minds do music from the Twin Peaks soundtrack from front to back that's what this album is that's what happens here the Twin Peaks television series if you didn't know is a shining moment for director mr. David Lynch it is one of the most legendary television series of all time it was not only groundbreaking but boundary blurring as well makes any other elements of soap opera and drama but also horror and thriller along with quirks that could have only come from the mind of David Lynch and the popularity of the television series has kind of researched in the Netflix era as people have been able to go back and watch binge watch the entire series it's even actually brought a newfound appreciation for the second season where popularity of the series kind of trailed off a little bit and I understand why there are some kind of painfully weird moments and narrative directions in that second season but it's still kind of enjoyable now shoo shoo they have some great records under their belts at this point and I do enjoy a lot of their cover songs I know they've covered Joy Division and Rihanna and one of my favorite records in their discography is a covers album the album Nina where they do nothing but Nina Simone covers I believe I have a copy of that sitting in my record collection just imagine it imagine it in your mind it's in my record collection that's sitting there you've probably seen it before if you've been watching the videos for a long time I predict that if you use the search bar the needle drop Shu Shu Nina review it'll pop right up I really enjoyed the reinterpretations of these Nina Simone songs on this record so obviously Shu Shu has already proven themselves to have the ability to reinterpret another piece of music very creatively and I do like the music of Twin Peaks so it would be interesting to kind hear that music celebrated and filtered through that very strange shoo-shoo lens which in a way could be a challenge trying to make a record like that and not have it sound like just a random sporadic array of tracks because there are so many different musical flavors just as there are elements of jazz music of ambient music of dream pop and how is shoo-shoo going to make all these sounds come together and the answer to that question is very well they make them come together very well shoo-shoo gives nearly every single track that they cover on this record a horrific ly eerie vibe there is a frightening rendition of the song falling which actually opened the show up if you remember and Shu shus version is complemented strangely but also beautifully with Jaime's very erratic foot a soft-shoe shoe with these tracks they really go the distance they're not like cheating anybody out of an experience on these songs they're performing five six seven minute versions of these tracks so they're they're really dedicated here because the entire album is over an hour of material and yet it just flows so well and every track is so engaging that it doesn't really feel like an hour it all breezes by pretty quickly in my opinion even the very trudging and heavy track dedicated to Laura Palmer her theme in the show is so tense creating tension in music that sense of dread shoo-shoo doesn't so well on this track and the iconic piano chord burn just go over so well and they're complemented with this kind of shocking like gunshot percussion the backing instrumentation blossoms really nicely as the composition moves from that dreary passage to the chords really kind of changing flavor into something more I guess grand and harmonious which is something that's always been kind of mysterious to me about this particular song in the Twin Peaks soundtrack how this sort of goes from cold to warm and heavenly and just a few chord changes is awesome and Shu Shu plays through those chord changes really well one of the dream pop tracks on the record which had some very easygoing instrumentation that had melodies that were subtly sinister the track into the night goes over really well too Shu Shu raps this track in almost just a hellish drone there's just a very dark atmosphere to this cut while the jazz piece Audrey's dance which is really slithering and suspicious kind of has this a nightmarish quality added to the already mysterious sound the song has much of the original Twin Peaks soundtrack is super mellow and even though Shu Shu stays true to a lot of the musical characteristics of these songs they make them so much more harsh and in-your-face and aggressive the song blue Frank I think Shu Shu takes maybe the most liberties with at one time it was this kind of Spacey lowdown dirty bluesy rock track and Jews interpretation of the sock over here is like psychedelic noise rock it's a total fury of wailing guitars the bass in the backing beat in the chord progression stay pretty true to the songs roots but just what they do on top of these foundational pieces is just pure mayhem the song sycamore trees which is pretty infamous for its heavy vibrato on the lead vocals from Jimmy Scott I believe is done pretty well - it sounds like a cut that could have made it off of Shu shus nina covers album it has very sparse simple pianos and Jamie on top of it with his voice just going completely oh I love what he does vocally you know he's a very eccentric singer so to me it would take someone like him to come on to a track like this and appreciate how eccentric the vocals are on the original and sort of put his own spin on it put his own personality into it and to close the whole thing out we have the very disturbing Josie's past which is so much about Josie the character in the show it's more a drone kind of an abstract song piece with what sounds like some vocal snippet voiced by somebody who is supposed to be Laura Palmer or maybe we're hearing something from Laura Palmer's diary I'm not totally sure maybe it's something to do with the show that I'm not fully aware of please enlighten me I'm not an expert over here but but essentially on this cut we have Laura Palmer sort of explaining or going into detail talking about the abuse and the sexual exploitation that she suffered at the hands of this very evil Bob character that we learn about in the show and what is said here added to these really tense and sour drones hanging in the background it's it's pretty sickening any very stomach-churning finish to this record the only thing left I have to say about this record is that I'm just thoroughly impressed with how great it came out of course shoo-shoo couldn't have done this without the great source material so we have to say thank you and give a shout out to Angelo Badalamenti for composing these fantastic songs but the liberties that shoo-shoo takes with these tracks not only do they make them these songs sort of digestible in kind of that full-length album sense but also the the liberties taken are thrilling they're exciting they're colorful they're intense they're lively they're animalistic they're horrifying they're freaky and and I think she does a great job of reimagining this music in a way that sort of matches the intensity and the oddity of the Twin Peaks series itself I'm feeling a strong II to a light 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you two best you two best what should I review next hit the like if you like watch another review that's good for you shoe place musica Twin Peaks forever 
A18b9Hls6gE,hey everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a very long day where I go through all the new records that have recently made it into my record

community the title of this thing love this title no lives matter this is from the bedlam tapes label if you're into vapor waiver if you're curious about vapor wave or sample-based music plunder phonics and you're looking for something a little hard kind of moody brooding then I would look this up it's Christ it's CR is with three crosses okay no lives matter is really cool little orange cassette with blue and orange labeling the J card over here features an image of a man walking through the class we have a Christ sticker over here so I want to give a shout out to bedlam tapes for sending this set over of this because I did like a few tracks off of this thing and a very generous fan sent me a record over here a spare copy of a record I believe he said he had another copy of this and he knew that this is one of my favorite live albums so he passed me a vinyl copy of the name of this band is Talking Heads I fucking love this live album ah this is a two LP live set of live performances from a few different points in the band's career like 82 81 and I think 78 to 79 77 to 79 and yeah it's just like a really great collection of tracks and live performances so energetic it's so electrifying you know stop making sense is great too you know but that to me is that this to me is like a good compilation you know it's it's just it's just so overloaded with great music you know even though stop making sense is live it very much feels to me like an album in and of itself in a way this this is just like a really great live compilation so the name of this band is talking heads really cool double LP set really happy about this the sleeve is a little beat up but the records themselves are men they're in great condition they played through great so no complaints about that so thank you to Adam for sending that along and sending this along to he sent me this I had no clue what this was I was like what the hell is this Who am I well who's this guy with the funny face over here and then I read the note and then I looked at the the binder on here are the the binding the the side this is an EP from Clarence clarity who if you know was like producer on my favorite pop records of last year know now and I didn't even know we had an EP that came out before no now and it has several tracks that appeared on know now those who can't cheat Golden Gate on my grid song exultation ziz on here - again I didn't even know this existed and yeah it's pretty straightforward for track EP black sleeve black vinyl pressing but cool to have a copy of a record that even know existed and very happy to sort of have mr. mr. Clarence clarity as a part of my record collection now because I did really like know now a lot although you know it does seem like a very digital record so I thought just having it digitally would make the most sense wasn't and I didn't run across a vinyl copy anywhere so um so I guess I probably would have picked one up if I had seen it but it's sort of cool to now have a copy of this so thank you to Adam for sending that along appreciate that all right here are some records that I did purchase recently that I was happy to add into my collection we have the Cure's three imaginary boys one of the records from earlier in the Bands career this is a pretty raw record does still feature that very moody very um angsty post-punk music that I like from the band so much and I am just you know another record closer from filling out my cure record collection over here geez keep just getting more and more cure albums the longer I exist got this quadruped quad opposed EP pornography I got a kiss me kiss me and now I have three imaginary boys and we're just we're just racking up the Cure Records guys we're just racking up these care records um highlights on this album for sure if you you know just want to give this thing a little bit of a taster I would say check out check out one of the last tracks on the first side oh no object object is a great song object was really catchy and on the B side there is a cover of Jimi Hendrix's foxy lady that you have to hear to believe essentially it's very herky-jerky and a little chaotic very passionate so yeah and Jimi Hendrix foxy lady cover on here I did not see coming and yeah like the album art done here a lot the primary color swegles are really cool and this is a this is an infamous album cover over here I love the Photoshop of this cover that people do where they just like put the Sun logo over here because people say Sun sounds like a vacuum cleaner or a refrigerator slow down so very funny very cool iconic cover awesome the cure album collection is growing this next thing is a jazz record it's from mr. Thelonious Monk criss cross from my understanding not one of his biggest records almost you know legendary records but still a really good record for the jazz heads out there we have a charlie ruse on ruse raus on tenor sax Frankie Dunlop on drums and John Orr on the bass and this was pretty sweet it had a nice swing to it I would say it's a very pleasant jazz music but what kind of makes this record stick out is that so many of the melodies the theme melodies the solos especially coming from the sax are very odd and very angular like everything about these songs the rhythm and the way the instrumentation is gelling together just seems so easy going and danceable as well but again I think this album kind of lives up to that crisscross name because those melodies are sort of odd and they do contour in very weird ways not so weird that it sours the mood of the music but it definitely makes this pretty unique record in my opinion I haven't heard a whole lot of felonious monk where I think the melodies have kind of bent in the way that I think they do on this album and something sort of weird I noticed about this is that there's like it seems like there's a corrective label over here that says slow Gnaeus monks name they might have spelled his name wrong on the wreck had to put a bunch of labels on the album to correct it because underneath it I can kind of see what used to be there and it looks like they were a character short or something from spelling his name very quick but if you want to look up some tracks on here we have hackensack t42 criss cross Erin L was a really good cut off of the first side rhythm anning don't blame me think of one crepes crepes Kuehl with I'm not even going to try to pronounce that alright I suck so anyway a felonious monk criss cross really classy really sweet jazz record with sort of odd melodic quality to it that was really cool alright moving on we have a cool cool cool compilation over here New York noise this is one of my favorite eras in modern music and there are a lot of compilations out there diving into this stuff and I'm not even saying that this one is like the best out there but it did seem to hit a lot of the major names that I liked so much we have Mars on here the legendary no wave band we have conch we have the contortions we have bush tetras we have I believe there's a Glenn Branca song on here I know I know he was a sort of featured in the the album art over here we have Lizzy and me haha I don't speak French I suck alright yeah I know he's glad Branca is featured over here sort of in the in the cover art I know I listen to one whole of one of these records we have Alan Vega I Michigan and it's like such a mix on here there's pure noise rock on here there are fusions of disco and punk they're weird noisy rock cuts with great grooves this is a kind of post-punk that I like the song in plug breakfast sounds kind of like a Talking Heads song off of like fear of music but they're singing about like eating bagels and like drinking orange do okay like they're literally singing about having breakfast it's it's an odd odd collection of tracks Mars again on there there's like three or four cuts off of each side let me see what's on the what's on the other record over here we have the contortions we have the dance we have theoretical girls we have Mars dives or L chain-gang Busch tetras our toe Netto probably something I'm missing here there's somebody screaming in the comments like Anthony you're an idiot and I hate you and I wish you were dead I wish you were dead Anthony yeah it's probably somebody saying that in comments so uh so yeah so anyway yes this is definitely a highlight for me in modern music you know kind of this era of punk music where it's kind of melding with pop music but also getting more experimental than it was before with noise and just like totally weird shit and I was really impressed with one of two of these records so I know the firt I know the other one's going to be great and again you know I knew what kind of names to look out for here and I loved sort of the album art here it's so colorful I love the contrast is really pleasing to the eye alright moving forward I have a couple more records left we have Oh Kenny Kenny Lama Kenny cornrow Kenny with uh oh my god didn't even notice that I didn't even notice uh I'm just noticing something here for the first time there is Braille on this record and I don't know what it is I don't know what it's saying in Braille over here it's confusing but anyway awesome awesome we have the credits over here to all the songs got all the tracks listed on the back and it's a nice heavy pressing over here nice heavy black record a lot of brief to this record and I played through the first of the two records on the sound of great sound a really slick clean vibrant sounded great on vinyl happy to have this and I also pre-ordered untitled unmastered so that's going to be coming eventually too so looking forward to playing this some Moe Kendrick Lamar to pimp a butterfly whoo all right moving on a couple more left we have when I saw the side to get it we have fucking Sex Pistols anarchy in the UK 12-inch single nice with I want to be me on the b-side and this says here it's a French pressing another import album from gem records and it says it's banned in the UK oh it's naughty it's kind of a simple record in a bag over here it's like it's a trash bag or something I'm tired of you I'm tired of these men it's not trash so don't put it in a trash bag hey so uh so yep over here there is does seem to be that there is a little French on the inside label over here so I guess it does uh I guess it does come from France so you know people in France have to listen to anarchy in the UK because the French France is curious what's going on in the UK oh Anarchy's going on there okay cool we got to press it over here so we can know so yeah pretty straightforward 12-inch single just wanted to add some classic pump to the collection and it was for a decent price this is a compilation that I believe was sent to me by red distribution set a shout out to them for getting this record in my hands pretty cool many of you death metal fans may be aware of the band entombed alright you're aware of the band entombed this is a compilation album put together by the people over a Southern records of nihilist this is the band that preceded the band entombed like this is what entombed was born out of and this Swedish death metal band it's it's kind of death metal I mean there are elements of death metal on here but the earliest stuff here is like fusions of thrash and hardcore punk and it's like a little a little heavier and the vocals are you definitely have like a growl your element too on some of the tracks and basically this pulls together a series of tracks from all of their early demos so it's like you know all these tape covers over here from their early demos we have the premature autopsy demo the only shreds remain demo the drowned demo the head not found session and we have the but life goes on 7-inch that was put out under the entombed name and on the inside we have lots of liner notes lots of stories pictures of the band's early years and we have this sort of record sleeve over here ooh that's a bad ass fucking logo picture of the band over here inside this little pocket over here I thought this was a booklet but it's a pocket is the entombed to a seven inch so the entombed tracks are on that 7-inch and on the bigger sleeve we just have the main record itself with all the nihilists tracks from all of these early releases sort of assembled together onto one big ugly Brown record the only way I could describe the color of this vinyl is if you took all of the fluids from inside the human body okay and mix them together in a bucket this is the color that it would come out to okay all the fluids everything that comes out of the human body that is liquid put it in a bucket that's the color you get and the demos are very rough okay there are some very messy parts to these recordings but in one way it adds to the character of the record and also I think I don't know maybe that was um no yeah it just adds the character the record that's really all I wanted to say it has to the character of the record and even though it is kind of noisy it doesn't necessarily take away from some of the performances which are which are pretty vicious so again this nihilist compilation over here carnal left overs nihilist for the entombed in the death metal complete us out there and finally we're going to end off with a a box set over here of swans this is the love of life box set and this is essentially swans have been since the band is kind of seen a resurgence have been reissuing a love of life and white light from the mouth of infinity you guys should know those records by now those are records the swans dropped in the early 90s but they've been out of print for a while they've recently put them back into print they've slowly been either putting old records back into print or releasing albums and compilations so this is from young God records again swans record label love of life white light from mouth of infinity very ominous album art over there and basically what we have is in this box the two albums as advertised sort of in their own separate box other than their own supper you know little things plus an eighteen track bonus CD from both of these albums so if you want to hear bonus material from this era over here it's thrown together into this CD I've heard plenty of material off of these digitally but I have not heard the whole records all the way through so I'm looking forward to to getting these a listen from front to back I've just been kind of keeping it in the box over here because I'm just like the box is so nice I'm just like afraid to touch it too much because it just seems like you know it's gen ice well put-together package so I'm just going to put it down because I want to like you know mess it up too much like that everything else has been you know kind of getting a man handled and all that meanwhile this has kind of just been you know sitting there and I've been looking at it and like oh man this is so cool it seems so weird like there's like some really weird shit in this box somebody sees this box or like the fuck's going on in there what's going on with that thing that seems kind of weird so just gonna be a good boy put it back in the sleeve I I will play it when I get around to playing it but uh for right now it's just going to kind of hang out in the sleeve a little bit you know that's that's all you know again I'm gonna get around to it it's just you know it's just chilling in the sleeve because the box is nice and that's that's going on here okay you guys understand you know you know the struggle so there you go all right um if you uh happened to buy a copy of the shoo-shoo Twin Peaks album but for whatever reason you absolutely hate it and you think it's the worst thing you've ever heard consider passing it to yours truly instead of passing it to

you're the whitey all right but what if I like it well then it's just your white guilt tacking right there okay never mind that now just not review it at all no Beyonce reviews fuck it any what'd you get a review the Beyonce album what do you had it touch mmm damn it I'm gonna end you I swear hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Beyonce album lemonade global pop singing sensation Beyonce with her sixth full-length album she really needs no introduction at this point she is back with another record that is being released sort of out of the blue a lot like her last album which was self-titled which was just like released onto iTunes overnight and didn't really have her need any promotion as everybody was pretty surprised and talking about it like crazy the very next day she complimented track after track after track from this record with a series of music videos and stylistically I thought this was her riskiest album to date even though there were some safe spots and I think risky for Beyonce I see her on this album is kind of dipping her toes into some new sounds some new ideas and on this latest record of hers lemonade I think she's not just dipping her toes I think she's diving right in she's taking even more chances which I assumed was going to be the case from her latest single formation which I thought was great which had a colorful trap flavored banger beat a twang II just plucked lead melody and even though it was just a very snappy a very punchy very catchy single I saw the lyrics as being more personal than what beyonce usually delivers her typical verses about love and relationships and femininity and empowerment on formation we got a little bit of that as well but also references to Beyonce's heritage and her culture and her Southern roots her parents delivered with this monstrous swagger and charisma that I couldn't help but get sucked into I had a hunch I didn't want to assume but I had a hunch that the rest of this record would follow a similarly personal pattern and in fact it does but so personal that I think lemonade is confessional I just didn't know how many personal details Beyonce would be divulging on this record it's to the point where I'm kind of worried about whether or not we're going to see some divorce papers between her and jay-z surface in the next year which is something I read people online talking about but it's it's something that before listening to the record I partially assumed was mostly because people were reading into some esoteric lyrics a little too much or just making some very bold assumptions but but no Beyonce makes her emotions her personal struggles and her intentions painfully clear on so many of these tracks going as far as to hint at the infidelities of her husband and say that she regrets putting this wedding ring on her finger and on other tracks here she makes reference to her parents her father specifically freedom a little bit of politics as well and sonically this is a very risky record for Beyonce - the last album had some subtle hints of alternative R&B and Beyonce's experimentation didn't really go too much farther beyond that now I think she's overtly referencing that sound with appearances from artists like the weakened and James Blake there's even a cut on here that seems semi inspired by fka twigs and there's even a country instrumental a Hard Rock instrumental she makes bold references to funk and soul there are numerous producers on this thing including familiar faces such as boots as well as Diplo they're soft and subtle spacious synthetic beats as well as luscious string sections the track listing is diverse it's occasionally epic its catchy and sometimes heartbreaking the album starts out very somber and quiet with the opening track and the story of this record is as plain as day from the first few lines we have an image of dishonesty being on his breath there's a lack of trust here she's kind of questioning this relationship that she's in she knows something's going on but nothing is quite confirmed beyonce is feeling out of the loop she's feeling confused and there are beautiful pianos on this track that I love a lot that I wasn't surprised to hear that James Blake might have had his hand in writing I saw he was in the writing credits on this track and just the instrumental read to me so much like something James Blake would have put together especially like off his first record and the picture beyonce is painting on this track goes very much with the subtlety of the music because I just get this image in my head of her listening into what's going on on the other side of a door or a wall or something she's just having this very quiet introspective moment wondering what's going on in this relationship that she's a part of the song hold up is a little louder it's a little bolder you can hear the intensity of the album kind of ramping up it's not going hard it's not going crazy it's not aggressive but beyonce has sort of up to the volume of her voice the music is a little more lively her lyrics to me are kind of a mix of anger and pleading for sanity here it's like she's trying to convince her significant other that who else loves you like I love you who else cares about you in the way that I care about you a lot of people have talked about how the chorus on this track directly references the ya-ya song maps and the chorus here does seem like a subtle play on that I get that so Beyonce takes this confusion and uh the the pressure builds into a full-fledged explosion on the very next track the song don't hurt yourself Beyonce is totally fed the fuck up on this track she's volcanic there's a pretty edgy instrumentation on this track to some very crisp drums and weird keyboards that to me sounded like something that could have come off of a battles record but once I heard the blaring guitars and Jack White's voice on the chorus it all kind of made sense Jack White had a hand in the production of this song AHA and the lyrics here in Beyonce's vocal delivery are insane this level of aggression that I never heard her lay on to a record and she even goes as far as to say on this track that she might just you know leave this relationship and bounce over to the next dick though there are some lyrics here that did make me roll my eyes a little bit like motivate you call me Malcolm X the song does have its other shortcomings I do wish that the distortion on Beyonce's voice wasn't really there it thins her voice out in a way that I don't quite care for and I don't really like Jack White that much on this chorus I mean I think the instrumental is cool it is a big change of pace for Beyonce and this album but I think throwing Jack White's vocals into the mix is just doing a little too much and also it it would just make more sense for Beyonce to sing the words on this chorus given what the song is about and who the song is about for Jack white to kind of come in and say when you hurt me you hurt yourself etc it just seems kind of like a bit of a disconnect still though I do think Beyonce's singing on this track is monstrous and I like the sentiment of the song a lot in a smart way it poses the idea that when you're in a relationship anything that happens the other person also happens to you also affect see any of you continuing the flow of the album because again this is very much a story this is very much a progression in a way it reminds me of the relationship tale that Bjork was telling on volnek Keira the song sorry we have Beyonce after this explosive moment with no regrets in her mind the relationship is like over she's not second-guessing herself the instrumental is a little synthetic bleepity bleep ii it's very sweet but i do wish it changed up a little more from the verse to the chorus but in a way it works because the instrumental doesn't really take away from what beyonce is saying and singing on this track as she delivers more very biting and telling lyrics she's calling out excuses she's taken the baby she's gonna start a new life she even makes reference to this mistress woman calling her Becky with the good hair who the Internet is so of hunting for for the blood of right now boo but also referring her specifically as Becky with the good hair could have a lot to do with you know some stuff I'm not really going to get into because people fucking get up my ass about it all of a sudden the flow and the story the direction of this album changes we have the song six inch which is sort of like a working women's empowerment anthem with a banger beat Beyonce sort of monotone on the chorus some subtle auto-tune on her voice just to add a bit of an effect it's a little much especially with the weekend being thrown into the mix too but the track is catchy as hell and it's got I guess kind of a smart life lesson underneath the very gaudy beat the very kind of Club flavor of the song it's not about heed mystically blowing all of your money away on just short-term pleasures but stacking your paper up for a better life tomorrow I don't quite get why Beyonce had to kind of take the stripper angle with the track but Beyonce has always been someone who celebrates sexuality the power of a sexual woman but yet she's kind of working herself to the bone to the point where she's crying at night when she's away from the stage and away from the club Beyonce doesn't get so bogged down in the details of this life that your average person can't relate to this because you know selling yourself for 40 or more hours a week just for a paycheck and that can be kind of degrading - we have the song daddy lessons which is the most endearing track on the entire record beautiful tribute to Beyonce's father over some organic percussion some acoustic guitar the track has a country flavor to it and I do appreciate how dynamic and diverse the tracklist is and how well these songs are kind of flowing into one another as far as the narrative and I guess Beyonce's voice does a good job of kind of tying all of these songs together even though they are in a load of different styles however this particular track it is one of my least favorite instrumentals because I do think it could have done without all the hooting and the hollering throughout the track which to me read like they were making a character of country music there are a few moments where the lyrics are painfully basic like daddy made me fight it wasn't always right although in a way this does remind me of a return back to the lyrical styles of a lot of older soul singers and I get that sense in the the style of storytelling on this song Beyonce referring to her dad simply as daddy and going through a series of life lessons in every lyric that he passed on to her and even when there is a lyrical shortcoming on a track such as this I still get a great sense of emotion coming from Beyonce on this song and others too because what's going on here on this track is so personal that I can tell it just has an immense amount of personal significance for Beyonce and as a result we get great vocal performances and I do have to admit the the refrain about sort of shooting at the site of any of these dangers that her father warns her about is pretty catchy also there's a very telling moment in the chorus here where Beyonce's father tells her that she should also shoot if she sees another man like him approaching I mean Beyonce is dad his inclusion in this record though she does love him and she has a lot of admiration for him he had his own infidelity issues as well so he works in the theme of this record we go back to Beyonce's relationship crumbling immediately after this cut we have the song love drought which is the track that to me sounded a little bit like fka twigs the beat was very synthetic very Spacey Beyonce's vocal delivery here hushed but still plenty of emotion there and she's singing about this loved route that she's in the midst of with her husband could be ended but there's a disconnect there like neither of them are willing to make the effort at the same time to kind of reconnect and make things work again and then from there we move into probably the most depressing and heartbreaking track on the entire record which is just simply a very bare piano ballad but also features one of the best vocal performances on this thing sandcastles and it's painful man this track is painful as hell to me it was kind of like you know when Adele would do a really great piano track but maybe even a little bit beyond that because again the picture she paints here is just so vivid and it hurts just hear her kind of refer to this relationship that she's been building over years and years and years as simply just a sand castle that was eventually meant to crumble and say that every promise wasn't meant to work out that way or the way that you want it to still you know a lyrical flub here and there like Tisha's smashed on the counter from our last encounter but still a stand out moment on the record uh Whitney Houston fans I think we'll get a lot out of this track two and then we go into this short interlude titled from the Shimura which features vocals from James Blake he returns there are some more beautiful piano embellishments and some strange electronic edits and even though the track is so short it's just a little bit of an epilogue to this song it adds so much to the record in transitions into the next track nicely which is the song freedom now this track a lot of people would say and they'd be right that this is the most political cut on the record Beyonce's making a huge statement here especially on the music video that is paired with this song if you watch like the visual lemonade HBO special but I think Beyonce's approach lyrically on this track is a little general and I think that's with a purpose I mean if you take the lyrics in a very general sense you could certainly pose this track within the relationship that she's been singing about for the entire album too but she kind of kills two birds with one stone and I'm not saying that she's not trying to make a political statement here that it could have been better I'm saying she did a smart thing here by being able to make a political statement but also make this track work within the story within the context of this record it's like she wants to be freed from this prison the suffering this unhappy relationship but simultaneously this song again it's also a statement she's making in reaction to all these stories of police brutality to minorities over the past several years the track has a strong funk soul hard like edge to it the instrumentation is vibrant it's dense it's lively its blaring and of course there's got to be a Kendrick Lamar feature on here if you're gonna make a political track and Kendricks verse is great I love how in the first few lines didn't know if you noticed this but he sort of does a bit of a countdown thing and Beyonce I think she just puts together a great track that is this heartfelt as the other songs I mean Beyonce not usually the one to make political statements in her music or make a country song but you know whatever make political statements in her music and this comes across is so heartfelt she portrays freedom as something that isn't simply just given to you it's something that you earn it's something that you need to maintain it's sort of motivational in a sense - as we have a refrain here saying that I'm going to keep running because winners don't quit on themselves and after this big showing of instrumentation and in a grand statement we're given a kind of low-key cut called all night which is sort of like The Closer of the album or at least the closing of this story in a way and Beyonce comes to the conclusion that this relationship is still worth working for and it's still worth being in but she needs to get to a point where she can kind of trust her significant other again and I love the base on this track - I'm really happy not only for this track but any point on this record where some great organic instrumentation turns up and even though there are lyrics on this track there may be a little blatantly sexual or basic for some people I see Beyonce as just a very sexual artist and someone whose love is a very physical love and that's why when she sings lyric like I'm going to row because of a Dutch opinion there's still so much conviction there it's not like she's just saying it for the sake of titillation like there is a point to that those types of expressions really mean something to her so this track to me is kind of the finish is the conclusion of this tale of this moment of infidelity this moment of kind of questioning the future of your relationship and meanwhile formation is kind of like this big banger that plays as the credits of the story role and even the song makes sense within the narrative the entire record because there's a point where she says she's possessive so she wears his chain so I guess at this point things are kind of fine and smoothed over but still you know for me personally being kind of subject to all of these very intimate details of a very public relationship was semi traumatizing so to be to be in the relationship I imagined could you know be even harder or it's just all sort of thrown in there for jihadist and I'm not sure you know it was entertaining I liked the story I liked the concept I thought the theme was cool but simultaneously I can't help but feel like the music industry occasionally is like I don't know some Truman Show esque thing where everything that's released to us is just meant to manipulate us in some way and if everything Beyonce is saying is true on this album and the result is this great record you can truly say that she was given lemons but she made lemonade I'm feeling a strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen you better have and I hope you enjoyed it I like it a lot I think it's great definitely my favorite Beyonce record a really mature album really well fleshed out concept thoughtful focused on point good production really it's it's a very nice record I'm I'm already saying it so a nice things about it let's get the fuck out of here Beyonce lemonade forever 
fkZ_8Zvy9Y0,okay everybody here is talking about the trap man himself any Bini hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new ASAP ferg album always strive and prosper ASAP ferg New York rapper part of the ASAP mob and you don't even know for the past several months I have been praying every night to the trap' Lord that this album would be good my relationship with fur has not always been a positive one my first introduction to him was in 2012 on ASAP Rocky's breakout mixtape where he had what I thought was the worst feature on the entire tape on the song kiss in pink but just not too much later he drops this album trap Lord that I thought was going to be terrible and lo and behold I liked it a lot the songs work and let it go and shove up the album featured all these trap flavored bangers but also had an eerie quality - the instrumentals and Ferg on top of them was really eccentric and animated and sort of out of his mind and the occasionally goofy off-key singing on the album I even thought was entertaining her Michelle Michelle at times he reminded me of bone thugs at times he reminded me of like ODB but he also had his own personal quirks - he followed this project up with a free mixtape that I thought was pretty decent there were a few changes of pace on this thing though he was getting some bigger names to feature and there were spots on here where he was rapping over like these EDM style instrumentals and some of those same sounds do show up here on this new album - they're actually much more prominent on this record I think I get the impression that Ferg is really trying to make a very commercial album on this one which isn't necessarily a bad thing I mean I assume that's kind of the whole plan of ASAP mob to begin with and it certainly worked for ASAP Rocky when he transitioned from level up ASAP - long live ASAP which was kind of like a bigger more commercial version of his original mixtape and had some huge hits on it but going blatantly commercial I don't think has worked out in the same way with Ferg here Ferg to me seems more like a wild card he doesn't have that slick delivery or that knack for an incredibly catchy song like rocky does or at least did because his last album was such a dud for me this album is filled with these candy-coated attempts at making something super melodic super catchy and it only ever comes out as annoying the introductory track is kind of like a perfect taster of what is to come it seems like some kind of mutated take on something that kendrick lamar would have done better with a bunch of wild background vocals and weird flows Ferg is essentially trying to send the message that he is changing he's reinventing himself here and the first instance of that is on the song hungry ham which features an incredibly obnoxious hungry ham mmm lyrically the song is a tribute to his home block but the really gaudy beat from Skrillex doesn't really match the gritty descriptions in his lyrics the whoops since aren't really doing him any favors either the songs strive featuring Missy Elliott is easily top five one of the worst songs have heard this year you can be tuna you gonna be Knight Ferg's goofy singing voice is being plugged into what's essentially like a hip house song and it goes over it doesn't go over at all it's completely tasteless especially as Ferg pulls out this little vocal ad-lib ow ow ow and then these weird lyrics about Ben and Jerry's and his uncle Terry and more it's so sweet it's sickening it's so bad it's not even worth sticking around for the decent Missy Elliott verse in the second half songs like psycho seem like the Ferg that we've known up until this point and seem way more personal and have a stronger element of storytelling the track is all about furs on very violent uncle and even though lyrically I think the song let it bang is a little general the schoolboy q feature on this track is fine and it's just a gritty hard-hitting tune and as far as highlights that's it everything goes downhill from here and it had been going downhill since like the first track we have the song new level with future and when this single drop last year I forgot about it I I didn't even remember it existed it was like I was listening to it for the first time again and believe me I'm gonna forget about it again in a few months I'm on a new level the the hook is ok the future feature is so-so the best thing about this track is kind of the lumbering beat with these synth horns that are just alright while the songs swipe life features one of the worst flows on the entire record usually forget least comes through with an eccentric or a silly or a very imaginative flow not really the case on this album or at least when he does come through with an eccentric flow it mixes in a really toxic way with these electronic banger beats it's kind of like bleach and ammonia you just don't want to breathe in these fumes the concept of this song which does feature Rick Ross is like you swipe your card and then you get stuff which I mean I hope it's a debit card you know you don't want to be putting all this stuff on credit and you can't pay for it later you know you think some of these guys on the corner are ruthless to try a debt collector suddenly the album just goes conscious hip hop for a moment on the song beautiful people ASAP ferg goes full Marvin Gaye what's going on on this track with a very soulful instrumental and even though lyrically the song doesn't really match with much of what Ferg is saying on the rest of the record the thoughtful lyrics about positivity and brotherhood and loving one another are a nice change of pace and let you go is an honest-to-god breakup song which is not only smooth and buttery but it's painfully corny too and I don't know who in their right mind dating Ferg would sort of accept this song as an apology considering the he did what he said he did in the song it's kind of like the equivalent to a crayon drawing I'm sorry card I'm like some computer printer paper while the track featuring big Sean on the album seems less like a song and more like a contest to see who can sing the worst song I love you is more a Chris Brown song than it is an ace app Ferg song since he dominates the track from almost beginning to end it also sticks out like the sorest of thumbs because this very slick ultra commercial R&B style isn't really Ferg's thing and sticking out like a sore thumb I guess it's kind of a weird accomplishment since the album hasn't really been consistent at all up until the end of it and this thing is 18 tracks long it's just jumping all over the place from beginning to end it just feels like it has no identity trap Lord had a very strong identity at least the worst tracks contributed to the character of Ferg and seemed like he was building up a portrait of himself from song to song to song here it's like an identity crisis this album seems focus group we need a song for the club we need a song for the girls we needed a banger we need a hit and a lot of these tracks would just be okay if you're listening to any one of them individually but as an album the listening experience just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and the whole thing isn't even that long this thing isn't even 50 minutes I believe and it feels like it's it's over an hour this thing is gaudy the production isn't that good the lyrics are subpar Ferg's personality doesn't seem to be doing him the justice it did on Trapp lord it's messy it's disheveled it's just not sure what it wants to do and it's a really weak attempt at commercial success I'm feeling a light decent two on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die it's just the way nature works everybody ASAP ferg always strive and prosper forever 
h_vuv0Oq6jQ,hey everyone Harrison in line tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sturgill Simpson album a sailor's guide to earth singer/songwriter Sturgill Simpson here with a new record at one time a humble country singer on the genres indie circuit he had a decent amount of buzz behind his last album meta modern sounds in country music which I admired from afar I didn't really love the record I thought it was a little too retro for its own good but if you're a country purist looking for that kind of old-school country outlaw country sound then this record is great but me personally I thought it was a little coloring by the numbers I didn't really get a sense of who's Sturgill Simpson was as an artist what makes a Sturgill Simpson song is it recognizable on impact however this new album over here which is Sturgill Simpson's debut record for Atlantic Records he has changed to a major on this one this album is leaving a much larger impression on me and it's because it's so quality and don't be scared by the fact that this is a country record coming out on a major record label this is not your commercial cookie cutter country it's actually diverse and layered nuanced and pretty refined occasionally it's even soulful with its hot horn sections and funky drumming he's not playing with an old-school or a stereotypical country sound on this one some tracks have been slowed down into a very somber ballad style elevated by lots of arranged instrumentation especially string sections the production even though it sounds very expensive it's pretty classy it's pretty tasteful and and very rarely does Simpsons voice get lost in all the instrumentation he comes through some pretty strong passionate vocals that keep him is the center of attention chin chin chin now I like this record a lot but I sort of wonder how people are going to take it it is in some respects an all country album it's Ault enough to be riding the fringes it's probably not going to be making it on to country radio and time soon or at least most of the tracks however this is not just some indie country in the folk like hipster country record some tracks on here like see stories are shamelessly southern and not that there's any shame in being from the south but still I do like the song in particular though the lyrics are great some secondhand war stories on here talking about being an egg and Uncle Sam's beater not usually an angle that you hear in a country song these days which are typically very very patriotic but Sturgill Simpson has sense enough to sort of see the individuality of this soldier protagonist and the song and kind of see him as being ground up into the war machine so there are true blue country songs on this record but Simpson and his band have the talent to reference pretty deep outside of the genre or even work in a groaning bass synth into the song brace for impact that works and pull off a tear in your beer rendition of Nirvana's in bloom that's pretty good too the lyric you don't know what it means to love someone actually translates pretty well to a country instrumentation a country rendition of a classic grunge song could have gone much much worse than what we have here the glistening pianos at the song welcome to Earth Polliwog are really beautiful they're almost story or lullaby like I wasn't sure how to take them at first because it seemed like such a huge departure from Simpsons last record but he brings the really passion and dramatic almost theatrical vocal delivery that this huge instrumentation calls for and then the track sort of transitions suddenly into this really visceral instrumental stomper and Simpson I guess gracefully transitions with that instrumentation the lyrics are essentially welcoming Simpsons newborn son into the world and this isn't the only part on the album where he references Parenthood fatherhood his grandfather familial ties life lessons that's what the song keep it between the lines is essentially about where the drums kind of take this tract of funky country tune lyric after lyric Simpson tries to drop all of this father-to-son insight but this album isn't without its contradictions because just a few tracks later the message from the album is live a little this track has an equally catchy guitar riff but I do think it it is little blander than some of the other cuts here I think Simpsons vocals get lost in the roaring guitars a bit while the song all around you is pretty much a straight soul song I wouldn't say Simpson makes soul music his own on this track but he definitely with his band knows enough to pull this sound off without a hitch there's a track on here in tribute to his significant other talking about the stresses of performance life of the music industry life kind of weighing on him but her love and their love for each other is going to kind of pull him through this madness that the world is driving him to in his head and the closer kind of returns to a lot of these war themes the song call to arms where Simpson basically goes on a rampage about drones and people just looking at their phones the media he's got bills to pay it's early fiery finish to the album and it's great that the record starts as strong as it ends and the whole thing rounds out at like a very tight thirty nine minutes doesn't overstay its welcome at all each song really serves a strong purpose there's nothing on here that feels like filler to me a few tracks the pale in comparison to others but even the Nirvana cover here felt like essential to the flow of the record this is a very consistent quality enjoyable country album with again a lot of great production law degree instrumentation nuanced stylistic diversity he's pulling so far outside of the country genre sometimes but he still kind of maintains that southern twang and his voice and his storytelling style I'm feeling a strong seven to late eight on this thing transition have you get in this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe or you'll die click on a video next to my head if you want to see another video have a nice day listen to the Sturgill Simpson album say your prayers your vegetables hug your mom forever 
gcEbFb9F9g4,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd I'm so hard because we are doing another episode of maybe my new favorite segment on this YouTube channel it came from band camp where I recommend to you a handful of albums from self release artists across the internet that are really weird our first album in this month's why you know a review is Larry wishes porous obtainer of loads truly bald yes strange title and it is a covers EP from this Larry wish man and it's a series of cover songs from music memes both new and old he covers an infamous song from mark Gormley as well as Jan Terry and he also does an organic instrumental reinvention of Macintosh pluses you know this track the album cover features a strange synthesized image of a room with a drum set and weird white buckets full of green liquid it's a barrel of monkeys covers EP so give it a listen our next album comes from a project by the name of stinky picnic it is an outsider music project a children's music project and I presume from what I can see and hear on this band camp page that it is a father-daughter duo and the daughter is particularly young and that is very much reflected in her vocals when they do pop up in stinky picnics music and they have numerous albums up on their Bandcamp but two records that are of specific interest here that I want to point out are there two minecraft tribute albums there are songs from front to back on these two records in tribute to various elements in the Minecraft series whether it be pigs and chickens and waterfalls and creepers and sheep and the tracks some of them feel like I don't know I guess cutesy traditional songs but many others are kind of strange ambient sound scape ish and very abstract so this isn't just some rickety cutesy children's music album or anything like that it's actually pretty weird it's one of the few records I've heard where I feel like children's music and various shades of experimental music cross paths and do so in a way that's not like trying to be jokey or silly or anything like some of the tracks on these two albums are legitimately intriguing next on this list of Wonders from the band camp platform is an album named zebra man from RMF the retarded Muppet family this is a sort of weird goofy tongue-in-cheek synth pop project from California allegedly formed in 1996 so I'm not totally sure if I can trust that and the cover here features an anthropomorphic zebra but and there's also a music video from this project too that features some pretty heavy themes of like you know furry lifestyle and bondage I'm not really sure how to describe the vocals they are freakish and they are very odd and the lyrics are even more difficult to make heads or tails up sometimes there's one track in particular where a lyric says that Marilyn Manson was arrested when he was caught with his pants down in a Taco Bell bathroom that is off of the song clown town so if you're looking for that line check that track out and if this thing doesn't weird you out enough also check out retarded Muppet families wheezes album yeah wheezes next carrion eater darkness and decay hold dominion over all this is a self-proclaimed New England death industrial project masterminded by someone who calls himself hyena carrion being like rotting flesh a carrion eater a hyena is a carrion eater he's a member of carrying eater do you get it maybe if more people join carrion eater in the future they could be named like vulture or talk or whatever and this album is like some very destructive harsh noise super distorted seems like a lot of what is distorted on this project are like vocals and could be the lead vocals of hyena they're super distorted and sort of processed to be very noisy but also there are samples and vocal snippets of like preachers saying some crazy there's a lot of very dark and disturbing Christian just and just generally religious themes all over this thing if you like white house if you like wolf eyes I think you'll get a lot out of this one and now for a little meme wrap with honk collective's big ball buff tea funky jammers vol 8 though this isn't completely a hip hop album it's sort of a weird low five since album with some cassia tone keys all over it and some vocals that sound like they were recorded by someone who has I don't know some kind of like voice disorder and all the vocals are being recorded into like a Call of Duty headset mic there's a few originals here but it's mostly covers there is a god-awful rendition of Green Day's basket-case that is so bad it becomes good he also does a revised version of Bismarck ease just a friend and kendrick lamar's backseat freestyle there's also a couple of tracks here where he's just kind of doing poetry as well as a rap in reference to the Animal Crossing videogame there's even a track on here titled dad's stretch my hands part one and in the tags to this album you can very prominently find the word cancer and finally we're gonna give a shout out to a pretty high project over here from a producer by the name of Toyo Moo and the name of this project is imagining the life of Pablo and what basically inspired this project is that this Japanese producer wanted to hear Kanye's new album but at the time the album was only available on title and title is not available in Japan so this left Toyo mu-2 because he wanted to hear the album make his own life of Pablo now there's no rapping on it or anything like that but it seemed like online he did some research and found out what songs Kanye sampled on the life of Pablo so then he also samples those songs and I guess does it in a way that he thinks Kanye would and sometimes he comes like scary clothes like he grabs the very same loops or chunks that Kanye does again I don't know how much he knew or understood about the life of Pablo before he went into this Bandcamp album but it's still an interesting concept and there's a lot of cool ideas here so if you like or if you love or even if you're just sort of indifferent to the life of Pablo check this thing out because it's it's a tribute but it's also its own monster in a way and that is it came from band camp for this month check out those albums they're all linked down there in the description you're the best I hope you have a good day transition another great episode of it came from band camp our theme song was by hot dad and our visual bumper was by liquid diamond both of their YouTube channels are linked down below again along with all of the band camp pages that are referenced in this video give them a listen have fun listen to some anti music make some crazy whacked-out music and put it up on the internet because that's what the Internet should be about you know not like just being as commercial as possible do something do some weird on the internet that 
7p4aLyHdp04,hey everyone missus inanimate here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new spark master tape mixtape silhouette of a sunken city this is the latest mixtape from semi-anonymous internet rap project spark master tape which generated quite a bit of buzz back in 2013 with the swoop Serengeti mixtape a tape that at the time I recall I wasn't all that intrigued by I guess it just didn't really leave an impression on me I think I wrote it off as like a little ugly Maine copycat or something to be honest I barely remember and now it's three years later we have a follow-up tape produced entirely by paper platoon it is 22 tracks long and I was very quickly reminded of why I was never really into this project to begin with it is the most shallow and gimmicky internet rap I've heard in a while their pitched down vocals from the start to the very end of this tape and it's not even that good of an effect it garbles the vocals to the point where they're almost unintelligible a lot of the time the vocals sound annoying they're almost completely unlistenable there's nothing good or entertaining about the rapping on this project partially because of this horrible cheap pitch down effect but also because there's not really any personality or flavor coming through in the vocals at least in the case of little ugly Maine when he does pitch his vocals down at least there's I don't know kind of a vocal inflection or a certain level of character coming through on the vocals whereas the rapping on this is just bland there is kind of an on-again-off-again southern accent that comes through on the vocals which could be a put-on I don't know all I hear really is the effect the effect that essentially swallows the lyrics and when the lyrics do stand out or translate they don't read as anything that significant or memorable just a lot of very general ignorant drug sex talk I feel like I'm listening to a bunch of runoff again from little ugly Maine some ASAP Rocky 3 6 mafia and every horrible chopped and screwed remix album that you've ever heard the production is decent on a bulk of the mixtape but it's nothing really to write home about a lot of the mixing and lack of effects on the percussion leaves a lot of these beats sounding flat and kind of one-dimensional though I do think some of the loops and samples are mildly interesting as far as songs and song lengths on here a lot of what's featured on this tape are like one to two minute bridges to nowhere no real significant progression or developments on some of these tracks the hooks are barely memorable when there is a hook this thing is too long it's too mundane it's too basic it's too unskilled and it's too reliant on this vocal gimmick that doesn't even work I just don't really see much of anything redeeming about this tape other than like a few beats here and there which are ok I'm feeling a light - decent - on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would rate it u2 best u2 best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe because that would be really nice of you ok spark master tape forever 
py975bActJY,
nHvuGiV8a2g,the blue album is better than Pinkerton California alt rock band and pop rock band Weezer their first two records are considered by many to be their best but every time they're brought up someone has to say which one they think is the best and usually that album is is Pinkerton the people who feel the need to say which one of the two is better wrong answer buddy Weezer's first album is their best album and that's not some hipster either that's objective truth that's right it's objectively better for 1994 this album had an incredibly fresh sound with its heavy drone II almost guitars some really punchy drums too but this edge was taken off by a kind of sad and nerdy demeanor coming through in the lyrics and the really catchy songs also this album features much more clever songs and hilarious and interesting song topics namely surf wax America a hilarious track that in a weird way imagines Rivers Cuomo taking his surfboard to work while you're taking your car you know just alternative means of transportation surfing it's better the song Buddy Holly classic single about a bit of a nerd relationship where Rivers is challenged with having to stand up for a girl and it doesn't go so well like he's got to get in a physical altercation here the song undone which uses this awesome sweater unraveling metaphor that is so catchy and so well executed people don't even remember that the song is called undone sometimes they just refer to it as the sweater song in the garage Rivers Cuomo does a great job of exploring all these childhood memories of his say it ain't so a painful song where his childhood home is sort of being ripped apart by his negative relationship with his stepfather and alcoholism the song only in dreams brings this incredible sense of longing for love with a girl or a particular girl in mind he does an effective job of painting love or at least this particular lover girl he's thinking about as addictive and sexism has never been as catchy as it been on the song no one else we're essentially rivers Cuomo's ideal girl is one that won't even laugh at other people's jokes on the flipside Pinkerton lacks any confidence whatsoever the album is rife with the kind of angst that numerous other 90s rock and grunge acts featured but with less of a pop buffer now and almost every track here is just mired in some kind of severe insecurity which maybe is mirrored in the hardcore fanbase behind this record which is why they have to at every opportunity yell at other people to remind them that Pinkertons a better album and while I do enjoy it an emotional wreck of an album this is not the greatest emotional wreck ever recorded especially for the 90s where there were a lot of emotional wrecks the instrumentals on this thing are kind of lackluster sometimes they're unenjoyable messy to the point where I think it actually takes away from the songs like on the tracks good life or why bother imagine if Nirvana had put out never mind and then they release bleach instead of the other way around well you don't have to imagine it because Weezer did that when they came out with the blue album and then they came out with Pinkerton it's like Weezer tries to embrace being noisy and messy as a means of being edgy or anti-commercial in a way reacting to the hype of the singles from blue but if this album is some kind of rebellion this rebellion is short lasting considering that after this record Weezer would go on to put out their most commercial and most one-dimensional material yet even more commercial than the material from their debut even the album's biggest singles are just okay or they haven't really aged that well El Scorcho scary that are clearly the result of Beck convincing all white people that they could or should rap annoying guitar lead and lyrics that put this song just a shade above hash pipe on the Weezer single pantheon like that bring the bacon line know that line was never good that line wasn't even good back in the 90s while deeper cuts on here like pink triangle and believe me I stand that Rivers has this tendency to allow his romantic desires and aspirations to push him into just illogical mental states which is okay it's part of the reason that Weezer is an interesting group and rivers is an interesting songwriter but this track about being sad that a woman that you're into is in fact a lesbian featuring lyrics like everyone's a little queer can't you be a little straight is so painfully idiotic that it makes me want to open up Tumblr and blog about identity politics every day I enjoy Pinkerton I still see it as a high point in Weezer's career especially with albums like make-believe under their belts it's definitely better than make-believe but it's definitely not better than the Blue Album I don't care how many times you've written it into your tear-stained journal transition if you disagree with this video make sure you subscribe and if you agree make sure you subscribe also don't disagree because you're wrong forever 
bRXD2P6UV7M,oh yeah hey everybody its de de tan oh here the Internet's deepest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Deacon album sleep cycle Deacon multi-instrumentalist producer singer/songwriter apparently on-again off-again member of the fantastic and internationally known psychedelic pop outfit animal collective and he is coming through with a long-awaited solo debut album sleep cycle whoa I've had my reservations in the past with Animal Collective albums well not specifically Animal Collective albums the group albums are pretty consistent very enjoyable though I didn't really enjoy the last one it's just their solo efforts the solo efforts they usually end up being a major disappointment for me it's like I'm listening to a piece but not the full puzzle that's true in the case of panda bear and AV tear and I'm wondering if that's gonna be the case too in the case of Deacon now this thing is six songs and just over 30 minutes long so even if it is lackluster it's not really gonna overstay its welcome it's pretty short for a sleep cycle we're like an afternoon nap but there's nothing on this album that makes me want to sleep there are actually a lot of engaging moments on this album I don't think Deacon has the unique vocal delivery of a navy tear or a panda bear but simultaneously Deacon avoids some of the shortcomings of their solo efforts it's not as repetitive and awash in pointless my new show and reverb is like a panda bear album and it's not as obnoxious or as grating as an AV tear project but stylistically sleep cycle still shares a lot in common with the animal collective discography there are tons of tracks on here that are very dreamy psychedelic folk with sound effects and since and electronics subtly weaved into the mix the dreamy and softer cuts in the very short track listing here are relaxing they're pretty and I acts want to get lost in this very easygoing instrumental the echo on the acoustic guitar here is a little sharp but still each piece of instrumentation is well mixed and recorded and balanced and even though it's all washing kind of blending together into this sort of psychedelic soundscape it's very pleasant and it doesn't turn into mush this is true of the song golden chords the opener of this album which with this acoustic instrumentation with these electronics the track also features what sounds like a field recording of crickets just the drone of nature playing in the background sort of took me back to animal collectives campfire songs album these steady and finger picket are chords are very sweet to the ear and deacon his vocals are I don't know I guess you would say earnest they're very intimate very sweet they're endearing the song that yes is equally as pretty but way more psychedelic way more layers on this track the song features kind of a weird oompah rhythm or groove that I like a lot and occasionally on the song Deacon works in these rushes of well I don't know what kind of instrumentation it sounds synthetic but some of the sounds organic but there's a lot of vocal layers in there too there's just so much layering on this thing he makes use of the same repetition tricks that pandabear and AV terran Animal Collective do but at least here on this little solo project he's always adding new layers and new sounds and crescendos to keep things interesting and the vocal melody on this track is pretty solid to solid to the point where I actually want to listen to the song over and over so that I can sort of learn the vocal melody or the words and sing along then there are really wild moments in the tracklisting year like the song footie which is such a physical and an explosive track features these super aggressive and busy drums the high hats are just rattling off like an automatic assault weapon while you have these just pounding toms popping up in the background and Deacon delivers his most aggressive vocal performance on the entire record he strains he yells at points it seems a little AV tear influence specifically dur during those more chaotic Animal Collective records and the tension in his voice the intensity in his voice really matches this blaring instrumental these loud just aggressive riffs that sound like they're coming from a guitar but maybe that guitar is just so heavily manipulated it doesn't sound quite like a guitar or maybe it's a sense whatever it is it's roaring it's angry it's loud and he matches that energy perfectly the song is borderline psychotic and as the track moves along each verse just gets madder and madder and madder it's really an over-the-top track Deacon definitely exercises a few emotional demons on this cut and then after the song we kind of have a calm after this storm a little interlude cut that's okay and then the song good house this is the first moment on the record where I think Deacon really begins to find his own voice in his music instrumentally we return back to that kind of nocturnal outside nature very serene instrumentation that kicked the whole project off and these really deep murky guitar chords sort of lay a foundation for deacon to sing over and lyrically at least how I'm interpreting it it's like he's telling us about this house about this place where his anxieties and his pain and his worries kind of melt away and the instrumentation builds really nicely with whatever level of emotion Deacon is showcasing in his own voice I like how dynamic his singing is on this track and the instrumental too I mean almost every instrumental on this project is pretty dynamic and I also appreciate that even though this project was short nearly every song segwayed into the next very fluidly so it did end up feeling pretty cohesive there wasn't any one song that stuck out like a sore thumb or was just a really horrible track and the tracklist singer felt really out of place it feels like a really cohesive piece with multiple phases to it again I think it could have been a little bit longer and deacon I think does leave a little to be desired when it comes to his vocal presence and his vocal delivery he certainly doesn't have a stunningly recognizable voice especially since from time to time we are hearing vocals that sound like they could just be on any other animal collective record but he still brings some decent tunes some very good rich lush production performances that are either exciting and visceral and intense or tracks that are really laid-back and maybe even a little entrancing this project has a lot of good things going for it's very solid and I guess it's my favorite of all the recent animal collective solo efforts I'm feeling a light a decent seven on this thing transition have you given thus album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like hit that like deacon sleep cycle forever 
RgzSqtBoP2Y,I rest of the words hey everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new PJ Harvey record the hope six demolition project UK singer-songwriter PJ Harvey here with her ninth full-length studio album I'm pretty sure coming through five years after the release of her last record let England shake which has become one of her most celebrated albums so far and it hasn't really aged that badly either in the half a decade it's been around and with this new record over here Harvey is sticking with a lot of these social themes that were on her last record along with the very loose kind of rootsy instrumentation though there are some noticeable differences for one the production is slightly different it's not as reverb E and washed out as her last record the instrumentation here is certainly more up front which is good but it's a little less mystical and her socially aware sites have kind of shifting off of her home country and now are sliding in between the first world and the third world the voguing imagery of not only kids begging for money saying dollar dollar but also a rundown downtown area that instead of being cleaned up and fixed and revitalized is I guess getting bulldozed over so that a Walmart can get thrown in there which oddly enough kind of reminds me of that Dead Kennedys song killed the poor which is this track about the this you know upper-class upper crust group of people's fantasy this violent fantasy that they have that they just wipe out all the poor people using like nuclear weapons or something but now instead of doing that we get rid of the things that we don't like anymore with just public works projects and we just kind of replace things that we hate and run down areas with box stores Harvey jumps around from location to location and kind of gives us little vignettes and pictures and gives us the divide between where we're living and some other place where there might be some kind of great suffering going on musically this album pulls way more from the world of Blue's PJ Harvey and company actually sample a blue song quite blatantly on the song the Ministry of Social Affairs and the saxophone plays a way stronger role on this project than it did her last album not only does it fit very snugly into the already existing instrumentation on a lot of tracks here but occasionally the sax goes full sax attack in a series of very noisy and contorted solos throughout the tracklisting lyrically I think this is a pretty interesting sequel to let England shake like I said it brings a lot of those socially aware themes once again and Harvey's language isn't too I guess flowery or poetic or whatever she's not afraid to list out death tolls and call places shitholes but her kind of eerie and emotional and very upfront delivery adds a lot of weight to her simple words and I think part of the magic of this record comes through in the scenarios that she's referencing throughout this record two on one track in particular she depicts the life of an old woman who is essentially doing her best to maintain a group of houses in Kosovo after the war had either killed the people who were once living in these houses or drove them away from their native land so now she's just kind of keeping these houses up the best that she can with the hopes that their inhabitants will one day return and PJ Harvey doesn't play up the war or the location where this is happening or anything at all it's like she takes the situation and turns it into more of an abstract more of a fable type tale it's got a bit of a Sisyphus rolling a boulder up a hill forever kind of vibe to it or maybe even a Waiting for Godot type of thing it's like she's not trying to be overly political on the track even though what she's singing about is a direct result of politics she's singing more about the situation and just being as in the moment as this old woman is and there are other moments on this record where she's making what sounds like protest music like on the very heavy and trudging Ministry of Defence I like most of what's going on with this record conceptually lyrically it's musically I think this album pales in comparison to PJ Harvey's last record some of these songs are super brief and I actually think they kind of hurt the potential high points of this album like on community of Hope or orange monkey or medicinals a track about the Washington DC area about how before it was touched by human hands there were all these medicinals that grew in the area and PJ I guess has this I don't know kind of weird psychedelic experience where these plants are talking to her saying that they've always been here and then all of a sudden the track just ends out of nowhere and we're given the image of what seems like a homeless woman sippin liquor in a wheelchair I guess to kind of juxtapose the natural state that this place was once in versus the urban decay that it's suffering through now an interesting point to make but in my opinion there was so much more that could have been pulled out of it lyrically and musically than the very sparse two minutes that this song lasts and then there are other tracks here whose story and song I think could have been extended could have used another musical passage to make the song more dynamic or again there just might have been more to the tale that PJ Harvey isn't telling us like on chain of keys or on a line in the sand and then there are several tracks where I think the instrumentation is super tedious super repetitive to the point where the the simple musical idea is being broadcast here really get tired this is especially true of the song the Ministry of Defense whose very heavy shutting down earner nur guitar riff I don't think is as exciting at the end of the track as it is at the start of the track and then there are a few instrumental choices that I think pull away from the punch of these tracks like near the memorials to Vietnam and Lincoln whose refrain is completely drum 'less and even though there are so many vocals here and it seems like there might have been a few layers of guitars the instrumental feels so collective and yet it's so hollow because the percussion the lower frequencies are just really not represented though I do like the high hich drone the song progresses into during some of the verses a couple of tracks on here that I do think are great instrumentally throughout are the wheel which has this rowdy driving and dirty rock and roll vibe to it with these just sweaty bluesy horns they honk throughout the track the song also has kind of a messy loose Velvet Underground vibe to a very brittle rhythm guitars and Harvey's vocals on the track are great and the closing track is well dollar dollar which is one of the more subtle cuts here but is still very fulfilling with its hypnotic and heavenly background vocals and a very soulful sax solo that closes the track out I still enjoy this record a great deal and for all these songs that I'm very critical of there are elements that I like whether it be a catchy vocal melody or an interesting lyrical idea or some instrumental chemistry or the production it's just that I think this record could have been better I think it could have been better I think it could have been longer I think it could have been more fleshed out and the shortcomings of this album I think are especially obvious not only given that PJ Harvey's last record was so great but this album here shares so much in common with it I think there are some cool fundamental ideas and foundations on this album but there's just not enough meat on these bones I'm feeling a life 7 on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best well should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe or you'll die that's it's a serious medical condition everybody be careful PJ Harvey forever

cool you're the best links and info down in the description I'm with the review No hey everyone Gora theny grind tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new ma t3 record junk famed French synth pop outfit m83 or rather a project masterminded by multi-instrumentalist and producer Anthony Gonzalez and with m83 he hit a pretty fantastic stride in the 2000s with records like Saturday is equal youth dead cities before the dawn heals us but then in 2011 I feel like m83 made a slight misstep with the album hurry up we are dreaming on the one hand this project featured some of m83 s biggest and most high production songs yet just huge glistening multi-layered instrumentals some pretty punchy beats as well but these high points were weighed down by a lot of pretty lackluster moments - a lot of which in the runtime of this project I think was kind of unnecessary I think there was a lot of filler a lot of songs that were central just patting this thing out in order to fulfill the weird conceptual idea that Anthony had going into this album and that's essentially that it is two sister records both of which aren't even that long they're like 30 minutes or so each and together they kind of just create two very mediocre records whereas it would have been much more enjoyable to just have culled the best tracks out of these two albums and just have one good album and that's kind of what I'm hoping I get on junk this is not a double album this is not a set of sister albums it's one single record and on this album Anthony doesn't seem to have married himself to some over-the-top concept or anything so are we just going to get a bunch of good tracks this album isn't necessarily a return to form either I don't think this record is going to sit well with a lot of m83 fans mostly because it's not really what fans of this project are going to expect or even want rather than handing us an album another album with m83 s trademark sound Anthony has seen fit to go back and deliver to us a variety of tunes that indulge in a bunch of different vintage pop styles mostly from like the mid 70s to the mid 80s a lot of which could have been an inspiration for him as he was starting m83 I guess you might be able to see this as m83 very own random access memories in a way but even though it seems like this project is reaching back to a lot of very old sounds in pop and synth pop um I don't know it's not really like Gonzalez here is giving them the epic tribute that Daft Punk did on their last album in fact it seems like Anthony is such a skilled songwriter and producer at this point that he can reimagine a lot of this music with his eyes closed or just reimagine these kinds of songs in his sleep and right from the start this record has its low points like the lead single do it try it which honestly did not have me excited at all to listen to this record it does not sound nearly as smooth or as well put together as many previous m83 tracks even the the biggest and the best and the catchiest songs off of hurry up or dreaming the track intros with these very odd vocals and kind of thin stabby piano chords that don't know whether or not they want to sound track a dance song or I know there's like some chord progressions here that remind me of like a piano saloon tune and while I've never really considered m83 to be the kind of project that shows off any kind of lyrical genius the lyrics on this track sort of seen below the very average standard that m83 has set so far the chorus on this track is super indecipherable the vocals are garbled they're buried everything is so thick and compressed and just so oppressive the cheap crunchy synth bass doesn't really sound that great either and the sudden ending on this song only further adds just how unimpressive it is after this lead single and opening tract the album hit me with a series of songs that featured nothing but sensual synth leads and vintage pop grooves some string sections some sweaty sack solos from you know that 70s 80s era that I talked about even a few adult contemporary vocal ballets from that same era of time and this vibe even comes through on the interlude tracks here which some of the interlude tracks were I don't know some of the momentum killers on the last album so I'm a little disappointed to hear that they come up here once again but moments like Moon crystal I actually really enjoy the the instrumental here actually reminds me of I don't know a sitcom theme from the 70s or the 80s it's really a you know a heart warming lyric about family and friends away from being a sitcom theme while the song tension is like a bit of very sad mood music that would be played during a montage where our main character in this sitcom like I don't know made a bad decision or something and now he's got a say sorry but right after this song Moon crystal is the song for the kids with Suzanne's son for on lead vocals this is undeniably a highlight for me on this album it's a pretty tune and I like it you know this kind of slow very emotional synth pop ballad but if you wanted to hear this kind of music you could easily grab $5 and head down to your local goodwill and look for any album that came out late 70s early 80s in the used record bin and chances are you would get a more consistent album especially if that album is a Stevie Wonder album Anthony definitely pulls from him quite a few times on this record especially with that harmonica solo at the very end of junk but then there are other ballads on here that just don't go over as well like the track Atlantique hood which is a little duet that is super emotionally flat flatter than a cornfield the vocals on here are so passionless it actually sucks any appeal out of the song this is also an issue on the track solitude which is another vocal pop track another ballad with huge instrumentation but Anthony doesn't step up to the plate to provide the big vocal character in presentation that this instrumental is begging for these in the background behind the scenes just completely unaffected and emotionally just hollow vocals just aren't doing it for this type of music it's like Anthony has brought everything but the personality that these songs need in order to be carried properly and even the other guest singers with the exception of Suzanne are pretty unimpressive - there's not a single vocal take on this record that I liked even Beck's appearance at the very end of the album is almost anonymous I would never have known it was back if I hadn't seen the credit the harder-hitting cuts in the track listing here are passable for the most part at the very least they provide a danceable groove and a candy-coated synth lead but there's very little memorability and very little character to these songs - at the end of the day hearing m83 sort of indulge in all of these older pop styles just seems like such a hollow pursuit this album serves as more of a reminder of why a lot of these sounds are no longer in style more than it does a reminder of hey this is this really cool era of music that that there's still potential in and that you know it's it's cool to revisit like with the album Hurry Up We're Dreaming as I mentioned earlier there's a bunch of interlude tracks on here that while they're not terrible they just don't really seem like they serve a purpose as all they're doing is gluing together a bunch of very unentertaining songs this in a way reminds me a lot of the sister albums from hurry up we're dreaming it's kind of like the third sister album in this series the sister that the two sisters previously didn't even know about and mom mistreated her and locked her up in the Attic to live the rest of her life and now she's back and she's looking for revenge I'm feeling a strong three to a light four on this record honestly transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you do best you the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die watch one of these other reviews over here have a nice day Anthony Fantana m83

Tim Hecker he produced my favorite album of 2013 virgins as you may already know and he has a new album out now titled loved streams so I'm very excited to talk to him about this latest record and anything else that kind of comes up in the midst of this conversation Tim thanks for thanks for coming on time of your day to opportunity no problem and and likewise all right let's let's dive into the new record which is out everybody can hear everybody can listen to it it's out on major streaming platforms and people can purchase it in their local record stores and whatnot on first impression this latest record seems to have I don't know a real strong note of warmth to it that I think your last two albums didn't have which were a little despondent I think a little apocalyptic in a way you know was it a conscious decision to make an album that seemed a little bit I guess less foreboding in a way yeah it is like an intention to like use a paintbrush to like paint a bit of like that a rainbow or some kind of like riding with unicorns versus you know some kind of not sure in terms of studying what I've maybe been waste in the past and I would say am i conscious but there's also unconscious like there was just at this point where I didn't I wanted to avoid like overly you know making overly plodding music and so this is kind of like a restraint or pull back or something also like fragmentation I was really into like trying to make works that were like you know had some interconnectedness but also seen really disparate and disjointed and didn't make sense so we're trying to with a bunch of things that were you know floating on the head at that point is is disjointedness a word that you would use to describe some of your previous material because at least in my personal opinion you know virgins and and rave death you know your two most reasons that they seem like pretty cohesive pieces yeah yeah focus I'm trying to make cookies is like apples that work as the unity or whatever this point I was actually like well like how do you how do you make something that the bit more fragmented how do you make something that's a bit more jarring or like has a bit more of a pastiche aspect to it you know just collage with like black and white Xerox Xerox kind of photocopies it was like bright high-definition overlays or ways of thinking about things differently than integrity and unity and completing this and you know trying to make them it's a bit more disfigured a little bit yeah when you're talking about your own art which I mean obviously is is auditory you throw in a lot of language that to me sounds almost visual or almost like you're making references to to artistic studies like painting you know is is is painting and color and sort of I don't know visual representations of the sounds that you're producing something that's in your mind as you're creating your music I mean really struggle it because on the surface it comes off as a super pretentious like music makers above the music industry relies on visual metaphors to creative thing and that's partly true but it's also partly not you know I'm like it's honestly like I really do come at it with these kinds of visual overlays and like I think about like you know what is white neons look like Shona fiber what does like a Richter Street painting look like as a musical composition and those are things have given me as much inspiration as my colleagues and friends and people working in music or whatever you want to call this one apart stepping back I do honestly still feel myself as part of a like a contemporary art as much as I do music industry Alex I'm really not into defending any notion of how the music apparatus should work like a really dream of another state which is not like would like merged like a youth earlier in an interview did not exist like a dream a dream of the obliteration of the word much and I don't know and often like a lot of my friends we just exist as much in tons of musicians you know and like and speaked in those discourses like I'm expending our history like those are just things that I've always interested in you and I hopefully that comes off and in this way and it's not pretentious you know because that's the truth of it really wouldn't get that through it well that I mean the the musical arts have just always had a very close history with especially the visual arts I mean especially in the the modern music industry I mean just the album cover itself just kind of seems like something that is inseparable from the current day music world you know if you don't have an album cover slapped on to this group of songs that you've put together as almost as if you didn't try hard enough or something yeah just like you know like like you look like the early philipot album to get to 12 you couldn't become really nothing houses the cover has done by solo with you know there's like a very much like it kind of downtown Manhattan like community that was like not segregating these discrete industries that for me it was really tedious like I like that kind of weird inter relationships with people that do other things you know and getting inspiration from it so yeah it's just like it could be a deeper relationship in some ways and it is it feels really superficial important yeah all right um moving further into the instrumentation on this new record kind of one of the big two dues about what you're doing on this record instrumentally is that you have worked sort of a choral group into your pieces on this album and they and they come up again and again throughout the piece or throughout the entire record you know tell me a little bit about the incorporation of these vocals into your work and sort of you know where where they were kind of driving the creative process kind of came in as like an early idea and it came up just like thinking about like what you know how do like looks like the next like problem to solve were like what's in it object to creating it place it came up through talking with my friend Benton we I worked on a lot of my records she's still like a touch vocal and that kind of started just by like working through choir pieces and writing a really bright digital versions of these medieval chrome looks and I am at some point I brought in Johansson who did some vocal arrangements a filter and like pieces and studio recorded everything together and it took got back to my studio and worked on it for a while like honestly pulling you know paint from a cave or discarding it it's you know went back to these beautiful blues and brilliant titanium lights and whatever and they're just started you know working on these pieces and finishing it yeah and uh you you you're talking about sort of bringing them in as like oh it's sort of a problem to solve or something to sort of you know figure out was was there a problem there that the vocals were kind of a solution to with the music villain tonight I mean problematic looking it shows off those ends like sure just an object of interest and concerns you know like how the fuck did you deal with vocals like I've avoided the voice because the voice is loaded with meaning of text and like focus things that I wanted all my work was tried to break through them and so you know the earliest idea was like was charged with her Sodom was trying to dial tone was trying to be Iceland I'll inquire you know like how do you how did you do that and then the whole I question of like vocal treatments like how would you deal with the voice would you leave its bear gym off these skating it doesn't even in a sound like it's human at all you know did you all have kind of questions and one extreme incident happened you know in the end it kind of settled on some kind of path through that dance along these kind of bridge lines between like semblance and blurriness or whatever and meaning and not leaving you know just just ways what found pieces of the problem very on color yeah it's it's uh it's rare that these days you sort of hear the voice used as like an abstract sound or piece of instrumentation as you would with you know like a like a violin or just any other piece of instrumentation I guess the point I'm trying to make is that usually with Western music in terms of vocals the voice is the carrier of the the persona the personality the message and now in your music that you're producing over here the vocals are just kind of no more than just another piece of sound in the mix they're not necessarily trying to give you a direct linguistic message or anything like that not to say that you know that's disrespectful of them in any kind of way but it's just kind of refreshing to hear vocals in that way when they're just usually not treated that way in the modern age ya know for sure and I mean I'm not the first question to treat the voice and in a way that like makes meaning unclear I mean there's been sure junkies mothering in like you know rock music for you know decades you know it's been like deep ones like him knows that you know muttering or kind of murmuring or whispering was also the way so it's not like there's any new ground broken yeah you thought I mean I'm just that was just something I was really interested in in pursuing well the way the way that you had framed it earlier of yeah sure I mean no new ground broken okay I agree with that but it seemed almost as if the way you were kind of framing the introduction of these vocals it was almost as like it was a personal artistic challenge to yourself yes but in the end that's all it is in the end like the the pink and blue like CD or vinyl or mp3 is just you know just a document of you know a few months of my life and so a work that I made to like make peace with myself and like just try to make something that you know isn't offering to the world and I thought was like something you know it just made me contend maybe not exhilarated but I feel like it was giving up that it wasn't a total failure you know it's good enough to go out and that's definitely documents that's all these albums are you know it's just like a little piece of work mm-hmm I want to kind of get back to the the idea of music and painting later because I think there's some interesting sort of comparisons that you can make between the two but when you tour behind this material live do you foresee yourself incorporating live vocals into the set when you're playing this material honestly I did a console I tried I liked workshop for vocalists and had been walking around wireless headsets in the fog and it was a quite amazing thing it was like they were singing three like you know treatment chains but I had made and they were like walking amongst people in the audience and it was really fantastic but the logistics is like doing that like chewing with five musicians it's just not tenable like it's like literally it undermines one of the reasons you brought on the road which is to make a living like partly I mean obviously do it for you like perform and enjoy me keep on into a path but if i Nick it's not viable silly travel with that many people for me and eating four fingers in each town with the kind of Damo Suzuki live Jam kind of way and killing presentational too much work I would say so for the time being I'm dealing with power instrumental versions of music are you some vocal treatment but it's going to be more of a such an approach to education what part alright my next question is uh you know you're talking about this music kind of being a documentation of a few months out of your life sort of creating something and you know you're also creating this music within a certain space - this is the third album I believe that you have recorded in Iceland and is that correct or have you done more yeah I mean it's been like three that I'd like the corded torso kinda nice one like a lot of the time right I mean this is like you're talking about a couple days out of a month or something right there would be you know studio sessions we've done a bunch yeah and this one was finished in LA and it does a lot of you know the early sessions where I go to kind of break away like I'd go probably once you try to learn records - and they've taken first air for sure why I guess my question is you know what what kind of continues to make Iceland such a prime location for you in terms of sort of recording at least your recent records you know I mean is it a certain collaborators or resources over there or is just kind of the area of all you're lazy about mobility about it's like simple if it's friends it's like people I look with and trust and enjoy and tight with and love them and half vision like that that makes something interesting about us also it's like one of the you know great they have a really world-class video that I'm using just everything in Fletch is very able in quality and he is like a place to get away where you remember what you're there for you know you you left home to be on the internet half the day as an email and some you know kinda you know like distraction it's like it's all melted away you like you remember after the swimming pool or husband you like and therefore music you know and and it kind of forces you into writing and commit to something you know but you don't have infinite time you can do there for five years shoes I mean some people do but for me like I just want to I want to work for a while and then move on now I know if it's a huge burden I was like some unfinished mega project lasting ten years making a Peter Gabriel turn away or something you know I like this I like to get clean and cut my losses and move on and it stays lean and not you know have like intellectual or like work below you know where things are kind of like painting so I like to go and just burn it harsh and then like move on make been affected from and that kind of setting really fostered that well that's kind of an interesting look at your I guess your creative mindset in your creative process I mean some some people do kind of thrive in the hustle and bustle of the the Internet age and the information age but it sounds like you know you personally need some separation from that and also you know it sounds like it may be difficult for you to work on something then get distracted from it and then kind of come back to it later with like the same kind of excitement this is like let's no less internet mediated than any other like digital aesthetic music I would say I mean if I'm like sure you know the reality is there's like I message popping up constantly and like it's like fully like I'm not unplugged at all you know it's like even if I don't like maybe use social media very aggressively and like I you know and very much still like digital natives in terms of like my music production like kind of came up with the Internet in terms of the earliest ones of like crack software and I've been using through and feel that like I definitely do try to like move over the digital edges of my music like to confuse those like coffee spaces and make them look didn't want scoffs sometimes but if you come from a very like computer driven me and other consent Bureau you know yeah I suppose that's kind of the double-edged sword of making you know music that is sort of so synthetic in tone you know you're you have to depend on the devices that could simultaneously be a distraction away from your creative process I suppose I don't like wish for any like free internet time or D tax time kind of like you know I do like to turn off off airplane mode for like six hours of the time and just like totally go into business all I you know I don't wish the difference in 70s or something or like I'm not nostalgic at all for what was lost really I mean you know when your album leaks or whatever that's not fun and it does like make you think I wish that didn't happen but that doesn't mean that you know you want to throw back and some golden age that we don't have anymore you know the game I'm like so fully against in a mindset so artistically do you do you feel like it's at least important to your philosophy to continually be looking forward to the next frontier where music is going in order to kind of I don't know get inspiration for what you want to do next then tough one I don't really know you know it's kind of like this is an art form it's really predicated by like its technological like a bond gardener like these you know just go back to the visual culture yeah there's like definitely that 3d type of artists to like a slab off like the newest like textural spaces in which they model they're like you know objects in two-dimensional space allurement that like is it really that I don't know I like I question that kind of hormones that like like be lining to follow the technological space and the answer is I do you personally you know like I'm always like interested in that new tool but I'm also a bit skeptical when I found those tools are like asking about something better than the reactor plugin I had like seven years ago or whatever he would make my music better doesn't make him working much streamlined and less cumbersome and bloated and like the answer is not always clear you know what doesn't work that's when I use my old tools and I push them in different ways for things like trying to find a new interface or you know no it's a tough one I mean once is basically like I'm steeped in the world you know hundred percent and it might taste they're like 2016 pop me just disagreed and yeah it's a problem I don't know because I'm like a Kumar I feel right yes like very much like interested in like envelope-pushing and terms of tools I'm a computer artist first and foremost but I also don't drink the kool-aid you know that some of these tools are always necessarily better you know yeah talking more I have in my own brain I mean it's uh you know I've spoken with artists who see a great deal of potential in terms of their own creative processes in stuff like I don't know virtual reality glasses or something and sort of thinking of ways where they can sort of get people to appreciate or even experiment or experience rather their music in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise by sort of feeding it to them through this other kind of platform I guess yeah I mean the question of like you know disseminating through multiple new emerging platform is interesting but in the same way I'm a she's lines again where I'm like you know I expected love primarily through Sonic medium like true stereo or binaural waves like entering music into your brain that was this generally audio-visual like pattern you know like I do it but I feel it's also always arbitrary like you know so the digital internationalist music like this could be of like a million things they would all work and some of them wouldn't and it's like I like a strong little thing I don't have the answer you know I'm like I was open but I don't really I don't really dream along like platform lines but you know I don't get excited about composing for virtual reality like you never some type of like we are goggles and things I'm more about like the audio content of what would be made versus the apparatus is deployed in yeah I mean the mixing sound that makes them judicial which maybe is probably true that often not okay no I mean I it's it's it's it's a point of view that I agree with you know I mean personally music is my primary focus and and I hate to see a project where it seems like all the effort was put into I don't know kind of the video game that was paired with the music and the music is just absolutely terrible you know I would much rather just have a good album you know as opposed to like I don't know you put your album on an app or something and the word you ask people is like how would the music stand on its own without the technological audio-visual crutch that you're left with right like it's almost them sometimes crotch that if you close your eyes and you just listen to music and it sucks that you know they mean it's not then that audio-visual pairing like that like 5 4 min to could be seen as a gimmick to facilitate underwhelming sonic artform you know what I mean I'm just thinking off the top of my head here like I don't know I probably disagree with myself tomorrow so that's what they're doing ok let's move on and talk conceptually a little bit here about about ambient music which is a term that is is very often used to describe what you do however I personally you know at least if we go by the definition that someone like Brian Eno lends to ambient music it's very much background music it's very much furniture music but I feel like your music does have commonalities with what we know as ambient music but I feel it personally to be engaging I feel it personally be very much foreground music you know music that you're concentrating on music that you know you wouldn't necessarily stuff in the background while you're exploring some kind of app or you have some kind of VR helmet on your head kind of playing you all sorts of psychedelic colors to go along with the audio that you've created yeah I mean I always like was kind of stalled by the description and it took great exception to me you know I was like I like the idea of like you know background objects listed there and don't that that act like tying postmodernist furniture or something and that's cool but what about like intensive when those objects to examine but focus you know like close up like full field vision how do you how does how does it work you know kind of pulled up and you know this amiko clip on the batter I just felt like I was interested in like jacking up the intensity of like Ambika news or something that in accelerating it and making long-form mimetic pieces into increasingly short ADHD like kind of some edits and things like that that regulating each other and like sneeze and unsmooth form a totally collage friendly like you know like almost like what it's an insane clown posse jugglers and sort of claiming some ambien pack I don't know like all these guys here you know like why not you know and what would that be and those things were more interesting community and at some point I kind of became reactionary again I'm being like I'm not interested even though that guy I make music that I like in doing shit that's like anything from I don't know Wendy what Nina's work through to like I'm a lot of early German since are that like different one to deep space mine you know but I enjoy myself but I felt like I need to do something slightly different or it's just like it wasn't enough to just like play a pad us a counterpoint that of a baseball system thing they needed some kind of compositional or things just like your chocolate in a different way or Mossad or magnetized into a place microscopic detail I don't know it's like today I were struggling with and I haven't felt fully comfortable with that like classification or like that so interested in descending that as you know is my form of expression like a always felt out of that inner circle another thing that I kind of want to ask you about this this album is just kind of your compositional process in in relation to experimental music and in relation to ambient music what you're composing here just seems so abstract a lot of the time you know you're obviously not following your traditional verse chorus verse kind of structure you're actively working to kind of break away from that sort of thing a lot of the time yeah idea that the composer sequelae no paper and the sheet music and and has an idea right there and then it's performed here whatever either it's a that is it go on with your question jump in yeah okay well with that in mind how do you sort of over the course of the compositional process sort of decide exactly when you are done with a piece per se you know especially considering how vast and how formless not completely formless but you know uh with your songs with your compositions being abstract as they are you know there certainly is the potential to just kind of go on and on and on for however long as you like really and and what I've always kind of appreciated about your music is that for as abstract and you know again for lack of a better term I guess as ambient as it is it always seems very direct in terms of what it's trying to do compositionally and and as far as runtime as well it seems like you know you really kind of have a focus as to what you want to get across sonically in your music and it doesn't necessarily come off as a overly indulgent especially in terms of just like the the time at and length that you put into your songs yet mean it's a tough question because basically like I'm interested in like instead confuse me and things that make me need to listen to it for thought time to understand it those are the things that excite me and I I've been you know trying to do music that like adheres to that in some way that's like maybe for the D distance looks really simple and then under closer and closer examination it kind of implodes or electron of like blank sideways so it's not clear when you know how that was made or you know just valuing things like distortion and overload or intensity or like physicality lower you know confusing interior and exterior spaces or like digital reverb in the real spaces instrumental confusion a bunch of different things like and would be things I've been interested in throughout and it's kind of constantly pursued I don't know it's a tough one does that get close to answering your question and I don't really know well it's it's it's it's just kind of interesting to hear yeah well it's it's just interesting to hear you bounce off of some of these ideas here I mean not that I expect you know completely just you know decided answer to that you know but just kind of a to get you to react to some of those ideas because it sort of brings me back to the painting idea that I was going to bring up earlier you know you're talking about you enjoying music and enjoying the creation of music that sort of has that disorienting property to it and has that kind of confusing property to it which kind of makes you go back and listen to it and and and look at it once again which reminds me of just kind of the act of looking at or enjoying a painting you know when exactly are you done looking at a painting per se you know I guess when you talk about the most modern time when the question when something's done and that's like a like a question you can't really teach her like you could Qing down and you know it's just like that's like personal taste and it's like something that I've always valued oh yes it's absolutely personal taste absolutely not tinkering throat you know endless because at the point where I like you can modify and perfecting and you suck the life out of them and I'm like you know I kind of come out of like no noise rock world and things like that are like me distorted overloaded slow tracked hey explain as a teenager I was rough kind of noisy things and I think that still kind of keeps some time length of that in my work and where you can make everything like perfect and like add 400 players with chamber strings or whatever there's a point where like the 300 like becomes the death knell of that piece you know but 299 is the perfect amount I don't know it's like simply can't really pin down and put you you know it's like she's got basically and I think oh I mean again absolutely it totally comes down to personal taste you know just kind of the weird thing in the case of music is that it's almost as if the runtime of whatever you're listening to is implying to you when you're going to be done listening to it you know you could always start it over again but you know you can't sort of sit there at one single point in the song and just kind of enjoy that one moment forever I mean it's going to pass you by at the pace that it's going to pass you by and the only way that you can kind of reach mmm that would be an interesting form of listening where people could just loop some 22nd thing and extend that in infinity you know or more than engaged from the playback it could be really great actually so if they feel like there's some zone so I ask them like have like a chords meant that some artist makes you know Jesus was amazing if they should have done like 15 phases of that and yet it disappeared the second it arrived and it's like an interesting question of like where's listening and playback and just appreciating music and it goes back to like really to Glenn Gould and sixties imagine this form of home listening where the listener would sit and splice tape on his own and create like new fragments out of Nina possible music pieces that are being performed in whatever I mean it's kind of like a I guess it's kind of a problem that something like minimalism kind of finds the solution to you know if you like this one particular sound if you like this one particular idea here it is in this musical piece that kind of you know repeats an idea to infinity with very minimal progressions from the beginning to the end trying to I guess explore this one single sort of concept and and that's something that definitely and you know influences what you do correct I mean you know I'm sure there are minimalist composers and producers who you find a lot of uh I guess uh who you get a lot from you know in terms of inspiration or just enjoyment yeah like I'm really interested in front of the repetition that like sound like incantation that seemed like shamanistic camp would seem like our forms of like psychedelic dissolution of the south you know versus the obvious ones of repetition that seem like a full bar like computer software just routine something's been out it's like hard to like you know it's hard to put your finger on what those forms of repetition or life transcendental and what are like really like the Machine just repeating and it's like life is like and it's a tough one but yeah I'm like definitely I come out of like minimalism in some ways like part of one of the streams of things that I'm interested in it's like early forms of deep like hypnotic overloaded repetition that was almost religious before I became like kind of like almost the veneer of capitalism or something but it did in the 80s and I mean yeah and for you personally I guess you know I sort of a it's it's an interesting point you're just made there because you know you're talking about making synthetic music making electronic music where you could just easily have the Machine repeat sort of whatever you punch into it very easily but you're trying to create I guess more of an organic experience with these machines essentially is sort of what you're talking about you know how do you kind of make sure that that human touch comes through in what you're doing even though you're using sort of sound I'm not really defending like human touch so there's a trainer there I'm not really interesting like defending the humanity and notions like I like them I don't really care so much like using tools or like coldness or like inhuman this like I I use machines I repeat things using like tools and I do like use a bunch of different approaches and like how sometimes like I do like to confuse that like whatever you want to call human touch versus an inhuman and I like to you know like one of the things like I asked these singers and this album looks like pretend you like dead or pretend your robot you know and just what would that be like you know I don't know how human like whatever you want to call the human is constituted in that but it's like hopefully hopefully an interesting take on it I don't know but for me whenever someone says like humanity I just think of like the National Geographic like them you know diet type of the world I don't know well okay it seems like the way that you're explaining it you know you don't want it in your art down to something as kind of defined as humanity or something with as much baggage as humanity yeah you would much rather it be kind of more abstract than that yeah just playful you know I don't a plane opens up a third a third sex whatever a new gendered space you know a whole bunch of things that I want to get out of that I find one I use calculus murders allowed but like just spaces that are free and liberated and playful um we are employing I don't know if it succeed in making when you look right back up that's what I aspire to all right I want to thank my guest Tim Hecker for coming on and talking about not only his creative process experimental and ambient music and his latest record loves streams which we will link you to down there in the description box Tim I appreciate you taking the time to come on and just be really open about about all of this and just talking about your music can I call you Tony you can call me an and okay really nice to meet you pleasure thanks for sure wait Cali it but alright have a good one good alright have a good day 
vruPJVIfa2s,hello sir do you have a minute to talk about Jesus Christ hey everyone I hope you're doing well it's Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd you know who it is by now and it's time to review the new parquet courts record human performance parquet courts they are a Brooklyn indie rock outfit this is their fifth full-length album I was really anticipating this record because I enjoyed the teaser tracks Plus with each new album the band is always trying something at least a little different so and with this new LP over here we are getting a mixed bag of some garage rocks some 90s indie rock and a little bit of art punk as well a little bit of wire coming through on the very raw and minimal and repetitive and just very simple instrumentation and riffs and maybe a little bit of silver Jews from the sincere and very frank and personal lyrics that are kind of poetic and what gear the band is in sort of depends on the track whether or not they're doing something left field or left or field a long six minute kind of hypnotic jammy Rock instrumental or just like a simple one-minute weird detour there's just a lot going on here what can I say right from the opener of the album we have the song dust which is not a metaphor Andrew Savage is literally singing about dust and I actually like this song a lot I thought it was a pretty clever song subject and the way that mr. savage sings about this dust on this record how its kind of coming in through the door through the window it's all around him it's piling up it's pretty oppressive and his deadpan delivery on the song I think lends a lot of weight to what he's singing about I also like the steady doom doom doom sort of guitar bass and drum groove on the track some keys are added in as well for a nice touch the title track on here is a surprisingly tender moment very sad very dreary lyrically the song seems to dive into some sort of nostalgia nostalgia for better days it seems almost as if mr. savage here is sort of in limbo between two points where a relationship was great and a relationship has been fully dissolved but I'm not totally sure about that as occasionally his Liris can read as a little obtuse but still that does not keep liens on here about sort of living in darkness or what have I done and who have I done it to from being painfully depressing also in this song out of nowhere a very airy grainy flew so low that I thought was a pretty nice touch and this is one of several moments on here where all of a sudden a piece of very nice guest instrumentation where arranged instrumentation will just pop up and add a little bit of refinement amendment the song outside is a piece of lazy but very clever slacker rock and in true slacker rock fashion it ends at the 1 minute and 45 second mark and I also enjoy the equally short I was just here which is a track that seems to be about the fast paced living of New York City and how rapid change can be being in a place that is always evolving can kind of give you this sense of just not being able to become familiar with your surroundings and that sort of seems to drive mr. savage crazy on this track in a way where he sounds very neurotic and on edge the lyrics on this track come to a head when it sounds like he wants to go out for some Chinese fried rice or something and in the place where he got that Chinese fried rice is just like no longer there I was just here I was just here the groove on this track sort of seems like it's pulled out of the very herky-jerky Gang of Four playbook now life in New York City in this very busy urban area seems to inspire quite a bit of the lyricism on this record although on the song one man no city the band delves into what seems like an isolation fantasy of some kind where the instrumental is super jammy super in the moment a little repetitive kind of has like a Velvet Underground white light/white Heat vibe to it and believe me that this is one of many moments on here where it seems like these guys are really really pulling from that vu catalog the track gets slightly tedious at 6 minutes although I will say when it comes to repetition and when it comes to Lin you're very groovy rock music I think what parquet courts are doing here is world's better than what they were doing on sunbathing animal it seems like they've worked in more changes more nuances there's more tension in the instrumentation we kind of change sounds and locations on the song Berlin got blurry where we have these twanging guitar leads that seemed almost like Country or Western inspired it's kind of interesting here so many different flavors of guitar music coexisting on the same album so harmoniously whether it be the psyche rock passages or the very dreary ballads like on the song keep it even or the very aggressive and intense cuts such as two dead cops we're lyrically this is like the most mayhem that Savage delivers on the entire album but most seriously an emergency moment with bullets flying and people dying as he tries to put into poetry this really chaotic occurrence set to the soundtrack of these noisy ask guitars the ending on here was a little bit of a snoozer but generally I liked the album I think this is the most I've enjoyed parquet courts since light up gold on this album I think they're doing a better job of channeling their influences and the experimental ideas I think they've been employing for the past several albums and EPS they put out they're going over better and they're sounding more fulfilling over here and I think the lyrics have seen a noticeable improvement as well but parquet courts I still feel like they're yet to kind of carve out their own style or niche they're drowning in their influences a little bit on this album and they pull a little too frequently I think from The Velvet Underground playbook occasionally we have a so-so instrumental and occasionally I think the lyrics on here don't quite pack the emotional or the abstract or absurd punch I think they were going for but still this is a good record if you're looking for an artsy a punky a weird a visceral but also thoughtful and cerebral rock album I would definitely recommend this I don't think this is going to be one of my favorite rock records of the year but parquet court sound closer to making that than they have in a while I'm feeling a decent seven on this transition now if you get in this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you two best you the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die parking courts human performance forever 
bfsooZS6v50,living drama-free cuz it's the way to brat hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's cringy assured and it's time for a review of the new Deftones album Gor highly requested review here guys this is the eighth full-length album from California alternative metal outfit Deftones still going strong after 20 years long after the shelf life of the alternative metal in the new metal trend that they were sort of born out of which goes to show the band was more than just the era that they came from because since their critically acclaimed records in the late 90s in the early 2000s they had gone on to put out some pretty experimental material by their standards like the very shoegaze II Saturday night wrist or koi no yokan I've reviewed that record not too long ago and there were some kind of dreamy pop elements to it also frontman chino moreno has been involved in a couple of different out there side projects palms which has more of a post rocky edge to it or crosses which is kind of electronic but Deftones have had their uninvent Eurus moments as well i don't care too much for their debut also their 2010 album Diamond Eyes I just did not like and all just seemed like one of the more commercial records in their discography really flat one-dimensional overproduced red to me almost like the band trying to squeeze the last few drops of blood from the alternative metal sound that was more interesting five years before the album had actually come out and honestly in the greater scheme of Deftones discography I can't help but see Gore is just on the more unimaginative side of things I will say I do think it is better than Diamond Eyes that record I just could barely stand it I do think there's a little more finesse and nuance to what Deftones are doing on here but this record still features the I guess those certain quirks and character traits about Deftones music that I have never really cared for too much just I don't know exacerbated to a point where I can barely stand them like the huge listening over compressed sand just so thick and merciless guitars whose tone really just kind of loses its flavor after not too long very quickly loses flavor and then of course Deftones heap on the angst on top of these guitars which usually come through in the mone vocal style which is pretty much a trademark for them at this point the band just continues to force as hard as they can these angry but also very vulnerable emotions into the same box and it's such a sick and tired cliché at this point I was sick of this when bands like stained did this or bands like cold did this and I don't think Deftones is much more artful with it sure the band is a little more Spacey and post rocky they might throw in a riff with a five four time signature they might do their best to come up with these contrasting pieces of instrumentals where all of a sudden you have this explosive chorus coming right after these dingle-dangle guitar passages that are just soaked in reverb and echo I get that they have a little more nuance but it is just as melodramatic as any number of bands that did this very same thing but cheaper and more donk obvious so not only does this album just not do anything for me emotionally but I'm not that impressed with the writing either like the song acid hologram the guitar passages on here I've never heard so many non ideas one after the other the song continually changes in each riff each idea it shifts into is as bad as the one before it not only that but there's almost no gelling between the instrumentation on this track because the guitars are mixed so loudly you could barely make out the bass barely make out the drums the only other thing that pops out are the vocals and the only reason why they pop out is because they have this very awful sharp either chorus effect or just additional harmony added to them that makes them almost unbearable but this is just one of a couple tracks on here that from beginning to end I just cannot stand much of the time we are getting moments like the opener on here where we're getting these space verses which explode into these super dense super compressed super loud choruses but not because they're very bassy or very heavy but because everything in the mix is condensed so much that I don't know there's not really a volume that you could play it at where it doesn't sound like it's blaring and while the verses I guess are nice breathers and breaks from these oppressively loud moments on the record I don't really care to hear Chino Moreno band just vocally explore with these melodies that it sounds like he's just coming up with them off the top of his head why he would even write any of this stuff I don't know because it just seems so effortless for him at this point because he's just playing into his comfort zone so much as he's singing on these tracks and often his vocals during these moments sound so quiet and distant in the mix I don't know just kind of a weird placement I guess in a way I can appreciate that it sounds like the band is living up to the standard they've set so far but these mellower moments just don't do anything for me in fact when I listen to them and try to read into the lyrics they usually come off as pretty melodramatic now there are harder and heavier more aggressive spots on here like the song doomed user which features this groaning descending ATAR if it sounds like electrical transformers all exploding and falling on top of one another or a piece of heavy machinery malfunctioning and then there's the title track Gore which is pretty intense as well but on a lot of these songs chena really tries his best to match the aggression of the instrumental by reaching up into this super raspy I guess part of his voice and whenever he does this the band and their producer sees fit to throw this really awful filter on his voice that makes his voice sound super tinny and super thin which only makes the just really unpleasant no question i I could have been mosh into some of this shit 15 years ago but but now now it's doing nothing for me guys it's doing nothing for me I'm sorry you know I know that you you guys wanted me to review this record you were like Anthony Fantana he's got to love the new Deftones record he's got to love it it's the best thing the bed's come out with yeah it's amazing he's gonna give it a 10 he's gonna say its greatest Deftones I'm of all time he's gonna say the band has returned to form it's so artsy it's so ah the emotions are so powerful to me and the guy that's just hitting me in my soul and haha I'm sorry guys it's just not happening you know the more I listen to this record the more insane it drove me the more I don't know how mad it made me in a way by my sixth or so listened to this thing I felt like a volcano about to pop lava everywhere houses destroyed forests on fire no one is happy except for volcano scientists because they could observe the volcano mmm the more I think about this record it just makes me shudder because again the the the singing the production the guitars the writing the melodramatic lyrics it's it's so angsty it's so trying to be vulnerable it's so trying to be angry very little of it is memorable or catchy to me and and what does come off here as memorable I don't want to remember it because it does not sound good to my my ear holes I'm sorry y'all I again I can appreciate that this is like deaf sort of you know meeting that standard I guess of what Deftones fans would probably call quality but this just has nothing for me I'm feeling a light too decent for on this transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die don't want that to happen Deftones gore forever 
fn6CgvrVAmw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tim Hecker record loves streams experimental electronic music artist Tim Hecker here with his new full-length album the follow-up to 2013's virgins my favorite album of that year and I recommend that you check out that record and any number of albums from his very deep back catalog now this album virgins was also compounding a lot of the very apocalyptic and sharp dark and painfully sad sounds that were coming from his previous record as well raid death 1972 both albums collectively could soundtrack the end of the world now loves streams though definitely brings a change of pace at least for the first half of the record this album by comparison seems a little fuzzier exists more on a synthetic plane it's a little more heavenly ethereal warmer and also with this record we see the addition of vocals and not just like you know a lead vocalist and we're getting some kind of you know lyrical message or narrative here nothing like that we're getting vocals as more of an abstract sound purely as an instrument we're getting harmonious choral group vocals which are very smooth and gentle or like in the case of the song violet monumental number two we're getting what seems like strange sampled vocal manipulations all layered on top of one another for a really disorienting effect and if there's another thing about this record that I noticed sort of a trend that pops up here and there is that there are occasionally these really loud jutting heavy bass e synth leads and phrases that just really stab so far outside of the very light ethereal drones occurring in the background and it kind of reminds me of the occasionally disjointed synth work that you might catch in the music of OneNote Rick's point never or Daniel lopatin which isn't too surprising considering that Daniel and Hecker not too long ago put out a collaborative record Tim usually seems like the the kind of artist to keep his contemporaries close at his side especially considering that fellow experimental and ambient music artist Ben Frost is collaborating with him on this record once again Tim also returns to Iceland for the recording of this album - and it would seem that all the elements of the previous equations that made Tim hacker's music so great they're here but this album just isn't as enthralling as Tim's recent work in my opinion and it's it's for several different reasons one I think a lot of the songs on this record fail to reinforce one another in any significant way leaving a lot of the tracks here feeling is if they are just lone islands or motifs or vignettes rather than an overall album and overall piece which is something I enjoy quite a bit about many Tim Hecker records and I think part of this disconnect is due to a lot of the weak endings and segues on these songs right from the start the track Obsidian counterpoint the track certainly starts off with a bang or at least I guess as much of a bang as you could expect from a Tim Hecker album those punchy bass e synth phrases I talked about being matched up with these woodwind leads and then as these progress there is a growing wall of synth layers that they're all kind of swimming in and then eventually all of this heavier more pungent instrumentation just fades away and just gives way to a very mild drone that for a moment almost sounds like it's just going to fade out it really kills the momentum of the track which I know sort of sounds weird when you're talking about this type of music but one thing I've always enjoyed about Tim Hecker's music is that despite it being so vast and so abstract it usually has a very strong sense of direction and pace to it not so much here I think the last third of this track is really just a lot of compositional dead air the song music of the air sort of fails to progress in any meaningful way as well once the song reaches a certain point of peak layers of instrumentation with vocals and layer after layer of very treble e thin synthesizers and some groaning bass and while progress is one thing there are some moments here where I feel like all the respected pieces of instrumentation within a given track fail to line up sort of like on the track of Bee Gees dream I'm not pronouncing that correctly I'm sorry the textures are pretty but the song mostly seems to consist of these several improvised or semi-improvised synth layers that just do not complement one another and then the track just dissipates I guess due to lack of direction I think the first legitimately enthralling moment on the record is violent monuments parts one and two the very bright droning synthesizers on this track and the very ghostly vocal edits come together into something that's both beautiful and kind of scary and there are these very subtle alterations to the music as the track progresses along to keep the intensity up the track sounds like it's haunted by poltergeists or something but then with this song like many others on here we reach a point where it sounds like the instrumentation is just fading to black but not quite so that it's just suddenly over it's kind of this weird middle-of-the-road fade it's like Tim wants the track to be over but it's not so quiet that it's going away but it's not so loud that it's kind of in the forefront of my mind and the second part of this two-part piece I guess I enjoy more in theory than I do in practice there are some very hypnotic synth layers here that are hitting this kind of skipping groove pattern and then all of a sudden these lumbering Basie woodwinds come in and just Hulk and stomp their way through this ambient sense scape but after a while even though I think these two textures together are interesting musically I just don't see a lot here complementing each other I think compositionally these elements are a little mismatched and the track loses steam because of it and here we actually have a song that just suddenly fades out of nowhere it's just done and again we're just kind of left with one track that does not connect meaningfully to the next track in the track listing on the song castrati stack Tim Hecker brings back some sounds that feel like they would have fit a little better into the album we are getting these glistening synth layers once again matched with some harsh just sudden sporadic distortion the vocals that have been so prominent thus far on the album are worked in again and it's it's a it's a winning combination it functions at least for this part of the album and even though I think Tim is pulling back to his previous record a little bit here this part of the album is indicative of a trend or progression in the album itself because the last several tracks here in comparison with the beginning of the album are kind of dark the song voicecrack following this is even more textured where rather than harsh shots of distortion we kind of had these glitchy what sounds like guitar samples just move a lot gargling or just hurting and jerking unpredictably over this very smooth synth scape it's pretty brain tingling and so not a deterioration is exactly that it sounds like many of the sonic elements featured previously in this album are kind of just melting away or becoming more sour more dissonant it's at this point on the album that I'm recognizing a theme it seems like the songs are connecting a little bit better but with the track black phase I mean to me this is just another unfinished moment in the album here as it suddenly fades out like many other tracks previous to it this record just did not feel as fully fleshed out as Tim Hecker's recent work and for a good part of the album it seemed almost as if to me that Tim was recycling a lot of the same sounds and textures over and over again just to kind of create this very gauzy aesthetic for this album above them I mean on the fourth track here I almost had a deja vu moment it was almost as if I was listening to the three tracks previous to it but sort of at a different angle or something unfortunately I just did not really get that much out of this album you know I hate to feel this way this was one of my most anticipated records of the year and Tim has made some of my favorite electronic music albums experimental albums ambient if you want to throw that label on to it and I think there are some good compositional moments here too it's just that very few here glide into the next in a cohesive way or stick the landing when they finish momentum is never kept up the dots are never completely connected I think the warmer sonic aesthetic of this record and the vocals were certainly enough to bring a nice sonic change of pace to Tim's progression here it is discography but this record just did not seem as compositionally meaty as I've known his work to be in the past I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this album Tran transition have you given this album a listen if you have did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Tim Hecker loved streams click on some over here the subscribe button the website go check out another review over here click on something Willia have a nice day bye 
GlAsfhqp7E8,uh hey everyone send any pie tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new baby metal record metal resistance now this review you may have already noticed in the time stamp is super long I'm sorry about that it is a collaborative review with the one the only anime critic otaku gonzo journalist he labels himself as mr. dizzy bro and I don't know whenever I talk to this guy I feel like we're just talking for 15 minutes but it ends up being for just a very long time and we just go into this babymetal record and we talk about its pros its cons we give a little background on the band and we just have a good fun conversation which is totally uncut very casual so you know if you're into some j-pop metal fusions then kick back get a snack relax just you know kind of play this in the background a little bit as we you know sort of converse and shoot the shit over this baby metal magic and yeah we're going to leave it at that and also a bit of a shirt change to transition and here we are via the magic of the internet with a co review of this new baby record with my dude digi bro hey dreaming thanks likely stuff this new baby record Tiffany said record oh my god sorry fuck a fuck good ol baby metal yeah okay uh I thought it might be helpful for you to bring on someone so some weeaboo who could shed context into what the hell a baby metal is you know someone who looks like you'd listened to babymetal coming on the show wait let me redo that whole intro okay so okay we redo that whole thing the transition and here we are with a babymetal review yes my dude dizzy bro we're going to be exploring this album via the magic of the Internet here with a Google hangout I do admit I am doing great glad to be here to be your resident weeaboo and help to explain what babymetal is everything's been going good since the podcast we you know yeah podcast with you went over really well and yeah a since nine I was accused of cutting you off a lot so I'm gonna try to let you finish your sentences that podcast was about you that podcast was titled over you yeah that's that's how I felt about it too so you can interrupt all you want in that context if you interrupt me here I will kill you don't even don't even think about it don't anything about disagreeing with me either so don't worry your to reinforce every single thing I think it'd say so alrighty okay um but before I get into uh your thoughts on this record you you're a fan of this project I imagine you approached me wondering if I had heard the the record if I was coming over viewing the record and I assume that sort of came from some kind of enthusiasm you have you nosey azzam might be a good word I don't know a fan is I am very interested in this project like in the fact that it's getting so big in like a worldwide way like I think this might be like the biggest act out of Japan right now like they're playing shows all over the world touring the United States they just did a show on Colbert's show yeah the other night um so I'm more excited about this from the perspective of like this weeaboo anime guy who you know sees a lot of Japanese bands and sees a lot of bands of this nature the sort of idol group type things and like would never have expected one to be on American television you know so I don't I don't know if I'm a fan of their music per se I like some of their songs but I'm definitely interested in the how far this project has come and and and the reactions of people like you like music critics in the US I'm I'm extremely curious about how you would feel about this album uh at first it kind of interesting to see people kind of simultaneously recoil at what they were doing great while also there was another group of people that just thought it was the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of music oh and and and I kind of feel like I avoided their debut record simply because avoided reviewing it that is because it just kind of felt like it wasn't something that was genuine as much as it was just kind of created and masterminded to elicit those kinds of reactions but this time around it seems like the surprise factor is kind of gone and that people can kind of judge it and listen to it for what it really is it's not like this weird surprising thing anymore you know sort of what babymetal is setting out to do is very kind of clear and very obvious at this point so you know they're not going to be hitting you with that left hook on this new record so I figured I would kind of give it a shot and also my decision to review this was was also because of a lot of what you just said um it doesn't just seem to kind of be a one-trick pony or you know a gimmick that's kind of here and it's gone with this new sophomore album over here the group has sort of seemed to just hold on to some kind of legitimacy it seems like a lot of people who enjoyed their debut record um you know didn't just kind of think of it as this passing joke and thought you know actually I kind of want to hear this again but I can go for another round of this yeah I love that you brought up the the feeling of it being like manufactured and everything because that's like what kind of what I find the most interesting about the project coming to the u.s. especially that it's a metal project because I I know I know you and your taste in metal is generally more like you tend to like something's very raw and like feels like it's very the guys needed to make this it's like something that had to be created something like very original and this is like the opposite of that almost the entire system that it's totally manufactured and put together and I think that here in the US like we kind of have a stigma against like manufactured pop stars where you know people who are really into music tend to be like I can't stand all that that let design by committee stuff you know and they try to hide it pretty well people who are like Lady Gaga fans for instance will always say like she writes her own music and that's what makes her special it's like he writes her own lyrics she doesn't like compose the sounds you know but there's like such a worship of that and I think in Japan there's not really that much of a stigma in that way and this this band comes very much from Japanese idol culture which is like where they just find young girls like talent agencies all over Japan just finding young girls putting them in groups together and making them sing you know and there's like hundreds of idol groups in Japan it's it's such a huge like market and you know all the girls in babymetal were originally just regular idols like from like when they were in middle school like the lead singer all three of them started when they were 11 um and they were like 14 by the time not even 14 like what 13 or something by the time babymetal started that they're a bunch of children you know but they've sort of already become like seasoned idols uh and then obviously some music composers some Japanese metal composers who wanted to write some songs and slap some cute girls on them we're like hey let's put this band together and like that seems kind of normal for a Japanese band so then to see the u.s. react to it so positively is definitely reflects like a changing of the way people think about like extreme music or you know metal music like you know the kinds of guys who I expect to be at metal shows or the guys who are like yeah I liked him back before they were cool you know and then here we have you couldn't have liked him before they were cool because it's the it was designed by committee to be cool everything in your room just got really dark and really red all of a sudden you have noticing that I don't know what happened something there got really devilish just all of a sudden I don't know why okay well very strange I think um I think the reason they've taken off over here is for several different reasons I mean as much as American music acts do try to avoid sort of that look in that feel of being manufactured uh I do think that you know Westerners enjoy a novelty every round then especially the metal scene you know even though metalheads do take metal seriously they're always down for a good joke - yeah um metal sucks is the name of one of the biggest metal sites exactly they're they're into good tasteful metal satire and I think your average metal fan can pick up on the artistry and the technical ability that goes into a lot of the production behind these songs because there's certainly some really flashy guitar soloing and playing and compositional work going into these tracks even if they are topped with these you know sort of Japanese idol singers so there's definitely an element of artistry to these tracks and I think instrumentally as a general music fan not even a metalhead would pick up on some of the quirks and the personality and the intentional comedy that comes up in some of these tracks I mean there's one cut here that I mark down the song a GJ exclamation point where there is a lone cowbell hit that just but it won't the track just like all the guitars all the vocals everything is silent for that split second there's a dunk and then they go right back into the thunderous riffs I didn't even notice them but that's fantastic what could you catch on the song um uh what is it takes of destiny's or something hailing on tales of the destinies I think as you has that track all of a sudden there's that weird jazzy piano break that comes out of nowhere yeah you catch that I might have yeah so so there there are some elements of I think a little tongue-in-cheek humor here no I mean it seems like these guys know metal and they appreciate metal and they understand metal but they know that they're not making a serious metal project so as a result it seems like they're trying to have as much fun with it as they can you know it's not like a serious serious metal album and as a result I think I think it works yeah well the funny thing too is that a lot of the people who are like the songwriters on this are like this is their more mainstream sounding stuff like as I know that one of the the lead writers on for this band is the the main guy from coal tar of the deepers which is like a long-running shoegaze band that was always super experimental all their albums I'm totally different from both each other and anything else I've ever heard really and that guy also did for my anime fans out there who probably the only ones who know what I'm talking about there's an anime series called sayonara zetsubou sensei and it had this really bizarre like metal album tie-in where they had all the voice actresses for the show like sing over these really heavy metal songs and they had the singer Otsuka kenji who is from like some more legendary Japanese metal bands like you know doing like shouted vocals while these girls are backing him up that albums a lot more experimental than the babymetal stuff it's more like coal tar of the deeper sound but um I highly recommend it especially if you're into babymetal look up the album kaku Denbo from sayonara zetsubou sensei but like so this guy's done this kind of thing before where he's worked with like having like a like cute girl singers over his music and then like some of the babymetal songs you can definitely hear his influence I would say track 3 on here um let me look up the name real quick I was ah my favorite fever that one sounds very like like coal tar of the deeper sounding and that one actually though is like co-written by the bassist from MADD capsule markets who are sort of popular um again long-running Japanese metal band that's very experimental so like yeah it's almost like these guys they know the genre is so inside and out that like this is them like on their relaxed today you know and they're just like they could just jam out some really structured like pop metal you know as opposed to the kind of weird experimental shit that they would get up to in their own time yeah and I mean the production is super tight and and even though it does feel manufactured and it is really poppy the the music is excuse me the music is really visceral you know I mean the Akhtar riffs and the drums all have a really great groove to them so it is kind of an exciting very physical listen and I think the vocals topped onto a lot of these tracks I add a really nice element of metal add a nice element of melody you know - he's just really a I don't know some of these riffs have kind of a new metal feel to them yeah I would definitely say karate is like a new middle it sounds like 2002 you know yeah it's like you know what like when I hear some of these new metal riffs I do kind of wince a little bit because it reminds me of like you know and would not forget get down what to say look I know how much you I know how much you hate disturb oh really just like my least favorite new metal band but you know also like you know a little bit of waiting me up inside you know there's all that going on it's a little new metal it also reminds me a little bit of like metalcore sometimes you got a metal thing going on with some to thousands metalcore and a little bit of like you know let the body should don't floor like that kind of shit to like some jump the fuck up like hot riffs pop up here and there I believe it I can't remember it might have even been on uh our Dava fever where there's you like this this lone vocal that pops up and there's like yo burnin Iron Man yeah we're bored sometimes it's just go over words but the there are parts here where I feel like they do something completely jest off their rocker no it wasn't Howard Amma fever I would AMA fever was a track that I like for another reason that was the track that had the break beats in the bass the almond break all of which is like often uh like metal guitars and break beats usual a combo I stay far far away from sort of in in this context of this weird j-pop new metal fusion I think it kind of worked because at least in my head I was like yeah this is about like the level of seriousness that I think these kinds of guitarists should be allotted so sort of soso in the context of this kind of fun melodic catchy novelty metal album I thought it worked and on the song Yahveh uh you had kind of those upstroke ska guitars in the mix I was very odd in common so so again part of the reason I think this album might get a pass of the metal community is there are some like really weird eccentric quirky risks and ideas that they take in the instrumentation here that if you know you're listening past the the manufactured element of the album the singers the the look of the singers and I guess the aesthetic of the project and the group um there's some interesting things going on yeah although I would say um with this album I feel like it's it's a lot more focused on being like a metal album where a baby metal one which I haven't listened to as many times but uh like it had a lot more of that like pushing the idol element like their first big track which was a doki-doki morning where I'm like like late 2011 was like super going between like metal and then like totally idle you know and just having these really poppy moment so it's sort of like a maximum the hormone type thing I don't know if you've ever listened to them but uh before people if people have recommended them to be in quite a few times they're pretty wild I'm a I'm a big fan of them of their Bowie kakazu album but uh in any case like I I kind of like that sound the most like my favorite babymetal song is like gimme chocolate where it's very like focused on this being this like weird cute girls singing over metal thing because I think that is a sound we don't have a lot of in existence already we're like that's what makes it so like jarring and interesting and unique whereas with this I turned red again and the Sun but uh with this album more of it is like straight-up just metal songs that have a like a female vocal on them you know I guess opposed to being an idol song over a metal song it's just a metal song with a cute girl who happens to be the singer you know it feels like it's more power metal than then than before as well definitely I think those power metal moments those moments where the project does kind of sound like a little Dragon Force influenced or kind of like Iron Maiden roots well the first song is Dragon Force her mainly insane thought that are both on it absolutely um and that that's actually one of my favorite tracks is that track on a more and the song no rain no rainbow uh these are three of the most melodic tracks on the record I mean no rain no rainbow isn't even really truly a metal song until the very end of the track up until that point it just kind of feels like a Japanese pop ballad because it is just very vocal driven there aren't really any electric guitars making their presence known until there's really bright melodic solo after like a verse and a chorus or so these tracks are some of my favorites to me there's some of the most tasteful on the record um but then once we get into some of those more new metal infused tracks like I can go either way sometimes they go over really well sometimes they just seem kind of gross to me and I don't want to have anything to do with them it um and then then there's a but those aren't even really like uh also I do want to make note of the song sis anger which I sort of wonder if that's kind of a take on Metallica Saint anger I was wondering that too I think that's probably what it's in reference to I mean the track did seem like it had kind of a thrashy element to it so I could have seen that being the case and some listened with the last record they saw quite a bit of success so they had more leeway to just like go crazier and have more fun into more risks than just make this album more metal you know um even though uh it seemed like the last album was more of an idol album it seems like they really kind of turned up the metal elements on this record whether it be because of a personal artistic desire or to just kind of enhance the fact that this project is all about really just two worlds kind of clashing here you know so let's make this record metal as funk as we think you have these Japanese pop singers on top um and then uh and then there are a couple other tracks that to me were maybe my least favorites the song of meta taro I meta taro is very weird and I feel like it would have been cute as like a two-minute song but it goes on for a while and it just gets really old well I mean the reason the track failed is because it's it's literally a it's like it's like a Norwegian folk metal song yeah grand folk metal tune that I could hear I don't know something like korpiklaani playing yeah I'm not really a big folk metal fan to begin with but for this project it seemed like they were even more off the mark then but I would hate it painted but obviously that was kind of their nod to that and then the track from dusk till dawn that was maybe my at least my other least favorite as well because I just didn't really care for the electronic fusion I actually didn't need to hear that one because if you don't have a paid Spotify account that song doesn't show up for some reason I don't know on Apple music and I have a paid Apple music account I needed to like pick the song up on iTunes to hear the full version of the song which region there's there's like five different versions of this album like depending on what country it's released in which is a very like Japanese thing to do but very weird in the modern internet age to have like the UK version has like six different songs the American versions um well they're not literally six different but like I'm looking at the the list right now and there's like the standard edition has a song called syncopation which is replaced by from dusk till dawn on the out of Japan Edition and then there's like there's the the song the one on the out of Japan version is all in English whereas the original has like Japanese vocals in it which you can find the original on their YouTube page um I think it's a little bit better just the lyrics I'm better in a TI Japanese using way too the song the one just kind of listening to the English lyric version it didn't really do all that much for me um not only because I didn't really care for the lyrics that much but I just feel like just having the song sung in Japanese just adds to the character of the project yeah um yeah that meta taro though like when I was listening to it I I couldn't shake this feeling that it like I expected excitement to look up a live version of this like after hearing it I was so confused by it and I was like I'm gonna be really disappointed if a giant meta taro doesn't like come out onto the stage because I was picturing is this as like guar score Gor we're in the start of the song they like Gor Gor and then it comes out of the song as some of those huge like chanting Viking angels when they're singing that uh Toto I'm like this is a summoning song they're trying to bring him up from the depths but that's not the case unfortunately I tried to like look up what this song is about some people think it's in reference to an Ultraman character named like ultra taro but I don't know it seems unlikely to be so I have no idea what it is it's so what were a couple of tracks that - you were like your favorites totally standouts um highlights on the record I would definitely say I would AMA fever was my favorite cuz again oh your microphone cut out again for some reason bringing it back bringing it back he's gonna bring it back all right I'm gonna sound different but it's okay that's fun oh I would AMA fever why did that track together um I like the use of the weird break beats and everything again it's very cold out of the deepers he would use he actually has used that same common break but um instead of a metal song it was a UH a shoegaze song like a really bizarre shoegaze song the head growling vocals on it for some reason on the penguin EP but um yeah it just it's it's so weird and like totally different and I didn't whereas a lot of babymetal songs again I feel like are just kind of generic metal songs with baby singing on it I would AMA fever does not sound like something you'd find on a normal metal album yeah besides that uh I don't know road of resistance is like an okay song but it gives me such a dragonforce vibe and I don't want to think about dragon fire I have a long terrible history with dragon forests so a long history with Dragon Force well I don't have such a checkered past when it comes to Dragon Force um you know I could sort of tolerate them for a little bit um but I I think they just sort of push it a little too far however um if something is Dragon Force ish and I feel like you know I guess they're not sort of pushing those speed metal guitars to the point where I want to throw up mom then I can enjoy it you know I don't see dragon force as so much a style as much as uh they're just pulling a style for many other metal groups I already know and they're just kind of taking all those elements and speeding them up as we were making the flash here and even more technical to the point where I can't even digest it um babymetal obviously though I wouldn't call them generic on this new record the production's um they definitely seem like they're putting in more effort more detail you know and while it is Dragon Force inspired it definitely they definitely pull a lot of influence from that um they didn't push it so far that it doesn't become like a pop record you know it's still a PI I just think that like with road of resistance I think what it's missing is like a really strong power metal hook where you'd get like um you know again I'm not into dragon forest because of a checkered past them but like I'm a huge fan of the Japanese band Galan arias who are sort of along these lines as well they're another like you know very technical power metal band not quite as like blistering as a Dragon Force and all their songs don't sound exactly the same but uh this like you know I think with power metal like having a big strong memorable hook is like a big part of that genre and and also having like a six minute guitar solo which this longest Mississippi as well but overall I think it's pretty pretty okay song I'd say my second favorite though is Yahveh that one's just a lot of fun and I like the I like the hook on that one and the in the random screaming Yahveh like the girls just randomly at an Oregon Gabba I'm like yeah yeah they had like a lot of weird quirky vocal moments on this thing especially on those tracks that had like the just like it just like the groaning nu metal riffs it seems like over those riffs like on tracks like karate um they would just have them do the strangest vocal stuff just like so on metal it is yelling like Sade yeah that's that's very Idol that just having been it's almost like a like like a hip-hop hype man like someone just yelling like yo yo in the background like that's the idol version of that okay but what what to you um were some of the low points on the record like songs that you just could not stand and Minotauro is definitely the one I like had to scam but I'm glad we agree on that I'm ready that's like a serious low point on there um I didn't like no rain no rainbow and the reason I didn't like I think my biggest problem with like this album and with babymetal in general this was true with their first album - is that like I just see it as in maybe this is a problem I have with pop music in general but like the layout of the album is so like open with the big epic song go right into the big single uh you know and then have a big dumb power ballad towards the end and then end on like another epic song and like no rain no rainbow just feels very token to me of like we had to have the the power ballad that the sad one you know and so here it is yeah I put the thought songs at the end dude right and like that's for me on every metal album that's the one I scared random saw unless it's like really great I actually do think like dragonforce is first album managed to have like a our ballad that I remember being like super memorable but um although I don't remember it now so I guess it's not that memorable but has been like 10 years since they uh as I listen to them but yeah I don't know it to me I was just like oh here we go it's the notes it's true as far as the structuring of the record it's very it's very blueprint you know I mean they're they weren't trying to really do anything different um but but I mean I I guess it's sort of I don't know it sort of comes with the territory of I think being the novelty project being the novelty album that it is yeah you know they're not going to try to do anything super weird or abstract or unexpected because ultimately at the end of the day this is a very pop it's very commercial project I would actually say despite the very clichéd sequencing of this record um again instrumentally and production wise I'm surprised they got away with as much as they did uh with this record considering that you know again it's an idol project it's a pop record it's a commercial record in a way it's a novelty album but then they were still able to work in I mean as even though it's not a great track it's my least favorite track I do appreciate how weird the song uh ro is um it did I agree I liked when I heard it I was like it's really cool that this is on here it's just not a good song it should have been like two minutes long it's another thing with Japanese like pop music is that I don't know what it is with Japan but their pop songs are always like four to five minutes long they're never like like we're in the u.s. you expect a pop song to be like two and a half to three minutes usually and it's like the total opposite over there they're always like full minute and a half verse chorus then a repeat of that and then another chorus and you end up with like four and a half minutes and a lot of them you're just like you could cut so much from this and it would be fine but if taro could be two minutes long and it'd be adorable uh instead it's like a trial yeah it is little bit of trouble so yeah I mean I do appreciate that that song is on the record it is a really weird moment it's something I'm surprised that they were able to incorporate into the album you know but there are other spots that I'm surprised they were able to incorporate and I enjoy them like the breakbeats on how Adama fever like the sky guitars on Yahveh like very heavy thrash riffs on says anger and honestly I guess I enjoy no rain no rainbow as just a ballad like I think it has some really sweet melodies even though they are a little cliched and I suppose it adds to the variety of the album yeah again this edition is kind of predictable but it's still one of my favorite tunes on here and I guess again it's kind of a track that to me is de-facto enjoyable because um it doesn't have all those growly new metal riffs on it so you know I'm not having my my adolescence haunt me as I'm listening to that song because I'm not like you know listening to this album or listening to a certain track here and having like Slipknot concert flash but I definitely think that starting riff on cut out a like really like it reminds me of he's oedema do you remember oedema yes yeah it like really brought me back to oedema why tonight I have like an ironic appreciation for the early two-thousands because I was a kid so I don't have to like remember being a ste and teenage I can just be like yeah all the songs kick-ass to me back then you know like that Ben I like there were moments on this record that kind of reminded me of like maybe a little Linkin Park or some Slipknot or like saliva or something like every bad post grunge and new metal band that I liked for a minute and then hated as soon as I hated less as soon as I like turned 17 Fran and got into other kinds of music like ever every one of those bands like I was I was reminded of on this project but again because of its novelty and its self-awareness and it's kind of tongue-in-cheek attitude I think it gets away with it at least a little bit yeah I definitely agree like you're saying how you're surprised what they got away with and like you know from the perspective of like I listen to weird music not here is that shocking but from the perspective of this was just performed on Colbert's show it's like whoa this is like mainstream music doing something this out there I don't know if you know this the babymetal opened for Lady gaga for like five shows on her tour which I was really upset by because I actually saw Lady gaga I saw her when she had Hatsune Miku on the east coast which Hatsune Miku's another fun weird Japanese act thing but uh I would have loved to see babymetal instead and I was like how the West Coast you bastards you know um but what were your thoughts on this record overall I mean did did you enjoy it as as a whole would you say um I I can't see myself listening to this whole album like in the future I could see myself just taking the tracks that I like and listening to them babymetal for me has always been like like the the five or so best songs are great and I find this kind of like twelve track hour-long pop metal thing exhausting to listen to so like for me if I want like hey I'm in the mood for babymetal I need like three YouTube clicks and then I'm like satiated you know like yeah I got gimme chocolate I got maybe ala dama fever and like a little karate and then I could just go on with my day you know yeah it's not really anything I need to hear a full album of either though I can see myself coming back to this record if maybe like four tracks had been cut from it yeah I think of four tracks have been cut from it I could enjoy it from beginning to end as as at least a novelty for you know I mean there's still a great deal of moments that I'm just like just like you know like my former new metal self is crying on the inside yeah I also wanted to that's though I'm like 10 when that song came out I was a huge Lincoln Park fan back then but I don't feel as guilty about it because I was really young and I didn't like I wasn't like angsty with the lyrics I just thought it sounded cool cuz it was heavy you know uh but um I wanted to talk about another band that sort sprung up as a result of babymetal called lady baby who is kind of the same concept but what they've done instead is it's like Idol mix with metal but the the three idols are two little girls and one giant bearded Australian white man who's dressed as a little girl who's like a rest like a professional wrestler dressed as a girl but with a full beard and he's doing the screaming vocals so it'll go between like full Idol and then he'll come honours be like a guru doll although I got it like and the songs are great so of like for me lady baby has kind of taken babymetal and done like what I wish they would do with it which is like really emphasize the idol and metal fusion aspect and they made it more like a I don't know it's almost I don't know how to describe it but it's it's kind of like this but but more pushing the weird angle um you know having a giant bearded white guy dressed as a little girl dancing with few little girls um they only have like four songs out but I've liked all of them so check them out if you're into babymetal give lady baby a try and you want to see this kind of concept further mutated yeah I just look on to the next extreme I mean I enjoyed the album but it's it's definitely kind of a passing infatuation yeah no I mean I'll definitely check out what babymetal do next because I know I'll get a giggle out of it and a few hummable melodies out of it and maybe just a little bit of new metal most nostalgia you know but they were probably like you know maybe only three tracks on here that I think I genuinely liked as metal and as pop songs whereas many of the other cuts while I may have enjoyed them slightly or I may have been or any of just like kind of like elements to them I still couldn't help but feel like this is just kind of gimmicky you know it's a fun gimmick and it's a gimmick that it seems like you know there's definitely like a lot of technical know-how behind but it's just kind of like you know it was just very kind of quick chewing gum flavor loss I think this is more of a like this is a band that that'll be more fun live and I'm I might go see them live because my cousins like a really big fan of babymetal so he's like let's drive all the way up to DC for hours to go see babymetal and I'm like I got nothing better to do cuz like I feel like seeing it with the cute girls on stage and like I just really want a mosh pit I really want a mosh to babymetal cuz like if I die in a babymetal mosh pit I'll know I like lived my life like it I died as I lived essentially so when you go to the concert give me your password and everything to your YouTube channel so I can upload a picture yeah yeah I'll be sure to do that so what are you gonna sclera suppose I'll put this clip up there what are you gonna score this uh album here I'm at well I was talking I thought you're gonna ask me what I was going to score your death oh if you died in a babymetal mosh pit I would score your death a ten out of ten oh that's great but this album itself I'm probably going to score a decent two strong six I can get some enjoyment out of it it's a fun record it's you know a novelty album don't expect too much from it uh you know other than a laugh but uh but you know that they kind of want you to laugh you know they want you to have fun to it and the guys who are producing it are clearly having fun doing it you know there are some moments that are incredibly that are in very bad taste I'm not sure if some tracks over here they wanted to go over as badly as they wanted them to but um overall I still think those tracks were at least kind of interesting to gawk at while they were on so so yeah those are kind of my thoughts in general about it I'd give it a light two decent five myself um just because like as much as I love the concept and again to gawk at it like you said or even you know sometimes to just enjoy it I think the fact that I can't see myself like listening to this all the way through again like I kind of had to make myself do it to make this review like I had to keep I would get tired around halfway through the album and be like okay I gotta finish it because I gotta talk about the whole I gotta talk about every song you know and then so yeah I can't give it above a five knowing that look at you you're such a you're such a picky critic it's true you're a tough critic dude I'm just I'm glad you seemed to enjoy the album cuz I was I thought maybe that my five was still gonna be me playing defense for the south I wasn't sure if you were gonna totally hate it or not so you know I feel like it's something that if you're really cynical it's super easy to hate it and and I feel like it was easy for me too and you might have seen me tweet about this you know I like put up a picture of the page where I was listening to the album and I was like Jesus give me strength yeah that's why I requested to be on I I uh you know because I first responded to that tweet I was like if you need a weeaboo to help with this just give me an office like you know I I felt like I had to like you needed some someone there to be next to you - like reassure you that this makes sense in some universes okay I feel like it was easier to hate it when I hadn't heard it you know but then after I listened to I was like okay you know it's a gimmick yes like that I had already understood but then once I started listening to the production and I started listening to some of those weird instrumental quirks and you know I started to pick up some of the stuff that they were blatantly referencing in metal music I was like okay you know these guys are in on the joke you know they're not just like maybe I would have felt that way about their last record but it didn't feel like they were just kind of blatantly ripping off metal music to make a buck you know it felt like they enjoyed metal and it felt like they were doing their best to make some uh some interesting instrumental bits here and and put together some tight very visceral production while still kind of holding true to the demand for this record to be sort of the Japanese pop album that it needs to be so it was a balancing act that I don't think always went over well on here but I think you know that they came out with their heads up for the most part and it's a mostly entertaining album alrighty well that was a long-ass review so we should warn us this is a weird-ass project so it's worth an intensive discussion I think I agree all right thanks for coming on man I appreciate your appearance over here we will link your YouTube channel down there in the description where if you didn't already know you can catch some pretty in-depth anime reviews and think pieces for mr. dizzy bro over here and yeah you you two best you bes might be dropping a couple rap mixtapes soon as well so check those out y'all head on over to my soundcloud digital on soundcloud I got some songs coming out so what we'll do a CO review of that - Oh that'll be awful all

ioQHqg2_GvU,hey everyone hey theny meet an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I don't want another mad villian album ever mad villainy as you may already know is the fantastic legendary collaborative hip hop record from producer mad villain and rapper lyricist songwriter MF DOOM I kiss my own personal copy of this record goodnight every night this album to me is one of the best rap records of the 2000s if not the best I've reviewed this record you can see my review where I go in-depth about the records awesome instrumentals and verses lyrics aesthetic but tragically Madlib and doom never saw fit to follow up this project though every year there's always rumors and there's always discussion and there's always just bated breath waiting for them to follow this record up and even though I love this album I think this is arguably the the best thing either of these two have done I do not want them to put out another I don't want them to follow it up if another mad villain album does show up of course my curiosity is gonna get the better of me but yeah I just don't really want it to happen and it's for a few different reasons one expectations are eye-to-eye a follow-up mad villain album is bound to be met with mixed reviews and even if a new mad villain album were to drop tomorrow it would still be seen as a second record as a follow-up as a sophomore album and typically music fans expect sophomore albums to be better improvements upon the debut and how on earth could a follow-up mad villain record be better than the original especially with time working against it and that is our second reason time the fans of this album have had over a decade to digest it it's had over a decade to influence countless other artists the impressions this album has left are long lasting and monstrous unmatched by most other albums including whatever album may follow this up the time that the fans have had with this record have strengthened the bond they have with it to the point where just a follow-up is not going to measure up and another reason that time is a factor is at the time that this album was dropped the sound that it had was boundary-pushing it was experimental it was refreshing it was challenging for doom and lib to come back and sort of rehash their previous glory days with a new record it just wouldn't be as refreshing I think my third reason for not wanting a follow-up mad villian record would be that there's just the possibility that there's nothing else to say doom and lib could have potentially communicated artistically everything they wanted to communicate in this collaboration and they don't really feel like there's anything else to explore the potential could have been exhausted I mean there is over 20 tracks on this thing and they're all very quality and Madlib did see fit to come through with like a mad villainy remix album where we are getting some alternate lyrical takes from doom and different instrumentals I think if doom and Lib had so much more to communicate through this project they would have communicated it five years ago ten years ago my fourth reason for not wanting another mad villainy record I think Doom in Lib were at their creative peaks at this moment in their careers and now they are not really now I love MF dooms music and I think he has plenty of underrated projects but he is not that consistent now Madlib I'm not so much worried about but what are we supposed to expect him to do as fans just kind of come back to this project and redo what he did before he strikes me as the kind of artist who was always on to the next idea always on to the next concept always always on to the next collaboration he's incredibly prolific and I think feeding those artistic drives and desires to do something new do something different take priority over trying to revive this mad villain project and my final reason for not wanting another Mad villain album ever is that doom and Allah don't need to do it both artists have already changed the face of hip-hop both are already well-known well-respected and they don't need to revisit the mad villain name in order to maintain that reputation plus I think the fact that this album is such a standalone piece allows music fans to continue to see this album and the mad villain name is kind of this ideal of musical perfection it's that perfect image and it's that wonderful memory that we have of this moment in time that even today when they may drop a so-so project when the names Madlib and MF DOOM come up or like ooh yeah yeah wow they're great they just whoo baby and I think this incredibly high watermark in both of their careers is part of what continues to fuel Mad Libs and MF dooms legendary status so why touch that why endanger it why endanger it all right let me know you think of this transition forever

zfDFz8OmgzE,whoa whoa oh my god hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new open mic and paul white collaborative record hell a personal Film Festival open mike eagle is a California rapper who you should know by now he's hilarious he's clever he's charismatic he's gentle he's kind he's loving he's so nice at this point you should have heard at least some of his previously released material rappers will die of natural causes Animal Hospital which is pretty good the music he's released with Hellfire Club dark comedy his last studio solo album which was fantastic my favorite of his so far and now this new collaborative record over here Paul White however I'm not as familiar with but seeing that he's teaming up with open mike eagle I'm game for anything and essentially on this album I just kind of see Mike Eagle continuing everything that has made him such a great artist up until this point while also taking a few risks to sort of keep things refreshing paul weitz production a lot of the time is as soft and Spacey and easygoing as Mike Eagles tone of voices it's a little off-kilter it's very sample intensive it's pretty simple and it's billed it seems at least on the surface usually the beats just have a very redundant build so Mike can kind of take over on these tracks lyrically but even though I guess there's not a lot of progression to these instrumentals Paul white does bring a lot of sonic variety to this production on the song protectors of the heat we have these weird communal tribal rhythms the track that I didn't see coming the hook on the song insecurity sounds like it was sampled from some disco flavored Yacht rock or something the song I went outside today featuring Aesop Rock has some soul samples with some dusty horns and glistening heavenly pianos woven in I like the very small and quirky beat on the track to check the warm nimble just somewhat robotic baseline and the hissing symbols are kind of cool and the schmaltzy whistles and pianos on the cursive hyper-vigilance are enjoyable as well I mean I think they match mics very playful personality DDD Mike and Paul just complement each other really well and Mike lyrically he's no slouch on this record he brings plenty of quotables some great topical tracks I really think he makes this project live up to the title where each song kind of feels like its own little story it's a little concept its own little narrative and yes these tracks are very personal with some very strong themes of death and insecurity and some of Mike's passionate thoughts on a myriad of social issues but as I mentioned earlier lots of quotables on this thing one at one of my favorite lines for the beginning of the record is trying to relive the days that I couldn't grab I looked up what Lena Dunham said and I shouldn't have opened Mike's verse on this track ends with a weird suggestion that we should use like camera satellite technology to spy on fire ants and keep tabs on fire ants because those little bastards and then he just goes and then his verse just ends I don't know why was there a fire ant attack similar to Kavanagh this record has kind of a very loose sort of unfinished very off-the-cuff very lightning in a bottle feel to it but I think this album benefits from it even more than that Cavanagh collaboration did I love the song check to check which I think was a very clever lyrical angle to take this song the idea of living check to check yeah sort of money check but Mike Eagle was talking about checking his email checking his phone checking his son's homework checking in checking out all these things he has to check there's a hilarious line in here about how he's just stuck to his cell phone and that he might as well get a big one and pretend that it's a freeway and get some exercise while he's at it there's a weird robotic voice diatribe at the end about how humans are sort of being taken over by the mechanical race I guess there's an odd track here with an incredibly sad instrumental where Mike Eagle essentially tells a story about guy who dies just hundreds of times over kind of living again and again and again kind of in a Bill Murray Groundhogs Day sort of way so he hits me with some surprisingly serious moments on here and and tracks that are I guess in a sense no less serious or the topic is no less serious but mike is able to approach it in a clever way with some comedy and make it I guess some cool food for thought like on the song smiling where essentially he's talking about how just going about his business day to day being out in public people don't smile at him because he is a black man and the white public that he's dealing with had this fear of black people like they're going to mug them or hurt them or kill them he even highlights an experience he had where a woman avoided eye contact with him because she must have thought he was a white person strangler and and I have been in this man's presence at least a few times so if he were a white person strangler he has had more opportunities than most have had to do that to yours truly on the song leave people alone Mike Eagle takes another political angle where at one point in the song he essentially just devolves into this semi wrap semi rant at anyone listening who doesn't know who their local government representatives are without sort of checking or looking it up it seems like the political and the social is really important to him on this record and not only that but just effectively communicating your causes and what you care about on the song insecurities he goes in about sort of caring about something and and and pushing ideas without being an asshole or being rude necessarily but then at the very end of the track it's almost like he takes everything he's made up until that point and just erases it throws it in the trash as he says never mind just don't even bother just lie you know just just lie I guess instead of caring or getting things done or being sincere just lie which I guess is kind of the track insecurities it's like he cares but he's not that confident in himself to sort of be shoving these ideas down people's throats on the track insecurities part 2 we see insecurity again being depicted but in a different light here open mike eagle seems to be surrounding himself with people with friends maybe with some alcohol to kind of hide himself away from the world who does not deal with the harshness of reality because there are some very alcohol drenched tracks on the back end of this project and it gets the most hilarious on the song drunk dreaming where essentially we have opened my Eagle pulling together a bunch of very weird surreal odd ideas and vivid dreams that are partially just him dreaming partially just drug influence we have dr. Martin Luther King telling him he's the man we have Obama a little Obama a very tiny Obama flying by on a drone so yeah this record is a lot of fun it's got a lot of character it's got a lot of personality and I think it's got an interesting concept to it some cool themes open mike eagle for the most part I think is really on point the production complements him consistently but there are some low points on this record I think the opener and a handful of other tracks on here too are just so Spacey so underwhelming that they don't really I guess engage me directly I think generally some of Paul's production here could have used a little more progression and could have used a little more punch a little more weight because sometimes they're just so easygoing that their presence just isn't really felt as open mike is just going absolutely insane on some of these instrumentals his flow is I think a little more expressive here than it has been in his past few records and then there is one moment here where open mike and paul white just go overboard on the song dang is invincible and I do like it when open mike does something eccentric does something loud does something in your face generally but this track I just had a hard time wrapping my head around no matter how many times I listened to it I just couldn't see it as anything more than sort of obnoxious and for sure I'm positive that that is their intention because it's just so grating but outside of those several moments I think this is a really cool rap record I enjoy it quite a bit another fun thought-provoking record from mr. Mike Eagle I'm feeling a decent of strong 7 on this thing transition have you given this open mike eagle record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you two best you the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe Orioles I open my Eagle have a personal Film Festival forever 
Q7PJ9zTAqQQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new explosions in the sky record wilderness this is the latest full-length LP from Texas instrumental rock band explosions in the sky who've almost been around for 20 years at this point now we have not heard from these guys in a full-length album capacity since 2011 s take care take care take care but they have spent the five years since then dropping several original soundtracks for a couple different movies and I wasn't sure when we were going to hear another album from explosions in the sky I wasn't that into their last full-length album I figured with that record they had squeezed the last dying breath out of this kind of third wave post rock sound twangy guitars slow basic chord progressions crescendos but now the band is back on their album grind and and sadly the nine tracks on this thing they are as slow and as tedious and mostly as predictable as I had expected but now just with a larger instrumental palette explosions in the sky definitely come back with a bigger instrumental presentation on this thing it's not just drums and guitars anymore there some pianos worked into this record some whistling it sounded like string sections throbbing electronics a droning buzzing organ at the beginning of one track and I do think the production on this thing is generally good it balances all of this instrumentation really well but when it comes to the compositions at the core of these tracks explosions in the skies compositional style their songwriting style is no more inspired than it was ten years ago I would actually argue that ten years ago it was more inspired it was more refreshing and interesting because here we're getting the same cliched crescendos I mean the song infinite orbit is just a single crescendo after a two minute build the same aimless guitar noodling over hopeful and triumphant chord progressions the same plain reverb effects laid on nearly everything in the mix in order to give the songs this larger-than-life feeling give these tracks more weight sonically than they actually have compositionally the band takes almost no risks on this record with this new flood of instrumentation it's just kind of the same rehashed formulas with some different sonic window-dressing around it and the exciting moments that are on this record they are few and far between like the first half of the song logic of a dream which is a very tense build-up ear piercing tones tense layers upon layers of instrumentation what sounds like huge group drums all being played as you say the band is really living up to their band name on this track but then all of a sudden the larger-than-life instrumentation fades away in favor just kind of this quiet jangly rock instrumental at feo is new after a few minutes watching Rock right Anthony what can you talk what it sounds like the band is still kind of in that mode of delivering soundtrack music and not rock music that sounds engaging sounds exciting to listen to just on its own I guess I could see some of the stuff working here so far if it had some visual accompaniment I guess and even when the band try something a little different like the diddling very tight guitar leads on the song disintegration anxiety sounds a little math rock inspired the band plays this riff until it is just no longer interesting they play the life out of it and the thing is is that this track compositionally it's not really going anywhere and the band plays as if they know that that's the case they're very much going through the motions on this track and many others on here these compositions being so repetitive would be one thing if the band were playing a little gutsy ER and the grooves were more fluid and I guess a little more enthralling and there was some interplay and some tension to the way the band was performing on this record but a lot of the time there isn't the song losing the light is a surprise semi ambient piece in the middle of the record which isn't too bad I like the soundscape the band presents in the last third of the track with the roaring guitars and the ethereal tones and a little bit of piano gentle piano mixed in there some pulsating weird noisy electronics but then the final two tracks are just a few empty attempts at some beautiful instrumental rock music before the record closes out empty bliss I guess you could call it though I will say colors in space I did think the drums were a little bit more aggressive on this track and I liked the very dissonant just shrieking finish that the track had here the band's performance actually struck me as being like a little krautrock inspired it felt very in the moment kind of organic but right before the album closes out they go right back to that super Pleasant very middle-of-the-road performance style that makes so much of this album drab unfortunately I just did not care for this record just too many songs on here just followed the typical explosions in the sky formula despite the introduction of all of this new instrumentation and even when the band was trying something new they were trying something different I feel like they were kind of at a loss as to where to progress some of these ideas which I guess is to be expected because explosions in the skies progressions and their songs are usually pretty typical so they're not really going to pull a rabbit out of a hat when all of a sudden you hear something slightly different from their usual sound again the production on this thing is decent but there's just so much to be desired from this album compositionally so many cliffhangers on these songs so many tracks that really aren't that fulfilling all because the writing is just so neglecting it's just so bare it's just so sparse last thing I want to add is I don't feel like they sound really do that great of a job of reinforcing one another either I mean I wouldn't be surprised if all of these tracks were just a bunch of loose change left over from explosions in the skies past several soundtrack records stealing a decent four on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it explosions in the the there area wilderness forever 
5aJQIfMufns,Hey hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new ash Cuccia album I a ka I HQ Xie is a London via Iran electronic music producer I interviewed him not too long ago I will try to link that down there in the description if I remember to do that and I caught on to him just last year when he dropped his full-length debut record good which was one of the most mind-bending displays of synthetic sound I had heard that year and now since the release of that record he has been signed to Ninja Tune records and now he has released this 15 track 45-minute record now I didn't really know what to expect from this album but due to do mostly because his last full-length LP there was no one single sound label or style that you could just throw onto the record because it blended so much together some wonky and glitch and IDM blatantly experimental and just very challenging electronic music if I could sum it up in any kind of way I would call it a collage of sounds that he mined from within his brain pulled together into these dizzying compositions now this new project over here it's still very sound rich no doubt about that it sounds like Cuccia has spent quite a bit of time here forging these synth patches and these pieces of percussion but one thing I noticed is that he's making way more use of repetition on this project forming the sounds of this album into very coherent loops and grooves and patterns very quickly and easily recognizable patterns something that wasn't so much the case on good which was always shifting always evolving so quickly that it was hard to keep track of and even though I do think good is a very difficult to digest record I will not argue that this album is an easy listen I don't really find myself that enamored with this new project over here I think it's less mystifying for one the songs don't link together into a big cohesive piece they feel like these very sterile separate islands they don't really reinforce one another all that well in this track listing and because of the repetition I think a lot of these songs are just structurally flat as many of the cuts here just end somewhere between two or three minutes after they've exhausted whatever loop or repetition Cuccia happens to be working in the track I could definitely understand this this need to shift in this direction because again good is a very difficult to digest album but it seems like Cuccia has just gone so far on to the other side of the spectrum where there's just not enough progress not enough evolution from the beginning to the end of these cuts many of which just end abruptly rather than just speeding through all these crazy sound ideas as we were on good i ka i to me resembles the feeling of stillness and stiffness like i'm just not moving through these pieces at all even if the sounds worked into these tracks are pretty vivid and colorful and imaginative just like with his last album here i feel like i'm being transported to a different world but this album is the scary realization that this world this other world and being transported to also has waiting rooms and i'm just kind of sitting in one psychedelic synthetic sound waiting room after the next unfortunately the song structures of these tracks could be better they could be a lot better a lot more ambitious a lot more linear but I do give Cuccia and this project all the props in the world for the production and the sound play which are so good I am going to be curious about what the next project from him is and there are some musically stunning moments here and there like the very woozy and warped melodies on the song beautiful there are lots of dissonant and dark and percussive spots on here too that are decent of the song growl kind of features these ambient glacial walls of synth every track here is a cool little motif but it's not really organized into a coherent song that is entertaining from beginning to end or reinforces the track that's coming immediately after it again the sound plays is still here I still hear that Sonic creative side from Cuccia on this project but structurally I don't know what happened this is just nowhere near as interesting as good and sound and interesting linear unpredictable crazy structures were part of what made that record so good so it's kind of shocking to see that part of the equation so neglected on this new project over here I'm feeling a light to decent six on this project it's decent you know if you're looking for some very sound rich electronic music that isn't going to demand your undivided attention because always doing something different then maybe give this thing a shot but I guess I'm looking for something that has a little bit more evolution to it a little more meaty when it comes to the composition yeah we're gonna leave it at that transition have you been in this album a listen did you love it - hate it what would you rate it you're the best you can bachelor should I review next hit like if like please subscribe or you'll die ash Cuccia iak I forever 
GtvpT_PO7-4,oh hey everyone noisy article here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review a track review to be exact for these two new Drake songs that just dropped on Apple music and iTunes out of the blue pop style and one dance drake in case you didn't already know is the Canadian rap Prince my do DJ academics calls him the light-skinned Keith Sweat he has a new full-length album on the way the sheer titled views from the 6 which I am pretty excited for because musically I think Drake has been on a winning streak lately between his summer 16 single and if you're reading this is too late hotline bling back to back freestyle although these two new officially released songs come off the back of a few leaked tracks including the song controla songs that I thought were just super mediocre not really that good but they were leaked songs maybe they didn't want them to come out maybe they were just besides maybe they were just leftovers you know I'm not sort of anticipating these tracks to be amazing unless they're officially released I'm not really kind of hitting them with that critical ear because maybe the artists didn't want them to be out because they weren't finished or they weren't happy with them however again these two songs here have been released so they are expecting people to buy this music if they want to hear of course their ways you don't have to to to buy it but they want that to happen and my take on these tracks is that I'm not impressed not impressed in the least to start off with the song one dance featuring Wiz Kid and Kaila this is a sexy sensual dance floor ballad and it is god-awful there's literally nothing redeeming about this song I think it's one of the worst songs Drake has put out in a while I don't think he sounded this sniveling and simply since like his thank me layer days again nothing redeeming about the song from Drake's vocals which are just loaded with this really obnoxious effect which does not make his voice sound human and then the be the production on this thing is off the percussion is super loud very Basie very punchy and then there's this cymbal crash that happens in the song a few times that sounds like it was sampled off of 240p quality youtube video like the sound quality is super crunchy super low and the guest vocals on this track seem to have like a very low sound quality to the sound quality of some of the samples some of the sounds worked into this beat are literally garbage the piano kind of sounds like it's not the same sound quality as the beat either the sounds here because some of them are sort of crunchy and sound like they're stretched digitally and just again not of a high quality they don't blend that well together into a cohesive instrumental not only that but you have to account for the abrupt ending of this song the forgettable lyrics the forgettable melody this track sounds frightfully unfinished and because of that it's not worth the money Cash Money Records are asking you the listener to pay for it do not waste your money on this track if you can hear a second hand from somewhere else do it that way because this is not a good song again do not waste your money on this track now the song pop style it sounds unfinished as well although it is the more entertaining of the two tracks and boasts a jay-z and a Kanye feature although really only sort of a jay-z feature because he literally comes on the track for two lines and then disappears still though I do like the production on this track it kind of reminds me of the sparse banger beats from if you're reading this it's too late although maybe a little bass ear a little punchy er a little more aggressive Drake's flow is very slow it's chill it's laid-back he's a little more generous with the one-liners here although I feel like the only person who comes through on the song and gives us a full effort is Kanye his verse is pretty funny it's clever at points I think the final lines on the verse here are hilarious and they close out with that streetfighter perfect sample which I like a lot Drake to me on this cut just sounds like he's trying a little too hard to sound cold-blooded and the result is just a lackluster verse the refrain is is a okay it's nothing all that memorable by Drake's standards and again we have an abrupt ending here the bass line shifts out of nowhere although here it sounds like it would be a really appropriate place to put a bridge but instead of putting a bridge here the song starts fading out as soon as the bass line shifts if you're a hardcore Drake stand and a hardcore Kanye stand and you really want to hear the two of these guys on a decent track I could recommend this song but again keep in mind that it's not one of the better songs either these two have landed on the only other thing I want to say about these tracks is that I am praying that neither of them are anywhere near views from the 6 I don't want them on the record I don't want them as bonus tracks they are not good songs Drake could do better Drake could do loads better I don't know what Drake usually does put together a better track higher a million ghost riders do what you got to do but come out with better songs because these songs especially one dance are trash Drake put in half effort here and he and his team and his record label they're expecting full price and that's that's crap that's it that's how I feel about these Drake tracks don't want them anywhere near views from the six don't put them anywhere near this record I want views from the 6 to be good so in order for it to be good these songs have to not be on the album a transition have you given these tracks to listen did your love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantan Oh Drake new singles forever 
TJNRymZmcfY,or aah hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new Weezer album White Album The White Album Weezer long-running California power pop and alternative rock band and this is their tenth full-length studio album which I've been looking forward to for a couple of different reasons one there were great singles and teaser tracks to this album la girls and thank God for girls and I actually think the band has slowly been on a progression of making some better music now we all know that the 2000s were a pretty dark time for the Weezer catalog numerous awful Weezer albums were released around this time and the band was just kind of sweetening their sound to the point where it was just completely beyond consumption there were like a handful of decent tracks on Hurley and I also not everything will be alright that that record was actually relatively solid in my opinion and now the White Album is here and it is their most consistent album in years so consistent and so good that it actually makes me bitter why why did this happen because it's not like Weezer are reinventing themselves on this album or trying anything like radically new here they're just kind of sticking to their guns once again but this time they just happen to be on target but then I have to kind of remind myself that Weezer came through and were popular in the mid in late 90s and since then the music industry has gone through a really awkward phase the traditional media outlets that Weezer was born out of are no longer really relevant when it comes to music discovery at least for the target audience that Weezer typically would reach the introspective type the rock music fan they're just not going to look for new music on Anthony or on MTV anymore so now we xur doesn't really have the pressure to come out with a raid single or an ultra sugary album that's going to be competing with every other radio hit out there on the market now they have to compete on the democratized internet with a legitimately solid album and I think they did it they did it not only just by putting together one good song after another but in a way kind of pulling from their glory days in the 90s with a little touch of some Californian sunshine pop music from the 1960s as I was listening to this record with my buddy max he actually pointed out that the lead melody of the song a good thing along with the chord progression actually resembles quite a bit Lee Rascals song it's beautiful mone it booty dude and there's a ton of Beach Boys influence on this record as well now there are 10 tracks on this album most of them end at the 3 minute and 30 second mark which only further proves that Weezer just has this music here down to a science a summary angsty science the opening track California kids lyrically it might be a little bit of an over exaggeration as to how willing the California kids will help you if you are in trouble but it's still a fiery anthem and a wonderful tribute in a really catchy song with soaring siren guitar leads riding on top of these punching just pounding and confident guitar chords there are a lot of anthemic and triumphant spots on this record but this album has a dark side to which you might have already guessed which comes through on tracks like thank God for girls this is one of a handful of cuts on this record where piano so it's pretty prominently in the mix not just those roaring Weezer guitars and thank God for girls is a single that I like even more in the context of this album than I did just like it by itself the chorus on this thing just ruptures with pent-up sadness and anger over unrequited love and rivers as our songwriting protagonist here kind of falling short of that alpha male archetype Rivers is just still chained handling so well those emotions that come from adolescent and awkward teenage love well into his 40s and it just works and I'm sure that he and every other Weezer fan that's still out there enjoys or maybe is even angered by the irony of a song like la girls where Rivers is essentially pleading with these la girls to act their age when he's just completely unwilling to do the same but you cannot deny that that is a fantastically catchy track and one of the many songs on here where the Ballad underneath these heavy again Weezer alternative rock guitars it just feels like a song much older than the recording we're actually hearing much older than even the 90s that Weezer were born out of hey girls please act your age but back to this thank God for girls track I do like some of the weird religious undertones that pop up in the lyrics on this track there's a lot to this song I think it's one of the better tunes that Weezer has come out with in a while and there are other cuts on here that are great songs too and they are equally Moody or a little bit edgy like on the song do you want to get high or on the track jacked up I think this is the saddest Weezer's been sounding since Pinkerton with the dying flowers and these strained falsettos that definitely calls back to that era and it does a great job of it and there's some irresistible sweet songs in the tracklisting here that may be a little too cute at times but I do think they're still very enjoyable to me even just in general the worst songs in the tracklisting here are pretty good there's not one song on here that I want to skip so good thing of course that track is very sunny it's very upbeat it's very sweet it's just about being in the midst of a blissful love affair and then with the song endless summer hey hey hey hey it's a little acoustic closer for the album that feels really good it's really warm finish but one track I do want to specifically highlight before I get out of this review is the song king of the world not only is this one of the best courses Weezer's come through with a while but it's also one of the most adult and lyrically telling songs I think Rivers Cuomo has written or at least put onto a Weezer album in a long time - he seems to be singing about his wife and not only his wife's childhood but his wife's emotions and how if he were king of the world or if he had control over this kind of thing that she wouldn't shed a tear she wouldn't be sad unless she really wanted to be it's about somebody who from rivers perspective really understands emotional pain and wants to be the bearer of that pain for somebody who he really cares about so while in a sense it is a very sad song and it does have some very strong personal details in there it's it's also a track that is shrouded musically and vocally in that same youthful hope and idealism that most Weezer songs are as I said earlier that song good thing is a little too sweet for my taste just just a little bit but again not a terrible song and the track some are Elaine and drunk Dori didn't really stand out to me just to really seem to have as strong a lyrical narrative behind it as many other tracks here did and really that's it for like low lights for me on this album this album is consistently highlights I mean even again this drunk Dory track has a great melody to it that I still find myself singing along to on the chorus ever since this album dropped I've been consistently coming back to it again and again and again and even as I was listening to it more times than I normally would if I were just reviewing it I didn't really feel like I was reviewing it I was just putting it on to enjoy it I wasn't even you know in the forefront of my mind in the way that I would be critically analyzing the album bah bah bah bah bah because after a while I just kind of realized man there's really nothing that bad about this record there's nothing I have to harshly critique about this album I can just sit back and just listen to this thing without worrying about you know oh where are the tracks I want to skip what are the bad parts what are the so boy here comes this track I hate this moment it's just a super great pop rock album it just comes through with great music without doing anything too experimental or too pretentious or - weird or difficult to digest or anything that needs a whole lot of explaining anything all I really feel like I'm doing coming on camera here is saying to you guys that confirmed this is a very great Weezer album and this is the greatest thing they've done in a long time again makes me slightly mad that it didn't come out earlier or that the band hasn't been this consistent up until this point because even in Weezer's darkest days I've always felt like this album was within their potential later is better than never I guess I'm feeling a strong a - la9 on this project transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you die best u2 best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you might die anthony Fantana Weezer that white album very pretty

Davi Diggs how you doing dude I'm pretty good man I went a little old-school with the star of stage and throwing it back a little about it felt like child intestine or something okay man thanks for coming on the show it's it's been a while and a lot has happened since we last talked I believe our last conversation was was shortly after clipping came out with kind of their first mixtape I believe Wow yeah yeah I think you're right and then you guys got signed to Sub Pop you dropped that follow-up record right and since then you have landed on a bill of what essentially right now is pretty much the hottest thing on Broadway the new Hamilton musical yeah wherein you play two characters correct so fill me in a little bit on how you sort of came to be involved in this project because something we didn't really go over in our last talk I don't think at least not in depth is that you know you have a pretty intensive theater background as well you know I believe you've been in a number of sort of productions and you've also done a advertisements as well one of which I believe you wanted me to sort of keep under wraps for a little while well like just before the release of the second clipping record where you played a great producer by the way in sort of that Austin Mahoney commercial I believe where you were super convincing and you see you seemed really concerned with with him sort of jumbling the words of the song up with like breakfast foods it was really a yeah it was it was a really intense scene it was kind of high drama shout out to Austin for being such a such a really fantastic actor and and recently after a you know you sort of pointing me in the direction I've caught you in a few law-and-order episodes as well yeah those are recent developments yeah so I mean you know tell me a little bit about your acting background now and and then from there you know sort of how you happen to be in this Hamilton musical weird well yeah I mean I've been acting for a very long time mostly in plays and I sort of was it was a very reluctant theatre major in college I went to brown which meant that I swore I was gonna like create my major and do some really like cool like hippy arts and education like activism thing and then I looked around and it had finished the theater major already cuz I just liked taking silly acting classes so that became what I did and but that was never my intention but I have was always like doing plays and stuff I'd done them in high school I did them in college and then I went back to Oakland after college and kept doing them I managed to sort of piece together a living doing that between that and like teaching poetry classes in middle schools and stuff but yeah I was doing a lot of theater in the bay and then II you know I so when I moved to Los Angeles though after which is sort of when I started when clipping really started taking four and was until like 2012 when I moved down to Los Angeles or 2011 I guess but I moved there and like I am really not good at auditioning for commercials and things like that basically like I had done a bunch of plays in the Bay Area and nobody knew who I was and like there no one was really interested in representing me except I could get a commercial agents very easy to get a commercial agent if you show up and you can like read at like a fifth-grade level you can probably get a commercial agent so I did that and I was basically like the extent of my acting work was auditioning for commercials so I was really like focused on this clipping stuff because that was way more fun and I was working with two of my best friends we were making stuff that we thought was really dope hmm so acting just kind of took a backseat and I would audition you know when I when I could get around to it yeah and then we started touring about you know like so you sort of know that the clipping history so yeah those albums came out and we started touring a bunch and that was that was cool meanwhile I had also been hit up by a mentor of mine from back in the Bay Area Mark veloute Joseph to sort of concurrently be touring a piece that he had written called word becomes flesh that was like a story it initially was a solo performance piece of his that he toured all around the world in 2007 but he reimagined it for a group of five black men there was this sort of choreo poem thing so I was also doing that so basically I lived on the road a lot and while I was doing that is when I got hit up by Tommy Kael the director of Hamilton to to come out and be in a reading of Hamilton and so the back story of that actually we have to go back to the bay area for her second church yeah what's what's the story behind that connection so Lynn and lemon well who wrote the show and Tommy are both part of this thing called freestyle Love Supreme that they sort of formed while they were at Wesleyan but had become like imagine sort of like a faster like more theatrical wild and out or maybe less the answer I don't know it feels a little more like a concert but also like there seems to be like more acting going on and it's live and entirely improvised and but all in all in verse and so anyway I became a part of that group because another founding member of that group name and even its Yali and we were both called to substitute teach the same class in Marin County due to some clerical error uh and we so we were both there so we just fuckin team taught this class and I gave him a ride home and he was like you know we were talking about rapping and talking about acting and he was like oh we do the same things hey I work with these people he was trying to found a West Coast version of this group called the fries and so I became a part of that and then while being a part of that free style of supreme which is based in New York when they couldn't fill a whole performance which happened often because in the heights was on Lynn's last play and the heights was on Broadway at the time so like often performers couldn't make it so they would fly me out to do these these freestyle shows hmm so that's how I know those guys is really through this this weird like freestyle theater hybrid thing and sometime in the midst of doing a word becomes flesh tour freestyle of supreme calls and has me come out to the Super Bowl when it was in New Orleans to rap on sports nation about sports celebrities live in the week leading up to the Super Bowl you can watch these clips on YouTube they're not good oh my god so we do this gig and it was really fun you know the these are great guys and it's always a good time and and that kid I was in a moment in my life where I wasn't saying no to anything that paid money and while we were there Tommy mentioned this musical this new thing Lynn was writing and asked would I come out to Vassar to do a reading of that in like a month and I said sure send me the stuff and he sent me the music and I've never done a musical before but I did you know I listen to these were like Lin's sort of crappy demos of all of the songs that he had written so far and they were so smart and so like sort of fulfilling even from from a rapper perspective you know yeah you hear this idea of like hip-hop theater sometimes and just makes you cringe definitely if you if you do the rap thing for real because you just you just know it's gonna be bad yeah I guess I guess uh the whole concept of hip-hop theater while obviously this isn't the furthest isn't the inception of it right here like you just said sort of the idea of these two worlds kind of colliding does elicit a cringe just like you said or it could I guess uh in what way were these demos kind of succeeding where previous efforts that you had seen were kind of failing well I think cuz nothing was forced you know it's this is an interesting to say and being part of clipping but like there is rap is about authenticity right I mean sure about the presentation of authenticity so even even with clipping where we don't use the first person at all like that was it that that choice is made actually to elicit a greater feeling of authenticity because this is makes it easier for us to participate in the kinds of rap music we're making so like I think that's why you get that cringe because when you're smashing these two worlds together it feels like the wrappings gonna be a gimmick it feels like it's gonna be something to get the kids in the seats and like do it you know but but when I heard these demos you know Lynne is a good rapper he's a really good rapper he's a great writer and he's also just a super musical theater head and he was so also enamored with his subject he read this biography of Alexander Hamilton and totally like fell for him so he wrote this thing that was so everything about it was good it was like technically good the story was really engaging and inter seeing any any and none of it felt a force it all felt like really honest and not like rap was being used as sort of a as a gimmick but instead it was the only way that he could figure out to tell this story about a guy who who wrote his way off of off of the island that he lived on and consequently like wrote his way into success and into ruin so it's really like rap music is used because it's the best way to tell the story along with a lot of other kinds of music that's the other thing about it is like you know all the press around it it says that it's a rap show but it just it just has a lot of rapping in it but there's tons of jazz there's tons of like super just show tune yeah a Analia feeling stuff is I mean it's it's all over the place a lot of R&B music a lot of and his reference points were always whatever that particular song needed so yeah it's like a written musically it's if you listen to the cast recording it's really a mix of everything right um yeah I mean I think in previous sort of attempts to incorporate the sounds of hip-hop in the musical theater maybe there kind of would have been a feeling of maybe the person writing the song being sort of out of touch and then sort of incorporating that just as an attempt to get the kids in the seats like you said but hip hop's at a point now where it's it's not as young as it used to be and you know you have these classic records that people hold as in high regard as like Nirvana's Nevermind or something well and and now hip hop isn't just you know the language of the young generation it's kind of a part of the modern mainstream vernacular you know so in a way it sort of seems like this is coming at a very appropriate time where even people who are in that 30 40 50 year-old range who you know might typically go to a Broadway show are familiar with the idea of hip hop they're familiar with the concepts behind hip hop so so what they may be seeing on stage because you guys take a lot of the hip hop vernacular to incorporate that into the lyrics of the show you know you're not like talking as if you it's the 1700s or the 1800s right now it's it's a very modern feel to the language of the show so you know what's being said on stage isn't really alien to anybody in the juxtaposition of the new and the old in the story is is very obvious and kind of humorous right well and I think also that was part of the point was to it in order to really care about these characters which we let you know how many times have you learned something about George Washington and forgotten it immediately the idea was like to make them feel contemporary to make them feel like somebody you know and and you're right hip-hop is everywhere and and whether you consciously are a hip-hop fan or not like you've listened to it there's nobody that you can't tell me you've never heard a rap song you know yeah it's like this Universal at this point yeah absolutely um you know it's a sort of detour for a quick second it's just sort of funny too to see that that's sort of where the current state of hip hop's relevancy is because it seems like now at this peak of hip hop's relevance where it's really everywhere it seems like everybody has access to it most people have at least you know a baseline grasp of what to expect when someone tells them they're going to hear a hip hop song simultaneously there's also like this movement of people within the community who sort of come off like purists and you know sort of want to maintain the status quo and and that means sort of saying who can participate who can't what can or can't be said just kind of in a weird attempt to sort of hold on to what they grew up with in terms of hip-hop but but now as it's grown and things like this production that you're involved in have occurred you know the whole landscape is changing right it's true I mean but I think actually like you know our production is pretty like great for like for her like those 90s rap purists you know I was really Lynn's golden era and that's the stuff that he's he's referencing and writing about but I I agree with you that you know the the landscape is changing and continues to change and I think but it's so funny like you know for folks who don't participate in it like if you're not making rap songs or any kind of music like generally write the best music for you is the music you were listening to when you were like in your late teens and early twenties I sure that's like oh you're the most nostalgic for yeah that's that's when it should stop what should stop that's when that's when rap music should stop whenever you were like 18 you're like yeah that's the Golden Age of hip-hop right they don't think everything after that is crap you know like which of course is garbage we would we would all be really upset if it stopped hmm but you know yeah you get it those are the things that make you feel young and powerful and like that's considering that hip-hop is is so the the the roots of it especially throughout the 90s are sort of based in those young and powerful feelings you know and rock obviously went through this phase as well you know do you see the genre sort of gracefully transitioning into this era where it might be able to move away from some of those feelings or maybe incorporate more ideas in the mainstream from artists who are taking kind of a softer approach I mean I think it's already happening in a sense with people like Drake you know being as popular and as relevant as he is who you know widely acknowledges the fact that he's not the hardest rapper right yeah I think you know the hip hop in general has always been such a wide open genre and there's always been everything and it but in terms of like what the mainstream is accepting it tends to exist on this on kind of a pendulum right like we we we get really hard for a second and then it sort of swings back the other way and we get our you know we get our jiggy era we get our we get our you know softer stuff and it's gonna wingback and we we get some more gangster rap and now we're sitting in the middle of a Drake phase and it's it's pretty soft and whoa maybe it'll swing back the other way but I do think you know the the internet and access to all different kinds of music in like the different ways that artists have to gain popularity is sort of helping to make the the mainstream image of the genre a little bit wider a little more all-inclusive than it ever has been Christian you look like that guys like Earl Sweatshirt too it was like such a great revin is enjoying like some amount of mainstream's excitement certainly not a drake but you know there is there is certainly room in the in the mainstream consciousness for a guy like like Earl yeah I mean I think if more people like him were to come out hip-hop could sort of work itself through sort of the 90s introspective depressing grunge phase that rock had going for a little while you know III think rap sort of went through its era of of sort of hard rock hair metal excess and and and now and now it's due for you know some sad introspective sort of really depressing sort of reflective reflective music yeah yeah yeah I mean I think I think there's there's there's certainly a lot of good stuff in that world out there you know I think yeah we'll just we'll always need all of it you know the thing about rap music is it's a it's still one of its main functions as always I think going to be like as a party soundtrack and like I you know I I still don't like to party to sad music but I'm old so you know maybe I don't know maybe that's not for me anymore I'll just keep listening to my like early 2000 psyche songs and um you know and every and every every party the kids are going to will be like real sad hmm all right um okay so one more question about I guess the concept of this before we go into more specifics about you know sort of your role in the show you know I believe I caught a clip of you online talking about how you're getting your reparations by doing this show is it what is that true is did I hear that right it's a good laugh I mean it's it's the way I ended my BT cyber so they and these dead presidents don't get in my record yes yes good line so you know give me your point of view in your opinion on basically you know that this whole idea that you're using what's essentially a modern black art form to sort of express this story or take part in expressing this story about I guess it's very old in this very white part of American history yeah well I think the the thing that comes up for me all the time is that it actually is not a white part of American history that you know black people were around all the time of course building you know just about everything that we're talking about in the show yeah and I think one of the things that the show does in a really cool way is sort of allows that narrative of that that this country was built by these people to still exist but in this very subversive way put black and brown faces at the forefront of it and black and brown music at the forefront of it so as opposed to as opposed to having this this fight about who really built the country which is which is the thing that you know we like to yell about all the time but doesn't you know the thing about landing the thing about this show is is it's very it's patriotic it is a pro-america show it's about it's about sort of the greatness of the democracy that we created when it's at its best and how it has room for disagreement and how when it when it is working a encourages argument and is imperfect and is always being fixed and tinkered with so it keeps that narrative and just puts people of color at the forefront of it and you know I get so many tweets from kids from kids that like looking at you know or tweeting statues of Jefferson or whatever and being like you know s mhm this doesn't look anything like that we dig which is you know for me as a human being pretty weird but I think there's a there's a certain amount of significance to that that I think is important that I sort of wish I had had when I was 13 mmm kind of wish you know my 13 year old like theater nerd self would have been able to see this show because it it opens the world up a little bit you know and it's you know at the time when our president is is who our president is and and this world should be opened up and it gives it certainly when I started working on it it gave me a sort of sense of ownership over the story of the of the founding of this country and this democracy that I didn't have before so I I I do hope that it is operating that way for sort of younger folks and these feelings of patriotism and the inner workings of our democracy that you're sort of talking about that are reflected in the play you know are these feelings that you personally feel like you have even in the midst of this very chaotic election season that that we're having yeah I don't know that's a really complicated question you know I I think I have them in in this really idealistic sense in the in the sense that we all approach it when we go to work and work on this display you know I do I do you know believe in people in general you know like I'm a pretty optimistic person as far as I think I I tend to think people are good so and I think the there is an idea about how America works that could really capitalize on that I don't in practice I think that almost never happens and I think there are there are so much you know there is a there is such a history of like beyond slavery and and everything gesture of abuse um to minorities and women and you know they I it's pretty easy to be pessimistic about and then yeah and then you listen to you know you listen to Trump rhetoric and get you get even more depressed and all that but you know I think I think somewhere in there it still exists for me I still I still like living here I feel like every election season I I start to be like oh man if such-and-such wins we're got moving to Canada yeah yeah that's the that's what everybody says every time right but I mean that's as scary as it can be simultaneously I feel like this dissonance is just kind of a natural part of the process of letting everybody sort of have their own opinion Wow absolutely and it's you know and I think one of the things we also we love to look at the the polls of it we left to look at the like the most extremes on either side oh yeah after the internet sort of indulges that right so everything so much yeah oh yeah I think you know if it were for the internet kind of amplifying and platforming the most polarizing views on both sides of the aisle you know I don't think people like Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump would be as prominent as they are in this election you know it would essentially be talking a Hillary Ted Cruz election already you but now there are sort of these loud voices on both sides of the aisle that can't really be ignored right yeah I think you're right and I think the majority of the country is actually much more centrist around most issues than you know way we are allowed to imagine mmm but I also you know I've also only ever lived on the coast so what do I know all right um so you know going into the characters that you play in the show and sort of using to springboard from that the story that you told of of that you know some of the kids sort of messaging you pictures of Jefferson and so on and so forth and maybe being a point of inspiration for some of these young kids you know give us an idea of you know what you personally do in the show with your character and sort of you know how you feel about the role that you play and sort of how you feel it reflects on you as an actor and the message that you think that your character sends within the overall story all right well so in the first act I'm playing the Marquis de Lafayette who I certainly didn't know anything about before I started working on this yeah that you know left at 19 years old left France and came to the u.s. to fight in in the revolution in the American Revolution which a lot of people which was kind of a thing in France the idea of American democracy was really sexy the French were trying to work out their own ideas about about having a revolution and and starting a democracy there and and the America was a little bit further along in the process so people were leaving to go join the terrorist sect in America right exactly yes Lafayette comes over and and beats George Washington and and ends up becoming a really great general and really like became an American hero after after the war and after you know the French Revolution - he comes back and is like thrown ticker-tape parades everywhere he goes and women are wearing gloves with his face on them like he was like he was a real like you know like like superhero on a lunchbox type dude hmm like yeah so so he's he became this kind of celebrity but when we're when we're meeting him he's young and just sort of trying to figure it out and over the course of the first act we sort of see him become a general in in the ways that it relates to to Hamilton story of also becoming George Washington's aide de camp and eventually the secretary of the Treasury so but yeah Lafayette I think this show sort of embodies that kind of idealism and this kind of and this this sort of ideal that that I think America still preaches and doesn't and and it clearly doesn't practice very much about this is a place where anyone can come and be what they want to be um so the you know Lafayette comes here with these dreams of being a general and does just that and and works his ass off and impresses everybody in the process and and but he you know he's French and and Hamilton does the same thing they have this great line towards the end of the first stag immigrants we get the job done she gets like a great response every night um given our political climate right sure yeah Vidia it so he's sort of embodying this this sort of act ideal of America where you know this this place is for everyone and and immigrants who come here are the ones building it are really the ones doing the work in building and shaping it and and the second act I come back so Lafayette leaves and goes back to France to deal with his own Revolution and I come back as Thomas Jefferson who has been in France for the entire duration of the war never had to had to fight in the war at all he's been just hanging out in France being a rock star because he was like a symbol of American democracy and he comes back and is just made Secretary of State like just a letter just shows up from George Washington you're the first secretary of state dude you didn't have to do anything for it you're awesome and this kind of and we learned all this in in Jefferson's sort of entrance song which is this sort of jazzy like throwback jersey number called what did I miss and he the that sort of epitomizes to me who Jefferson is right just the most privileged has just been handed everything a really smart guy and and in our version of him a really charismatic guy as well but but like has never had to work for anything and in fact like when we meet him he's just being wheeled around by his slaves like he barely touches the ground that whole number so huh huh so then he he goes up again he starts going up against Hamilton in cabinet meetings and Hamilton sort of represents everything that he doesn't Hamilton his work for everything Harold said is you know and they also differ on most things specifically you know who this idea of like paying off the war debt this idea of slavery which Hamilton was always a staunch abolitionists Jefferson was absolutely not so you're kind of the heel at this point in the earth yeah and so yeah yeah Jefferson becomes basically a villain and and you know ends up being for a long time sort of a foil to Hamilton who sort of wins at every turn and then eventually becomes a BRR as well but yeah I think the for me the the take away from for Jefferson is just like that this kind of you know she wrote some things that are I mean he wrote the Declaration of Independence he wrote some documents that bit I think most of us even like most liberal minded folks can also really stand behind and he was still a piece of shit and I think that's important to sort of recognize that those two things are possible yeah it seems like you know he was a great political and mind and and especially when it came to the law as well but you could have that talent but also be a shitty person right exactly and he was you know he was a great inventor he invented a lot of things he was like a total weirdo also I mean and I think that's sort of part of the the charm and the draw of Jefferson also is that he's he just you know his his insane amount of privilege just gave him this like freedom to just think and all of this free time so he just made shit he just did chemistry experiments and like you know and and shipped things over from France that he you know macaroni and cheese we eat macaroni and cheese because of Thomas Jefferson yeah I mean so that there are you know but but yeah obviously his his his owning of slaves and his like inability to despite his like romantic relationships with Sally Hemings which are super well documented his like uh nobility inability to reconcile that with the fact that he was owning these people is unforgivable and we should have no way to really conceive that that's okay but he's still you know a smart guy and we can use a lot of the things that he created well sure you know I think um that's essentially you know I think the takeaway from from any significant part of history you know the thing is that at no point in history are are even when we're our most well-intentioned you know are we doing anything perfectly yeah so I think it's it's best just kind of take away from that with hindsight the better things that did come out of a certain situation or at least you know the the opportunities to learn from the mistakes that were made and just try to move on as best that you can knowing that even you know with your best intentions you're probably not doing everything wonders percent correctly - right exactly and I think one of my favorite things about this shows that it presents all of these all of the founding fathers and mothers as flawed as as real people as opposed to you know we don't we don't hear this story about George Washington chopping down the cherry tree and never lying and stuff in our show which is also not true but yeah but you know beyond that like that's not like that's not who these people were and it actually like has always made it impossible for me to care about them because you know nobody is perfect then and we can't and so you know I like that we don't have to ignore the fact that that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves which we do so where I did I was told to so much of the time when I was learning about who Thomas Jefferson was right that hmm actually stopped me from from learning anything interesting about him while that's just an interesting point of view because it seems like you know it's it's it's really an opportunity to truly learn something about the founding fathers as opposed to just kind of you know looking at this fake grand perfect sort of painting of them from the point of view of somebody who whether they're white brown black whatever they know that you know the narrative is bullshit right from the go it seems like you know the the the production is taking a much more reasonable reasonable approach to history as opposed to you know it's either grande it's perfect you know we can't question the founding fathers or you know the other point of view the on the other side of that you know the the polar opposite of that is anybody who looks at anyone a thousand years ago and says those people were barbarians you know essentially right you know where is it's only a matter of time before there's a future society that looks upon the society that you lived in Wow you know everything was so fucked up that back then how do they even live right right right I mean we can look at so many things that we're doing right now and say that absolutely and I imagine they could then - I mean that's you know that's the thing about it right like history is all about who tells who tells the story so yeah okay you know that's actually a really amazing point - I think - to leave this on before I totally let you go because I know you're a very busy person what are your plans right now that you have or ambitions as far as music goes or you know are you just like sinking your teeth into a theatre and acting right now no man we've been making so much music I actually bill and Jonathan were just here they just spent a week out here and we recorded a ton of songs and so uh you know I think Jonathan is doing sort of the rough mixes of those right now to see kind of what shook out and see if there's a direction that a lot of this was was solo stuff for me hmm and then a couple clipping things that we had to finish up and I there there is a totally finished clipping project I can't give any dates on it yet but it's it's you know I can I can be very hopeful that it will be out this year and so there's there's one of those there's a there's another one in the works there's there's tons of clipping music and there's also a bunch of like my own sort of solo stuff that I'm really excited about because I haven't really put anything out since since small things - a giant in 2012 yo and how has your music sort of Peart you know your solo stuff has that progressed in any way significantly since that last album like are you going for any different sounds or are you taking some risks or any of the ideas or concepts that you sort of have explored through the last few clipping records kind of bleeding into this new solo record I think so I mean like I said I'm still waiting for the songs to shake down to figure like what would constitute a full-length project so I might just end up leaking songs that don't fit into that anyway because I don't I don't really know what that is yet but I do think I mean I think the music's better I think you know working with clipping has given me a fair like a higher amount of quality control sort of which is which is good but also you know um I still write about Oakland all the time but I think and I'm in a different place now so that there's a lot of it's I don't know the stuff so far has been a little bit angrier a little like more distrustful um I think maybe because I'm in this position where like all of a sudden people are do I don't know we're trying to talk to me all the time and like you know this rap music is a thing that I've been doing for so so long and nobody cared and I get it you're on your now you're on your Drake shit now I'm on my drink shit though yeah yeah I'm super on my drink shit it's really like no new friends like it's a lot of no new friends it's a lot of like lonely like sad songs a lot of like sort of singing no I've been there you know but I still alternately like like I said like my my real era is like the high fear so I'm still like I'm still looking for whatever the modern version of that is right so I think the stuff sounds probably club' ER then then one would expect it to sound if you knew me but oh that's just where I've sort of always been at but I think I don't know I'm excited about it it's I'm excited about the writing I think I'm a better writer now than I was then and I think I'm working with better producers now than I was then so I'm pretty excited to see how it all comes out try and put something together or not or to just start putting songs out because what I what I would like to not do is just sit on them for a bunch of years and then hate them by the time they come out that would be bad well this solo release for right now is it looking at a self release or are you dealing with a label at the moment and his clippings still a sort of in the works with Sub Pop yeah clipping this next clipping project will be on Sub Pop and yes we're still working with them and and my solo thing is is looking for I'm talking with with some label folks but I'm also exploring the options of putting it out myself I'm sort of and maybe both I don't know I'm sort of interested in whatever like gets the music out and is gonna have the greatest reach but also wait the least amount of time navigating those things right now okay alright my guest on this episode has been Debbie Diggs of not only clipping also a solo rapper artist singer songwriter and of the Hamilton musical as well where can I direct people to to just kind of you know check you out is a you know a Twitter page or a solo site or something or yeah yeah Twitter Devi Diggs Facebook big gravy dudes Debbie Diggs calm is gonna be redesigned soon right now you can just get small things to a giant there that's the only thing in action here okay go ahead or we're working on on reopening that into a more useful site as well so I guess keep your eyes tuned to that but basically Debbie Diggs on all the various social media I do have a snapchat I never use it okay that'll change alright we'll link everybody to those social media platforms and I just want to thank you for being on them hey thank you 
jodE2aQpwNw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new damo Genesis project Genesis this guy is a California rapper and at one time a member of the now-defunct Odd Future who are I guess no longer a rap collective but somehow still a record label that this album came out on and in regards to damo over here just from his previous mixtapes and and features much of which I've heard and reviewed he's never really been one of those standout members of Odd Future in my opinion I think actually one of the more average members of Odd Future one member of Odd Future that's kind of lacking a distinct sound or angle or personality sure he has some projects that have some really overt references to smoking weed and just being high but really that's like not enough for you to separate yourself away from just any other weed rapper and honestly on this new project over here I don't see him or hear him coming into his own either I mean seriously what is it that is making you so excited about this project that you're like Anthony you got to review this oh my god I can't believe you're not reviewing this I mean is it is it the average flows is it damos slightly raspy voice is it his so so wordplay I mean please you know get down there in the comments explain it to me like I'm an idiot I already know you think I'm an idiot I mean the dudes delivery on the song dapper with Anderson pack who by the way is the only great thing about that track is so sleepy and it's it's like he barely even showed up for his own song now in a sense this is definitely da Mo's most mature project yet the instrumentation on this thing is consistently chill it's smooth it's jazzy a lot of the verses and bars on this record are either about da Mo's personal problems with loved ones and family or just about his is effort that he puts into this music and the rap game in general though there are moments like where some very off-key vocals are added into the mix like on the song one below which do not do the tune any favors in fact actually ruin the song I think it could have been one of the better tracks in the tracklist here especially since it has one of da Mo's better verses here so while I do see that that da mo is taking a more introspective approach on this project I don't know it's not like his flows it's not like his delivery it's not like his wordplay are so great that it makes his life story compelling it seems like the whole project is based on this assumption there's even one line here it's actually on the song 1 below where he literally says that my life story has to be worth somebody's time and not necessarily there are things I like about this project but little to none of it has to do with da Mo's rapping or lyrics like the instrumentals as I noted they are more refined and detailed and prettier and I guess overall this project is taking a softer approach than his previous ones and also just odd future projects in general but other than that there are no real significant changes to make note of - da Mo's style all the other changes are just completely outside of him or they are window dressing which leads me to the genesis title of this project I hardly see this as the genesis of da mo Genesis he's had five years to come through with this debut commercial project since Odd Future blew up and it seems like he's made almost no progress whatsoever he's not really sounding that much better than he did on no idols I do like some of the features on here but there are others that are serious disappointments Dash's feature on the song questions is obnoxious and terrible Wiz Khalifa's feature on the song go is not good at all although that song entirely is the worst track in the tracklisting here it features this garish Tyler the Creator hook and instrumental with these awful synth leads that just sound and on top of it a Juicy J feature that just does not fit it's like he didn't even hear the beat when he was rapping it's like they just gave him a tempo and said just rap to this tempo we'll slip it into the beat and we'll leave it at that again this project certainly seems like it has the biggest budget of anything damo has been involved with but the high quality beats and the big-name features are underutilized they are not complemented with anything great in terms of rapping or storytelling there are forgettable bars all over this thing very general general general themes and topics and middle-of-the-road flows the song faded in the moment has such crummy vocal mixing this song is just like a shade or two away from sounding like a demo and another track I have to mention is the song alright I don't know what it is about this track but I cannot shake that this sounds exactly like a Jay Cole song like I could just plug j : to this song and put on one of his records and people will just be like yeah that's a Jay Cole song from the glistening pianos to the kind of melodic flow to even some of the lyrics on this track this just reads to me just so much like I don't know if there were a rap like Jay Cole Twitter account and Dom just like grab these bars off of it or something of course that's not what happened I'm not saying that's what happened I know some of you were gonna be in the comments I did with Hamid AD it feeling happy especially that one line about if you don't like this song there to turn my lights off it just seemed so I don't know this trying to be meaningful but also cutesy the the closing track here is such a filler track it's like da mo just to know how to end this project and I feel like he says as much in the lyrics as over and over and over he's saying that he's trying to find a way trying to find his way and that's essentially this record in a nutshell it's an album that doesn't know where it's going doesn't know where it wants to go and even if it did it wouldn't know how to get there so because da mo doesn't have a distinct sound or style he just settled on a bunch of chill stoner soft jazzy rap beats that sound pretty but don't really offer anything to engage with I guess you could smoke to it and maybe have an introspective moment where you think about how hard life is but yet you can afford the luxury to just be high all day that's just how I'm feeling about this record I'm feeling a decent strong 4 on this thing transition have you given this album listen did you love it way more than me did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino demo Genesis forever 
bnlr59qTWQ8,uh hi everyone honey tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of nothing nothing whatsoever because this is not a review video I'm going over my favorite albums over this past month it's a it's a favorite great albums video for the month of March I have a list of albums right here there are links down there below where you can listen to music from these projects where you can watch my reviews from these projects so let's get into it here we go musical highlights from this past month kicking this thing off we have the drones with the album feeling kind of free this is a really fantastic Australian art rock record with some dense noisy instrumentation a few tracks that are more on the electronic spectrum of a few tracks that are more on like the post rock spectrum some really interesting tracks in this record I think the drones most ambitious record to date some wonderful songs on this thing just some some intense instrumentation just so textured so it's explosive it's artsy it's gritty it's grimy there's so many good things about this record I just cannot say enough nice things about it I think it's I think it's gonna be one of my favorites of the year and another favorite of the year from my dude cornrow Kenney a kay Kendrick Lamar with untitled unmastered Godman even his demos sound great why why is this man so magical why yeah this is this is a friggin great record I think it's gone me a little bit more since I initially reviewed it as some of the lyrical themes behind this record have kind of revealed themselves to me also thanks to some of you getting mad at me and being like that's not what that songs about and that's totally fine that's totally good I was sort of in a rush to do this review because I felt like I wanted to do it like weird and raw sort of like the raw demo quality of the album itself and if there were mistakes in the review then you know totally bucket I was mostly happy with how it came out but I wish I did have more to sit with the record that I gave myself more time with it but you know I still enjoy the the album a lot I'm still happy I did give it a positive review and that I didn't understand into the record I was like oh this is just demos it's not a big deal this is demos but in fact these demos are great they're great demos great combinations of soul jazz funk 90s boom bap style hip hop a lot of different styles and flavors coming together on this record and some of Kendricks most thoughtful verses - over the past couple of years you know even though there are moments where the production is a little muddy the instrumentation and Kendricks writing and his flows are on point and they're impressive it's just kind of a matter of getting past that demo vibe of the tracks and just enjoying the the songs for the ideas that they're putting forward we have the savage new Denzel Currie record Imperial if you're looking for some hard-hitting trap with some fantastic fast flows and some decent verses - and some of Denzel Curry's best hooks to date check out this project we also have lemon demon my dude Neil coming through with this new lemon demon album over here a really punky fusion of pop and rock music on this thing with some fantastic creative song ideas to say the least the production is a little loud it's a little bombastic kind of looking for some breathing room at some points personally just listening to this thing but still there are a lot of highlights on here it's a very creative and fun album very catchy - and a very eccentric EP coming from Charli XCX Sophie on production with this thing just some really totally wigged out pop music with some insane instrumentals and Charli XCX surprisingly melds together with Sophie really well on this project I know some people this EP rubbed the wrong way but I don't know I'm hoping that Charli XCX does some more stuff like this on her next full-length album because I think the totally just wackyland style instrumentals really complimented her cocky and in-your-face delivery we have the new Big Ups album before a million universes if you're looking for some post-hardcore that is super dreary very dynamic you know loads of soft very subtle depressing moments jammed right up against these hard-hitting and heavy and aggressive explosions of rock ferocity then definitely look into this especially if you're a Slynt fan a lot of Slynt influence on this thing and finally we're going to end it off with the various artists compilation the southern family compilation a load of alternative country artists coming together on this project and delivering some really great songs David Cobb producer sort of masterminding this thing so all the instrumentation comes together really cohesively you know there are no horrible slicks or thumbs on this project it's all just very good organic tasteful modern country music some really good balladry each artists coming through with their own story and their own emotional flavor on this track their own mood but but again the instrumentation is all organic it's all great and it ties the whole thing together even though you're getting 12 tracks with 12 different personas here and those are the records that I want to recommend to you guys one more thing on my second channel that is the plan I do a weekly series where I talk about my favorite tracks of the week they're very raw videos they're shot in one take on like my iPhone but still I do weekly recommendations of tracks that I think that you should check out and all the tracks videos from this past month I'll stuff them down there in the description box too you guys can subscribe to that channel if you want to stay up to date on those weekly track recommendations and that's it thank you for watching Anthony Fantan o that the music music transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you do best you the best so should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die albums down there in the description like I said and have a nice day and the Fantana music forever 
wPR7j3RQDYo,hi everyone country poblano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new various artists compilation southern family this is a various artists compilation of a myriad of different singers across the contemporary alternative country spectrum all produced by mr. Dave Cobb you might have heard his production before on that last Sturgill Simpson record I know a lot of modern country fans enjoy that record quite a bit so if you're looking for you know more of an organic a roots ear country sound then I think you're gonna like what this compilation has to offer and with Dave Cobb kind of masterminding this whole thing being at the helm of this whole thing he's there to guide the sound of every single track so even though you're getting a bunch of different artists across this compilation the sound really ties together from one track to the next there's no song that really sticks out as being vastly different from all the others it's a fluidly cohesive project which is pretty surprising because usually various artist compilations they're not that at all they don't feel like they're crafted to be listened to in kind of the album sort of context or usually all over the place no not the case on this project it's like dave is the coach and every musician on here is like a team player so as I said a lot of different artists on this thing 12 to be exact who all bring 12 different songs and this compilation is a very beautiful blend of country music some folk rock a few soul like southern soul vibes coming through on a couple tracks a splash of gospel as well and the production is smooth that's definitely not the old dusty rickety country sound that we once knew but it's also not the pristine sanitized slick ultra commercial sound that has chased so many people away from country music since the late 90s and the early 2000s each song on this track really feels like it has its own personality to it and the instrumentation the guitars the pianos the pedal steel the bass they're all very dynamic they're all very well mixed there's a lot of breathing room in this mix and each voice on this record is given a really intimate spot in the mix to the performances are pretty organic think along the lines of like Bruce Springsteen's Seeger sessions maybe not quite that in the moment as occasionally it sounds like Dave Cobb might bring in like a string section or something that could have been added later and it's not just that each track comes with its own singer and its own mood but also its own story too on the song God is a working man we have a tale of religion and family and belief our protagonist here is singing about his family's Pentecostal background and have some of those rituals including snakes at points would sort of weird him out make him question religion make him see you religion as this crazy thing but then he finds his I guess own sort of way of believing his own sort of faith in God and he portrays God as this deity that works hard for mankind in the way that his father and grandfather worked hard as everyday working men it's a really sweet and endearing song and even more endearing is the song down-home where again we have a tale of family and home kids running around loved ones it's just a nice gentle warm hug of a track with some saloon style piano embellishments to add a little bit of instrumental flavor that I like a lot and it seems like the tracks just get more and more precious that we have the song grandma's garden where the garden is essentially a metaphor for the family that the grandmother in this track raised the instrumentation on the verses is so gentle in the way that it blossoms on the chorus it's like the sound just hits you like the wonderful aroma of good home cooking deeper into the track our singer tells the tale of being brought to tears having to say some words about his grandmother at her church that she had gone to for like 60 years I imagine after she had passed away and they were having awake I guess that the title of the same southern family you have to anticipate that so many of the tracks on this thing are oriented around family that theme continues on the song mamas table with Jamie Johnson he easily has the most weathered and worn voice on the entire project think you know maybe a little bit of Willie Nelson influence in his singing and the whole track is about his mother's table as a meeting place a place where family history is made not only good times but also you know him talking about his brother going crazy carving his name or initials into the mom's table and he talks about over the years how much wear and tear the table has seen and while that table is beat-up there's also a lot of memories around that table and the song learning with Anderson East I love the story on this track as well talking about being raised by his dad talking about going out with his father having these experiences with his dad as he was a kid and essentially these experiences culminating into his manhood learning how to be a man from his father in this track as I previously mentioned is one of the songs that kind of brings that southern soul flavor that I didn't totally anticipate from this compilation you know think a little bit of Booker T and the MGS especially with that you know very a very high-pitched church organ thrown into the mix the song can you come over is another big instrumental production in the mix over here with the background vocals the female background vocals that are just hollering they're loud they're passionate the harmonica the funky bass line the track just whomps on this groove I don't know it sits or reminds me of The Rolling Stones a little bit but I know it's not pulling from that totally it's got a root seer more aged feel than that I just like the cops off it to work this big instrumental presentation toward the back end of the record to really you know save some of the best instrumental bits for last now there are certainly a few lows in the track listening here but they're not so low that their tracks that I would skip or that I think are terrible just tracks it to me pale in comparison to others there is the track settle down which while it's another endearing track it's just so short in comparison to the other cuts I felt like it could have been fleshed out a little bit more and what could have been shortened a tad I think is the six minute rendition of you are my sunshine by Morgan Stapleton you are my sunshine being a track that we're all very well familiar with at this point and it is a very slow trudging but passionate version of the song and while I don't think their rendition is bad it's just the six minute length is a little excessive especially among all these tracks that to me are superior and far more original now of course the compilation is not without its tearjerkers as well there's the tracks simple song that kicks off the entire project which it's it's got a very modern tear in your beer vibe to it I'm surprised that the compilation kicked off with such a sad tune and then the track I cried from brandy Klark her vocals on this track are heart breaking she channeled a little bit of Patsy Cline on this track I think and it came out so good it's cool that you know a few just gut punches were thrown into the mix here because so much of the track listing here is generally so soulful so warm so hopeful which don't get me wrong that's great I think it's a part of the charm of this compilation but you know also there's some nice emotional diversity to this thing as well you know you have your easygoing tracks you have your slow ballads and you know you have your tub thumpers that just have a really great groove lots of loud instrumentation lots of passion lots of fire while this compilation isn't perfect I think it's a really good cup and I hope that this collection of tracks here sort of sparks a new trend in country to go back to roots your instrumentation like this really bring country back to what makes the genre so fantastic the singers the songs the stories and you know the sound of good organic instrumentation I'm feeling a strong seven to a late eight on this compilation transition have you given this compilation a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you do best you the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die various artists southern family forever 
AYfYvYdlxmc,hey everyone Antoine Antoine here you know who it is Internet's busiest music nerd all that jazz before we get into this review want to give a shout-out to our sponsor on this review the good people over vinyl me please they are a vinyl of the Month Club brand-new exclusive pressings of fantastic records set to your front door every month also exclusive access to their store were even more unique exclusive pressings sit they are linked down there in the description box not only do you get that record every month you get some background on the record a little bit of a drink recommendation to go with the album some 12 by 12 inch art you can hang up around wherever you're listening to this record and yeah that's it guys so again they are our fantastic sponsor want to thank them again for that once more hit him up down there in the description linked to the review band yeah I want you to hold my hand I hope you're doing well and it's time for a review of the new black mountain-- record for this is a photo album from Canadian sack rock and stone a rock outfit black mound 2 they have been at it for over a decade now it's been about six years since we've heard from these guys in a full-length studio album capacity though they did drop that year zero soundtrack like in 2012 still though it has been a while and in my opinion with their last full-length album they didn't exactly leave on a high note they sort of stripped out of their sound all the progressive and epic and ambitious musical qualities that I thought made their previous record the record previous to that in the future so great however the teaser tracks from this new record over here I was pretty excited about this album because I thought they were incredibly good they were dynamic they were heavy it sounded like the band was including those ambitious song structures back into the formula not only with giant guitars that had kind of an old-school vintage classic rock vibe to them at points but also with retro futuristic synth leads that I just not see coming but we're into Black Mountain style pretty well so I really had no reason not to expect good things from this album and Black Mountain did not disappoint from the intro track mothers of the Sun which has these really dramatic organs which sounds super ominous very dark buzzing heavy guitar leads in there amber Weber's vocals on this track sound beautiful her voice has kind of a cultish feel to it at points her voice works very well with Steven McBean all over this record they have some pretty great chemistry and this song is one of the longest in the track listing here it has multiple phases to it some heavy some subtle some hellish and some heavenly like when there are just loads and loads of group vocals worked into the track to feel almost gospel inspired and you're getting lyrics like mother your children it's a really grand start to the record and this record I see a sort of a balance between in the future and Black Mountains last record which yeah while it wasn't as ambitious it was more straightforward it was punchier and the band goes punchy on the very next track Florian Saucer attack where you get these driving guitars driving drums it's got kind of a proto-punk feel to it seems somewhat Joan Jett inspired especially with Amber Webber wailing on top of the track with just loads of fire coming from her vocals she is fire-breathing her vocals are shaking at some points in the song with intensity and somehow the band still manages to work in the sci-fi synth leads with this track and they still sound great the records first misstep in my opinion though is on the song you can dream where the bubbly throbbing synth arpeggios all over this track consistently from beginning to end clash with the roaring desert guitar leads that just aesthetically they don't complement one another and then as far as the refrain goes on this thing the lyrics are not that good dream baby dream dream dream dream I mean at this point of dreaming for some better lyrics on this track so yeah definitely low point for me on the record but things pick back up instantaneously on the very next cut constellations where you get this cow coming through in the drum be and these staccato guitar riffs they have a lot of swagger to them it kind of reminds me of like a Queens of the Stone Age song didn't think black mountain-- could pull this kind of thing off but they do and once again with some eeriness to not only coming through on the vocals but those retro-futuristic alien synth leads somehow appear here again they're really kind of the the theme the sonic theme of the psalm that ties all these tracks together and and here they work - now past the halfway mark of this record Black Mountain starts just throwing out some slow jams in fact the whole second half of this record is a lot more mellow than the first half the song cemetery breeding which I think has one of the most melancholy and just stab you right in the heart lead melodies is a track that lyrically seems like a tribute to friends that the band has lost over time another interesting lyrical moment comes through on the song crucify me which seems like one of the most vulnerable spots on the record the track does kind of end abruptly though which is a little disappointing but generally I like how subtle and soft the track is there are these really wonderful embellishments coming from since and piano all throughout the track a little acoustic guitar back there it's a really vivid soft luscious wall of sound coming through on this track the only thing kind of breaking up this very vast soundscape being some really cool pronounced drum fills - you know the kind of drum fills I'm talking about and in the second half here the band makes sure to take us on a few psychedelic Odysseys as well the song over and over the chain is a buzzing wall of synths and roaring guitars that seem like they're improvising for a lot of the tracks um droning organ worked into there - it's a very tense wall of sound that I like a lot the closure is pretty psychedelic and vast as well but to me it's it's definitely one of the duds in the track listing here it's definitely not one of the cuts that just keeps me on the edge of my seat I guess the band sort of decided to take a more relaxed approach for this records final moments on this album which was a little unexpected because it felt like they were building up to something it would have been appropriate to just put a big finish in there considering how just non-existent the ending of crucify me is I thought they would kind of transition into a big closer from this very somber and easygoing track and that's pretty much the record in a nutshell I think this is overall good it's a decent return for Black Mountain I certainly like it more than their last record it's not blowing me away but if you're looking for a psychedelic stoner heavy somewhat classic rock influenced synth prog pilgrimage then this thing is going to be worth checking out I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen there's a love it did you hate it what would you rate it you do best you the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe Orioles I Black Mountain for forever 
tdGi7dP5zwg,oh hey everyone both in the band tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Zayn album mind of mine Zayn aka my main main Zayn is actually Zayn Malik singer pop singer pop star and formerly of the boy band One Direction and as the hashtag says it's been about a full year since Zayn left the explosive pop sensation one direction to pursue his own solo music career and the music press is really all too eager to support him in this move hoping I guess that he would come out with something great but in the process of that I feel like it was ignored just what usually happens in these you know sort of post boyband album Affairs boyband has created boyband explodes lots of hits or produce the star fades the members sort of go their own way start coming out with the solo records and then they are met with mixed reviews and as many of them are just not really that good there have been a few very notable exceptions to this cycle though guys like Justin Timberlake who post NSYNC has seen incredible success with not only his solo music career but with acting as well he's just an anomaly and I think Zayn could achieve similar critical acclaim he seems to be interested in making music that's a little bit edgier or at least slightly more mature than what he was doing in one direction but in order to get this critical acclaim he's gonna need a great solo debut and that is just not here I did dig the pillow-talk single building up to the release of this record I thought the production was explosive and I thought lyrically the song was at least mildly interesting talking about sex love pillow talk kind of being I don't know this this weird dichotomy of love and hate war and paradise the single gave me a reason to look forward to the record and going deeper into the album the song it's you I thought was decent as well the track kicks off with these wavy cyntha sighs or cords that feel like they're coming straight out of an organ the song almost feels like it's going to be taking a religious tone or something the music is backed up with a very simple beat kind of sounds like it's coming from the quietest shyest 808 of all time and then Zane's vocal melodies especially on the refrain here as he reaches into his upper register is kind of seductive kind of pretty but the album doesn't really offer anything all that interesting beautiful moving stirring seductive beyond these couple of tracks I think the album's quality takes a nosedive pretty quickly and Zayn pretty much throws any chance of conjuring a distinct personality on this record out the window - like on the song before where essentially this track is zayn trying to rehash the same formula that drake had on hold on we're going home the song she is one of several tracks here like drunk and the song take it off we're essentially zayn delivers some very flavorless bland sexually charged electro pop that seems like the only reason it exists is to sort of fuel the carnal fantasies of Zane's obsessed fan base and since I personally have no sexual fantasies about Zane none that I would admit listening to this record just really does nothing for me pretty much the only thing you can do to this record is lay there listen to it and imagine yourself I don't know just lying in the sheets with Zane staring into his eyes maybe you guys are drinking and smoking a little bit you guys are using naughty language there's the intermission track here which sounds like this weird acoustic bit with a kind of foreign musical flavor it sounds like I don't know DeVotchKa trying to write a song with absolutely no song idea in sight and the song fool for you the two near has a bit of a vintage soul vocal pop flavor to it that is not complimented at all by the modern production nor is it complemented by Zane's lack of vocal chops or the really insipid lyrics the song wrong with Kalani she's really the the shining star on this track she actually makes this song vibrant as her and Zayn reach into their upper registers on the hook where they're both singing very passionately definitely perks my ears up it's certainly a better cut than any number of the subtle tracks in the second half here all of which are very underwhelming very boring because Zayn just does not have the voice or the emotional presentation to make a solo record especially the softer cuts on a solo record entertaining or emotionally stirring yeah there's there's just not really too much in the way of anything great about this record for one Zayn gave up any hope or chance of coming through with a distinct memorable sound way too early he was kind of close on the first few tracks but then he just just really gave up and then instead decided to drop a bunch of Airy flavourless by the numbers sort of alternative R&B tunes that are just so painfully uninspired this thing is so standard it's so blueprint or at least is trying to be that I think it actually falls short of that I think your average alternative R&B record would have at least been slightly more interesting than what's been presented here this is just a pop record with no personality whatsoever feeling a three to four on this thing transition can't be given Salim listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die Anthony Fantana insane in the membrane forever 
9MwGVZ9vIbI,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new young thug mixtape slime season 3 Atlanta rapper and singer young thug apparently this is the third and final installment in the slime season series mixtape series and I wasn't exactly excited going into this new project over here especially given that young thug's last mixtape I'm up was pretty mediocre pretty much just uninspired rehashes of what young thug does on almost every single song for like 8 or 9 tracks however I am thankful that this new project over here is short as well just like I'm up this thing only has 8 tracks on it and 8 so-so tracks are certainly better than 18 so-so tracks but I guess there are some notable improvements that slime season 3 features that were not on I'm up the lyrics are definitely more audible it doesn't seem like young thug is slurring every single word coming out of his mouth also his vocal performances are wilder sometimes he's yelling sometimes he's screaming sometimes he's just doing some really weird screechie squeaky inflections he seems to be taking more risks with his vocal delivery and just getting a little more eccentric on slime season 3 and there are actually some worthwhile hooks on this thing too whereas there were just not much of any on I'm up now I won't say the chorus is on this thing art is sleekly crafted as they were like on the rich gang mixtape with rich homie Quan and Birdman occasionally the lyrics are hilarious young thug definitely puts his best foot forward right at the start of this project with a line about how a girl sucks his dick on a plane and he calls her airhead young thugs little Wayne influence definitely pourings were you there but like little Wayne young thug is very capable of coming out with a myriad of corny I roll bars as well like she plays games like the NBA or one line that he had where if he wants to see titties he'll eat it and how he could be your teacher because he has the ruler like I said this tape is more lyrically intelligible than young thug's past few but that doesn't necessarily mean an overall improvement because all you're really making a sense of are a series of bars that are not that good at his best on this thing lyrically young thug is like kind of putting together a decent little wayne verse and like decent by today's standards like I said this project isn't really about bars as much as it is just about young thugs while vocal delivery over these verses and the very smooth bouncy synthetic production from London on the track which there are plenty reminders of that and the really moody melodies in this production fits buggers very musical vocal delivery nicely and there definitely some production highlights here and there like there's a little I don't know I guess keyboard passage on the song memo that emphasizes the upbeat of the song that reminds me a little bit of reggae but outside of a few standout moments the production feels pretty average for London on the track as his young thug generally on this thing you know while I do like his vocal performances on these verses he's just not backed up with a spectacular song a spectacular beat so it's just kind of like things aren't really adding up you have a few elements here and there that are good or stand out but they're not complemented with equally good production equally good lyrics like I said there are some memorable refrains here and there like I'm in I'm shit young thug's vocal delivery on the songs written is just totally off the wall but even the high points on this tape just feel painfully formulaic and blend just so deeply into everything young thug has been doing over the past year or so at the end of the day this is just another redundant uninspired just-so blueprint young thug project it's ok while it's on but there's really no reason to return to it especially when around the corner you know he's just gonna drop another project that sounds exactly like this I feeling strong for two la-5 on this thing it's just so deja vu at this point young thug is just not really taking enough risks or putting together enough coke songs to really justify eight more tracks of material ten more tracks and material 18 more tracks of material try try try transition I've been given this tape I'll listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you divest your vests well should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you might die you don't want that to happen young thug slime season three forever

I've always wanted to say the name of my guests like this so you know please excuse me let me do this here Mitch Grassi amazing thank you so much you know I thought you'd be a good guest to try that out with yeah you know what I love a bit it was amazing presentation thank you hey I'll incorporate it more in the future awesome yeah so before we get into it just thank you for being on the show of course yeah thanks for having me um moving forward I'd love to talk about singing you're come up the the growth of the pentatonix and and after you know save the best for last we can have a little music discussion - yeah and talk about some of that this is some of that weird obscure stuff that you know some of your fans some of my fans might not be totally turned on - I know you're big into igloo ghosts you know we'll get it all yeah okay perfect okay um so so pay me a picture here give me an idea of sort of where you're beginning sitting you know I know it's been about four years since one of the first episode of the first uploads to the pentatonix channel yeah now it's sitting at 10 million subscribers thank you for coming to slum it on my youtube channel today buddy but you know III know before that you've been in choir you've had a passion for singing for a long time you know where exactly did this desire start what would you know give me an idea where the spark sort of came from sure I mean well for me I had always been interested in music it started out when I was about nine years old and I was in musical theater so I had always had a passion for performing and I'm being onstage but there was a time in my life when it was middle school actually which is you know the worst years of anyone's life and I dream every I became very introverted and shy and then I sort of turned to turn to music and electronic music especially and I sort of fell in love with that and I think my path veered a little bit toward music production and songwriting and the more obscure musicians um so I think you know III shied away from from musical theater demand became more of a musician I think it just went from there and then I did choir and I did theater again later on in life but um you know it's always about the music mm-hmm so so that's kind of a time period from middle school to like about high school we're talking about here yeah okay so getting into music production I mean you've sort of uh not that I'm trying to sort of out you here as a producer or you know like making bedroom music or anything like that or demanding that you drop something but you know you sort of have your own amateur experience and sort of desire to sort of put together your own electronic music I assume that you you've done this before I do yeah it's a very preliminary stages I mean I you know it's it's very time-consuming it's very tedious and time isn't something I have right now obviously and I'm also incredibly a DD so it would take a lot of just like locking myself in my room and focusing on the da W and figuring it out but eventually that's something I want to come around to okay so so talking about these more alternative forms of electronic music that that you obviously have a passion for what you sort of ended up on this very different road where you know you're on huge stages millions of fans watching your videos where you're sort of doing these acapella renditions of very popular songs yeah you know sort of what veered you into that direction well it was uh it was actually Scott who started this whole thing we Kirstie me and Scott were friends in high school and there was a video competition at for acapella groups so I didn't go out and meet the cast of Glee in Los Angeles it's very glamorous and mm-hmm we put together that group and you know I mean I wasn't against it necessarily um you know I wasn't its alcohol wasn't something that I had strokes ribbons strived what does that word to do but you get my point um mm-hmm but I was like what the heck I mean it's it's something to do I love music it's another avenue for me and you know it it all went from there and so you know once once a group like the the pentatonic sort of reaches this pinnacle that you're at right now sort of and you know you guys were just released out would you call it your debut album or your sophomore album because I know that your your previous record was like a Christmas record okay yeah it's tough to say I mean we've we have a number of EPS out right now but yeah I would say this is our debut original album for sure yep okay so your debut original album over here so you know focusing on more original music here what is it like sort of transitioning from this cover process to this process where you know you're forcing yourself sort of collaborate a group and come up with something that just didn't exist before yeah I mean it was really it was quite a challenge but it was actually a bit of an adventure I mean we got to go into the studio and every day was with a different songwriter / producer and and sometimes it was horrible and sometimes it was amazing it was kind of like a blind date actually and it was it was really cool to be able to explore a different creative avenues different styles and genres and kind of figure out what our sound is and I feel like we're still trying to figure out just what that sound is but um you know but I think we've made great strides musically you guys sort of come together on this this common ground of a cappella music but you know talking about how we're some of your preferences lie within electronic music are there other sort of large preferential divides musically between you and the other members of the group I mean I wouldn't call them divides they're definitely we definitely all have way different tastes in music but I think that's what's kind of cool about is that we can bring all these different influences even though it is a cappella we can bring all these musical nuances into the music and kind of have this weird hybrid genre you know that that we can write - mm-hmm and uh sort of moving beyond some of the electronic music that I know you like you know you're talking about being in choir being a musical theatre I mean obviously there has to be sort of a soft spot in your heart for some of that stuff as well I mean I'm sure you're into some of the early Disney musicals I mean there are are there other musicals out there that you know you sort of a are a huge fan of oh yeah for sure I mean I was obsessive when I was a kid about musicals I know every single word to rent I you know I love wicked I love all the classics I I haven't really been up to date with what's going on now though in terms of like newer Broadway musicals but but yeah well you know speaking back to that old school that you just that you just brought up there where do you feel like and not to sort of talk just about musicals but just kind of vocal music and pop music today because it just seems like generally the the discussion around vocals and and vocal music today it's almost sort of trashed consistently in comparison with the past where it seems like singers were more raw that was raw talent there there were fantastic performances there was no auto-tune there was no studio trickery to hide when you had a bad night you're you just were singing up to snuff right um you know is is that sort of era just romanticized was it really better than then do you it was it really better than now do you think singing today is just not what it used to be in a way oh my god it's tough to say I mean I don't want to shit on anyone you don't have to name any name no no I would never I mean I'm so bitter in that way sometimes when I hear quote-unquote singers on the radio and I can hear that they're dripping in auto-tune and it sounds like a computer is singing and I'm like why are they you know what makes them so popular but I have to realize that most everyone in the world isn't there for the voice it's more of the whole package and what the entire song slash production sounds like so I understand that as a business you don't necessarily need to have an amazing singer slash musician to have a successful product so I can respect it in that way yeah well yeah it's it's certainly production at songwriting to its image as well you know and I thought being being where you are you know especially uh not just with the pentatonix being a becoming a well respected group within the music industry but also just YouTube too which is a very visual medium you know you guys appreciate the visual and the look of a group - you know how much focus in your mind is sort of on that when you're creating something and you know does it ever become disheartening sometimes when maybe to the audience from your perspective it seems like they're putting to em too much emphasis on that on the visuals yeah yeah sure um I mean it's tough to say I think it's I think it's pretty important but what's cool about it what's cool about pentatonix is that we like to key in our videos we like to keep it simple we like to basically just show you what's going on who's singing what harm instead of you know being a purely aesthetics based group sure if you know what I mean I think I think it's for us it is more about the music and and and our different parts that are so integral launched our sound hmm yeah I mean uh sort of talking about you know seeing people in the videos seeing the members of the group in the videos singing it's just I don't know it just strikes me as really interesting how vocals and singing it's sort of a musical instrument and a musical practice that almost anybody can relate to so it's almost important for people when listening to music to be able to understand the lyrics or maybe see the singer because it's it's like the quickest way to relate or understand to the music on an emotional level absolutely yeah totally and and what's cool about our group is that we're all so incredibly different so being able to see us and how vastly different we all look from each other is also something that's really cool because you know our fans can pick one of us to latch on to and relate to and that's also a really big part of our brand is that we're so diverse um another thing that's sort of different about your group and and maybe this is not so much today because there's been a proliferation of YouTube musicians online over the past four years since you guys started but it seems like with how much headway you're making you guys are doing a lot to sort of break down what was once before sort of a stigma with musicians on YouTube oh yeah I mean in terms of what like what was this thing in terms of just like a respect within the music industry itself it seemed like at one point there was just very little crossover between people who had potentially millions and millions of views and listens on YouTube and they're probably a little more popular than some musicians who might be established in the music industry but the music industry it seems like they didn't want to sort of reach out that olive branch to people who are sort of doing and doing it themselves like you you guys were independently at one time on YouTube for sure yeah um well I think it's I think that's a recent development the YouTube artivist yeah you know a lot of people are becoming really well-known from YouTube and I think you know one of the reasons we became so successful is that you know record labels were seeing us and they were like wow they did that completely independently it's almost an anomaly that they garnered so many this isn't me bragging by the way brag all you want this is your bragging pedestal thank you they granted so many you know fans off of YouTube and so many dedicated fans I think was the most impressive thing is that our fan base is just so supportive and they will literally buy anything or do anything just because they love us so much and it's I mean that love is totally reciprocated to we you know we wouldn't be anywhere without them and that's just a fact yeah you know just being the age that I am I can't help but compare it back to a point in time when when I was growing up and it seemed like as legitimately great as a lot of pop music that you and I grew up with was it seemed like much of it was just manufactured and handed down to us from on high and shot on the radio stations and from the record labels and it was just like well this is good we're telling you it's good right whereas now it's just so much more democratized yeah yeah totally what was the question I'm sorry no there was no question there was just kind of a statement just looking for you to react to that basically you know the democratization of tastes online as popular as you guys are nobody can really take that away from you guys because your fans are passionate they're legitimate and they're interested in what you're doing because I'm doing it well not because anybody is telling them to be into it or anybody's for size down their throat you know yeah absolutely no I see you're saying no yeah no I totally agree I mean there are so many different types of music that people can latch on to nowadays and I feel like the the spectrum is broadening in terms of what pop music is and you know what what people actually like it's like there's not a specific type of music that people are into now because there's so many different kinds oh my god yes you know the Internet just gives people so much access now to so many different sounds and it's like you know even with people who watch my show you know there are people who are into X Y Z death metal band I'm reviewing and then they're asking me to review the new Lady gaga record right yeah and you know while that world seems really freeing and like almost as if as a community of music fans we can listen to him we can enjoy anything there's almost like a lack of a safety net there you know there's a certain volatility to the internet because what's hot today may be totally gone and irrelevant tomorrow all right you know sort of what are the challenges that that you and and pentatonix keep in mind when you're thinking okay you know we need to do something new this time around we need to try something different you know is there always an emphasis to experiment try to keep up with the times or do you guys feel like you can sort of stick to what you know and continue to please your fans I think it's a balance of both honestly I mean we do love to push the boundaries we like to think of we like to come up with things that are sort of gimmicky and attention-grabbing and yeah we do there is a part of us that likes to stay current because we want to grow and progress with the market as well but we also have a brand that we don't want to totally abandon so it's not like we're gonna all of a sudden have like crazy bass drops and production in the background yeah it's you know it's not it's not part of who we are so it's it definitely is a balance so obviously there are going to be any crazy bass drops working working their way into your songs into the future but you know sort of what concessions are what could you see the group making in terms of maybe other sounds or other kinds of instrumentation honestly what I would love I think this would be more of a live thing but I would love to do some vocal looping and live electronic vocal alterations I think that would be amazing that's something I've always been into using the voice as an instrument and sort of manipulating it electronically I just thought you know harlot Hollie her done yes yeah I just saw her in concert and that was a big part of her show is using live vocals and manipulating them into a whole new soundscape and I just thought that was totally amazing if there's one thing I like about her music consistently it's that you know I saw this I don't know if you've caught this but there's this great boiler room set with her how do I have to oh it's really cool some of the stuff she's doing live and what was so like heartbreaking when I saw is like the dislike bar was so extreme on that side oh no like and I know yeah okay it doesn't sound like the usual boiler room set I get it but she's doing some really cool stuff with her rivals how info oh yeah you know the the thing is I mean you know some of the weirdest stuff out there if you expose it to a group of people who just do not expect it they're just like why don't they hate it all right that's so good I feel like boiler room has so many different types of musicians to that's really oh yeah well I I I will say that her set was a little indulgent you know there were large swathes of time where she was just kind of being very indulgent with her vocals it was pretty cool I said yeah it was there was nothing to really speak of like rhythm or structure or anything going on in the background it was very much kind of like watching I don't know the evolution of amoebas into like multi-celled organisms or something for a while and then all of a sudden it becomes something you know down the road and then once it gets there it's like okay you know now we're cooking with gas over here it's a while but I understand that yeah yeah well that would be really interesting you know it kind of sounds like you're talking about I don't know doing a wild live image and he kind of thing oh yeah yeah she's my favorite oh really yeah you know is that mostly due to her music or some of the interesting things that I know that she does live um from me it was mostly her vocals that I drew influence from I am a lot of her nuances I have subconsciously copied just because I have listened to her so much over the years but also what's amazing about her is that she produced just her music and she does do a lot of it live and she's the most type multi-instrumentalist and an inventor it's you know I could go on and on it's no it's true it's absolutely true all right so uh give me a little taste and an idea before we talk probably more about some of your favorite music over here as to what people can expect if they come out and they catch the pentatonix live I know you guys are working on what you said earlier the production of the show yeah you know you guys are typically a vocal group but what do you sort of do to sort of step beyond that and bring the audience a little extra when they come out and see you in person sure yeah well I mean a lot of it is production it's gonna be a really really cool show in terms of production but you know there's a lot of staging and a lot of movement involved it is going to be an actual conceptual show instead of just us standing in a line across the stage and singing which can be very effective but I feel like since we're kind of moving up in terms of in terms of venue size I think we have to kind of bring it a little bit because we have to match the energy of the room so so yeah it's it's definitely a real show okay so what what are we and you know if you can spoil it a little bit yeah what are we talking here in terms of concept you know are we talking visuals their story here is there a theme um there will be lots of visuals there's sort of an underlying uh what I'm looking for like we are in this together we did this all ourselves sort of theme that kind of runs throughout the show and it's sort of I guess family theme as well but um but yeah I won't spoil too much it's it's gonna be really cool actually I have them today is the first day that I'm gonna actually get see all the production so you know I don't actually totally know what it's gonna look like okay that sounds sentimental heartwarming exactly yes is there a moment like in an usher set where a fan is brought up onto the stage and you guys sort of grind on him like that there may very well be easy like that I don't know about grinding necessarily it might not be part of our brand to do that but that's true that's true I wouldn't see it in the brand but if you guys wanted to just play a little more racy and branch out yeah I know I said all about okay um where can people find out about this tour and just kind of know if you guys are coming to a city near them yeah you said it's starting in April it starting in April technically yeah and then it's gonna extend pretty much for the rest of the year but we're doing Europe and Asia North America twice okay yeah um oh and you can you can find the due dates on pjx official calm slash tour okay cool all right um let me talk a little bit about music with you I know that you watch the show for some reason which is totally crazy I yeah I I appreciate that very much so you know you're into a lot of alternative electronic music what's up with this new igloo ghost EP I'm really excited about everything that he's doing and he has a new album coming out are you into any of what these guys over at PC music are doing - oh my gosh yeah I've been obsessed with PC music since day one you know it reminds me of just a lot of weird 2000s vocal pop but just totally whacked out in in a weird way you know I never quite appreciated stuff like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera when it was around right I was younger but it sort of has made me want to go back and listen to it again yeah there's this a producer who goes by the name of Clarence clarity are you familiar with him I'm not he is this weird UK pop music producer who's hugely influenced by like boy bands and are and but amuse it the the the production is so glitchy yeah it's so weird Clarence clarity the album is no now it was one of my favorite records of last year and I don't know it in a weird way it just made me think like yeah you know what that devil Backstreet Boys thing it like wasn't that bad because when I was in high school I remember I was like an angsty metal kid I just like I see that yeah yeah yes you see that in me yeah I see that in me thank you I appreciate that yeah I was an angsty metal kid I hated everybody I don't have any anything to do with anything yeah and I feel that way oh do you yeah what do you do when you have that feeling how do you how do you how do you indulge in that oh god I just listen to aggressive music like like whoo Hoosier Hoosier go to it was the most aggressive thing that you listen to the most aggressive oh my god well I'm feeling badass a long time ago when I was an angsty teen such as we were talking about I am made a playlist called empower me and I wish it yeah I think the first track on there was Pluto by Bjork and that was one of my like angry song little game it's like dancing around his room to Pluto by Bjork just getting his aggression out yeah keep going in that playlist keep going oh my god oh I don't even remember what it was I feel like nowadays it's probably like Sophie or like I'm looking at my at my iTunes right now uh or it's just like hard or like happy hardcore or something mm-hmm okay so something that's not necessarily like angry angry angry but it's very visceral it's very physical yeah so if you're moving around and there's a hard-hitting beat it allows you to just vent yeah abscess entually yeah mm-hmm I got it so I know that you you know are into artists like igloo ghosts like Sophie I know you like techno some house too you know is is there sort of a soft spot for any IDM for you like FX twin or Autec or anything like that like super obtuse sort of you know that's it's I don't even know what you would even call it kind of like listening to computers heartbeat or something yeah yeah yeah absolutely well I am I actually have I don't know if you knew this or not but I have an a fixed-wing tattoo on my left left arm oh no I did not have that fun fact fun fun fact about me um so I do love aphex twin and I mean I am very fascinated by the different multitude of sounds that that synthesizers can make so yeah I'm totally into IDM I've been trying to get myself into a checker for the longest time and I'm not giving up it's just all my friends that our producers are like we love outer core you really need to get into them and I'm like I'm trying my best but it's so visceral and so just off the wall but I can certainly appreciate it for what it is is is do you feel like it's it's hard to sort of connect with the music on a human level or is that something that's not totally necessary for you sometimes a human level in what way I guess in I guess in rock music or vocal music it's sort of easy for me personally to sort of see the humanity or the human touch in the music whereas when I listen to Autechre sometimes it's like I feel almost as if floored that this music even came from a human you know it seems almost like 1% computer-generated sometimes yeah which could be a challenge in itself you know the mind favors melody the mind favors patterns to sort of totally break away from those wants and those desires that the brain naturally prefers when it comes to organized sound can be a real challenge not only in the creative process but just to listen to it and try to appreciate it from that angle as well yeah for sure yeah I mean I I think what I like about it music like that is that it doesn't really sound like it was man-made it sounds kind of like it's its own entity I don't know it's it's just so interesting to me yeah you're right I can't believe that people actually make me music like that like what is the process and are there patterns or it's wild um are you into a square pusher at all do you like a new square pusher I do like scrap for sure I don't know much of um square pushers stuff but I can I'm definitely into it I mean you know he definitely came up at the same time if X twin did and totally if if you like drum and bass if you like jungle if you like IDM but with more of like a jazzy twist yeah he he's fantastic I remember in probably college I was obsessed with him for a while and I didn't know too much about electronic music back then I assumed that he was like like this really huge guy and everybody knew about him within like later down the road I was like oh wow he's just like not as relevant as I thought he was interesting yeah I thought it was pretty big too I see his name everywhere yeah yeah I mean I think he was I think he definitely had more popularity at one time maybe like in the late 90s early 2000s but then he sort of turned to like a little bit of a recluse and I think he just kind of keeps to himself I remember there was this interesting interview Andre 3000 of outcasts at one time where he was like completely just praising everything he did and he was like oh he's so great he's such an amazing musician I would love to collaborate with him and and he essentially like responded it was like no no I'm not an not in session like you know and and I don't know how much he knew of Andre or you know or anything like that but maybe he sort of knew some of the outcasts hits or something it was probably around the time hey yaa was popular shortly after that and I think he you know he might have said something like well I don't write love songs or something like that you know I was like oh well you know okay whatever so yeah he's a little bit of a curmudgeon but he's amazing at what he does sorry yeah alright so if you were to you know have the time we're sort of I'm not I'm not you know predicting the end of the group or anything like that I'm not wishing for that but you know if we're in a post pentatonix era or if we're in an era where you do have this time to sort of make the electronic music that you want where do you sort of see yourself going you know so what are some of the first sounds or concepts or ideas that you'd like to make or sort of explore yeah sure um definitely something bass-heavy and something I think it would be really interesting to go the the twigs route actually aware especially with her latest EP where her songs are very I suppose like a journey and they have different sections and I think what I'm more focused on is the live aspect of my music so I would always keep that in mind if and when you know I I produce my own music because yeah I don't know I love performing so much and I think it would be cool just to have those different moments in the show well that that's something that in some ways is sort of overlooked now you know it seems like when somebody gets an internet hit while the song may be good they didn't have those years of sort of practice and study sort of under their belt before that internet hit comes along out of nowhere and then all of a sudden they're sort of thrust into the limelight and then you kind of have like I don't know like a Lana Del Rey Saturday live debut moment right where it's just like a flop on so many levels yeah you know where's with you guys I mean you guys have sort of been in the I guess the trenches as it were sort of practicing your craft for years before you got to where you were and it's it's got to feel good to sort of have that solid foundation oh yeah absolutely yeah it's if nothing else not to belittle it at all but it's a it's an amazing starting point you know we could go anywhere from here you know and uh sort of putting that in perspective with I don't know the the consistent popularity of maybe some TV shows like The Voice which you know I'm not asking you to hate on The Voice or anything like that I think it sort of makes sort of becoming a singer easy not becoming a singer easy but it makes it seem like that to the audience like just about anybody can do it and sure you know anybody can put in the prac put in the time and put in the effort but it's much harder than just kind of simply deciding that you want to sing on TV and then people on TV like you're singing and then you're all of a sudden career musician oh yeah no absolutely not well she was like that especially so there's normally no no offense but there's no longevity I mean it's sad because these musicians are so hyped up about their potential music career especially when they win and then nothing happens and then we move on to the next season so alright um I just want to thank you for coming on the show thanks for coming over and having this conversation and talking with me about the the group and electronic music and just being a fan of the show I love chorus thanks for having me on no problem and the there is a rumor that I made up just now that people call you my bitch Mitch is is that true more or less yes that is more or less okay alright then great thank you thank you for answering that of course yeah we're gonna put links to information where you can find about found out about the Pentatonix tour and I'll put some Pentatonix videos down there I'll put Mitch's sex tape down there and spread that around please and and and just I appreciate you being a great guest thank you thanks so much 
AuV4nkRtPLg,oh hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who would be I'm making a quick video here to tell you guys that there is another video that would like you to go check out essentially it's Luis and I Luis of the David Pakman show David Pakman show great YouTube channel lots of news items on that channel regularly updated and they've been doing a lot of election coverage but they're taking a break for a little metal take over so Louis the producer of the show who is a huge metalhead and I could sort of make six six six black metal recommendations to anybody who is looking to get into the genre curious about black metal and maybe just wanted to try out a black metal record that they haven't tried before and they're looking for something a really nice to give a shot so yeah that's centrally it you probably click on my face and go see this video and there's a link down there in the description and yeah we're gonna leave it there six black metal recommendations cool forever 
zMygzOso8MQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the interest is culture vulture and it's time for a video where I put down some thoughts on Kanye West's latest record the life of Pablo not really about the music as much as about the promotional process and the fact that after this record saw a widespread release on title and of course there were tons of downloads of this record all over the Internet Kanye saw fit to change the record very slightly but still change the record all the same the current tracklist of the album is a little different and Kanye as he said on Twitter fixed wolves he put Vick menses verse back on the track he put CEA's vocals back on the track I was expecting maybe something entirely different or just different mixes whatever but this leaves some questions open for me is this a sign that Kanye isn't really all that committed to this artistic statement or is it a sign that he cares about this artistic statement so much that he would continue to change it after it had already seen mass exposure and moving into the future should albums be changed once they're released can the album become this living breathing ever-evolving thing or should it kind of be like a test that an artist works hard on away from his or her audience and then hands it in and if it's good it's good if it's bad it's bad the way Kanye went about changing this record reminded me of a few different things in other artistic mediums it reminded me of new computer technology it reminded me of software it reminded me of video games things that consistently have software or hardware updates or maybe downloadable content that adds to the previously existing thing that you purchased and maybe makes it function better and in the internet age doing this sort of thing with albums is incredibly feasible especially with cloud streaming and platform streaming as well as platforms like iTunes where you can buy a record and then have the songs read downloaded if you lose them potentially you could have newer versions of songs downloaded onto your computer once you bought the album if you don't care for the older versions where you want to update the record already I could see some people kind of call sacrilege at this you know imagine how many classic and fantastic records that have come out over the past 15 20 30 40 years they were to see large-scale changes like this there's already enough drama and hubbub over albums from The Beatles and Pink Floyd when they're undergoing some kind of remaster process and then all of a sudden the new version sounds totally different because EQ and compression and mixing have a lot to do with how a record sounds imagine if these albums we're starting to see changes compositionally and lyrically now it's all very possible for this stuff to happen and it has happened but moving into the future is it probable if this were going to be some kind of regularly seen model ten five years from now just like anything in the music industry it would have to generate either buzz or money and when Kanye West says or does anything it's guaranteed hype it's guaranteed controversy so for Kanye to do something like this it's kind of understandable for him to take these sorts of risks it's only going to mean more attention for him at the end of the day but what about more obscure groups what about indie groups what about groups that are doing it full-time but they're not internationally known or anything like that there might not really be the financial incentive for them to continually write and rewrite the same album over and over and over again now I guess out there already we already have demo albums we have remix albums we have live albums we have remixed songs with new instrumentals and features from other artists we have things like that new borås album that just dropped which is essentially a grouping of tracks the band has already played already recorded songs that if you're a fan of the band you already know them but now they sort of accompany Murs bough just adding some you know extra noise into the mix for decades musicians have always done a really great job of following the power of technology and allowing technology to empower them to make some really interesting art and I guess what's going to need to happen is some musician out there is going to have to take it upon themselves to take this risk do something different and maybe provide some kind of weird conceptual art piece that like I said earlier is ever-changing and use these platforms to continually evolve this piece of art for listeners and of course this piece of art is going to have to be great and it's going to have to be moving and it's going to have to be entertaining or else this idea is just never going to catch on we're going to need a powerful record to sort of plant this seed plant this idea in the minds of other musicians but maybe allowing something like this to happen and accepting something like this could potentially be really bad for music or potentially paint music itself into a corner look at the movie industry right now how many movies come out every year some which are decent that are just merely reboots of stuff that came out 20-30 years ago it's so funny that that's just something that we don't really have in the music community nobody is coming out with a new record and they're like hey man we're gonna reboot the Beatles revolver you're never going to have this new rap group come out and just like reboot 36 chambers and just like redo the whole record but themselves there are some examples I could think of that come close their cover songs there are interesting covers albums but when these things happen they're not huge celebratory box-office events they're usually met with mixed reviews and a lot of people are groaning about how they ruin the classic also you can take into account artists that are new artists that come out they break out and they sound exactly like older artists or they're just pulling so heavily from older artists that is very much another way that you know sort of themes and sounds and ideas sort of repeat themselves and modern music much in the same way they are repeated in a movie reboot I'm getting off track though all that being said could new internet technology bring us into a future where the album is an ever-changing piece of art if album sales keep dropping then maybe this will sort of be a thing you know people will have incentive to stream a new album every single time it gets changed that could be a way that this works or is everything I've said dumb and make no sense and will never ever happen um idiot dumb ass in a way it's sort of it puts the control back in the hands of the artist once an album is out there typically especially if it's on a physical medium you can't really do anything about it it's out there that's part of what makes music so interesting it's not like you're a painter and they're just kind of like one real copy of your painting out there and of course you know you could sort of make copies and take pictures and all that but there's only one authentic version of this painting with an album every single copy of that record is the same as any other copy you can't buy some other copy notes and it's a better copier the more authentic copy or anything like that I mean I guess you have like master tapes of a record but we don't like hang those in a museum you know what I mean if everyone is streaming and the artist has full control over that one album everybody's streaming online and they can changed at any time maybe this could be a trend that occurs pretty regularly turns out this feature didn't work turns out that mix was bad turns out that track was a filler track turns out that single wasn't a good single there could be a myriad of reasons to change an album once it's out there on the internet so is it going to happen is it going to happen do you want it to happen I don't know what else to say so just some thoughts guys transition what are your thoughts reactions ideas opinions in response to my ideas thoughts reactions and opinions in this video you guys are the best imperium forever 
aqA46RPQdZA,uh hey everyone comedy meme tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a new segment we're doing a brand new segment on this channel maybe gonna do it every month on or off see how it goes where we dive in to a handful of records that are on sites like band camp obviously self uploaded by the artists themselves and not just any albums the darkest weirdest strangest most unsettling funniest most disturbing and I guess most head scratching records that we can find on the platform it's called it came from Van cab and essentially we're looking to prove that the Internet you can really upload anything on to it and for some people that's just too much responsibility without that responsibility without that freedom you wouldn't have records like joestar's the life of Winston this thing features of course the typical the life of Pablo and it is a weird mashup record you will catch Soulja Boy on this thing a little bit of waka flocka flame of course right at the start a wonderful Guy Fieri sample where people are finding common ground in flavortown also Linkin Park's cry mixed with the main theme from Super Mario World there's also a wonderful dank dark trap rendition of the spongebob theme right at the very end of this thing and for the low low price of one thousand Australian dollars this can be yours it's also on Jackie Chan Records and the tags to ensure high high search engine optimization include words such as meme depression and scooby-doo so they're the the life of Winston our next project is naked Luigi this is an electro pop album that is all about some kind of weird slightly sick xual disturbing a relationship with Luigi from Super Mario Brothers the production on this thing is super cheap super terrible the singing is not that good but the lyrics are hilariously obsessed with Luigi about being in love with him about breaking up with him about people breaking his heart about Luigi breaking this guy's heart there's rapping on this thing as well some weird effects laid out of the vocals occasionally there's a skit where our protagonist here takes Kirby on a date because he's kind of using Kirby as a rebound from Luigi there's a weird karaoke track where our protagonist is singing Eddie Murphy's party all the time but a sentence a party all the time he says that he we jeez all the time we jeez all the time we jeez all the time yeah this was this one's special and again to ensure high search engine optimization in the tags on this thing are the words kids and of course Meta Knight it makes sense this next project is from a prolific singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist bedroom producer hot dad he has numerous albums under his belt but this one in particular grabbed my interest it is titled wrestle and it's like 21 songs all the songs are under two minutes and each track is in tribute to a different famous wrestler so called steve austin John Cena Randy Savage Cain mankind Undertaker and also Hulk Hogan his track makes reference to not only his reality show but I think that racist quote slash fallout that he had not too long ago and he sort of pleads with the audience or people who hate Hulk Hogan right now saying that he's the only Hulk we got and that we all need to do the Hulk stomp and maybe the funniest thing about this project is that every instrumental here has this really weird demo ish 80s synth-pop and pop rock vibe to it even on the tracks where you'd figure that for this particular wrestler he's definitely gonna do a hard or a heavy or an angry track or a spooky or a dark scary track nose sometimes even with the scariest wrestlers he makes the lightest most playful wimpiest music it's like if if all of these wrestlers had TV show themes for their own personal sitcoms or something in the late 80s or the early 90s Undertaker's specifically he sings about how it's time to party and Undertaker we love you it's beautifully weird and some of the songs are legitimately catchy our next project here is a yellow moon and vortex of craps oh hey look a collab album which is a collaborative record and the front cover here obviously features yours truly and the one the only Cal Church esta this thing came out via the abortion collective and was allegedly released like many other releases from the abortion collective on September 11th 2001 and this thing is essentially a bunch of samples from popular music loaded with a ton of very noisy and just ear-shattering jump scares the sample that you're listening we'll all of a sudden be very quiet and then it will shoot up like 30 decibels into this distorted and shocking wall of sound but after checking this record out because it is pretty short I couldn't help but be perplexed by some of the other releases from the abortion collective one of which is a tribute to John Cage's for 33 it is for 33 the album if you go on there I guess the abortion collective delivers their own cover of 433 and then deeper into the project you have the rap version the pop version the rock version and the version featuring Kanye West and to ensure top-notch search engine optimization in the tags are words such as piss core and anti music also absolute shit at least they're honest and we're going to close things out with another terrible record elevator grips self-titled the theme the concept behind this thing is pretty obvious elevator grips MC rides vocals mixed into elevator music and I guess I could see a lot of these instruments gentles being played in an elevator I mean it's so musically bland the music here is just so every day so nondescript there's nothing really to say about much of any of it honestly but I don't know where's the light jazz on this thing the music on this record doesn't really read to me as elevator music per se I'm looking for something you know a little slow easygoing maybe some vibraphone worked into there so it's really relaxing much of what's on here just sounds like I don't know crappy generic MIDI instrumentals with MC ride thrown on top not really elevator music per se I would have loved to have seen a bigger contrast in terms of intensity between the instrumental and ride himself if the music were ultra relaxing and ultra laid-back and very swanky that to me would be funny and an entertaining contrast this instead again just seems like generic MIDI instrumentals with ride on top but those are all the album's that I want to feature in this very special segment it came from band camp let me know what you think of these records they're all linked down there in the description box very special music very special music guys on the Internet make sure to upload more more wonderful confusing horrendous and offensive albums like these and maybe they will be featured in this segment in the future cool cool your best Tran now it's time to rock with the rock it's time to rock Tommy rock but I Baba you're the best thanks for watching please subscribe or you'll die hit that like if you like YouTube s I'll show you next pop it out pop it up forever 
qVG21PSiNKA,oh hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new okay no record made in the manner this is the latest full-length l.p from UK rapper Kano who is a bit of a vet when it comes to hip hop and grime in the United Kingdom it's been about 10 years as the release of his breakout full-length debut commercial album he's dropped a few records since then and the scene has grown since then too by leaps and bounds I have people asking me to check out and review the next big UK rapper every day there's new records coming out all the time I'm always hearing tracks or features from people like Jamie and skepta and Wiley I thought that little Sims record was okay not really a big fan of ghost poet but he's worth checking out I think Kate tempest has a lot of potential and Scroobius pip is a pretty interesting eccentric as well and then there's all the dudes over like high focus whose instrumentals have more of an American flavor a lot of the time if you're curious about UK hip hop I suggest that you try out any of the artists that I just mentioned without question now like I said it's been 10 years since kano break out with his debut record so understandably he would be a little I guess sentimental at this point and that certainly comes through in these songs I wouldn't say the album goes entirely soft though there's a good handful of bangers on this thing specifically the track no bag a new Baga which is a great single with a hard bee buzzing bass amp production that is just just it's metallically hard it's just steel reinforced and Kano comes with this rapid-fire flow lots of funny bars lots of clever quips the song Hall is a great banger as well huge introduction to the album itself some of my favorite bars are actually on this track one set of bars that I'm just going to put up on screen over here this is fantastic I also love the row the Rolling Stones reference in this little patch of bars over here as sort of having a hit when you cross the pond really clever the buzzing beat this track is kind of a dubstep flavor there's some tones that roar like their distorted guitars on this thing and then with the song three wheel ups Kano goes toe-to-toe with Wiley and gigs and it's just again another rapid-fire flow fest with these tracks Kano essentially proves that he's still very much at the top of his game when it comes to this grime shit but this album shows a lot of maturity and multiple sides of Kano there are plenty of topical and very introspective and personal songs in the track listing here too like on the track t-shirt whether in the manner where Kano sort of goes down memory lane musing about ribs and braided hair the ice cream truck in his neighborhood it's all very cute it's all nostalgic it's all endearing but then it seems like the last verse here everything turns really sour with a lot of his friends and remote artists kind of turning against him as he grows more famous the fame sort of bitters this sweet idyllic life that he once lived which is a theme that recurs again and again on this project actually on the song This Is England there's one line that pops up where he says that he's a Tupac in a land full of Suge Knight's that's on the song This Is England which is this really epic horn backed tribute and them to his home country it's very glitzy it's very glamorous it's one of a few instrumentals here that sort of read to me is something like I don't know Ryan Lewis would produce things get even more sentimental on the song little sis this track lyrically I think is one of my favorites on here though I don't really think the lyrics and the instrumental match the kind of very cold monotone delivery Kano has on this track still his efforts seem really heartfelt as he goes again back into his past and sort of tells this story about this sister that he has who he's essentially estranged from a strain from at a very young age and now he's just kind of left wondering what her life is at listen about it and if there's any real chance to reconnect this is one of the few tracks on here including the song strangers where it seems like Kano is trying to extend an olive branch and it's a really heartwarming moment or a couple of moments on the record a strangers to me the better these two tracks to me it seems like because he has this history with this person who now he is not really talking to there's even more reason for his voice to warm up a little bit on this track and it does and while there is two sides to every story quino's need his desire to reconnect with this person seems so warm and genuine that I can't help but be moved by the track so while this little sis track is decent the album sort of loses steam past this point as Kano continues to work this sentimental nostalgic angle but with so much less results like on the song a road man's hymn or drinking in the West End which is kind of this cutesy inconsequential bar story song the song deep blues with Damon Albarn on vocals who delivers a very chilly chorus on this track bit of a tit-for-tat thing because Kano has very famously appeared on guerrillas songs before and the verses are decent it's a kind of an interesting topical track about life kind of kicking you in the teeth but I don't know the refrain on here about life just getting real just doesn't seem as poetic as it could have been the song structure and I guess the the beat itself seems pretty underwhelming - the way the track transitions in the Damon Albarn's chorus it's just so just passionless really similarly to one of many tracks from a few of Damon Albarn's recent solo releases these several tracks in the center of the record really create a huge low in an album that had such a fantastic start thankfully the album picks up a little bit for a pretty big ending with the song seashells in the East which again has one of these glitzy glamorous beats not a lot here lyrically that's sticking with me but Kay knows some vocals on this track are definitely one of the moments where when he does manage to sing on a song it goes over pretty well K knows verses though I think get lost in the the huge clutter of instrumentation on this track but I guess is sort of made up for with the instrumental being so huge and punchy and dynamic sort of jazzy and the closing track hear my sound I see it as a closer because it's right before if you punchy bonus tracks the instrumental on this track takes on a bit of a Caribbean flavor and Kano just kind of talks about his passion for his music and his sound his style and that's essentially the track listing here in a nutshell it's not a bad LP and definitely one of the more promising UK rap records that I've heard in a while Kano brings a lot of variety a lot of versatility a lot of passion I just think he continues to work that sad somber angle a little too hard it's like he's trying to dig for gold when it's just kind of been exhausted by tracks like strangers and little cysts that I mean these are high points of emotion on the record high points that he's not really going to surpass or out in Deer still though all that being said this is a pretty decent record and I recommend that you check it out if you're looking for a hip hop act from across the pond that again has some topical tracks some mature tracks some hard-hitting tooth gridding in-your-face tracks I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it u2 best you two best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe or you'll die not really but Kano made in the manner forever 
cGmrG1JAYaQ,hey everyone packin Eman here and it is time for a few of the new the body and full of hell collaborative album day you will ache like I ate this is the highly-anticipated at least highly anticipated by me collaborative record from extreme music acts the body and full of Hell full of Hell being primarily a metalcore grind tower violence outfit they had a fantastic collaborative record with MERS bow not too long ago and then we have the body who are more on the slow droney sludgy end of the extreme metal spectrum their songs are typically topped with these shrieked vocals that kind of sound like a man pig hybrid being tortured to death in a nightmarish slaughterhouse they have a distinct sound but a lot of the time it doesn't really do too much for me but still though I do like full of Hell a lot and I do think that these two groups have some very extreme abrasive styles so it would be interesting to sort of hear them come together on a full-length record that is eight tracks and thirty or so minutes long and also includes a Leonard Cohen cover why now no surprise this thing is a musical house of horrors it's relentless right from the start the opening title track after a few lone spaced-out drum beats we get this hellish wall of sound it's just a solid monolith of blasts beat drums and grinding guitars it's the most disgusting ear bleeding wall of sound I've heard since the the opening track to that piss grave record that came out last year it's an exciting start and then the song all of a sudden busts into a second phase where the guitar slowed down everything's much sludgy er much doom you're way more depressing and dreary the body and full of hell sort of jumping back and forth throughout this album from one emotional and aggressive extreme to the next this track slides right into the song flesh works which isn't a bad track either it takes an easier approach but I will say before I get into this track every song here flows into one another pretty nicely even though this is a relatively short project it's very cohesive now the beat on this cut is primal it's hypnotic it's kind of repetitive it's lots of rolling fills and then we have these female harmonized vocals that pop into the mix that callback to other body projects where female vocals have been used to a similar degree they sound very pretty sort of cultish the track is cool but it ends somewhat abruptly as it seems to just be a detour to the Leonard Cohen cover on the third cut here which unfortunately is maybe my least favorite track on the entire album this song to me embodies most of what I don't really like about the body's music it's usually very slow and uneventful and it's just not freakish or detailed or progressive enough to kind of keep my attention throughout the duration of the entire track nor do I think the chord progression of the song really fits the brooding heavy vibe of the sound though I do appreciate that full of hell and the body tried to I guess stay as musically true as possible to this Leonard Cohen song without changing too much up I'm really happy they kept the blood-curdling scream in the original track I will say they are ambitious for trying though and I do like the production on here the crinkly white noise and the sputtering high-pitched sounds do leave this song feeling much more textured than a lot of the body's production generally the mayhem continues on the track Geralt where we have these booming just treble treble fill drums and over this we get just the psychedelic ugly wall of noise it's probably the trickiest and most echo drenched track on the entire project I wish there was a little more to the track musically but you know it's not often you get a sonic torture chamber quite like this one so well stocked with sharp implements now the last several cuts on here really where the heavyweights of the album the song Himmel and Holly is awe-inspiring ly harsh drone noise where the body and full of hell really enhance one another strengths and characteristics I was afraid that in a way they might cancel each other out on some of these tracks where we have songs where full of hell feels very present but not the body the body feels very present but not full of hell but on this cut specifically it just seems like they're all trying to create as much havoc as possible and it just blends together into the most sour vile putrid that of sad nihilistic ugly feelings that I've heard in a while the roars and shrieks and scattered drums and layer upon layer of buzzsaw guitar on this track are horrendously awesome the song bottled urn takes kind of an industrial approach to the production and I guess just the tone of the instrumentation it's a little electronic it's kind of metallic it's very textured and all these sounds add up into a merciless pummeling and the two bands really saved the best for last with the song the little death which is a kind of a French saying for orgasm and it truly is the climax of this record which is so crazy because everything up until this point has been so harsh so noisy so physical so brutal and yet full of hell and the body find a way to top all of it and come together with the most disorienting leave that in track on the entire record if an album as abrasive as this could have a powerful soul-crushing orgasm this is it overall I'm pretty impressed with how this record came out I don't have too many complaints other than that it's a little short and there are a few moments where I wish there was more of a musical memorability to the record not just you know merciless sonic beating and also I'm still not that into the Leonard Cohen cover and that is kind of a big misstep for such a short track listing though again I commend the the risk that the two groups took here regardless though there may be other people who are much warmer that cover than I am and even the tracks that aren't that cover I think are great they're hard-hitting they're just deadly this is a good record it's rare that I think full-length collaborative records like this come out so well so I'm just feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing really good good guys good decision have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you two best you the best what should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe or you'll die the body full of hell one day you will ache like I ache forever 
huLP9XM5bok,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new bauer record a a ah double a New York producer and DJ who hit it big a few years ago with the viral explosion of his single harlem shake baauer and while it is great that he had this song that sort of blew up out of nowhere off the back of a very hearty internet meme this kind of exposure is both a blessing and a curse plays money attention tour dates but also with Bauer's discography being kind of small and he was not an incredibly well-known producer before the the explosion of this track he risks being kind of typecast as the sort of producer who comes up with these goofy viral kooky bangers when he seems to be so much more being the Harlem shake guy is something that I heard he was sort of actively fighting against or at least just not feeding directly into the Harlem shake hype and rather than try to strike for oil in the same spot twice with the same sound and the same song Bauer has essentially experimented on this new record over here with a few different shades of electronic dance music from track to walkie to maybe a little bit of UK bass he also has tracks on here that very well compliment his guests grime rapper novelist m.i.a g-dragon as well as push a tee in future their songs on this thing that could be the soundtrack to everything from a club in the UK to a club in the US to the dressing room at a forever 21 now this thing is just smash your feet earth cinnamon earth sort of short considering how many songs are on this thing but they're actually a couple two-minute songs on here several one-minute tracks that are kind of like I don't know little filler interludes and intro and an outro truthfully though the record wasn't really what I was expecting I wasn't looking for a record of mindless bangers and I wasn't hoping that Bauer would just make a one-dimensional record like that but I at least expected this thing to be a little bigger a little bolder there are numerous cuts on this thing that are just forgettable which to me is just inexcusable considering how short the record is you only have so much run time here to make an impression so I figured what little material is on here has to be really good but the song body is very Airy it's inconspicuous sort of a shot at sensuality that doesn't quite make it the song pink ooh I do like the vibe of this track seems kind of like something John Talib ah would put together as a bit of a Balearic beat kind of thing maybe a bit of a European house flavor but the track is so short and unfinished and a lot of it is dominated by these spoken word snippets and another language it could be more significant as filler the song way from me is just way too sleepy and then even some of the bangers on here just painfully cliche and formulaic like the song make it bang where the vocal feature from TT the artist is so dominated by the beat that she barely even really leaves an impression on the track the record isn't even really that cohesive either Bower jumps around from one sound to another and sort of forgets to craft his own sound in the process the result is mixed results but among these mixed results there are highlights and there are tracks that I could see him taking a particular sound here I guess a kookier heavier punchy or more aggressive sound that seems sort of Harlem shake esque these tracks to me sort of have the most memorability are the most exciting are the most fun namely tracks like gogo it's not my favorite on here but it is one of the more flavorful bangers in the tracklist the monstrous rubbery bass on this thing is awesome the offbeat synth leads are really cool and the skipping vocal samples throughout the track just continue to add up to how overwhelming it is the song so as well is a track that is a banger but it throws a few left hooks in here like some really weird vocal samples from kids which are sewn into this really clunky be very sound rich very textured some weird I don't know Organic like rattling just metallic percussion has worked into there its tracks like this that are some of my favorites on here they're instrumental mostly they have some weird sounds worked into there they hit hard they're visceral they're punchy and there's sort of an element of how'd he do it he definitely put a lot of work into the sound craft of every little sonic element that went into this beat and it shows but I think the most inspired moments in the track listing here are when Bauer is paired up with his most top-notch vocal yes like em I am g-dragon on temple which features a beat that has this plucky lead melody that sounds like it's coming from the Far East mi A's delivery on this track is cool it's calm its collected its charismatic and g-dragon further adds to the international clash of influences that make this track so fun the very sleek and punchy kung fu with Pusha T and future is I think radio-ready this is a this is a banger it's great the chorus is a little I don't know who cares it's catchy Pusha T's verses for what he typically raps about nothing all that new but his delivery is on point it's energetic it matches the energy and the intensity of the instrumental and the song day ones is easily one of my favourite tracks of this year it's one of the songs that had me excited to listen to this record in the first place I have a feeling that this project was just put together to sort of surround the larger more successful awesome singles on the track listing here sort of give Bauer an excuse to tour because they'll have a project tour behind which again is totally fine there are some super great highlights on this thing but again the overall project is so short of breath there are so many tracks that feel semi unfinished or just nowhere near as exciting or as inspired as the feature tracks on here however I hope a few tracks on here hit it bigger so that maybe with a future project Bauer can work with more artists because it seems like like I said earlier the biggest moments of inspiration on here are when he had vocalists and rappers to work with really great vocalists and rappers to work with and if he had that going for him for 10 tracks straight eight tracks straight with maybe a few great instrumental he'd have a solid project unfortunately it seems like he didn't have as much vocal talent on this project over here so he had to resort to dishing out a bunch of sort of subpar instrumentals that just weren't that spectacular in its entirety the project isn't bad I think it's somewhat likable there's so many tracks here that pale in comparison to others and there was just so much potential that wasn't fully capitalized on that's all I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate at you two best you the best what should I review next

7bJL72EL-4U,I did not think I would be doing this but hey you know what let's life is life is all about surprises hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new little yachty album little boat baby boat little it's little boat yeah little boat is the breakout mixtape from Atlanta rapper and singer little yachty aka lil boat this tape isn't making the rounds for the past few weeks and I've spent that time span trying to make heads or tails of this thing in one breath this guy has a lot in common with your average auto-tuned Atlanta rapper and/or crooner who wants to be the next future or young thug but little yacht takes it a step further and somehow creates a distinct sound within this very saturated trend in hip hop right now maybe the most recognizable and ear grabbing thing about lil yachty sound are his vocals and they're quite goofy almost like I'm listening to a just smoked out cartoon cat sing and rap his way through these songs vocally I think he has things in common with like I love Makonnen maybe a fusion between I love Makonnen and bangs you know I want to take you to the movies but what little yachty has those two artists don't is self-awareness he seems to be very well aware of how weird his vocals and his sound are and he uses these shortcomings in his voice to create weird personality traits and quirks within his singing style the production is airy its ethereal its glassy it is infectiously blissful although it does have some hard sub bass and very tangible percussion so it's not like it's washed out and there's nothing really in the tracklist here in terms of a legitimate banger the song up next to comes the closest but even that track is relatively relaxed in comparison with mono know let's say any song that migos have dropped there is a you know an appearance from quavo on here this thing is liked rap music's answer to lullabies sure the sex and the money and the drugs and the references to violence are all here but there's something sort of sweet and warm and gentle about the way the music the production on this thing sounds and the way yachty delivers his vocals I don't know I just can't help but interpret his vocals as cute this is essentially pop rap and trapped with kind of a soft side and that soft side is reflected in the lyrics occasionally - not just the the front cover here where he is looking like a member of Team Zissou I mean there's a real sense of innocence about this tape I mean the whole thing kicks off with a Finding Nemo sample their tracks on this thing about relationships and heartbreak emotional betrayal song out late is a legitimately cute love song then there's the song fucked over and I'm sorry and yachties breakout hit one night the lyrics are occasionally silly and playful especially from some of the featured rappers on here Bayou favorite verse on this thing uh picking up bars like I'm benching catching a body like cheerleader but there are some other weird moments that yachty brings to the table like one track here where it seems like he's giving legitimately warm thank-you to a lawyer who he paid eight grand to win him a case there's the song we did at the closure here which is essentially a positivity anthem and the last portion of the song run running though I don't really care for the first half of the track all that much though I do like the production it seems the sample the very airy woodwind leads from some of the theme music from mario 64 loved that video game but moving on from there the second half of this track is this sort of weird beautifully melodic auto-tune interlude that reminds me of a weird fusion between again lullabies Kanye West and Bon Iver also keep in mind yachty himself seems to believe or at least States on the beginning of this tape and a few other moments here that he is two distinct personalities on this tape IATI is its own personality and boat is its own personality and yachty according to yachty is the friendly and the more I guess song oriented of these two personalities much of the singing on here is done by yachty whereas little boat is more aggressive and more likely to be rapping does it make sense not really weird yes but it sort of adds up to just how strange and oddball this record is to just kind of cast yachty off as just another weird no-nothing hedonistic lee and sipping Atlanta rapper would be wrong because underneath some of the very obviously borrowed ideas from his flows Daz production which are very trendy there's a really weird shit going on yachty switches up between these two personalities pretty often the tape isn't too one-sided toward the rapping or the relaxed songs although I will say I think that the the biggest characteristic appeal of this album is how relaxing it is that in the production while yachties vocals do have character a character that I like a lot his lyrics aren't exactly a selling point some of them are god-awful or just don't really make much sense diamonds so cold you might need a fan well you know there was a point where I was sort of coming back to this tape occasionally over the past few weeks just to kind of have a giggle at it and then after continually laughing at I was like wait a second am i kind of liking this at one point it was like sort of a weird novelty record to me but now I'm sort of starting to appreciate it a little bit and it's scaring me they're even tracks on here that like on paper I just should not like at all but they're some of the most charming moments on this tape to me like the blissfully dumb aura around the song good day in today's a good day hey now he will admit the vocals and the auto-tune do have their limitations yachty is a little one-dimensional and the auto-tune can get excruciating especially during that first half of the track run running where the melody that he says is there even a melody that he's singing here I can't stand his vocals here almost I'm just thinking what are you doing and there are moments here where while I know yachty is not a lyrical genius I wish that he just wrote a little more lyrics to sort of break up the monotony of not only verses that he just repeats because he doesn't write anything different for his next verse or just refrains that he seems to repeat ad nauseam like on the songs want to be us and not my bro also the interlude track on here just merely feels like an unfinished song that was left on the record while the song fucked over like instrumentally and melodically feels like a hybrid of one night and wanna be us like at this point on the record while I do like the to ending tracks it's like yachty is just running out of ideas this thing could have been pared down a little bit I think overall though surprisingly I like this thing i I like it I enjoy it I put it on and I play it and I'm having fun listening to it this thing has some very obvious flaws most of which are lyrical but I think a lot like records such as level of ASAP or trap Lorde these shortcomings are overcome with character great production personality a little bit of a sense of humor like I'm listening to I don't know an old loaf I pop record like bedroom pop record or something and the instrumentals are sloppy the singing is terrible but there's something really charming and lovely and heartfelt about the songs I'm not saying you got to like it and believe me if you came to me up on the street and said hey that yachty record sucks I will say hey I understand dude I understand I'm not going to defend it I will leave it at that I like the record it's not perfect it's not blowing my mind or anything and I doubt he'll follow it up with an album I like quite as much if he did I would be surprised but as of right now I am feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing but maybe in the future this thing will either become one of my favorite records of the year or my I don't know I'll just do a total 180 on it and I'll hate it and I'll think it's the worst thing that was ever recorded my feelings on this record I think really could be that volatile because there's just so much that I like about it and there's so much that I dislike about it and some of the things I dislike about it some of its weaknesses I actually think end up being admirable kind of quirky strengths in a way but uh yeah those are my thoughts on this thing transition have you given to some a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best why should I review next hit that like if you like yeah yeah yeah I'm got little yachty little boat breath 
ioXQscpdNd4,
O-Q6A-xxPlY,yeah hey everyone Metheny burn tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd shout out to my Australian viewers hope you guys are doing well down I'm not that wasn't even an Australian accent we're gonna do a review here of this new drones record feeling kind of free the drones are an Australian band on the cusp of their 20th year as a band one of the best rock bands in Australia I think their discography dips back into the late 90s where they predominantly played garage rock and punk blues but since then they have employed a bunch of different sounds and influences in their music most specifically on their last album the very ambitious icy seaweed some of the tracks on this thing were the band's longest yet really impassioned ballads on this thing big instrumentals as well as some very noisy abrasive barnburners influenced by noise rock and post-punk behind all the mayhem usually there's a little bit of social commentary maybe some politically charged lyrics in the drones music - so I'm looking forward to that I'm looking forward to the heaviness I'm looking forward to the beautiful songwriting I'm looking forward to a lot of stuff I'm looking forward to this album and do the drones disappoint No thus albums really great the songs on this thing are sort of on the long side again depending on which track you're listening to but many of them follow a very linear structure have very dynamic instrumentals that usually swell to a really big finish at the end and I think this record holds some of the drones most stirring heavy sour and colourful sets of instrumentals yet maybe some of the best rock instrumentals I've heard this year so far and it's really difficult to sum up the album as a whole instrumentally because each track really goes for a different mood a different flavor a different style the song boredom which is one of my favorites on here has this kind of erratic danceable quality to it where the beats are clearly a little synthetic and sequenced so in a way it's kind of electronic it's the Borden's making electronic music here but the sounds are really though organic the groove is awesome so the track still has the punch in the aggression of a rock band despite having kind of this robotic rigidity and frontman gareth littered on this thing is almost rapping in a way with some spoken word vocals that are riding a tempo and he's got this cocky charismatic delivery that i like a lot just a barrage or different references thrown out in these very dense verses and there is a really overwhelming guitar solo on this thing that i think is not only performed well but it's edited down for just more studio trickery and bells and whistles it sounds more like a really disorienting sound collage than it does just your average guitar solo and that's the thing about this album as a whole while it all sounds very raw and organic and punchy and the instrumentation has a lot of interplay it seems heavily edited like a lot of overdubbing just a lot added into this record just a lot of meaty details worked into these songs it seems like these tracks were very carefully and very densely produced so we have this track boredom over here but then things switch gears like on the song sometimes which actually has vocals from Fiona Kitsch tin fronting the vocals here and this track is like the drones weird and twisted take on like it's a splash of Portishead maybe a little bit of Bjork to the beat is in three four and even though it is one of the more subtle tracks on here it's very eerie it's also got kind of this looming heaviness to some of the instrumentation that swells in that while it is quiet it feels very much like the band could be playing way louder so it's like they're adding this gentle reminder here that like we know that this song is soft but if we wanted to we could crush you this track flows very fluidly into the unhinged closing track where Gareth with his vocals really shows off his love for Nick Cave he's got a very snide vocal delivery on this one the beats on this track are just lumbering the rhythms the groove I guess I'm saying and then these kind of heavy plotting verses are contrasted with these very soft voiced creepy little vocal interludes the band is a great job of just contrast on a lot of these tracks contrasting heavier moments from quieter moments but also making sure it all kind of ties together and makes sense and the instrumental bridge on this thing is like absolutely frightening like the strings what sounds like strings on this track just shriek with horror and all of this instrumentation amasses into an ending that is so huge that it would make godspeed blush and the album starts as heavy as it finishes with one of the biggest cacophony x' i've heard on a rock record in a while the drones delivered kind of this slow sauntering groove with this buzzing distorted bassline that kind of seems a I don't know like it's got a bit of an industrial flavor to it and over it we kind of get these schmaltzy lead melodies but they're being played by the searingly loud guitars that sort of just sucked out the playful tone of the melody and turn it into I don't know like staring directly into the Sun at burns and the lyrics on this track are unsettling they're tortured the opening line I believe is saying essentially that the best songs are like bad dreams and obviously you don't have to agree with that sentiment but it certainly seems like Gareth embodies that with this track feeling very much like a bad dream he goes deeper into the song on the refrain and he talks about how he wants to go straight to DVD metaphorically it's like this song is about obsolescence or irrelevance either falling out of Fame falling out of popularity or kind of causing that yourself by kind of pulling yourself away from the world becoming our hermit in a way he talks about in their frame also going into remission and losing his ambition and he would like a private execution it's like he's writing his own funeral dirge on this track and if that's not at all what the song is about you know hit up those comments because you know I suck at lyrics I I cannot listen to lyrics and interpret them correctly at all on another track I'm sure to get wrong the following Taman should a phrase that it was kind of perplexed by so of course I had to look it up and essentially the song seems to be inspired by a John Doe that was found on a shore in Adelaide in Australia in 1948 and nobody was really able to put together who exactly killed this guy I don't believe they uncovered who he was exactly I could be wrong on that but the weirdest thing about his body or the way that the police found his body is that in his pocket was a piece of paper that said talons should which in Persian means finish and it was ripped out of this very rare poetry book and then they had to find the book and it's just kind of this really weird you know cold case the rhythms on this track the instrumentation is really tense and Gareth matches that intensity with another barrage of lyrics these harder heavier more aggressive tracks are great they're certainly highlights on the record but there are slower tracks on here too that I think go over just as well like that song sometimes or the track then they came for me or another lead single from this thing to think that I once loved you which is this slow tender tearjerker really the ultimate breakup song for this year and the Ballad is complemented with this really lovely lavish instrumentation that reminds me a little bit of silver Mount Zion Orchestra and immediately after this track the band does a good job of balancing out this bitter with some sentimental emotions on track tailwind yeah I mean I don't really have too many complaints about this record I think the drones came through with a fantastic record this time around and I think they surpassed I see seaweed in a lot of respects I think the instrumentation is bigger it's more risky it's more abrasive there are more layers more melodies more textures more flavours the songs I think are great nothing too straightforward but nothing too obtuse either I think there's a good balance between the ballads and the tracks that like boredom are little harder a little more meaty a little more aggressive I guess on I see seaweed there were tracks that stylistically felt like there was a wide divide between a lot of them this one seems a little more consistent in a way and in such a way where I feel like the tracks all do a better job of empowering one another and I'm just really impressed with the way that Gareth and company sort of blend together this really strange array of influences I mean clearly there's some Nick Cave influence here there's a little bit of hip-hop influence on here there's a little bit of post-rock like first wave godspeed era post rock on here there's Punk and noise rock mixed in here too but everything is just so subtly blended that they're never kind of simply just playing one single genre at any given time the lyrics so they can be kind of esoteric and obtuse at points I find really interesting the vocal deliveries usually have a lot of conviction a lot of energy a lot of passion and they make me want to dive into the lyrics more as I give this album subsequent listens as I go in further this year because I mean that's that's gonna happen because I think this record is really great I'm feeling a strongly to like 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would your rating you the best you the best what should I read you next hit that like if you like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the drones feeling kind of free forever 
u_sQjEc8--c,ah you gotta break out the yellow flame oh yeah you're talking about a legend here hey everyone ledge than the end tan oh here here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new pop record post pop depression rock icon Iggy Pop new full-length album over here which you know maybe not everyone in theory is excited for a new Iggy Pop record but it's the new Justin album and this isn't simply a solo album from Iggy Josh and Dean from Queens of the Stone Age as well as Matt Helders drummer for Arctic Monkeys join him on this record so it's kind of a collaborative effort especially since Josh seems to handle not only the guitars but the production on this thing as well and it definitely sounds it not only from the flavor of the guitars and the guitar tones on this thing but the way that the drums and the vocals are mixed a lot of the time can be likened to some of the production stylings on Queens of the Stone Ages latest record like clockwork which isn't necessarily a bad thing that record was produced very well and I do think it is one of the better rock albums of the past five years though this album in comparison is not quite as aggressive or punchy or compressed and instrumentally I think it takes a slightly more subtle approach it's not quite just balls-to-the-wall rock record take the song vulture for example which has kind of a spaghetti western vibe to it does this sound complement Iggy Pop though are the songs good are Iggy Pop's vocals well performed generally all the answers to these questions are yes I think this is a pretty good record it's solid it's on point I like the vibe of this album too there's something kind of weird and stiff about it that reminds me a lot of Iggy Pop's the idiot which is a pretty great record and an interesting sound and vibe to return to at this point in his career except on this occasion with the production sounding a little bit like the production on like clockwork there is a harder rock edge the music on this thing has a weird balance of emotions it's uneasy it's weird but it's also muscular and well-defined a lot like the current day physique of the lizard man himself and it's a pretty varied album too Oh Iggy Pop and company go for a different instrumental mood on almost every track here but before I get too deep into the tracks I want to talk about the title of this thing a little bit post pop depression which I think says a lot I mean we could either be talking about post the pop music era that Iggy Pop comes from the rock and pop music eras that he comes from which at this point are dead and gone or maybe we're talking about a post Iggy Pop era post Iggy Pop depression as in like his career relevance is over and gone or something which is maybe something he has had to reflect on now that we've had an album like black star just drop I mean we have these amazing rock gods who have dropped just game-changing albums dying left and right they're in their twilight years they're dropping their Twilight records and they're reflecting on these themes of just things being over and coming to terms with death and coming to terms with this lack of relevance in a very real way and in a way I think this album over here is Iggy Pop's own ode to his own bygone era and with this theme in mind of course the album has kind of a dark undertone to it it's Moody it feels almost as if it's in mourning but also it's catchy and it's kind of sweet on the ears Iggy Pop makes his intentions known on this album right from the opening track one of the lead singles from this thing break into your heart where he dramatically proclaims wanna break into yo heart this album is not a challenge it's not a cerebral mindfuck it's trying to charm you it's trying to as Iggy Pop says deeper into this refrain crawl under your skin sorry on this track and on the rest of this album Iggy Pop plays the role of the charming oddball and he does it well and a lot like David Bowie did on his last record I think Iggy Pop uses the where in his voice to his advantage the chorus on this thing is great but the verses Iggy Pop sort of seems a slink back a little bit while Josh Homme E's desert guitar riffs are sort of the star of the show also impressive is the song gardenia maybe my favorite track on the entire LP and other fantastic chorus whoa Lugo dude it's just this really cool shoulder swaying pop tune with a notic chorus that is just kind of washed over with these warm enveloping wavy tremolo guitars and lyrically Iggy Pop delivers this kind of subversive sexual angle it's almost as if he's this guy who was obsessed with a prostitute or something and he's trying to get with this particular prostitute who he sort of seems to have an infatuation with I also love the moments on this track where he kind of falls out of singing and and sort of dramatically delivers lines about her hourglass s on the song American Valhalla I feel like my presumptions about the title here kind of confirmed as Iggy Pop is looking for some kind of afterlife here or maybe just I don't know assurance that his name is going to be remembered once he's gone I like the rigid thumping bass line on this thing the very sleek smooth guitar leads that sort of contrasts very well from this hard groove it's kind of rigid and in the lyrics Iggy Pop sort of seems to be desperate for this American Valhalla singing about how who does he have to kill to either get there find out where it is talking about also how he has nothing but his name which he says a few times in a very sobering voice right at the end of the track again it sort of seems like he's trying to get into this American Val how I get into this place where he is remembered just based solely off of his fame and his street cred the song in the lobby is okay has some sort of intensified swagger to it sort of an ear piercing shrieking moment from Iggy Pop and the lyrics but the chorus seems built off of a riff that is either recycled or just borrowed or maybe a left over from like clockwork you know it's one thing for this record to have just similar production aesthetics but once guitar riffs start popping up that sound like they're borrowed literally from the record I'm just kind of I don't know just tuning out a little bit I feel so unenthused by it because I keep op while again I don't mind that there are similarities between these two records he's just such a standalone pop icon that he deserves his own sound and record rigueur this to me seems more like a moment on the album where josh takes over I sort of feel the same way about the final track on here as well I love the track Sundays though the groove of this track galloped into my heart by the 30-second mark of the song I was already into it it sort of seems like this weird fusion between disco topped with a Steppenwolf guitar riff and maybe a little bit of strokes in there for good measure I love the additional singers on this track too they had a lot of character a lot of color definitely one of the better tracks on this thing the song vulture as I mentioned previously loved that track too has a fantastic instrumental kind of a south-of-the-border flavor to it very dramatic and the huge noisy ending on this thing is unsettling and just mind exploding my mind exploded I'm now dead at EDD the song German days though instrumentally is maybe the messiest on the entire record and it's not necessarily a the better for it has promised right at the start with kind of a hardrock flavor but I feel like it just devolves from there into a bit of a clutter and the song Chocolate Drops might be a meditation on Fame and how essentially when you're popular when you're famous your shit turns to Chocolate Drops but it just kind of seems so I don't know trashy and sort of like they were running out of ideas at this point and the closing track which I already said I don't care for that much what I especially don't like in this track they're probably the lyrics on this thing come from Iggy Pop where essentially he drifts away from singing to go into this weird monologue or rant about technology and the information age where he's getting like angry at a laptop or just saying I don't want all this information ruah which just seems so weird and cranky and out of touch I just cannot get into it at all kind of remand it really ruins the vibe of the record for me but maybe it's because I'm at a point where I can't fully relate you know maybe in the future I will be totally angry and I will hate the virtual reality porn and the sex robots and the installed memory brain chips that the next generation is very likely to receive all of that being said again this is a pretty decent record some great singles off of this thing not too many tracks on here so the deep cuts on here that are drab that are boring that just aren't that great really do hurt the overall vibe of the record because there's not a whole lot of cushion in the tracklist here for Iggy Pop and company to be putting out a lackluster track still though a majority of it is good I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this thing transition have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it u2 best u2 best will should I review next hit that like if you like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Iggy Pop Post pop oppression album review thank you for watching forever 
VStEfKTZd18,ah hey everybody on the name the medon de tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new denzel curry album imperial young and ferocious florida rapper denzel curry brand new record over here it's a tight 10 track project and it's been a while since i initially reviewed his breakout album 64 he followed that up with some kind of weird inconspicuous double EP thing that certainly had its highlights but it felt like a much less distinct and recognizable Denzel curry he could have kind of been swapped out with any number of slightly aggressive cloud rappers on this project but here he is up front he's mean he's lean he's in your face he's very tangible and yeah just instantly recognizable it's good to hear him on something that is a little more meaty again Denzel curry though he may be young and it is reflected in his voice he does have the delivery of a junkyard dog cold blooded lots of conviction and I'm kind of glad he followed this double EP up quickly with a fresh and hard-hitting project and no doubt it was going to be that from the lead single from this thing alts this thing is a tight crisp snappy 808 flavor coming from the drums the keys are wide their watery their trippy their ethereal it's kind of psychedelic but it's just so explosive as far as his rapping curry brings these relentless triplet flows which he has amazing breath control on because with every syllable he sounds just as loud just as intense savage on every syllable and also with this track he has one of his best hooks yet I like some of the bars on here where he likens himself to a black metal terrorist or he says after math do the math later it's definitely one of his best tracks yet and a song that I think brings together the multiple influences that go into a Denzel curry song you have modern trap hardcore hip-hop cloud rap and a touch of Memphis hip hop as well like a big three 6 mafia influence maybe a Bone Thugs occasionally following this track is the song gook another banger and Infectious hook in which where he says he doesn't with purp that's how ASAP yams died and on this track lyrically curry paints himself as a drug user the one who isn't inhibited by his drug use he bets anyone listening that after doing drugs he could keep it ten times real or just perform at ten times the level of any of his competition and in a way I believed it because on this track once again his flow is relentless it's loud it is laser focused on the song sick and tired which is another incredibly aggressive track curry essentially raps about Stick Ups having to do stick ups and I guess support his wife and kid just in case you thought that this album was was nice or forgiving or reasonable in any way he's out here robbing people and on this track in particular Curry's delivery seems kind of desperate and manic and then on the second verse of this track we have Denzel curry rapping from the standpoint of the person that is being stuck up and on Noddy had a wild Rick Ross appears with no warning whatsoever and his verse actually isn't bad he actually makes for a nice change of pace from Curry's usual loud aggressive but somewhat monotone flow another banger beat but yet another lead keyboard melody that's super watery super woozy kind of warped a little bit Wow and on this track curry essentially paints a portrait of the cutthroat world of drug dealing among other things but then he turns around on the song narcotics and raps about stereotyping race racism and drug dealing and once again curry with that relentless flow hard-hitting beat you know structurally not that bad of a track but lyrically you know we're getting drugs guns Jail he's kind of running out of ideas at this point and this record isn't even that long though part of what might be contributing to this redundancy is that curries flow and delivery just sort of seems to stay at the same level of intensity without too much variation curry seems to ease up a little bit on the song story note title which seems slightly introspective and contains this hilarious line about him sort of dropping ether that make people think it's Easter because it's like a religious experience and he's talking about how he could be Jesus and why can't Jesus be a black guy even Luke Skywalker's dad was on the dark side there's a cool underachievers reference here and curry is essentially telling the story of his isolation as he's grown more popular in the rap game but still kind of continues to sit within these very violent surroundings and again he's very convincing he's very forceful even when he does drop lines occasionally like he's got beef but he's like not working at Five Guys occasionally he will drop bars that just warrant in I role or at least don't match the ultra aggressive delivery that he is giving us on these tracks now thankfully the song pure enough is the much-needed moment of subtlety and introspective that this album has been dying for up until this point curry legitimately sounds like he's in a moment of pain emotional pain and anguish on this cut as he sort of dissects very painfully the inner workings and and sort of the logic behind the life he's living in the world he's living in the last third of this record overall is a little more mellow than the preceding tracks there's a song with zennith with Joey badass with a slightly jazzy instrumental thankfully Denzel curry sort of lets up on the monotone roar of his delivery on the first half here that tends to make some of the verses kind of blur together and gives us something a little slower a little more thoughtful introspective like he's really inviting the listeners in to listen to what he's saying relate to him and sort of invite them into his world especially on the closing track if tomorrow's not here where he drops this amazing line about Medusa building a stone wall of human flesh I think this is a really good project but I still hear room for growth for Denzel I still think he could use more topic and delivery variation but as is Imperial is a really and a well-crafted catchy hard-hitting project the sequel to nostalgic 64 that I wanted the production on this thing is great the songwriting on this thing is great for the most part the bars but with the occasional I roll line are good Denzel Curry's flow is super OnPoint I don't have many complaints about this thing honestly I think in the future he has the potential to do something a little more ambitious and maybe even conceptual but as right now what he's delivered here is of high quality I think I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this transition have you given this album a listen as you love it as you hate it what would you rate it you do best you the best which that review next thank you yeah Denzel curry Imperial forever 
pZzjXiRUDHw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Flatbush zombies album 3001 a laced Odyssey michi Darko zombie juice and Eric Ark Elliott New York's Flatbush zombies and this is their independent commercial debut independent no label bitch I loved the Flatbush zombies last mixtape better off dead it made me come around to them I was kind of underwhelmed by drugs but better off dead solidified them in my mind as a really eccentric colorful rap trio who were incredibly gritty super in your face very distinct personalities among each person rapping in the group and with this new project over here I was just hoping hear everything that I've loved about the Flatbush zombies up until this point just may be refined into a really concise record as better off dead was kind of lengthy a little all over the place stylistically and emotionally maybe something a little more focused this time around on this commercial release would be nice while also kind of just sharpening the unique characteristics that have made Flatbush zombies so good now 3001 is a much more focused project at just 12 tracks and features an amazing front cover from mr. David Nakayama which to me is fitting because I've always seen the Flatbush zombies voices as cartoony sort of animated but unfortunately the excitement of the cover here does not translate into the music itself the record does have a pretty decent start though with the track The Odyssey a song that is as druggie as it is murderous the production on this thing is really ethereal it's kind of mystical the drums are pretty prominent but not so punchy that they're aggressive there's some pretty nice since bass on this thing some dramatic piano arpeggios there's something about the chord progression and the bass line on the beat that also reminds me a little bit of King Crimson epitaph pretty cool and Eric and juice and Meech all deliver these mid-paced flows with some non-sequitur verses just to kind of give a taste or as to what you're going to be hearing on the record Meech sounds especially devilish this track talking about how he writes rhymes or he does raps that causes Jesus to question religion it's one of the longer tracks here and I actually think it justifies the length immediately after is the song bounce which was a lead single to this thing and within the context of the record it's not bad it sort of fits the very smooth and ethereal vibe of nearly this entire album so it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb or anything and I really like the song r.i.p CD which features this grimy boom backbeat and is matched with these really dreary jazzy keyboards just really soft instrumentation that's just much just sadder than the percussion it's being backed by and the refrain on this thing is kind of funny as the Flatbush zombies essentially kind of lament the death of the CD as a popular physical medium for music juice comes through the very speedy flow Eric in his lyrics challenges other artists to do something different with hip hop he claims to see how formulaic other artists are in contrast to what Flatbush zombies are doing and Meech while I don't really mind what he's doing lyrically it seems like he comes through and his vocal mix is just way out of whack with what everybody else is doing bocalee he's just so much louder and it might partially have to do with just how he delivers his vocals he is easily the loudest the raspy Asst the grimy guy in the group so taking special care to make sure that his vocals aren't swallowing the beat that they're actually mixed into the beat and that they're not clipping or anything that just kind of needs to be taken into account I mean is a unique vocalist kind of like an ODB and after this track a majority of what's here feels like it's severely missing something the Flatbush zombies just kind of navel gaze over a series of tracks that are very spaced out and somewhat uninspired and I think the root of this issue might have to do with the production Eric's production on this thing in comparison with drugs and with better off dead especially better off dead is lacking the layers the bomb Basset II the detail and the colors that I've heard before somewhat disappointing it might partially have to do with an overall lack of very meaty long samples worked into these instrumentals I know that when you're doing a commercial release it might be harder to you know get samples cleared and to make your songs based purely off of samples because of all the licensing issues that can arise maybe that's what's going on or maybe Eric just wanted to take things into a more synthetic direction either way the end result here is just a series of beats that have much less punch much less oomph way less excitement and in a way it sounds like Eric could have produced most of these instrumentals with one hand tied behind his back like on the song a spike Lee joint while I do like the additional saxophones on this track those are nice the drum pattern the percussion the groove on this track is painfully lazy my ears just kind of glaze over on it and the songs take off good grief and new phone who dis are equally as lifeless when it comes to the instrumental I can hear Eric and Meech and juice doing their best to fill up this space and give us expressive verses with a lot of conviction but there's only so much they can do to sort of close this gap between their vocals and the production and what's kind of weird is that these tracks here are kind of the comeback moment on the record whereas the preceding tracks actually provide a bit of a breather kind of an interlude the songs fly away ascension and smoke break two of which are in an album so tight just completely unnecessary detours these tracks are even more spaced out than the general full-length tracks on the record so to just come out with a series of interludes that are just even more ethereal even more laid-back just doesn't seem to make much sense ascension does pick things up a little bit Meech does bring one of his most exciting vocal performances on the entire record he is especially aggressive here and I think this is one of the few moments where a more aggressive delivery does work over this very Spacey instrumentation that and the song this is it but there's very little or really just almost nothing here in terms of a banger or a track that I see having some serious long-lasting single potential which I've heard Flatbush zombies produced tracks like before in the case of thug pull and bliss this thing overall is pretty one-dimensional and sleepy and the hooks what few hooks are here aren't really anything to write home about either it seems like with the production having so much less punch that the trio wasn't really motivated to write choruses that really had a bang and kind of shook these songs out of there very relaxed and spaced out verses now I have no doubt that juice and Eric and Meech are still incredibly capable rappers I don't really have many issues with what they're doing lyrically or flow wise as well although occasionally I will say that maybe their flows do seem a little unsupported on some of these tracks with so many of the beats again being very laid back and not having a lot of punch I just think without great choruses and fantastic instrumentals and some good song topics to support them what Eric and Meech and juice here are doing lyrically just isn't enough to make up for the shortcomings of this record I think the ending here is decent at least the album itself is bookended by two great tracks I like your favorite rap song juice and me Chan Derek all respectively deliver three of their most amped verses on the entire project as on this track there being better supported by a more explosive instrumental with some pretty dramatic arpeggios worked into the beat it reminds me of something along the lines of mine off of a better off dead which I think was pulled off a little better there but still it sounds decent again kind of revisiting this vibe here I will give it to the record that it is consistent much in the same way like that new boss record was very consistent in how smooth and sleek and just easygoing and just kind of very middle-of-the-road not too many emotional peaks or valleys it's just very consistent at this emotional level at this intensity level but to me that's not what makes a record entertaining especially a record from Flatbush zombies a group that I know for being so explosive and over-the-top a group that I know that has a ton of character a ton of flavor but for whatever reason that flavor that character didn't show up in the beats and didn't show up in the songwriting here now I know that for a group that does it independently I know for a group that is underground it can be really difficult to just transition from a mixtape to a commercial record so I don't know at least in my own mind I'm going to kind of chalk the this album up to that and just hope that whatever they put out next is a little bit more in the red a little more risky I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it and what do you think I should review next Anthony fan 1005 push zombies 2001 at least i2c forever 
avUPRabkegM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new RNC Isuzu album not Dania these guys are a finish black metal outfit and this I believe is their fourth full-length studio album and though they haven't always wowed me I have consistently admired how adventurous their music is how many different styles of rock and and metal efuses together their debut album was like a black metal ode to space and their sophomore record took a lot of sounds from their debut but made them way more psychedelic noisy overwhelming a lot of the instrumentation just bleeding into itself but their last album though was one of the most inconspicuous releases yet it was just so middle-of-the-road but I guess as a result of that I wasn't expecting the man to really come back with a vengeance on this new project this thing is a big 70 minute statement which mostly consists of these long layered linear and loud tracks songs the feature heavy and hypnotically repetitive riffs to have a lot of punch and a lot of push the bass and drums are unwavering and they ride these grooves as the keys and the vocals and the guitars on top just create this whole mess of psychedelic metal mayhem in a way it reminds me a little bit of swans to be kind and the seer but a completely different vibe way more chaotic and obviously a bit of a black metal aesthetic to it to the whole record starts off with a really explosive opener set tar at track that features this thunderous riff in like a 5-4 time signature the way the guitars groove on this track reminds me quite a bit of Drive like Jay whose yank crimes specifically in the track here come the plows and I love how for five minutes on this track the band is consistently able to just give the track another level of intensity by adding a new sound or playing a little harder making things a little more dissonant just adding another layer and I the moment where a lot of this instrumentation just suddenly drops away in favor of these keyboards that pop in this really hellish organ eventually the man changes time signatures slows things down especially toward the back end of the track where I think maybe they take a little too long to just finish the song out you've clearly already kind of communicated to us that this wild ride is over just kind of give us the next track especially since when the band plays it quieter plays it more low-key they fail to really add any nuance that I think these more subtle moments could use you know the the quieter moments here are just about as straight forward and as basic and as easy to read as the louder moments maybe even easier to read since many of the loudest moments here are just so cacophonous with wild guitar leads flying in every direction drenched in echo drenched in reverb so everything is just kind of bleeding into itself the closing track here too has a similarly uneventful ending with these plotting circus organs that are just not pleasing at all there's also kind of a weak Wow guitar solo in the second half of this track right at the start of the second half that I don't care for it too much the melodies here the playing seems super weak and and that's the thing some of the guitar embellishments here aren't really that great it seems like the band will just incorporate a guitar line just to add a little bit of texture a little bit of color it's not really adding too much musically to the composition the band is playing which in a sense may be because a lot of these tracks sure they're structured but they don't feel like these very tightly wound compositions as much as they do these psychedelic black metal jams and since that is the case I feel like the bass and the drums could be doing a little bit more to vary the groove up and just provide a little bit more I don't know interplay between the instrumentation usually once the bass and drums find a groove within a particular passage of a track you can usually just tune them out because they're not doing too much and the vocals on this thing don't have as much presence as I've heard them have previous releases from this band either they are just totally lost in the guitar and keyboard mayhem or when they do manage to poke out they don't really bring much more than your standard black metal wretch now after this monstrous introduction the band heads into a couple of tracks that are much more low-key they are nocturnal their mystical their kind of a cult especially on track to here where who we have kind of these very icy keyboards they almost sound like viber phones pop into the track I wouldn't be surprised if it was a synth patch but it sounds very clean and clear and pristine and I can appreciate what the band is doing here aesthetically and sonically I mean it seems like they're really trying to provide a counterpoint to the harder heavier more aggressive moments on this record I wish these tracks were a little more cerebral and just had more going on compositionally they just extend past the point of interest for me as far as their runtime but I feel like just on paper they kind of get away with it because these five and seven-minute tracks are standing in the middle of these 10 and 17 minutes and these tracks don't become so excruciating that I'm dying to skip them or anything like that I would actually say for this record being 70 minutes long it's kind of a breeze to listen to there aren't too many patients testing moments on here I would say that these songs are simply just not as engaging as the harder in just louder spots on this thing now the 17 minute cut on this record in the second half is easily my favorite on the entire album the track preceding this one is actually one of the loudest and relentless on the entire record the song following this is the very hellish have these three tracks here to me are this album's longest winning streak but the 17 minute cut features just the most sinister riff on the entire album a riff so great and that I don't mind listening to it for as long as the band plays it on this cut and I love how just like on the intro here they find ways to intensify this riff intensify this track by adding more guitar layers just these bouncy equus spring reverb x' lots of ear piercing tones bleeding bleeding bleeding into one another it's psychedelic it's trippy it's overwhelming and then all of a sudden we just kind of get this bare-bones soundscape this apocalyptic interlude that I think is pretty nice reminds me a little bit of tangerine dream with some eerie and weary guitar Lee it's kind of laced into this soundscape and just sounding very creepy creepy and then all of a sudden out of nowhere this roar just pops in and the original riff at the start of the track comes back except this time slower more distorted heavier as if the initial riff were a monster and now it's just kind of gone gargantuan just to swallow the entire record I do have my complaints about this record but overall I like it I do think it is a very good metal record the production is heavy it's colorful there's plenty of instrumentation here and it's all mixed and balanced very well so that each bit of it can be just ingesting sopped up with your ears even though plenty of it is just kind of I don't know just uh in this very psychedelic mishmash of sounds thanks to a whole mess of effects a lot of what the band is doing here even in the most confidence moments still translates the performances on here are pretty good most of the time even if a guitar lead or embellishment here and there is kind of flattered it's not that interesting or if the drums and the bass just are a little too rigid despite all that this album is very visceral energetic and exciting and at times frightening and the writing to me is maybe the biggest Achilles heel here I think the band gets away with some of the writing shortcomings on this thing with many of these tracks feeling like jams in a sense but there were at least several tracks here where that approach didn't go over quite as well mostly on the more subtle cuts this is a really big and ambitious record for this band there's still room for improvement but it's still a really good and intriguing psychedelic black metal wreck I'm feeling a decent of Strom seven on this thing transition have you given this out oh listen did you love it did you hate it what with the rated you the best you the best what should I review next hit that like if you like have a nice day that's what I say Anthony Fantana or antsy Pazuzu I did have forever

Martin Schmidt and drew Daniel of Matt most who just dropped a brand-new album titled ultimate care - on Thrill Jockey records able review love the record a lot of you guys love the record - so hopefully in this conversation they are able to I guess kind of give us a little bit of insight into the creative process of this album and what exactly drove them to I guess create such a unique record and what exactly magnetized them to this wonderful Whirlpool washing machine the ultimate care - all of which I believe they just all the sounds throughout the record are sort of sampled from a wash cycle from that record if I'm wrong in any of this stuff they will very quickly correct me I'm sure in the whole point and I'm sure we'll talk about their past discography you know they and any other stuff that sort of comes up in the mists of the conversation guys welcome to the show Thanks alright um so so yeah I I know that you guys have over the years sampled a really wide array of sounds for a lot of your records what exactly drove you to you know try out sampling a washing machine and sort of what was so interesting about that batch of sounds that sort of made you think you know this is this is worth a whole record you know this isn't just a song or a bit of a song like previous samples that you've worked on this is an entire record here well drew and I take turns being in charge of the records that we made oh wow ostensibly the idea was to stop us from fighting so much because the idea that with equal power we fight and with in equal power we don't fight this does not turn out to be true but we've stuck with this this structure okay and whose turn was it this time it is my turn Wow it was my turn it's not my turn anymore Martin I go I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna look through all the previous records I'm gonna figure out if that holds true if this alternating style holds true I'm gonna go back I'm gonna figure out who made all my favorite memos records and then that guy is just going to be my favorite records with the 14 word titles take half an hour to explain got it it's true Martin created a supreme balloon and the Civil War I'm responsible for I guess a chance to cut and the Rose has teeth in the mouth of a beast hmm and the marriage of true mom and the ones with and if it has a preamble to the People in order to form a more perfect union album if it has a pretentious title it's probably me and I guess what's happened is just this like course correction or couples therapy model and since I had taken us into such an elaborate place that was also very labor intensive with the marriage of true minds it was Martin kind of snapping me out of my trance by saying why don't we make the whole album out of that and just point it right at the washing machine it's in our studio or our studio is in the laundry room depending on the way you want to look at it got it so convenience simplicity uh the knowledge that as I am the house husband and then I do all the laundry and I spend a lot of intimate time with the washing machine I know that it provides a wide variety of sounds and that variety comes in time it's cyclic like a song it returns to what it starts with like a good in my opinion albums yeah I mean you know it's got it's got at all I mean I you know it's got rhythm it's got pitch it's got a fuck is the word interv interval intervallic what I don't know conjugate that like just a family of pitches no no interval low like it's got sections in time than it changes within yeah it's sort of segmented into something that feels like a suite of mini compositions within a bigger form I mean the scary part this is how we think about things even stupid things the thing walking machine I mean you know I stand dumbfounded at the sound of bad air conditioning belts on cars sometimes you know that like high squealing sound oh yeah when the car gets going oh man or like there's a restaurant we go to where the ovens that make the bread make this really piercing high-pitched tone and it kind of sounds like Richard Cartier or no say Sakata or like some like really brutal like micro sound release but it's just this bread oven and it makes this incredible noise and we try to talk to the waiter and waitress at the restaurant about it like do you hear that thing and they're like what we're like that thing do you hear it and we realized they've had to survive around this noise by suppressing it and just not noticing it because it's so harsh but you know our orientation is to always try to like embrace that stuff embrace the everyday sounds that are just all around you and try to like find some peace with them I mean it's still scary to bet the farm of a whole album on a single object I will say you know since I wasn't in charge of this record I knew that it would be Martin's fault if the record was terrible and there's a certain like yes dear conformist cowardice in that I think every couple experiences that in some ways but in this case I think Martin was right I mean I don't mean to sound gross or like self congratulatory but it seems like it was a hunch or an intuition but it paid off because the more time we spent with the sound and this object the more we found there was just so much going on in there you know and and that was really what made it like a fun record rather than something kind of excruciating another sort of interesting thing about sort of sampling the washing machine in the way that you did and correct me on this if I'm wrong it kind of seems like it comes with a preset ending or I guess sort of a preset amount of time you could sort of create the piece with because if I'm correct you sort of composed the piece along the same length of the cycle the washing machine was running through itself truth be told that was largely a coincidence okay um and that we make great hay out of you know when we talk about this stuff I you know I don't mean to sound disingenuous but we we we do anticipate the talking about this stuff we're not all tech er you know we give interviews and we love to talk and we know that the talk will get folded back into what people think about when they're listening to it and honestly the the stuff we came up with to make up the album came out around 38 minutes and we realized oh shit the washing machine is about 38 minutes - we should say we did that on purpose yeah part of it is like you're making a bid for people's attention and I didn't feel that this was a double album statement you know there's some great double albums and there's some longer madness records but this record felt to me like it would make the most sense if we made it conform to the frame of the experience of doing laundry that you put it on and you endure that and then you don't interrupt it and it determines your attention I mean I think we're we concede to the logic of the LP is that we really did build it as to you know roughly 24 minutes sweets that have a puncture point in the middle and that was designed so that the 38 minute version wouldn't be that different from the LP version there's a kind of weird cut-up that happens at the midpoint that massages that thing that on the vinyl you have to flip the record yeah so it is kind of you know we're sort of folding the reality of the washing to the reality of the turntable and I think in some ways that that's a reflection of maybe that we're so obsessed with albums as statements and with that album era of consumption for music it's not really tied to the digital habit of like Spotify or how do you how do you feel Anthony about the fact that it's one 138 minute track instead of being broken up well I think it's a bit of a breath of fresh air from so many albums where it seems like it seems like that sort of format is dying in the digital music era and in the music streaming era where basically and you know you guys sort of tell me your experience with this - I don't I don't know if sort of streaming one track whether it be three minutes or 38 minutes that's sort of like you know one that's sort of one click you know and having one track if it's a 38 minute track I mean you guys can obviously put whatever price on it you want but there are a lot of record labels out there that I see influencing artists who sort of you know at least hit that standard 10 track number you know throw an intro in there throw an outro in there throw a filler track in there just so that we get those 10 tracks at least so that we can get that $1 in 29 cents price for every single track yeah we're very lucky to have always been on both Thrill Jockey and Matador have been very good their policy both of their policies we will let you shoot yourself in the foot if you want you can do whatever stupid stupid-ass thing you want yeah and you know once or twice they'll I mean you know Matador obviously I think digital pricing always struck me as very unfair to say like grindcore you know like you buy like a napalm death album or something you're paying $1 for every song but if there's 30 songs you know it's just it doesn't work for like agoraphobic nosebleed or something I think for me because a lot of my closest listening took place in the context of like psychedelic experience where I wanted these long-form pieces to be somewhere you know and so I was really ready for a long you know ambi at work or you know of vladislav delay record like a NEMA that is a single block that you really experience in that way and yet I was worried I was worried about Altima care to maybe not getting not getting that sort of focus from people I think ultimately though you sort of have to trust that people will get it if you explain what it is you're going for that you don't need to worry so much in like condescend about it you can kind of let people I mean they have a progress bar you know if they have some 38 minute file they can jump to the 20 minute mark if they want to I'm not I'm not there to like you know arch my eyebrow at them it disturbed me I would arch my eyebrow if I possibly could but it disturbs whatever that it's you've got some amazing eyebrows actually no please please go into that please go go please go into the eyebrow arching if you want go into the stern talking-to that you would give the person if magically appear there just work wherever it wouldn't be that this person skip to the 20-minute mark in this line they can they can Skype me up and I'll glare lair and glower I mean it's an arc that we put a lot of thought into about taking them across a particular sequence of emotions and also of frequencies you know I was very worried that the album would be so intensively like industrial clattering that it would kind of fry out people's ears and so we had to position the pieces I mean it's why that piece in the last three minutes is so harsh and strong is to kind of like wake people up after the more entrancing like seaside washing us of some of the previous segments and so I don't feel that those segments have as much power taken out of context I mean we presented them with videos as a way of telling people about this project and you know I think that's valid but for me the work is really meant to be experienced from start to finish you know I don't demand that you just stare at your speaker like you're allowed to read a book or something do some yoga I don't know no no reading sitting like the guy in that Maxell commercial you know that picture where the guys sitting in the armchair and is there that's exactly how I was listening to the records so that's perfect done I mean it's weird when you think about laundromats too like laundromats are spaces where strangers have to be kind of close to each other and look at each other's socks and underwear and you nervously read a magazine or look at your phone as a way of managing the weird intimacy of laundromats and I think of this record and are you going well this sort of like small T like R every part of our record like I think that that's true about the timing of laundry that there's a kind of sanctioned time where you're doing something you're doing a task but in a way the machine is doing the task for you and so your license to just space out you know and I think that that spacing out that time of doing nothing or of zoning out is under pressure now because the workday has expanded digital tools mean you're always reachable why aren't you being productive the culture of multitasking asks you to do multiple things at the same time and I kind of like the dead time feeling of laundry you know like I wanted a record that maybe addressed that I don't know I mean I you know that that's that's a best-case scenario for somebody who just sort of spaces out and can't even tell like how long is our record been going mmm you know that's what I'd like to induce one thing though to I think two or three of the first listens that I had given to the record I actually was not sitting in the chair I was sitting on a train to New York and then I was taking a few subways and I was walking around the city and it was actually a I don't know kind of the the pacing of the record especially the high intensity you know rhythmic spots where you're getting kind of all those metallic blank bangs and clangs it was a really interesting soundtrack for that commute you know like it was very clearly a washing machine a lot of the time but it sort of fit the urban jungle kind of surroundings that I was in the middle of at time I love what you're saying cuz we we the working title for the first six minutes of this album was trained oh really yeah like that that build up from the water filling to this sort of chugging rhythmic pattern and then this sort of xylophone like patterns that come in yeah the working title for that was trained so that's kind of cool that you were listening to it on a train that was just the right place at the right time and and then after that you know I I do like that generally just to say this before we go off to the next thing I do like a lot that it is oh you know just one single track I mean like you're saying you know you're not sort of angry with fans per se if they're doing yoga while listening to the record but it's it's rare that an artist ever implies these days in the digital age and the streaming age to their fans that this is one whole entire piece and you should listen to it in one whole entire piece you know especially in a day and age where you know and I grew up with mixtapes and mixed CDs and I have nothing against making mixes but I feel like just sort of generating playlists has become so easy that people are rarely if ever just listening to an album from beginning to end anymore just the other day I was talking to some fans of the show at speaking engagement that I was doing and some of them were asking me you know what playlists I make or what playlist I put together and I'm like I don't know I never put playlists together I just listened to an album from beginning to end yeah you gotta preach that because it's true that fast-forwarding to the emotional peak of something there's an understandable kind of rush that a great song gives you but the sort of family portrait effect of a cluster of songs and of the way that an image or a sound or an idea can kind of float across multiple songs as part of the joy of listening via an album is the joy of context and the complexity of like a whole constellation of pieces that affect each other through their proximity you know and maybe answer each other or like a problem is proposed and then it's maybe solved over the course of a set of songs that are written I don't know I mean an example here would be like Bjork svaneke era right which tracks the process of collapse of a relationship and the emergence out the other side and if you just jumped to one moment yes it's valid and it was presented as a song with a title but it's not really as effective as the synergetic impact of the sequence in sequence because it's reflecting on a on a bigger arc and I think albums do that for us but we have to we have to as listeners bring the willingness to to to give ourselves to give a little of our own like patience you know like my long answers that go on forever sir well I mean usually when I'm listening I like to listen to music in such a way where I'm getting a certain vibe for an extended period of time you know longer than three minutes longer than ten minutes if I'm gonna be really sitting down and listening to music for a while or listening music for a while while I'm doing something else and usually the easiest way to get that one singular vibe going for an extended period of time is to just listen to an entire album that sort of features that vibe features that mood features that sound yeah I mean as I as I grow ever older I sort of increasingly realized like oh they figured this out like a hundred and fifty years ago and they're called symphonies I mean I feel like our music fails a lot of time because the concepts are pulling us in a lot of different directions and we're being true to the concept but that hurts the consistency of the album I think that hurt our album the marriage of true minds a little bit because it was conceptually all generated through the same you know matrix matrix of parapsychological experiments but because each transcript from a different psychic session was a very different one the result was music that didn't really flow and when you have albums that are highly diverse you know there's some highly diverse albums that are still amazing and hold together like I think you throbbing gristle 20 jazz-funk grapes is one but I think that there's a big risk when you do that whereas albums that have a certain emotional continuity like I don't know Nico desert Shore there's there's a reason that you put it on and you want to be in that world for 45 minutes and it doesn't feel oppressive and it doesn't feel se me sure yeah I mean jumping around emotionally and stylistically sometimes is is the aesthetic you know sort of like with a band like we nor something mm-hmm yeah you know so that could be an appeal in and of itself yeah the what will they pull off next where else can they go sure oh I think there's artists that have that ability I mean the classic shape was that the rock album was like driving rock jams and then a ballad at the end of each side because literally to cut vinyl there was less of a high end high frequency response and is still still true um yeah at the end so you just sing ballads at the end there it's kind of weird to think about the technology being a sort of hidden contour for the way the art is getting assembled but it's also like each side is a little bit sad this ending that's actually a really interesting factoid there which has essentially driven the fact that at the end of nearly yeah almost every album that you hear there's an acoustic cut or there's like a sad song yeah put it yeah it's interesting I had no I had no idea of that I we I met the first vinyl record I ever made in the late 80s the mastering engineer was this guy at fantasy studios in Berkeley in the previously George horn George horn who mastered Creedence Clearwater Revival and and I think he had been mastering for 15 years before then yeah he did all those Silvestre disco albums - yeah I mean this guy was was legit yeah oh gee as they say anyway and in his first thing upon think of the record I brought in he was like there's it's too much crap at the end of the side it's too much crap at the end of the salad you're supposed to stick a ballot day yeah and that's that's how I learned this factoid yeah well don't wait our balance maybe someday a madness ballad will will be born yeah that's uh you know it's just sort of interesting to to see how you know you guys are making experimental music and how it doesn't fit into sort of traditional expectations like that but it seems like still when you're making music though you do have an ear or you do you do sort of pay some attention toward oh is this going to be too harsh is it's going to be too weird you know especially as you guys are telling me about your sampling process of this washing machine as you're sort of pulling it together you know how much is it in the forefront of your mind that we like these sounds you find these sounds intriguing but they have to translate as musical to the audience yeah it's a big it's a big part of the process you know and it also comes out in the quality control between the two of us I make things that I might think are strong and Martin will say you know I don't it's just not interesting it just doesn't speak to me and because Martin and I are very different people the music that either of us proposes has to appeal to the pleasure centers of the other person and that kind of mutual editing or I don't know we call it a Co tyranny you know it sounds like it's just about two people but there is this third person in the room that's the virtual listener I think if you worry directly about her or him then you're pandering and it's bad you know like like they're the road to hell is paved with people trying to sell out yeah I think we try to balance you know conceptual tightness with the hope that these will be records that you can really return to that it isn't like a candy bar and you eat it once and you're done you know it's the same with with a lot of like the challenge with humor is a little bit similar right that strong comedies are still funny even when you know the joke like the gasoline fight in Zoolander is funny the second the third the fourth time and I think with us even though we court this idea of novelty music or gimmickry you know and I think that's kind of a social category to that I would want to be maybe skeptical about I want us to create something that can function even if you don't know it's made out of a washing machine or if you don't care that it's made out of plastic surgery like it's important that we did that but I don't want that to be the only justification for it it has to actually be compelling on its own merits as just sound and that's a harsh you know that's a harsh mistress because you can get pretty intoxicated with the idea that like well I worked so hard to create this bizarre situation in which you know there's lasers and there's nails and a glass tube and the snails are interrupting the laser and that's going to a light-sensitive theremin I mean it's it's a lot of slepping but if it doesn't sound cool then really why bother yeah yeah I gotta say when I originally had this idea I knew that it was dumb at no point did we ever not know like that's kind of is so literally it's kind of dick be dumb like it's I know we know like a sort of less seasoned interviewer asked us the other day like so is this this is the first record ever made out of a washing machine and I was like I don't know yeah really you don't know and and it doesn't matter that's not in fact the idea was supposed to be so aggressively dumb as to sort of challenge like right now now really owes you is so what's important is in fact the music that you can make out of it yeah which is always which you know which is always the case I mean that's why it starts with such a didactic like here's a washing machine but then within 5 minutes 6 minutes you're you've you move past that hopefully and you're entering a a different state of mind you know like I think that the the the sheer I can't believe you did that like there's a dimension to it that is about that fact but by you know by seven minutes in you're not obsessing about that you're having an experience hopefully you know no I mean I I think there are moments where it certainly doesn't you know feel like I'm still listening to a washing machine you know specifically during the more spacious and sort of ambient and serene passages and the peace but it also feels like there was definitely a concerted effort to make sure that the the presence of the washing machine was there you know peppered throughout different pieces of the track just as kind of a reminder like this is what we're working with yeah and that's what happens when we do it live I mean it's one of the weirdest moments I have to say in playing music with Martin is that when we play ultimate care live you know we bring the washing machine from our basement oh yeah yeah yeah why we bring it and we set it up we'll be in by the way what are you nice to Connecticut are you or anywhere near your near problem Providence kind of I'm just in New England so okay we're gonna play in Providence with container next week and Chicago in Brooklyn and you know we did this in Baltimore as a sort of test of can we do this so we bring the washing machine from our basement with a big garbage can full of water and a pump that is pumping water into the washing machine and it's draining and we do laundry on stage live and about you know 30 minutes into the show we all stop and we just let the washing machine go for like three minutes and it takes a little solo and Martin and I and Sam the drummer from horselords he's drumming with us on the washing machine we all just sit in chairs and just listen and let the sound be and it's just a really weird moment for me of not performing you know because the washing machine is the star at that moment it's taken a solo and it seems to work like you know touch wood I don't know how it'll go at other shows we'll find out but people really went very well and but I mean Baltimore audiences are especially lower especially patient and good a DJ buddy of mine here said yeah DJing in Baltimore it's almost too easy I had people dancing to a Krause the sound of a crow for four minutes one night he's literally playing a field recording of a crow people are going off anyway so yeah we'll see if it is if this plays in Peoria I mean obviously during the washing machine sort of bit of the performance people in the crowd were going yeah they were loving it no but during me let's listen to the washing machine arch I was what I was really shocked by was that they were all and this was this is like a party night this is never like 200 people you know dredging drinking and stuff it wasn't like a culture bunker yeah it wasn't it wasn't a seeded thing everyone was absolutely quiet and had their uh their washing machine moment I think that's the magic trick we want to pull off we don't know if we can do it again but that way of sneaking up on people with something that they know what it is they already know it's a washing machine but they encounter it in a new way and they kind of give a little bit of themselves to it and and it changes so like that that's that's pretty cool if like you can have the same experience twice for the first time of hearing it in a new way just because of the context I mean it helps if you've massively amplified it you know it becomes physical in a different way yeah you know sure that I wanted to put into Anna and I have to look at these live dates now just to kind of see if I could come on down because I kind of need to see this in person I was I was hitting up some people on Twitter asking them what they're curious about in regards to the new record and one person asked me if if any are there any sounds on the record that are not washing machine derived because I know that you guys are you know have worked with just synthetic sounds before like on supreme balloon and you're perfectly capable of just you know deriving sounds that have nothing to do with samples or whatever you know so you were there just any purely synthetic sounds worked into the piece that weren't derived from the washing machine well it all rests on the technicality of derived yeah I sound a little like Bill Clinton saying it depends on what your definition of yeah you get it you did not derive it from that washing machine but here's what I'd say like what we did that was a little weird was we made samples of the washing machine put it on to my laptop that we sent that through this thing called a transducer which is basically what's inside of headphones and also microphones it's it's the thing that drives inside a speaker the speaker cone it's the thing that changes electricity into movement yeah or movement into electricity so we sent samples of the washing machine through a transducer that was attached to the washing machine and it makes the washing machine vibrate and shake and what we did was Turner and turns a washing machine into a speaker yeah becomes almost like a bass Jeep so like it's throbbing with this sound if you crank up a low frequency it makes the machine shake so we played it frequencies that caused a kind of feedback loop of the washing machine feeding back into itself amplifying itself and that created these very pure pitches that sound like a tone which I could then chop up and so everything around ultimate care to that sounds like a weird synth is actually created through the feedback of a transducer on the washing machine but it is originally the sound of the washing machine that is making that that is causing no yes you know it's from the washing machine but you guys are kind of cheating I get it I guess there's also you if you listen very carefully in one part you can hear me trying to play a part and go so there is that sound as well that is not the washing machine that's me doing earth I got it I got it okay so so after this tour after these live performances after these dates will you replace this washer or will it just go back snugly into your room until your practice room my deepest wish is to just return it to where it belonged poor thing poor thing like it is not a gentle process the loading in and loading out of gear into venues apparently in Providence the venue is on the third floor and it's upstairs all the way yeah and are you guys handling this or not oh yeah so there's not like a couple of stage hands there now and and your than if there were they would come downstairs and they look at that and be like fuck this yeah we moved music stuff not yeah there's a certain oh my arc fancy like that we uh there's a certain ride-or-die you know like we made this washing machine album with that washing machine so god dammit we're gonna bring there's gonna be bugs fuck after the toilet that's my goal we're we're not however taking it to Europe yeah we're gonna find another one in Europe I have a I have a young man in Berlin who is trying his best to find me an actual ultimate care - he found one in Munich in Munich which is on the other end of Germany we just we don't want to go with some other brand like a bow connect store some German brand because a lot of those are very eco groovy and they're very quiet and they take a long time they're like two hours long to run the cycle which would just be kind of excruciating so yeah we're hoping for an ultimate care - in Europe it's gonna be tricky I mean I feel like it would be fun though cuz we start the European tour at Bergen and it sort of seems like a reductio ad absurdum of minimal techno to actually just play a washing machine a bear kind yeah no I get it you know the the your machine has a certain sound and you're also brand lawyer yeah brand loyal yeah and it really it really does have I mean you know the sound is the sound yeah we're not kidding yeah his if I started playing yeah like I mean obviously made this plan I've been going around and whacking on other people's washing machine offender verses and Ibanez or something you know I understand we're not gonna suddenly bring the danelectro yep I think it's well yeah I mean maybe it's maybe it's just me but yeah I was gonna say it's more like a guitar versus of like banjo yeah there's that comparison to draw to yes yes alright this has been a great interview you guys were super easy super fun very upfront I appreciate it I want to thank Martin and drew for coming on here and being on the show talking about this latest record I'm going to leave some links down in the description box where you can find out about their new tour and try out the new record and again just I appreciate you guys coming on the show "
4c56KNcpepo,hey everyone price the nijo-jo here the internet's greediest music nerd money money money and it's time for a list recently the record store day the official records stored a list of all the releases the album's the reissues the singles the 10 inches the colored vinyl the splatter vinyl all the records the master list has dropped I'm gonna link that down there in the description so you can check out all of those records I believe Record Store Day is going to be on the 16th of April this year so head out to your participating stores super early if you want to get a copy of any of these records if you're interested in any of them I have listed out here the records that have sort of grabbed my attention might interest you certainly interest me a great deal the records that I'm gonna be looking out for when I head out for a Record Store Day this year provided nothing horrible happens to me between now and the 16th preventing me from going out on Record Store Day so here we go here are the releases that I will be looking out for we have in Afrika Bambaataa Planet Rock 12 inches seems like there's some some release celebrating this song every year but it is a fantastic song and an amazing foundational track for hip hop music in general so at least every Record Store Day is an opportunity for you to hear and buy this track if you have not gotten a chance to yet we have the Bee Gees and Faith No More on the same 7-inch with the song I started a joke and Robert Glasper and singer Bilal come together on a 12-inch covering Miles Davis a revision of his track their version is called ghetto walkin with I believe the Miles Davis official version on the b-side and we also have a death live album if you're into death metal live in eindhoven it's tapes from a 1998 live set there are demos for Mac DeMarcos another one coming out and also we have a J Dilla project by the name of the diary dropping this Record Store Day - there's a lot of I guess sort of lore surrounding this project from what I've read it's his long most vocal album I'm not exactly sure what this is going to entail some of it seems like it was originally put together by him much of it seems like it was put together by a producer brought on to sort of finish things up clean things up and sort of assemble the rest of the pieces of the puzzle here if you're a hardcore J Dilla fan and I guess you don't mind that you know his music is just constantly being drugged up again and again and again sort of what's left of it then keep a lookout for this thing post-punk outfit the feeley's are dropping a short little covers EP featuring covers of songs from The Doors Patti Smith and Fleetwood Mac is coming out with an alternate version of one of my favorite records of there's one of their most varied and just jumbled records but still good Tunes all the same tusks so I guess if you're looking for another take on Fleetwood Mac's most eclectic record keep an eye out for that a great soul record reissue is coming out with Etta James at last and this is easily one of the weirdest things on the list here we have blues man junior Kimbrough I got a try you girl and it is a Daft Punk remix and on the b-side is an etching yeah we have Manic Street Preachers with a design for life a single reissue it seems like there's a really elaborate deluxe package that comes along with this single rerelease also for those nostalgic nineties heads we have some Alanis Morissette 1994 to 1998 demos on a beautiful little splatter vinyl package we have new music from Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo with hello my good friend and itching of a drawing that marked it as a child on the b-side with again some new music on a side and then it's ODB with shimmy yo and Brooklyn zoo getting reissued as a single to Outkast elevators a track from their infamous ATLiens project is coming out and this is a 10-inch coloured glow-in-the-dark vinyl and one record I've definitely got to be looking out for is the 10th anniversary reissue of jail retards blood visions and there's also a kind of a strange bit of history from the residents back catalogue coming out the please do not steal it record this was originally a compilation album that was sent out to college radio stations in the late 70s and obviously it was titled that because they were pleading with the college students not to steal the record because they wanted the record to be played on the air so this is obviously a promotional never before sold album if you're a big residents fan then you're probably gonna want to own this we have a Sex Pistols never mind the bollocks picture disc coming out for those big punk fans the Shaggs sweet maria single if you're looking for a bit of novelty to add to your 7-inch collection Regina Spektor Soviet Kitsch reissues coming out if you're big into piano ballads female singer-songwriters this is a great record they've got to try out if you haven't heard it yet son Ross spaceways live album is getting a issue as well the other side of Sun Records vol 3 I believe this is compilation Sun records if you're not familiar just really epic and classic American record label a lot of foundational music for blues and rhythm and blues and soul and garage as well which I believe this compilation specifically deals in a lot of country music on the label too and finally we're going to be finishing it off with one record that I'm definitely gonna be looking out for I'm afraid to even mention it here because one of you bastards might die before I do and that is a shoo shoo plays the music of Twin Peaks there was talk of shoo-shoo playing some live sets where they play the music from Twin Peaks and it seems that now with Greg the drummer from Deerhoof they've gotten together and they have put out this record and has put these songs to tape essentially so I'm pretty excited to hear how shushu Rhian visions this music especially given that my one of my favorite records of theirs is that Nina Simone covers record so there you go those are all of the projects that I am looking forward to getting released on the coming record store day hopefully I can get my hands on the ones that I'm looking forward to the most the J retard the shoe shoe and yeah you know if anything else gets added in the mean time to the list I guess I'll be looking out for that as well if anything else sort of piques my interest let me know down in the description what you're looking forward to this Record Store Day and again that list is down there in the description box so you can check out and see if there's anything that's interesting to you I haven't listed out all the artists here obviously I've just kind of listed off what interested me there could be a lot of artists on the list that you're interested in that I did not cover here and we're gonna leave it at that you're the best record store day coming up I will be talking about any releases I do pick up during Record Store Day in a future vinyl update so keep an eye out for that too I know you guys watch the vinyl updates transition those are the releases that I'm looking forward to this year I hope you guys are doing well again you can put whatever releases you're looking forward to in the comments and you know even if you're a and if you're not going out to a Record Store Day this year you can leave some comments down in the description about why Record Store Day is horrible and why you shouldn't go to Record Store Day and how record store day sold out and you know just any kind of negative thoughts about Record Store Day alright cool you're the best 
adbXzyNy2lk,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new boss record - hi - riot this guy is a New York rapper he is on Interscope and Jay Cole's dreamville sub-label you might have caught him on 2013's born sinner or maybe his 2014 solo commercial debut or even last year there was that dreamville various artists compilation record where he had a couple tracks and a feature on there - and now he's got his follow-up project over here is sophomore full-length album but of course I'm not reviewing this by myself I'm going to be joined by fellow YouTube music reviewer mr. Luke James I'm going to leave a link down there in the description box where you can check out his channel he does plenty of hip hop reviews on the regular we're going to change camber qualities sorry about that as well as my shirt sorry about that too if you really like the shirt transition and here we are through the magic of the Internet mr. Luke James is with me and we're to be talking about this new Bozz record like I said so to start things off what in your opinion is sort of the general sound and style coming from this record musically that people can anticipate when they go to listen to this thing well first of all is very short it's only a little over half an hour in length and it is a very cohesive project in my opinion the production is very smooth way B as I say you kind of get a lot of those late-night vibes going on here lots of smooth bass underneath nothing too heavy or grading nothing to that effect really and it's flu activity Asian elite ooh yeah and I thought his rap style meshes with that perfectly because he's doing that rapping but then he's also blending in some singing some harmonizing you'll hear the Hicks this group that comes on and they add some vocals to it as well so the whole project I thought I didn't find it to be too varied and sound there weren't a lot of moments that really jumped out to me where I went whoa I've never heard production like this I've never heard flows like this I do think it is a pretty good project I actually liked it quite a bit but there was nothing that really was jarring or overly unique or original and at times he actually room ended me up some other artists mm-hmm yeah I mean you know it certainly wasn't jarring which I guess in a sense is a good thing um you know you you don't want anything that's just feeling too out of place but simultaneously there's nothing like that risky about any of what's going on here - I mean sure that there are moments on here reminded me of other artists but I mean I think the person who reminded me of the most was probably Jay Cole not that I think that he's just a straight Jaeckel ripoff but I think it's kind of a matter of um I don't know birds of a feather kind of flocking together it seems like he has this similar smooth rapping but also singing style and he likes his lyrics to kind of take a very um and it's it seems like a really weird marriage between there's some hedonism in there there's some you know general success and kind of you know bitches drugs sort of stuff that you might catch in you know just about any rappers verses but then there's a serious note of you know I'm going through hardship I'm sad I'm forlorn I'm you know just uh really kind of this and I don't know there's a cloud in the sky and it's upsetting me you know sort of thing and and I get that vibe very much from Jay Cole - um and and it just kind of seems like in a way almost redundant here as well to kind of just kind of hear that same vibe hear that same mood rehashed over again without anything all that a you know sort of a distinct added to the recipe yeah I actually agree with what you're saying I think one of the tracks that stood out to me as far as content goes is live 4 where he talks a bit about his aunt and have she passed away from cancer and that sort of thing but I also found even when he does touch on some real issues like that there's also some moments where he talks about black youth being gunned down by police but maybe also by each other in certain communities you know inner-city violence and that sort of thing but I find when he's rapping about that stuff he doesn't always go very deep and then he'll he'll spit some shit that's right real and then like you said the next line will be about bitches kind of like what Jay Cole actually does I found that on what was the song they did together heavy heart that was that track was a night job night job yeah I noticed on night job there's a line where J Cole asks he says something like why niggas always getting detention or something along that line and then a couple buyers later he's rapping about how he has a girl and she's just on the camera phone playing with herself you know what I mean she um let's go back to the track live for because that was a highlight for me on the record mostly because there were so many spots on here where I feel like Boz was coming off as just like I was saying very sad very forlorn um but that was one of the few moments on here where it felt like he really struck a chord and hit upon a very personal nerve there you know he didn't explicitly say you know I'm rapping about my aunt I needed to you know go and look that up but it seemed like he was referencing a family member that meant a lot to him passing away on this track but then after the first several bars after he dives into that he just completely goes off on to a completely different tangent and and it's different not only in narrative and story but it's different in mood as well um it's it's almost as if like he's just mixing all these emotions with no actual cohesion or flow between all of them and which is kind of weird considering that since vocally you know it seemed like he was coming through a lot of conviction and emotion at this part on the song it seemed like this meant a lot to you and this person meant a lot to you so therefore you know couldn't there be more to this story than what you simply told us and considering that this song isn't really that long it's like 2 minutes and 42 seconds I mean this this one part of your life could have been an entire track you know but instead it's just kind of you know one of many a variety of things that just gets kind of tossed out there and mentioned and I guess painted in a very kind of surface-level way on this project you know I mean there's a just a whole nada just not a lot of cohesion to what he's rapping about here you know he's just kind of all over the place and he doesn't go too deep into any one thing yeah I think it was the production that really held the cohesion together on this one like I said I found a lot of the beats were very similar and I notice that on that song as well because he starts off spittin that real shit and then he goes on about his pride and just relationship troubles he has so it is kind of connected a little bit in that aspect but it was kind of like what where are you going I thought this was going to be a full track all about that topic and again I think he does bring up some real issues I like that there is a little bit of social commentary throughout he doesn't break it down or go too deep but he throws it out there but again I'm agreeing with you he doesn't take that and expand but it would be nice if you had a song that was really about that issue with his on then maybe he had another song that was more focused on some of the social issues that he'd like to speak on and I think there's more to his story as well because there are some instances where they touch on how he was living the street life he dropped out of college he didn't follow through with that but like you said it's kind of just thrown out there and then it's back to the bitches and chillin and smoking and that sort of thing rather than expanding on those things so while I really did like this project I think there's a lot more to him I think he has a lot more that he could spit about if he really wanted to go in-depth on some of those issues but maybe he did in the past I haven't actually listened to any of his previous work so this was my first experience with him so I don't know maybe he's covered that already yeah there were moments here where he does reference his past life you know in drugs like on the song methalone but still even on that track he's a little all over the place almost as if just like what you were saying he could pull together all of these tracks or all of these lines where maybe he's getting into the more hedonistic thing and then pulled together all the lines where he's making all the social commentary and then sort of put them together into their own separate songs they could make maybe a full coherent track about a single thing but like you were saying it does feel cohesive anyway because the production does kind of pull it all together into this very dreary jazzy smooth very self-serious sound and and his rap style doesn't really vary that much from track to track either so you know if you're not really diving too deeply into what he's getting into lyrically the track does not the track but the project itself does sound you know like it comes together as a whole very well but um by the end of it I was kind of hoping for just a little more variation you know because uh I think you know even this project is not breaking the 40-minute mark I just kind of felt like I was hearing much of the same things over and over and over and over maybe that would have been helped if he had brought some stronger and more cohesive lyrical topics to the table you know then kind of the one-dimensional production would have been a little more acceptable you know again it's pretty for a handful of tracks but it does kind of wear out its welcome for me after a while yeah it's almost like the cohesion works for it and against it because as I was listening through there wasn't really a track that I hated like there was no one track on here that I said this is awful I don't like this at all I need to skip this there was nothing like that for me really I like most of the songs on this quite a bit cuz I did kind of take it for what it is you know it wasn't too deep I would have preferred him to do that cuz I think he has it in him because he brings up his past but maybe he'll do that on a later project but the actual vibe this is a project I think that is more about the vibe you know if you want something if you like to drive around at night with some bass up just lean back there's all kinds of tracks like that on this project for your song is like ricochet which I actually like quite a bit yeah I mean it's not a deep track but for what it is it's so smooth I like the way the beach slowly builds up and then we get those nice smooth vocal blends it's kind of like a kind of like a late-night creep anthem which I mean I'm washed up and married so I mean that's no use to me like I'm in bed early I'm changing diapers and shit but I mean if you you know you're still out there on the creep driving around maybe making a late-night call something like that that's the type of track you will put on because it has that feel to it you know hook up and ricochet as he says okay you know overall in this project I hear potential here even though I wish some of the hooks on here were stronger and that some of the songs just weren't so breezy and that some of the verses just felt more well formed and just not like this kind of a just stream of consciousness I'm going to jump from one topic to the next over this smooth V over the smooth beat and then another smooth beat and then another smooth beat I hear potential and what he's doing here but I have a weird analogy for this record to me the whole thing just sounded so much like it I don't know it could it could be like the musical equivalent of softcore porn that's like you you know it's porn but there's nothing like really rose or in your face or just like you know overly gratuitous about any of it in a way it's tasteful but it's also that gross Ness and that gratuitousness and just you know the whole money shot thing per se where you know you're taking that risk and you're going over the top and you know you're doing something that you know you're making a moment in the movie that people are going to remember you know you're putting a climax in there you're putting a highlight in there you know it's not just this continual like let's just pretend to be having sex on camera sort of thing um a weird analogy again you know but but still like softcore porn it's tasteful but you know it's it's it's a it's not going too far visually and it's not going too far as far as the I guess uh the the the explicitness of it but I just feel like he needs to be pushing more boundaries and he needs to be a little bit more aggressive as he approaches these sad topics as he approaches these socially aware topics because I feel like with how he's diving into them now he's not leaving any impact yeah I think overall I still did like this project because it's short I think if it was much longer for me then it really would have became dull if this was like an hour long and it had that same sound all the way through I mean I would have been put to sleep but you know at about I think was like 35 36 minutes I could deal with that but yeah also what held it back was that lack of versatility because I had never heard of this guy but last year I really liked omens album elephant eyes I don't know if you checked that out but he's another dreamville artist and so I was kind of just comparing them a little bit just going off you know they're both dreamville artists and what I liked about omens album is that it did have that variety there was a bit more in the in the production some of the tracks stuck out more because the beats were different and also the songs were more cohesive he had a song about what it was like growing up without a father and they had a song about you know this infatuation people had with social media it was much more there was much more variation and it was also just tighter all around but like I said I think this one is cool just for some mellow laid-back vibes kind of like you know people like currency's music you know he puts out a million projects a year but you know what you're going to get and if you just want to chill and put something on that's kind of what this is like but there is you know there is some more personal content and every now and then you will get some social commentary couple gems dropped here and there but not too much that's really gonna stick out or blow you away I use the word jarring early earlier which probably wasn't the right word but like you said sort of risky would be a better way of putting it like there was nothing that sounded different that made me go oh shit what does this be this is crazy I wasn't expecting this but it sounds nice or you know coming in with a different type of flow or something like that but you know still alright project for what it is for me but you know nothing if you're looking for something deep and more variation or anything gritty I don't think this is what that type of person would want to listen to is this album okay I think we're gonna leave it at that but yeah I mean I totally see what you're saying you know I mean I wish it did take more risks and there were some spots that varied up a little bit more but for the length of this project it's not bad to have you know a very chill record that you know lasts just over the 30-minute mark you know if that's what you're looking for and you know if that's the vibe that you're looking for you could do way worse than this for sure um I'm feeling about like a strong 5 to light six on this thing you know it's got its moments and there are some bars here and there that I thought were really good like that Nicorette patchwork line that I thought was great also that one line uh those one track in particular he was talking about uh olive branches splintering and how people will dab you just to you know reach you and touch user when you're in that moment of success and sort of you know trying to tell yourself out of the situation that you're in and advance yourself in order for people to kind of pull you back pull you down I'm like you said there's some gems here and there but you know he doesn't go in on a topic per se um but but mostly you know it's decent but I'm also sort of indifferent toward it too for the most part um you know what are you thinking as far as final thoughts actually like this a little bit more than you like anyone who follows my channel they know I always say wavy and smooth and mellow I really like this type of project that's just personally that's just the type of taste that I kind of have I do like deeper content as well for you know for when I rate something higher I like when there's content or more variation the sound this one I still have it a 3.5 I mean I can put it on in the car when I'm just driving around it's nice and smooth and mellow but it's it's not I don't know it's probably not going to make my top ten or anything like that because it's just not overly memorable it's almost too comfortable which again I think that works for it and against it if you just want to relax with this shit cool but you're not really going to think there's a whole lot that's different here well there we go that was the review I want to thank Luke Kames again for coming on and talking about this record with me I will leave a link down there in the description where you can check out his channel subscribe over there of course he has hip hop reviews how many reviews are you putting out a week now you're putting out of that you're putting out a handful quite a few it'll probably pick up soon too I'm actually moving out of this little place we got this apartment going to get a studio put together downstairs some private space so hopefully we'll be able to link up more because it's hard to plan around a small apartment with a kid ripping around like you can't see around me but it's just toys looks like a Toys R Us fucking workshop over here that'll be great you'll be even more prolific then yeah you know I can't wait for it more space definitely good as anticipate some more content from Luke in the future as soon as he gets into his new spot but he's already putting out a lot now and you know he's always a cover new hip-hop records so you know that's that's your thing head over his channel again linked down there and thanks for coming on dude thanks for having me man I appreciate it 
Ln4zXfzJX3I,"[Cal Chuchesta jammin'] [Anthony is not pleased] Hey everyone, SPAMtony SCAMtano here,
the Internet's busiest music nerd. And it's time for review of the new
Lemon Demon record, ""Spirit Phone"". Lemon Demon is the occasionally comedic, rock-and-pop project of producer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter, mr. Neil Cicerega. The man is a jack of all trades, when
it comes to Internet content creation. You might remember-r-r the legendary ""BRODYQUEST"" meme on his YouTube channel, he also has a series of great skits. The epic ""Computer Fighters"" video that he just dropped; also,
you can check out the Potter Puppet Pals series, that he's done. A couple years ago, he came up with two amazing mash-up records, which I still listen to, casually, to this day. [cough] This is what addiction feels like. And he's also dropped numerous Lemon Demon albums up until this point as well. And I checked out as many as I could,
when I first found out about Neil. And I guess, my first impressions were, that
there were good intentions behind these projects, but a lot of the production was sort of flimsy,
very clearly, sort of a DIY thing. And, not even like, in a super-cool, hip, trendy, lo-fi way. More in a way, where the mixing feels kinda one-dimentional: the keyboards, the guitars, the percussion,
the vocals feel really raw, maybe slightly untouched. Placing instruments in a mix, can be a lot like arranging furniture in a room. And rather than placing everything tastefully, so that the room functions and it flows,
and you could sort of move throughout i-i-it, it felt like everything was just kind of jumbled on top of each other. And this is somewhat of an issue on this latest
LP for me as well, though not quite as much. It seems like Neil, on this one, has honed his production chops quite a bit, though they're not perfect - - I will say that I think, in terms of his songwriting,
and what he puts into this record instrumentally (which is a lot, this is a pretty busy record), I feel like most of his ideas,
or great deal of his ideas, translate. All the songs are really sharply written.
I mean, some of the best hooks I've heard this year. If you like the quirk of bands like Devo, and the
erratic vocals of a singer like Mark Mothersbaugh, or, you know, some of the weirdo dudes from the new wave era, like Gary Numan, or maybe you enjoy little They Might Be Giants, or, let's say, the Japanese synth-punk band Polysics, but
sort of pulling the whole 8-bit sound out of the equation. Then I think you're gonna find something alike in this record. Neil isn't always making music to sound like these bands, but I do think there's a similar, playful attitu-u-u-ude. Musically, Neil pulls a lot from the 80s on this thing: new wave, pop-rock, there are lot of throbbing synthesizers-s-s, punchy danceable beats. Though it doesn't really sound clichéd, or vintaged, or just kind of trying to desperatly pull for some kind of nostalgia. Neil isn't trying to appeal to you with a throwback, he is
trying to get you to enjoy the songs, for what they are. And, I guess, occasionally wow you with a very strange song subject, like on the song ""Cabinet Man"", which seems to be about a guy,
that gets sucked into an arcade machine, and now he is part-man, part-machine,
and exists in this weird videogame world. Now, this thing is 14 tracks long, but if you buy the full length album on Bandcamp, you get like 13 additional bonus tracks; which consist of demos, of some loose... just change,
odds and ends that didn't make it onto the record. Some of which are actually pretty cool. The record features a really big intro track, a kind of, bit of a subtle, warm goodbye for the outro, that... at first I thought it was kind of a dud, but I guess with extra listens, it has grown on me. And there doesn't seem to be a grand concept to this entire project, even though right after the first track,
the whole thing kicks off with a PSA, where Neil is saying - due to his strong convictions - he has to say, that ""This record is not endorsing the occult"". And I guess there are some occult, and very morbid - hilariously morbid - moments on this thing, that we'll get into; but for the most part, this record is just all about...
each song on here just standing so well on its own, as uh, potentially, like a good single. I mean, we're just talkin' great verses and
choruses here, just very tightly written songs. Hooks so good, I get a rush off of them. Uh, one of my favourite tracks here is, right toward the
beginning: ""On a touch-tone, touch-tone, telephone!"" I love the punchy pianos on this thing, the really sweet ""kisses"" of string embellishments, that are worked into the hook too. This thing is as hard-hitting, and as infectious, as
it is just really detailed, and intricate, and refined. And uh, lyrically, the song is about... supernatural calls? Calling, talking to people from beyond the grave,
while simultaneously saluting old technology. You know, Neil just tosses out references to things like
circuitboards, and Leonard Nimoy, like it's nothin'. The song ""Sweet Bod"" is one of my favoutite tracks here,
but simultaneously, one of the most unsettling, uhh... Neil seems to have some kind of attraction to, uh, a
dead body here, or some specific person's dead body. And he's not trying to have sex with the body or anything like that, it's not a necrophilia thing, it's not... sexual, as he says in the song. But he wants to, sort of, cover the body in honey
and sweet things, and make it ""confectional""? It's a candy cadaver! It's a candy cadaver. And um,
I guess he just wants to mummify this body, in uh, sugar. [Anthony is confused] Eh? I like the song ""When He Died"", it took a little to grow on me, but I'm getting like a serious Unicorns vibe off this song, especially with some of the very frail lead vocals,
and the very morbid topic of the track. The song ""Ancient Aliens""
(♩ ♫ ti ti, paa, NAAH, naah ♬ ♪) - - has some of the most searing, and just bright,
and catchy synth leads of the entire project. Then there's the song ""Soft Fuzzy Man"", which... I mean, if a soft, fuzzy man is anywhere near
as fun as the song, I'm interested! Sign me up. On ""As Your Father I Expressly Forbid It"", Neil plays
this really neurotic character, that reads to me like a... from an old Talking Heads or like a David Burn song,
and Neil seems to literally be playing his dad, or a dad, on this track, sort of scolding his son, for: talking to his grandfather about the Internet, his grandfather doesn't know what the Internet is, he doesn't care. And he doesn't want his kid to be bringing his Gameboy to his table. Uh, he seems to be yelling at his kid, after he
misplaces his dad's medicine, or something; and his dad gets mad at him for it.
""As your father, I expressly forbid it!"" And, Neil stays on, sort of that family
theme, on the song ""I Earn My Life"", uh, which is, sort of an intimate
and vulnerable moment for him. Uh, sort of seems to add up to this idea,
that was placed by the last track; that I guess, family life, home life,
can kind of be a prison, in a way. Or at least, that's how I read it. And then, Neil dives into the
topsy-turvy world of economics, on the song ""Reaganomics"", where - I guarantee,
this will be the only song you hear this year, where a singer goes:
 ♬ ♫ ""DEREGULATION, baby!"" ♪ ♫ Though, I do think the song comes off really loud,
super punchy, to the point where, uhh, I think, everything... This is just another mix,
where the keys, the beats, everything is just so loud, and so piled on top of each other, that it's uh...
It's a little oppressive to listen to. But lyrically, I enjoy what Neil is doing with the song, basically umm... talking about his wish, to
""free the world of the burden of money"". And I like, that Neil is able to occasionally work in a soft side on this record too. Like on a closer, or uh, toward the start of the song ""No Eyed Girl"". Not only does this track feature plenty of cowbell, but some vocal harmonies, that seem sort of Queen-inspired. Really cool. This record, again, is just a straightforward pop-rock record, with some great hooks, some good writing,
some really creative lyrics, and a lot of persona-a-a-ality. It's got a New Wave vibe to it, with a fast, punchy punk energy, but it still stays accessible. Occasionally, the production can be a little messy, a little loud, and maybe this record might read to you as slightly obnoxious too. There is something about this album,
that- that is just painfully nerdy. But uh, that does appeal to me,
it may not appeal to you. And, I think we're gonna leave it there.
I'm feelin' a strong 7 to a light 8, on this thing. Tran- -sition!
Have you given this album a listen? Did ya love it, did ya hate it,
what would you rate it? You the best, you the best,
what should I review next? Hit-that-like,
if-you-like, Spirit Phone,
want to... bone (?) UGGGghhh...
Thanks for the album, Neil! It's really fun. And thanks for watching,
you guys are the best. Forever! "
zyVECdLF2pc,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of one of coucher chest his favorite bands what a cow's favorite band eat the booty like pac-man 1975 with the amazing title I like it when you sleep for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it the creepiest creeper album title I've ever heard in my entire life this is a sophomore full-length LP from this UK pop rock outfit and I can't really say I enjoy their debut I think there were a few decent singles off of this thing but for the most part as an entire record I thought the songs and the production were just a little too clean slick and sanitary to really suck me in and I can't really say I was intrigued to listen to this new LP either especially since the cover of this new album and the cover of the band's last album are almost identical and just to me that communicates well wouldn't this just be like the same album over again isn't this just like simply a sequel or something but you guys are really insistent that I try this thing out and that I hear this thing and that I review this thing and usually when I get so many requests for a group that I have not expressly said before that I enjoy or I haven't like really reviewed thoroughly before maybe there's been some kind of change of pace maybe some reason to celebrate maybe something to be excited about you know the man could have turned a new leaf and I'm open to enjoying the music of a group that I didn't previously enjoy not everybody makes the same music or the same sound forever change is inevitable so was there a change here and did it appeal to me well on this new project over here the band's sound is still pretty far from original I don't think they've come any closer to putting together a distinct sound that I recognize as being oh this is what a 1975 song is I instantly recognized this band as the 1975 but they are sounding much less like the simple basic overly sanitized pop rock band that they on their last record right from the gate this record hits me with a series of songs that are very funky playful pop throwbacks not really from 1975 more like from 1985 specifically on the song Love Me which sounds borrowed straight out of the Huey Lewis and the news playbook not only that but it seems like 1975 or taking a cue from artists like Mark Ronson who also pulled from that playbook or people like Carly Rae Jepsen who also pulled from a similar era of pop music on her latest record you know more from artists like Paula Abdul but it seems like in the mainstream the 80s are having a little comeback but in the case of this Love Me song I think the 1975 are a little more bombastic with it I love just the gunshot snares on this thing the room but those are some really nice guitar licks really sweet and sour rhythm guitar right there and the bass has a great groove to it hmm the 1975 came through the track on this thing that I thought was fantastic so already we're off to a really great start the band goes much smoother on the song which is a track that I think could have fit a little more snug ly into their last full-length album though it does seem to have still an 80s throwback vibe to it and the guitars even though the song is a lot lighter than that love me track are still pretty flavorful the synths are glistening plus the very tight bass and drum groove on this track seems a little Michael Jackson inspired and even though it is a little overly sugary I like the song she's American - I thought the moment in the refrain where the band is singing about having her teeth or having his teeth fixed was pretty funny so we're not even done with the first half of the LP and there are already some good pop highlights on here but there are some softer cuts in the first half here that I don't really care for at all here the band really fails to appeal to me in any kind of way like on the song change of heart the very stiff drum machine beats and the ethereal instrumentation and the cloying on this thing are just all borderline sickening however I don't really mind the ballot on here if I believe you mostly because it seems like such a weird combination of sounds some of which the 1975 might have picked up on accidentally I'm not sure it's like the band is fusing slow sensual R&B with the kind of ultra vulnerable ballad writing that you would catch from an artist like perfume genius and then there's like a big gospel style chorus finish that came out of nowhere and there are some religious themes turning up in the lyrics here with a you know love interest tie-in it's definitely one of the better tunes on this thing though still again I wish the vocals on this thing had a little bit more grit conviction fire or maybe sort of portrayed a little bit more vulnerability most of the time they just kind of had this very smooth effeminate demeanor to them that you know just seems so dime a dozen these days when you're listening to a lot of male singers in the top 40 the band pulls another left hook and takes a risk with the song please be naked one of a couple tracks on here that I totally did not expect to just be instrumental and sort of electronic too even the title track what I thought was going to be more of a centerpiece on here turns out to be a little bit more than a detour with some very sweet and somewhat bubbly electronics considering that this record is just over an hour long the 1975 not previously a band that I would want to hear a full-length album from much less a full-length album that is an hour long so I'm kind of sitting here thinking it has the band really shown up until this point that they can write an hour of material that is fantastic from beginning to end at least one of these tracks could have been excusable if it was a short concise record and especially if it was kind of transitioning the record from one mood or one sound or one batch of tracks to another but instead it just kind of drowns in a sea of songs which really could have been cut back mostly toward the tail end though after please be naked I don't mind the sequencing here the song right after this my head the band I think takes another risk and takes things down a bit of a shoegaze erode although the track does run pretty long on the end is sort of flaccid because I feel like the band is sort of done everything they can in terms of intensity and volume it's like the 1975 genuinely wants to experiment with some of these sounds but they don't know how to keep them intriguing or you know just like continue to advance them for an entire track but again not every experiment were for Rey into another sound or genre is fulfilling like those somewhat indie tronic little instrumental detours I talked about or like on Ballad of me in my brain where deeper under the track the mix is just so filled with instrumentation layers and sound that it becomes an unnecessary clutter which is also true of the song the sound which features these dance drumbeats and these cacophonous scents and these really sunny sugar-sweet Passion Pit s background vocals and the song this must be my dream too I mean a track that is just so overloaded and simultaneously is like a reminder a good reminder of why the 80s had to end because not only are these sax solos and bass grooves tired today but the band had already exhausted them at this point on the album why are they revisiting them with so much less mmm there's just a point where this album stops being fun which is a shame because it had a good start it stops being fun and it just starts getting stale as they just rehash very uncreative ly these influences that they seem to be borrowing from in the most shallow and cursory ways add to that the lack of distinct vocals and and interesting lyrics and then the album's last few moments are just not interesting at all as we get some of the most breezy most easygoing cuts on the entire project that are just not engaging that there was a point with this project where I was hopeful and I was enjoying it but it was just a small sliver of the tracklist here toward the beginning I feel like this thing could have either been pared down into a gray EP or a somewhat decent commercial record that is like 30 to 40 minutes in length but instead we've got over an hour of material here much of it is bland much of it is uninteresting and much of it just borrows from a bunch of tired clichés from the 80s in the worst way vast majority of the time this 80s pop pastiche has no real substance behind it you know it's it's just a record they had a lot of potential but the fact that it's so bloated with all these unnecessary tracks and and filler there's not a huge concept going on here we're talking about three minutes songs which get old fast especially when you're talking about a band that does not have that distinct of a sound you know I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing unfortunately transition have you given the sound listen as you love it did you hate it what would you rate it universe universe what should I review next hit that light if you like the 1975 I like it when you sleep thank you for watching I appreciate it hope you're doing well forever 
J3dF8yhnsu0,uh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new mr. yo t EP the terrible tales of scurvy Jones rapper singer producer mr. yo T is an Internet character man I guess he's keeping a relatively low profile with this pen name of his but you might have heard his voice before recently on that last igloo ghost EP that was one of my favorite EPS of the year he had a little vocal appearance on there on this thing he felt a little garbled in the very maximal production of igloo ghost but his vocals were very speedy they were pitched down to a very deep kind of cartoony depth his delivery seemed kind of eccentric it was intriguing so of course I wanted to check out this new 7 track project over here it's 20 minutes long and from what I've read this thing is like an ongoing exploration of the luteal and a place within his creative mind where I guess all of these characters and worlds exist and on this latest project over here he's giving us a taste of yet another character the character featured on the album cover over here something yo T did last year on count Toros House of heebie-jeebies but but now we're getting this other pirate character with a similar cartoony voice and yes I did say pirate character there we will get into that a little bit later if you've ever enjoyed an MC who has used the art form of rap to sort of create a character II persona that is out of this world then I think you're gonna like what yo T has to offer you know your MF dooms maybe a little Tyler the Creator del the funky homosapien through guerrillas or captain Murphy from Flying Lotus this thing might be short but it's big on character derp and this person that yo T is rapping from the perspective of on this project is an outlaw of the Seas he's got one eye a beard a peg leg and a lot to say and just doesn't bend to anybody you know right at the start of this EP he's like no my squad will not fall to thee it's so fun I love all the dreary n' kind of schmaltzy and and very dusty and vintage melodies that make their way on to this project and they're usually mash with some very fuzzy overblown beats with me a little clipping bass the vocals are pretty loud a lot of the time to the point where they overtake the beats a little bit and even though the flows on this thing aren't exactly fast the delivery is very expressive the character is eccentric and animated and though you're not being hit with just these relentless walls of bars each line here does sort of add up into sort of the characters overall personality you can sort of eat up the details of this person and the aquatic briny world in which he lives again it's literally pirate rap but not in a jokey comedic gimmicky way truth be told the deep expressive vocals and the loaf I sometimes jazzy beats stand very well on their own just the sort of odd character portrait that this thing brings forward and the aquatic and the pirate themes just sort of add to the appeal here there are like two sides to this thing - interlude tracks and then a couple other songs that are like four minutes each and each of these lengthier cuts they're good tracks but I feel like yo T doesn't dive so deeply into this character that we get a full picture of this character within this EP short length you know we're getting a lot of the same imagery of cannons and crocodiles and and that sort of stuff that has popped up throughout much of this thing it's aquatic it's pirate it's dangerous it's kind of gritty it's animated but what are this characters lows what are is highs what are his fears what are his hopes what are his weaknesses I would love to hear a falling story with this character rather than just kind of a series of just one-off references and mentions that when you add them all up I mean certainly a portrait a world is paint but you know nothing as far as a strong narrative on this thing however maybe that is yet to come on a full-length album or just another EP where yotie delivers to us an image of another character all I know so far is that I'm intrigued with what I'm hearing and right now at this very short and this basic level yo T is already doing some really interesting things I would love to hear exactly what I'm hearing now except a little bit bigger a little bit larger and more conceptual and maybe more than just one character maybe two characters three characters four characters sort of bouncing off of one another across the length of an entire project this is a cool little EP there's some decent songs here I hear a lot of potential mayou T is doing and I'm going to be looking forward to what he's doing next for sure I'm feeling a late two decent seven on this thing Tran you 
oyB8a1Ks8Vg,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly y-you know review segment where I essentially get into a bunch of Records that I didn't cover this past month and I didn't want to just let them slip through the cracks I wanted to talk about them at least in brief so here we go in this gauntlet of little tiny opinionated biased album reviews by yours truly you're the best love you the new bj the chicago kid record over here uh I don't know I was pretty lukewarm on this thing I don't really have too much to say about it i roughly feel the same way about this album as I did bj the chicago kids last album i feel like there are a few decent tracks here and there but he's not a voice he's not an artist that I feel like carries an entire album well I guess and again that's really all I have to say as far as R&B artists go contemporary R&B artists go he's not bad but he's just not blown me away or exciting me so much that I stay engaged from beginning to end on a long project I will continue to enjoy his features and his single tracks that pop up here and there but you know I guess I'll just see if the next album Wow's me next I got to give a shout out to this crooked I record mostly because a lot of you already know the this album was produced by static Selecta he's a cool guy but on one particular track the song lost a fan they saw fit to sample yours truly one moment from my I hate hip hop video so I'm happy about that that was cool nice little crossover there so appreciate you appreciate you if you're looking for some gritty slaughterhouse related hip hop give this thing a listen and you know you'll hear me at some point in in the record next magruder grinds to album these guys are a DC grindcore band and was pretty excited to try this you know I love a hard heavy aggressive album when it does end up wow me however in this instance this just kind of felt like very meat and potatoes grind to me nothing really sticking out to me about it but if just looking for another grind record you're a big grind fan and you're just just a grind completest and somehow McGruder grind has slipped by you give this thing a listen uh I just got one thing to say about this record Hyuk Hyuk is a London band and this is their third full-length album if you're not familiar with them they're kind of a bit of a loaf eye indie rock outfit with a big sense of 90s nostalgia coming through in their music still the band and their sound are very far from distinct and some of the songs are okay though I've just never really been a big yuk guy however again if you are big into that sort of fuzzy very melodic 90s indie rock sound then I think this record is going to have a lot to offer you alright alright boring uh not a kilo Kish fan almost everything I've heard from her thus far as bored me to tears mostly because I feel like her voice is just so underwhelming there's just nothing that she offers vocally that interests me and with this new project over here that really doesn't change at all it seems that her singing chops have not improved even a little bit from when I last heard her her vocals are still too quiet still too breathy not much range she literally has no presence whatsoever however I will say that I appreciate the weird instrumental surprises on this thing like there are a few tracks here that sound like some dusty old jazz or almost like ballroom music and it's rare that you hear new artists doing anything along those lines so again I appreciate that she took some risks some instrumental risks but I wish she would take some vocal risks I feel like when it comes to her saying she's still playing it super safe and not pushing herself out of her comfort zone is is is this an American Apparel commercial thrash metal Kings anthrax are back with a new full-length album and I don't know I can't say I'm really all that crazy about it much of what's on here sounds either like anthrax are doing their best to sort of rehash some old Iron Maiden songs or relive an era in Metallica's career where they were not putting out their best stuff like load and reload Metallica so yeah you know anthrax at this point they're really not keeping it refreshing they're really not trying anything that sounds new to my ears maybe a little new for them but nothing new in general and they're failing to keep up the things that have made the band appealing in the first place new Nick caution mixtape over here Nick caution New York rapper Pro era member and this new mixtape it's not all that bad you know it's not blowing me away or anything like that but I think I like it a little more than the Kirk Knight commercial project that dropped not too long ago however much like Kirk Knight and a lot of pro era and Joey badass from when he was you know sort of putting as 1999 mixtape Nick I think vocally and lyrically has a little bit before he comes into his own lyrically there's not a whole lot here that makes me think okay this is a nick caution song this is a nick caution verse you know however on this thing like many other pro era members Nick delivers some really solid flows and his his lyricism isn't that bad and I think he actually hops on some pretty eccentric production here and there on this thing too so again this was a decent project if you're looking for some East Coast hip-hop you're a big Pro air fan you know you like Capital steez you like Joey badass you're like Kirk Knight you like all those dudes make sure you give this thing a listen don't let it slip by you it just didn't stop me in my tracks for a full-length review that's all school of Seven Bells this is their final project over here to be honest I've never been a school of Seven Bells fan however I was moved once I heard that this was going to be the group's final record because the band's founding member Benjamin Curtis had sort of succumbed to the battle that he had been fighting with cancer so I have to recommend this if you're into music that is very gauzy very shoegaze e dreamy I wouldn't say it's you know it's it's not like super bland washed-out dream pop or anything like that it's very lush it's very color it's very thick it's very dense basically some very textured and blissful electro infused indie pop if those genres if those sounds are appealing to you do not let this record slip by you especially since this is going to be the last record in their discography rest in peace - Benjamin Curtis another teen record that unfortunately I liked the singles but I just wasn't that into the album itself I think it came down to a lot of the vocals and a lot of the songwriting much of which on this thing I thought was lackluster however I appreciate some of the dance grooves the band pulls through with and some of the quirky throwback synthesizers and synthesizer arpeggios throughout the album that I think are really cool I think teen has a good aesthetic it's just that the the songwriting and the vocal performances just aren't that OnPoint suede or the London suede back at it again with a new record an album where I think some of the performances and some of the tunes are alright but the production on this thing is just so flat and lifeless I mean it all has the same ultra high-gloss finish to it that makes nearly every song here blend together and I think it just kind of sucks the organic feel out of the performances on this thing - again some decent tunes but the way the music was produced on this thing just sucks the life out of it it just gets so stale so fast and we're going to finish it off here with a mention of the new Jeffrey Lewis and lo Smoltz album which dropped last year slipped by me I do enjoy quite a bit of Jeffrey Lewis's music but this record just seemed to have a pretty low key release and I did not see it or hear of it so Jeffrey Lewis is one of New York's greatest folk bunkers poets if you like rock music and you like folk music that's very thoughtful that's very wordy he is most definitely worth checking out on this new record over here there are some hard and heavy tracks that are just blisteringly fast and Jeffrey Lewis is just working at a million words minute and he's just hitting you with so much I like those a lot the somber and sort of low-key cuts are little patience testing but in a way they do kind of remind me of stuff that Adam Green has done in the past so if you are an Adam green fan you might be into this again full punkers art rockers wordy rock poet fans apply do apply to listening to this thing and before I hey I want to mention this new Violent Femmes comeback record comeback record alert comeback record alert then giving this thing a listen it's not too bad for a comeback record considering it's been 15 years since the band's last album it's surprisingly raw it's very raw you know it's got that old full Punk sound that I think their earliest records used to have which made me gravitate toward the Violent Femmes in the first place however some of the songs on here I wouldn't say particularly good they're kind of goofy I think without sort of that theme of heartbreak or ank's which usually colors early Violent Femmes records maybe the band is sort of at a loss for you know something really juicy and exciting to write about however you know if you don't mind them sort of taking things down a sillier and sort of more playful and absurd road then I think this record might appeal a lot to you so if you're looking for some full Punk with a bit of a tongue-in-cheek demeanor then try this thing out never never never yeah yeah and don't forget to ask for your free NPR tote bag when you order the new esperanza spalding album as well you guys are the best and that's it that's the why you know review those are all the records I wanted to touch down on in this video and thank you for a watch in transition have you given these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you the best you the best what should I review next thanks for watching the video hope you're doing well stay hydrated eat some fruits and veggies let's get warm out get some Sun get some Sun out there everybody forever 
f6zWp5Ix5mk,all right some parts of this review will be unmastered I can't review like this that's so good a review man without your a yellow sure here hey what am I supposed to wear it Stan oh boy I'm wearing it I've been putting it in hate you I hate you so much I'm wearing it nail I guess I'll just put this on fits me better than you it's like a glove hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Kendrick Lamar album EP thing untitled unmastered Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar hands-down no question I will debate you has the best batting average in rap right now section 80 good kid maad city to pimp a butterfly every project he comes out with gets bigger better more ambitious more mind-bending and he's had a fantastic year he's won a ton of Grammys a lot of television performances so of course I am psyched for a new out-of-the-blue project but he's clearly not dropping something on that to pimp a butterfly level between the very blobby black cover and the untitled tracks and the title untitled unmastered I like that word play there but Kendrick is clearly telling us that what we're about to embark on are some b-sides some left overs with a kind of muddy recording either tracks that were written and were conceptualized but for some reason or another didn't end up on to pimp a butterfly or songs that Kendrick didn't want to release studio versions of that he had performed live that people knew of their existence or afterthoughts from to pimp a butterfly songs that he wanted to get down to tape and maybe not clean up so much for a commercial release but just get out there in some way shape or form just before he moves on to his next his next project his next concept which potentially these songs would not fit within so sure while this project may be sort of a loose collection of odds and ends I think what this thing proves here is that the past few years have been such a creative time for Kendrick that even the the the extras from this period are worth sharing and when assembled they create a pretty solid project now this thing is 35 minutes doesn't overstay its welcome and Kendrick with his collaborating musicians create these interesting fusions of grimy hip hop jazz soul funk now each track on this thing deliver some interesting ideas has some cool vibes to it but each of them are I don't know maybe a little structurally half-baked maybe there are some abrupt endings here or some sudden or messy transitions but again I guess that's kind of the point if these tracks were cleaned up and groomed to the point where they were on that to pimp a butterfly level this project would seem kind of redundant and I don't think just putting out another two butterfly is the reason for this project I think Kendrick is purposefully giving us that experience in the raw he's removing sort of the the safety net that a lot of artists put underneath themselves with flashy production and very precise editing and instead he's giving us these instrumental performances and these extra tracks with a very live-in-the-moment sound sort of in the same way that we got that live version of the song I off of to pimp a butterfly instead of the very clean pressed up studio version but the tracks on this thing are even messier than that still the chaos and that in the moment feel that organic feel of these songs is still really enjoyable if these untitled tracks or anything it's a continuation of that pimp a butterfly experience but just giving it to us at a different angle on the first Sun title track here I love the the groaning bassline and kind of that boom bap drum flavor it brings me right back to the 90s and just to sort of add that jazz flavor in there there are these sparkling keyboard embellishments and what sounds kind of like a dusty mellotron wheezing away in the background I love how the instrumentation here just comes together in a way where it sounds like a live Jam one thing I want to say about Kendra's verse on this opening track is that the the imagery seems really violent almost dystopian and it seems almost like it seems like maybe a riot is going on or some kind of unrest it's like Kendrick is maybe describing the world that was described in sort of that whole Tupac interview where people eventually rise up because they're fed up and they feel disenfranchised maybe this is sort of the world that Kendrick is reflecting on in this track and plus there are some moments on here where I presume when I read into the lyrics that he might have written his verses after the dates that are marked on these untitled tracks like one moment on here where he's talking about how he gave us to pimp a butterfly we're I mean essentially is he sort of talking about this past the date of the release of a butterfly or is he recording this before the release and sort of predicting that the album is going to be good on the second untitled track here I'm blown away this track is fantastic I love how it's a slow-mo sort of trap flavor with the rattling high hats but then it's got these wandering Sachs's and it's really milky heavy enveloping base it is legitimately an intoxicating rap song and not intoxicating in the way that futures music is intoxicating certainly futures music does shoot for that vibe but I feel like Kendrick takes that even further down that rabbit hole and he embodies this intoxication vocally as well as he's sort of cracking in his inflection as he's Dadra fo+ the way the instrumentation just kind of washes into some jazzy keys right at the end of this song reminds me of to pimp a butterfly as well another thing I want to say about this track is that it's not just Lucy it's not just intoxicating they're serious darkness and sort of danger to this track there's an edge to it while it does seem like Kendrick is and maybe a blissful or somewhat inebriated state it's also an unsettling track to also with how you racial epithets in this tracking jigaboos it's it's like these racial stereotypes are coming to life in a nightmare for him in this track and the seventh untitled track here is also a very woozy intoxicating moment as kendrick is dropping lines mentioning a series of things talking about this won't get you high as this this won't get you high as this which actually makes her a really catchy refrain that I wish actually made it onto the album levitate levitate Levitt however after this track we see some of the longest and most patients testing detours on the entire record and I get that this is a b-sides record it's not going to be clean and yeah while this little bit of audio over here might be maybe a little overly long it does display Kendrick you know with a decent singing voice over here you can hold his own and and a good sense of humor as well at this point it's like the project has turned into almost like a documentary we're being given a very intimate moment from the recording sessions or I guess you know sort of the the creative mind that was behind this record on the fifth untitled track here the instrumentation is absolutely stunning the piano and the horns on this thing sound very gorgeous and these little flourishes of horns and piano kind of alternate with this really tense bassline dududududududu they did the Kendrick comes through with this show-stopping flow and delivery not that it's super fast or technical or anything like that but he just has so much passion attention hearing him in the raw like this he's just a different animal than he is on a cleaner just very again pressed up studio recording which is also evidenced in that Kendrick when he takes his songs from his albums and performs them live with the musicians he collaborates with he completely reimagines them so even if the tracks here aren't produced as well as they could have been the ideas that are presented still shine through and still Reed is incredibly creative and not only is Kendricks delivery pretty stunning on this track but his verse on here is pretty interesting too of course there were some religious themes that came up on typical butterfly on numerous tracks but here kendrick seems to be more overt with them than ever not that he's you know sort of citing biblical verses here or anything but the picture he seems to be painting is his mindset is very dark it's very conflicted when he turns his face away or he turns his focus away from religion and God and I guess the righteous path or at least that's how I interpret this track the sixth untitled track here is a really smooth jazzy ballad that features some guest vocals from CeeLo the instrumentation sort of reminds me of one of the few interlude tracks off of to pimp a butterfly I could see how if this song had landed onto the album it might be a little bit redundant but I will say instrumentally melodically and vocally too because I like CeeLo on this track a lot I would have prefered this track to one of the interludes already on the record if instead of those tracks this one had made it on and gotten the same studio treat more tracks I want to mention of course the third untitled track a song that you may have heard Kendrick perform on The Colbert Report before he landed on the late-night circuit the what does the white man say what does the black man say track but on this track he sort of dives into other races and I think tries to paint lyrically these cultural stereotypes and mindsets that come along with these skin colors at least according to him and the most interesting verse of which I thought was the final one where the white man is looking for a cut of the money Kendrick is making for the music that he's selling short of slapping that 1099 price tag on his albums and finally the closing track is a synth funk jam with a vibe similar to that of these walls but maybe a little bit more uppity and energetic and the tracks essentially about money talking about blue faces the blue faces that are featured on the new bills that we've come out with in the u.s. really you know interesting wordplay descriptive imagery there of the money I'm sort of going from green to blue and you know just kind of another theme of making it success fame money money money money money that also turned up on to the butterfly I like this project a lot it's very much a fan project eject eject eject if Kendrick hasn't wowed you on good kid maad city and to pimp a butterfly I don't think he's going to do it he so I think this project is good but there is part of me that has my reservations because as a complete piece it's very messy it's all over the place I think Kendrick did a good job of sort of marketing this thing effectively drop the title drop the track titles let it be very clear to the audience that this is not just another commercial release this is something sort of on the side it's a detour and as a detour I think this project works really well in a way this thing is like an epilogue to the to pimp a butterfly era of Kendricks career and I don't really have any complaints about it other than the very sort of glaring shortcomings of the production and the recording and the assembly and the structures of these songs flaws that Kendrick and company already knew were in there when releasing this thing um you know I was going to play it low-key with this project going into it I didn't feel at all too impressed with the sound but when you dive past the fact that this thing is a little low fie there's really not much more you can attack it with in terms of shortcomings I mean there is still some incredible instrumental performances on here some good writing some great concepts which are pretty fleshed out when the songs actually you know sort of push past that two-minute mark it seems even when Kendrick is coming through with something that isn't his best it's still pretty great kind of feeling a decent a strong eight on this thing but uh sition have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you two best you the best what should I review next hit that like if you like what you should write their  kendrick lamar untitled unmastered forever 
h98BVWxEG-w,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a whale update where I let you guys know the records that have just made it into this sweet-ass record collection over here that gets fatter and fatter with every goddamn viral video um we do these videos raw typically so not a whole lot of editing and and a whole lot of bullshitting instead so I have you know maybe 10 or so records to get through over here a couple shoutouts to do the first shout out I want to do is to the good people over vitami please a fantastic record of the Month Club where they send to your door a fantastic exclusive pressing of a great record every month they also give you access to a really great exclusive vinyl store where they have limited edition copies of many fantastic albums and you also with the records they send you in the mail you get some 12-inch art and a lot of cool swag swaggerific swag nests so alright this record came from them so again I got to get my shout out Earle sweatshirts I don't like I don't go outside I know you guys have seen my review of this thing and was pretty i was i liked the record a little bit during my review however giving listen to the vinyl the production is a little heavier and i think a little more flavorful the bass has more presence and I like that a lot I think it actually has made this record a little more appealing to me so you know maybe with a few more lessons of this thing I'll come on it or come around on it a little bit but this is a very nice kind of clear vinyl with a blue tint to it and if you kind of blew up splatters in there I had another copy as well that I gave away for a giveaway too which was really cool but uh you know very minimal cool packaging actually like this cover more than I do the original digital cover of the project here we have you know credits big liner notes few ominous pictures over here thrown onto the other side of the sleeve but it's a a cool ford vinyl package with a nice cool color i don't recall having a any sort of light blue tinted clear vinyl with glue splatter so you know this is a cool little addition to the collection alright moving on i have a bunch of records here from actually let me get into this record first let me get into those record first this record gotta passed me by a buddy of mine over at uh old english spelling bee' records the band's name is duck and the record is called worm vacation and this is an interesting little album this record is very much a jazz album okay so if you're into jazz you're gonna want to check this thing out but it's kind of like it's got a bit of an old timey jazz feel to it like you know some swing or some ragtime a very cartoony very nutty very off-the-wall but it's got kind of a modern contemporary eccentricity and kind of experimental edge to it like um you know it's sort of like uh if the high school jazz band was really cool and into Tom Waits and Captain Beefheart and stuff like that you know they're very nerdy high school jazz dudes who only listen to like pre-war jazz and but and that's all the that's the only kind of jazz they want to play but simultaneously they're like really big and a Beefheart or something like that so uh it's it's a weird record it's an odd record at times painfully nerdy but it is a cool little LP so duct worm vacation got to give them a shout out this is a interesting listen for sure and I'm wondering if I got to do another shout out over here look and look and look in looking okay also this came from another source over here this is a cool little compilation I've not given this a spin yet but I'm pretty excited too it's a various artists compilation features a lot of hard heavy Punky noisy extreme underground rock bands if you like you men insane today is the day we have rocket from the Crypt over here lizard jaw box we have helmet dwarves Melvin's Mudhoney there's a lot of good names on here let's see supernova is on here boredoms is on here and a lot of others as well I'm not going to list every single one of them but this is a various artists compilation dope guns and in the streets and this is volumes 1 through 11 this I guess was a compilation series that came out along with the zine way way way way way back in the day and looks like a 11:11 Washington Avenue let's see amphetamine reptile records is essentially the label and it's hot over here really amazing logo and it's a 3 LP set yeah they just have all the artists listed over here too I'm just like you know looking at this cover art it's a super involved and there's like you know a little story in here that I read about this compilation series and again it's three LPS and one of them's white okay you got a white record over here one of them is milky white one of them is red and one of them's black so essentially you know you're getting all the colors of the album cover art itself on the vinyl records and you're open it up you kind of get a backstory you get the full album list I mean the full song list so and you're getting like all these pictures at the top over here of the compilation series on the front we have a obviously a picture of a bullet and with the other compilation pictures we have other bullets needles syringes condoms so volume 9 volume 10 volume 11 six five four so yeah it's a cool little compilation again if not listened to it yet but a lot of bands that I think are fantastic on this thing so it's going to be cool to sort of hear them all on this one album compilation various artist compilations are cool like this you know this is how back in the day you got turned on the you know you didn't have like some music streaming service algorithm telling you if you like Band X you'll like band Y you know this is how we did it back in the day you know you had to buy a various artists comp and hopefully you know The Melvins or the Boredoms or whatever band you like was on a compilation with a bunch of other cool ass bands that were also noisy and also crazy too you know this is how you found out about  back in the day this out interesting this is this how scenes sort of celebrated themselves sometimes or you know just kind of a chunks of the musical underground would sort of convene and come up with these compilations and um you know hopefully share in some fans so there you go dope guns and in the streets good I'm gonna work as hard as I can to say that album title as many times as possible before the video is over alright all these other records come from a really awesome dude over at Sony's red distribution he's like hey man I got a bunch of records laying around doing some records I was like yeah sure so he sends me this uh Mark Mothersbaugh frontman of Devo uh and the little EP over here titled myopia and this came out last year it slipped by me it's got six tracks on it and I've been giving it a listen it's totally off the wall and it's a bunch of weird electronic music I think fans of Dan Deacon might be into it a little bit crazy whacked-out beats with a lot of strange vocals and effects over it wonderful piss yellow vinyl over here gotta love that so it's a cool little EP if you're into some whacked-out electronic music if you want to hear something super kooky and maybe bordering on am not but maybe bordering on obnoxious but entertaining all the same Mark Mothersbaugh with myopia moving on from there I got a vinyl copy of not my favorite but a certainly decent spiritualize album laser-guided melodies over here it's a double LP set to black records nothing really to fancy about it other than the the pressings of the records over here super fat I think they're probably 180 gram very very heavy pressing over here and it's not a gatefold or anything like that you just kind of get these a little different pieces of art colors with these uh very eerie wiggly figures over here and you have a little bit of a I guess thank you liner note message action over here now it's like a quote liner notes are on the back so there you go but you know having a this record on vinyl will give me the chance to uh maybe give it a another listen and sort of uh maybe it'll grow on me a little bit I have a little red label over here of Mobb Deep's the infamous so you know kind of like a you know DJ copy a red label over here you know obviously the cover art is not here nothing really too fancy about it black records white sleeves two albums you know two to 12-inch LPS sort of tossed into a black sleeve but you know it's a cool uh it's cool it's I mean it's an essential hip-hop album to have all the same doesn't really matter if the covers are not there of course this another classic piece of a New York hip hop over here I've done a classic review of this you guys should be well aware and you know uh well in love with this album over here wu-tang's 36 chambers if you consider yourself a hip hop fan or I guess a fan of modern music in general and you do not know and you have not heard this album please do make the time to listen to this album red label white sleeve black record you know nothing too fancy schmancy about it and I already have this thing on CD but I just figured it's a cool album to have on vinyl as well when the opportunity comes to you know sort of bring that record somewhere you know I definitely will also a really awesome record that I already have and love that don't own on vinyl so I was like hell yes and be that The Strokes this is it Wow oh no is this it  that up because I'm an idiot can't remember you know I love these albums and I'm just so terrible track titles and album titles but you guys already know that because I say that song I say that wrong all the time in my reviews yeah so you know it's it's it's it's nothing personal you know doesn't mean I don't care about your record it doesn't mean I I didn't listen to your record even albums that are some of my favorite albums of all time I can't remember their titles so there you go let's say it one more time since we're already swearing dope guns and in the streets so yeah black records over here baby with the wonderful little strokes logo over here on the label side a side B is labeled but you know I I don't know I wish we had the song titles on the label that would have been nice you know I mean I though the logo is cool ah I didn't even know this ah I didn't even know wait what's going on here wait what's going on here what's happening here what what is happening here what is going on here hold on guys hold on guys something's going on here something's going on here something's happening here I'm confused I'm confused educate me educate me over here I'm confused I know you guys are like thinking what the hell's going on what the hell's going on so there's one record over here it's a black record and it's just like side a side be pretty thick pressing and there you go so you know nothing really to it other than that but there's another record here I just thought it was like you know to wreck I just thought it was the same album split across two records now we have another record over here it's slightly thinner and it's side a side B and it's half blue and half orange what the hell is going on here okay sorry about that wasn't expecting to be surprised like that this is the same album this is this is is this it but it's just kind of another copy of it but it's blue and orange and I'm not sure if that was intentional that the to be sent that which is cool however and not saying that this is going to be the case for any copy of this that people find this seems I was putting this on the record player and this seemed a little warped the needle was kind of bouncing up and down again and again and again at one particular part of the record as it was kind of spinning around and round however this very heavy pressing of this album seems completely solid so I don't know can't complain I guess I just have it an orange and blue strokes album now few more things to get to this next record over here really cool picture disc of this wonderful Manic Street Preachers album the Holy Bible this looks like I guess the 20th anniversary I guess of the album really cool really cool a fan of the show was gracious enough to pass me a CD copy of this record a long time ago so I'm not really sure if I'm going to be doing much playin of this I will most likely just kind of keep it in the sleeve you know it's rare that I do that but yeah I think that's probably gonna be the case with this one so cool cool picture disc picture disc but if you're looking for a really nice alternative rock album that countless bands have ripped off mercilessly Mayock Street Preachers the holy bye bye bye bye this last one is a record that I was debating on opening and I did open it I instantly regretted it however I guess it'll be cool to to show you guys the contents of this um it is a honest to god double LP gatefold vinyl copy of meow the jewels yes meow the jewels ah what what and on the other side of this thing are the little cat paws and and these are furry this is fur this is fur here I mean hopefully not real for God please don't let it be real fur I don't think it is it feels synthetic but yes these are furry these are furry little things over here why now that this is part of the reason I regretted opening this thing so you pull the the the sleeve out and it's just as big there's a little much this big ugly wall of fur just like on on the cover of the sleeve and it's getting everywhere it is just a I mean I guess if I have OCD about anything it's this about weird dust and fur getting everywhere and it's kind of stitched into the cardboard cover or glued onto it or something I guess it's glued on to it so yeah that's this kind of sleeve there on the other side we have you know just the song titles little credits on here no song titles some remix credits and we have a you know Twitter sort of links and all that there's a very cool sleeve killer Mike and LP as cats hanging in that muscle car there's the liner notes right there on the inside some bigger liner notes and the two LPs themselves are this wonderfully hideous brown color that is just so delicious just I've never had an LP this color so so that that makes I've never had an LP that was hairy either so I guess that's another kind of unique experience that this record brings to the table so yeah you basically have two LPS that are that wonderful shade of brown with some kind of black splattered in there so very cool very interesting though just holding this in my hand I can see like little microbes of fur and dust just like fly all around this thing and flying all around me so now I'm going to try to find a big fat plastic sleeve to sort of throw this record in so it doesn't sort of gather dust and just kind of create a giant mess in my collection but still very cool very interesting very unique packaging here for the run for the meow the jewels remix album I have to give killer mic and LP that for sure so very awesome very awesome stuff all right that's the vinyl update for this month we're gonna have to leave it there again shout out to my boys over at a vinyl e please links to or a link to their services down there in the description all right and again shout out to red distribution for passing me a lot of those records you guys are the best thank you for watching hopefully you got turned on some stuff that's that you haven't heard of before and you give it a try and I think that's all I have to say transition vinyl vinyl vinyl banana fanna fo final me my mo - vinyl forever 
ihEG6ut9bWU,hi everyone it's me no-shave oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Big Ups record before a million universes this is the sophomore full-length album from New York hardcore and noise rock and punk band Big Ups I loved their debut full-length album 18 hours of static that dropped a couple years ago this record featured a set of very intense animalistic songs lot of punk energy matched with some kind of cool spoken word passages on this record the band came off angry but thoughtful too and there were moments on the album that I thought were kind of funny like on the song justice where over and over they repeat the lyric everybody says it's getting better all the time but it's bad it's so bad there was definitely a sense of humor there or at least that the band was being so cynical it was funny a lot of what I heard on this thing reminded me of Minor Threat reminded me of Fugazi but with more of a chaotic noisy edge the band and the album didn't have the most original sound on the block but I think the group had a lot going for them and I was interested to see where they would go next I was kind of hoping they would develop a more distinct sound on their latest project but with before a million universes I think big up still continues to wear their influences on their sleeves even if their influences I think have diversified a little bit here and this album is certainly a change of pace the ferocity of the first album fades a little bit in favor of songs that have more subtle moments are more dynamic are longer features some kind of linear winding song structures some of the vocals are kind of deadpan there are more spoken word passages the guitar work is pretty dreary a lot of it reminds me of Slynt spiderland to the point where I get shots of deja vu here and there on this thing like on the introductory moments of the song posture and of course on this thing Fugazi continues to be a big inspiration though more like red medicine era Fugazi than like their debut album this isn't really the nonstop wild ride the 18 hours of static was there are a lot of mid paced moments here some very slow guitar riffs some of which I think were heavier but they don't quite reach that point because the production here is so rough and distorted a lot of the time but I will say that the production has kind of an appealing snarl to it this thing isn't as visceral or maybe as physically pummeling as the debut album but I do think it is emotionally pummeling and working in these really soft and minimal low-key guitar passages do keep the album from being one-dimensional however not every one of them goes over well because it really does seem like sometimes the band is trying to live vicariously through the Slynt playbook like on the song so much.you where they just take so much time to get going and it seems like they're just purposefully trying to work the listener into the deepest of lulls before just at the 2 minutes and 30 second mark just BAM hit them with some hard and heavy guitars the rhythm guitars on the song feathers of yes are super stiff and gets stale pretty fast and the slow guitar leads on meat where we are I find to be very patience testing and there isn't exactly any relief once the band goes into a heavier guitar passage where I just cannot wait for it to be over no question the best part on this song is it's chaotic finish however even though I may not like a couple of these slower passages worked into these songs the band always delivers a decent payoff and they do get kind of experimental and they go left with it occasionally like on the closing track here where the heavy slow guitar riffs that the band transitions into have this really weird syncopated groove to it I guess I just wish some of the performances on these tracks were more lively some of the writing more intricate maybe a little more sound play some of the soft guitar passages come off a little colorless because the production is a little tinny but these are pretty much my main complaints with the record these specific songs I like a vast majority of this album and I guess I nitpick a little bit because I feel like the band had a little more potential than what they delivered here overall I still think it's a great record a majority of the time these subtle moments are incorporated well and they contrast very heavily from the heavy guitars and the emotional outbursts that the band delivers very consistently I love the hideous bass and guitar distortion that pops up on nearly every single track here like seong national parks which was a great lead single to tease toward this album or the song posture which has one of the greatest riffs on the entire thing the roaring slide guitars on the song hope for someone are really great and the song capitalized features these really weird Wow guitar licks that just pop into the song in between this really great bass groove and every single time this little guitar lick pops up the band just stops to create complete silence to make room for this little guitar lick and the song night has a really admirably weird intro to it the way that the bass and the guitars are just so chaotic and they don't match up it reminds me a little bit of a no wave song and there's a bunch of weird layers of guitar feedback right at the end of the song that you know in an odd way remind me of r2d2 but thankfully they aren't r2d2 sampled the song contain myself features these plucked guitar harmonics and really weird drones that play very nicely over this bass and drum groove that really eases the listener into the album I'm impressed with most of the songs on this record and I find myself coming back to it again and again and again I think adjusting to a slightly softer Big Ups had me underwhelmed at first but it took me a little bit to realize that this album's punch is more cerebral than it is physical and while there may be a lot of blatant Slynt worship on here I can't deny that the band when they are indulging in that they're doing a pretty good job I like the energy of this record I like the mood of this record I like a majority of the writing I think the aggression comes off well when they are indulging in that just like it did on the first album I like that the band got more ambitious with song structure on this thing and I appreciate the slightly more abstract approach as well hopefully they continue to experiment and they strike upon something that's a little more distinct with their next release but if you like the last album and you're looking for a rough dirty punky rock record that is a little fringe and is a bit of a throwback I think you're gonna like this a lot I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this LP transition good album good album get out with a good album I hope you do well you're the best what did you think of this record did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana big ups before a million universes forever 
aZc8DokL7PI,yeah hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd back on the East Coast you guys didn't even miss me though got that got that seamless shit going count your chest is putting in work over here while I'm gone alright but now now we're live and direct with this new wild nothing record life of Pablo's paws this is the third full-length album under the wild nothing name from mr. Jack Tatum a producer multi-instrumentalist songwriter and typically while nothing is a dream pop project and I guess that's no different in this current instance it's not a genre that I'm really all that huge on I find a lot of the newer artists in this style of music to be kind of underwhelming however in the case of wild nothing I have enjoyed Jack's previous output the sound of the first two wild nothing records are super Pleasant sweet smooth intoxicating but even though it's very easygoing kind of breezy the songwriting was stellar enough and sharp enough that it kind of pierced past the Veil the wall of sound the very light ethereal dreamy just luring wall of sound but that kind of hazy aesthetic melts away a little bit on this latest record over here in favor of a sound and a record that's a little more tangible a little more up front but it doesn't necessarily add to wild nothing's appeal I don't feel like I'm in a dream state when I'm listening to this record everything feels very awake and in the moment however I wouldn't exactly call them music lively it's just kind of some very light polite background 80s pastiche pop and with the vocals being way more upfront than they've ever been on a wild nothing record the lyrics are more audible and and maybe that's not necessarily the best thing because the the lyrics aren't really that much of a focal point in fact the the album kind of makes my eyes are all when I hear moments like I don't believe in heaven but baby you can be my church or I'm feeling like a million I'll be enough the whole record of like Mac DeMarco but without the eccentric charm that makes his very laid-back style of pop music palatable I also wanted to say some of the synth leads on this thing's very synth centric album kind of reminds me of like the latest tame impala record but with these vocals it's almost as if I'm listening to Mack DeMarco collaborate with tame impala for a full-length record but they're just absolutely no fireworks to them coming together and creating music and despite so many songs on this thing dealing in love and matters of the heart emotionally a lot of the vocal performances on this this record and instrumentally to the album's kind of sterile and emotionless there's a real lack of sensuality and romance and emotional pain on this thing especially on tracks we're given the lyrics they're very obviously should be like on the song lady blue I think the song of the very eye is the closest this record comes to pulling together a sensual groove and you know it's only like relatively sensual and comparison with the other tracks here but I do love the sweet little hip swaying groove on the chorus hear the subtle sax embellishments despite a lack of emotional highs or diversity I do like the instrumental diversity on this thing like on the song Japanese Alice which is this kind of little minimal very simple strip back art rock song that reminds me of wire quite a bit specifically a song outdoor minor I like the very driving and fuzzy rock instrumentation on the song to know you the nimble keyboards on the title track here really nice the song TV queen has some of the best lead melodies on the entire record and the closer here is one of the most instrumental e lush and layered songs on the entire record it actually kind of makes me wish other tracks here were as dense instrumentally it would have made this thing a little easier to listen to since the vocals really don't have that much presence and that's the issue ultimately this is this is mixed and sort of sculpted much more in the same way a more traditional pop record is and as a result I think this album isn't that engaging because the vocals are just so lifeless for a pop record this thing has very little in the way of persona but there are some decent instrumentals here some decent production and a few tunes here and there as well that I think are really good I guess on the songwriting side this record didn't stun me quite as much as the previous wild nothing efforts - this is this is just kind of one of those albums where it checks off a lot of the same boxes that previous records from the same artist have but there are some things that just really feel missing and as a result even though there are some highlights on this thing for me here and there I'm mostly indifferent toward a lot of the record I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition did you give the sound listen did you love it you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you the best what should i review next I should shave forever 
bLmPfVNEbYM,ah hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick little review of this new Charli XCX EP room room UK pop singer Charli XCX a musical artist - up to this point I have found excruciating ly bland but on this new EP she teams up with PC music producer Sophie one of my favorite producers right now I think one of the most creative producers out there at the moment Sophie's 2015 singles compilation was on my favorite collections of tracks of 2015 Sophie makes pop music and electronic dance music with a kooky wild eccentric experimental edge and Sophie's aesthetic and PC music's aesthetic is very much a play on manufactured pop artists with very gaudy looks and fashion senses and Charli XCX is like almost all of that she checks all those boxes so I guess Sophie can do what he usually does without having to manufacture anything and for the most part Charli XCX is kind of bending to the whims of Sophie she is very much being plugged into a very similar role to that of many other singers that have popped on to PC music songs in the past I think the greatest compliment that I can give this EP is that Sophie and Charli XCX they complement each other on pretty much every single track here even on the song that I think is the weakest track here and that's trophy a track that's fast it's kooky its hyperactive it's a little gimmicky with a silly repetitive chorus there's not too much in the way of substance to the song it's the shortest track here though I think it would have been improved greatly if it had just been made a bit longer and as far as Charley's vocals on this thing Sophie sees fit to just kind of leave them be he's not chipmunking them or anything like that which has consistently been an issue that I've had with a lot of PC music releases though it does grab my ear it's not entirely net Cerie and I think Charli XCX proves that with vocals that while they aren't chipmunk they still grab my attention with an incredible amount of sass and they're sort of cheeky too as she says stuff like bitch I'm here to you up which is maybe the most Death Grips II thing I've ever heard come out of her mouth the song secret I think is the track on here that is the closest to her original style the vocal melody is really catchy and reminds me of something like I don't know something Christina Aguilera might have done in the 2000s the vocals are very clean they're very radio friendly I think but then they're back with these whimpering just squeaking tones and a kind of a groaning banger B that is so odd but it's visceral and I can't help but just move to it and I like how this instrumental and many other instrumentals here are just constantly changing in flavor and I guess energy and intensity it's very angular the song paradise is a blissful little ballad that is very spacious it's very sweet it kind of takes the most sugary elements of house pop from the 2000s and then dips them in maple syrup and rolls them around in brown sugar it's high future hyper gloss lasers flying at your face and then with a lead single from this thing room room the track that I guess kind of drives this whole collaboration we have some driving synth bass it's kind of ballsy intro that just drops away instantaneously for a very spacious simple beat that leaves a lot of room for Charlie to do what she's doing vocally which is just talking a lot of and it's a fun track I just like how gutsy and in-your-face and unapologetically braggadocious it is it's very modern it's very contemporary and that it sounds like very narcissistic very me centric pop music but the instrumental tells a different story it's so weird it's so mutated in a way where it sounds like them I'm listening to something not new but something from the future like something from Pop's dystopian future where the genre has essentially just started to swallow its own male out of love for itself but also hate for itself but without getting to you know up my own ass and just conceptual about the whole thing I think these tracks are great they're very fun easily the best thing I think Charli XCX has been involved in and Sophie just kills it once again this project to me is Sophie just extending what he has been doing so far with his singles just with Charli XCX along for the ride and in a way I think they both enhance what the other does it's nice that sophie has a singer with a well known name and you know he's not chipmunking the vocals on here not giving in to those vocal gimmicks that I know PC music projects have in the past and Charli XCX it's almost like she's being driven to do something a little more interesting a little more risky really challenging her listeners on this project to hear out some very odd production my only huge complaint is is really that I want more I like this collection of tracks a lot I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given the CP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate at you two best you the best what should I review next hit that like if you like yeah yeah yeah yeah Charli XCX Sophie mmm forever 
4fVUAWDmvUw,hey hands and knees Nintendo here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis --is this unruly mess I made Seattle rapper Macklemore paired up once again with his right hand producer man Ryan Lewis for a new full-length album they had a huge independent come up in 2012 off of some singles from their last collaborative album and it has been a rocky and polarizing ride ever since but before all this drama and controversy that now surrounds McLemore I was enjoying his music I really liked his wings single video and EP I thought his album which was a little while before he blew up was decent upon my initial review of it there were some corny tracks on this thing but it had some powerful moments - I like the topical tracks and I thought some of the more playful ridiculous songs were cool as well in general the album was being met with some very polite praise I mean even people from Top Dawg entertainment were featured on the project even Sub Pop came out with a vinyl single of the song same love but then it's just kind of like overnight success because macklemore's silliest track on the project blew up due to not only at being a fun and a well-crafted song but it had a nutty music video to boot and that caused all of macklemore's other tracks to be put back into perspective like can't hold us and same love which are now huge smash hits the album itself has a Platinum certification and with this sudden popularity has come a lot of criticisms Macklemore is a white guy in hip-hop he's kind of exploiting the gay community for attention and success because he himself he's not in that community why would he be making songs about their struggles there's also this thing that happened Macklemore a lot of people see him as corny and preachy and inauthentic and I get those criticisms he's not always on my good side either but sometimes I don't think people want to give him credit where it is due I think he can dominate and vividly paint a topic when he wants to I think Ryan Lewis is a talented producer sure maybe his beats are a little glitzy and glamorous sometimes but I think they're tasteful mostly as far as pop rap goes I think you could do a lot worse I mean I could I could be listening to a gez record and I don't want to listen to a gez record and I just find it odd that people complain about pop rap like this is not really being hip-hop because the truth is is that the pop rap floodgates have been opened years ago by some of the originators of the genre it's like when it comes to Macklemore everybody becomes this 2000s New York hip-hop purist we're in a backpack when I know you're just listening to Drake and with this new record over here I'm not really expecting Macklemore to win any of these people over when his haters over I'm not even really expecting him to change his sound or his style all that much I mean he's seen nothing but success up until this point being himself paired with Ryan Lewis so I don't see him veering away from that path and that's in fact what he does he sticks to his guns on this project and in a way I do admire him for that because he's in a way staying true to himself in the face of this incredible fame that he's just been handed overnight now he's not doing the same exact thing over again well not the exact same thing like with macklemore's last project there are moments on here that are incredibly silly and playful maybe to the point where they step over a boundary where it makes me cringe a little bit there are tracks that feature glamorous huge instrumentals layered with just gigantic arranged instrumentation where Macklemore lyrically is trying to take on a larger-than-life topic in a lot of ways this record is the Macklemore that we've known from his last album just with everything about him turned up to 11 the entire thing kicks off with the incredibly sharp and self-aware light tunnels probably one of my favorite tracks on the project monstrous instrumentation on this thing from the group vocals to the strings to the horns to the pianos the ever prevalent pianos all over this thing there's a very dramatic hook from Mike slap and lyrically the song is essentially about how Macklemore is dealing with this newfound fame specifically within the context of the Grammy Awards show where he won best hip-hop record and he uses this opportunity to kind of go in on the commercialism and the narcissism of the music industry although despite the drama with Kendrick and him feeling like Kendrick should have won I'm kind of surprised that he didn't really give a large nod to that in this song still even with that piece of the puzzle being omitted between the makeup and the inauthenticity he paints a really vivid picture I mean the the story is just watertight from him arriving to the place to his acceptance speech all of which are displayed in different passages of the song where he either will change his inflection a little bit or the instrumentation will alter and I love how he finishes the song off describing his popularity his fame and his success as an unruly mess that he made while I might not agree with Macklemore on everything that he says and does on every single song there are moments where I think his self-awareness is so sharp that I can't help but just be in admiration of it the next track is downtown a big single off of this record that you might have already heard and the track has probably grown on me a little bit since I initially heard it and reviewed it on this channel the tara misu line still makes me groan a bit but the featured vocals from guys like Melly Mel and Grandmaster Caz awesome the hook from the foxy Shazam lead singer is amazing to the groove and the bass line on this track is great killer and it's just one of those moments from Macklemore comes through the fun song that's actually fun and entertaining no major complaints it's a highlight on the record but with Brad Pitt's cousin McLemore continues his silly streak but just those dives it into little painting himself as Brad Pitt's ugly cousin or something with a hook that is so painful to sit through oh you did Lena's Oh give me a break though I don't really have anything against a lot of the verses on this thing I do think Macklemore comes across as charismatic and clever and funny when he's dropping lines about how someone else will show up to a place with their crew but he's showing up with his parents and every white guy walks to the barbershop asking for the Macklemore haircut Macklemore has a good sense of humor about himself and what he does and though it doesn't always resonate with me I do appreciate it then we have the song buckshot which is another favorite of mine on this thing features not only DJ premier but also the god Karras one another moment on the project where I feel like Macklemore is obviously inviting these people on to sort of prove his hip-hop knowledge and his hip-hop authenticity and and sure it seems a little shallow and it seems a little obvious that effort seems very obvious but because he actually does appreciate the genre these features and these incorporations go over really well because Kerris ones feature on this thing is fantastic its energetic it's in your face it's just over the top and macklemore's delivery on this track is great too and the best thing about this track is not only the killer instrumental which has this piano line that kind of alludes to nas Illmatic I mean it's just a hard grimy 90s boom bap flavor to this beat but also the song is about graffiti it's about tagging and Macklemore and Kara's one handled the topic really well I mean they really carry the torch Macklemore brings it to Karis one in the relay race continues and they just stay on point the record switches into a heart warming gear with Ed Sheeran on the song growing up the track is a little cloying but it's a semi cute song about fatherhood and all the plans Macklemore has for raising his daughter and there are some thoughtful and precious sentiments on this record but there are just as many moments that uh go to festivals do yoga and cheat it calculus it's oppressively heartwarming you know to the point where it feels manipulative and then I don't care for it I do like the Ed Sheeran hook on this thing though it's it's rare that I come across an Ed Sheeran track or chorus that I care for not that I think he's terrible but he just never really resonates with me but I think his passion is singing on this track is beautiful and once again they're very prominent pianos on this album pop up here and I think they set a good foundation the album stays serious on the next track Kevin it seems Macklemore being a dad kind of throws him back into a bit of a nostalgia trip and he starts taking on a really huge topic here abuse of prescription drugs and how prescription drugs can kind of be a gateway for some people the song kind of reminds me of wings in that Macklemore is really shedding some light on an overlooked issue or an ignored issue and then tying it in with some personal experiences seeing a friend of his suffer through this issue on the song Saint IDEs Macklemore goes in a little bit further when it comes to just using substances to escape from the stresses of everyday life the instrumental is super subtle very quiet features these twine guitars that kind of remind me of like a Velvet Underground song it's a nice little detour and with the song need to know with chance the rapper he continues down this road of ignorance is bliss and kind of looking sentimentally back on these days when he didn't really need to know the truth or acknowledge the truth and he was again just diving into substances in order to I guess kind of heal him so while it's not a bad track and I think the chance the rapper features great I love the line that he drops about a scratching a line out but not being able to forget it and I do like a lot of macklemore's lyrics on this track - I mean I love the the bar about the grass always being greener when you play on astroturf but by this point on the record this point of ignorance being bliss has been driven home I mean it's been home it's 18 now and it's ready to move out of the house it's almost like Macklemore is running out of things to write about because he hasn't really drifted away from this topic for three tracks now and then we drift into a song that is the worst song on the project dance off you know I thought spoons was going to be the worst song on this project but it appears not to have made it onto the the standard version of the record but the song dance-off does take that worst track title but very easily it's just a shade away from being like a Lonely Island comedy rap track really featuring these really overdone and kind cartoony spoken-word vocals from actor Idris Elba a decent feature from Anderson PAC but I mean unless you want to hear verses about silly dance moves and old people genitals this track will probably not be for you the song let's eat is kind of cute it's a track about food fat dieting exercise taking care of yourself wanting to diet but always putting it off to the next day it's kind of like the mediocrity anthem though again kind of cute and a bolo tie maybe the most underwhelming track on the project sort of drab not really that great of a beat not really that great of a flow a feature from yg that I'm not really sure what Macklemore thought it was bringing to the track and lyrically Macklemore his point is so faint on this song he might as well just not have made it like is the industry unfair I guess but I feel like you kind of already painted that picture with the first track and now you've kind of come back to it here on this song but with way less oomph and and way less in the way of interesting observations you know not that the first two thirds of the record are perfect they're not but they were certainly much more consistent in the last third of this thing it feels like on the last third here Macklemore has run out of things to say and the record is really struggling to get its footing back and the album does not end off strong with the song white privilege I've given this tracker review on this channel previously and I have to say within the context of the record I don't really enjoy it anymore I might even enjoy it less musically instrumentally the song is so tedious and disjointed and unfulfilled Macklemore sounds about as awkward on these shades of black music as he does trying to talk about these black issues and when it comes to the message I feel like Macklemore is doing exactly what he's talking about not doing or what he's trying not to do or what he thinks he's not doing and that is in a really unhealthy and in a really unhelpful way just inserting himself into the black lives matter discussion in a way that seems like he's just kind of doing it for attention or just jumping onto the van wagon because he feels for some reason like he needs to talk about these issues and they're worth talking about discussions should be had but the way that Macklemore frames it in this song it's like it's all about him it's not really about what's at stake it's not really about who's suffering it's not really about why it's about Macklemore feeling awkward and feeling uninvited to participate in these protests and he just wants to be able to help and he sort of puts it within the frame of being white and sure your average white person probably does have some of these thoughts in their head when it comes to sympathizing with movements like black lives matter but it's not like white people don't go to these protests it's not like there aren't black protesters who are fine with white people involving themselves in these protests it's not like black people don't want white people to help out in any way shape or form on these issues but it seems Macklemore kind of ignores the celebrity quotient of this equation when it comes to him I mean I'm sure a lot of these black lives matter people aren't against him participating because he's white but because he's a celebrity and just jumping in being like hey I'm Macklemore and participating I care has the potential to derail and distract from what the protesters are trying to do I mean black lives matter they're not perfect I don't agree with them on everything but consistently the group has not been a very hierarchal organization they're not really the group to just let celebrities in and let figureheads in and make announcements and make decisions they're a collective in the truest sense of the word and Macklemore sort of seems to be ignorant to that in this song and ignorant to a lot of other things too I mean as well intentioned as he might be on this issue the way the song ends off with this collage that essentially comes the conclusion that we just need to have a dialogue we just need to come to a dialogue we just need to to read an article it makes the whole thing just seem like an empty platitude and empty promise it's just a big ball of feelings with no real solutions or point of view and I fail to see what macklemore's point of view brings to this problem overall I think the record is OK it's pretty inconsistent you know has high marks it has slow marks most of the low stuff turns up in the last third where Macklemore effectively just runs out of things to rap about and the big issues that he does try to take on like white privilege like black lives matter he does so very ineffectively just placing the blame on himself and just putting the cross on his back as this white rapper martyr does nobody no good just once again Macklemore is his clever funny thoughtful corny cringy self he's not always bad he's not always good and as a result I mean you get mixed results once again just like with his last

hkmX0tUrtv4,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly great albums segment where I talk about a series of projects that really surprised me over the past month this was a busy month I reviewed a lot of records not a lot of them I thought were great but there were so many that I don't feel like I got to talk about that hopefully I am able to discuss a little bit in the why you know review but there are a few albums I'm still hoping to catch up on in the next week or so links to the reviews and links to songs from these albums down there in the description box like usual and we are going to start off with Matt Moses ultimate care - this is a really cool record definitely one of the coolest records I'm gonna hear this year hands down a bit of a glitchy abstract IDM type experience where the duo samples the wash cycle of a washing machine in one long 38 minute piece which is actually pretty musical serene rhythmic intense it's got multiple phases to it super ambitious lot of flavor a lot of texture a lot of color and an interesting concept to boot moving on from there a somewhat left-field pop record that has its flaws but has a lot of highlights to the new santigold album 99 cents if you're looking for something that's gonna fuse a lot of genres together including reggae a bit of hip hop a bit of electro pop some indie pop - very sunny a little washed out a little too washed out for my taste but some good tunes in here then give this thing a listen and finally I will recommend the new bones mixtape useless yeah I'm you know the this was a hard and heavy tape you know it was super dark for him and it seems like he's up to the ante when it comes to the vocal recording to his vocal delivery to the production he's just sounding better on this project it's a little short of breath I just wish it was a little meteor but you know just kind of being brief and to the point and I don't know just not overstaying his welcome that's kind of bones as style at this point I suppose and those are the three records that I want to recommend to you for this month hope you're doing well and eat some fruits and veggies get some water stay hydrated transition what have some of your favorite records from this past month been let me know you're the best and it's warming up outside it's kind of nice forever 
KoTfcR2QKGs,weenies in Chile man it's your boy couch esta here I know you wish I'd rather be doing this review but here is that other guy hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new young lean record warlord swedish internet rap sensation young lean and this is his second full-length commercial project his previous efforts unknown memory and unknown death you may or may not already know wasn't a big fan these projects had their moments they were cloudy and intoxicating kind of alluring but beyond this really shallow aesthetic I wasn't finding that much to like the downsides being the lazy song structures and writing the lethargic vocals the vapid lyrics some really annoying auto-tune as well and to be honest I'm not really expecting any big changes on this new record over here no major revelations or advancements in the sound of mr. lean he has an itch which he seems to be satisfying with his style so I don't see any big reason for him to change what he does really but he does alter his sound a little on this project and I did like the teaser track Hoover a lot here's me praising it it feels and it feels ah if you ha that's how it feels I'm liking this track again there's not a whole lot to it lyrically and flow wise but I think sure lyrically this track was not that deep and young leans music tends to run a little mindless but as long as he's dishing out some hard bangers and some catchy flows I could see past some really shallow lyrics but lo and behold right from the start of this record we hear young leans trademark lack of enthusiasm and awkward flow and somewhat thick Swedish accent trying to pronounce all these English words however the sound change comes in the form of the vocals being way more up front way less wash in Reaver which I guess makes this record a little more intimate it's a little more personal it has nothing to hide in a sense and the production isn't that bad a lot of these tracks - it's not exactly flashy or imaginative or anything like that but it's got some trap style high hats some deep bassy resonant kicks some cloudy ethereal atmospheres they're pretty intoxicating and this vibe continues up to the point where the tracklist features the song Hoover although I I may like how trippy and just slow-mo a lot of these songs feel it's just kind of best to not think that hard about the lyrics especially on the first verse of the song fantasy life is like I Drive through I guess I could die soon whew that was deep I could tune out a lot of a young Lena's saying much of the time but then there's some distractingly awful features like a little flash don't know who that guy is but his appearance on this record doesn't exactly make me want to know and his features only outshined in terms of badness by blades on the song hocus-pocus he sort of just comes in very aggressively with this awful off-key singing that even the auto-tune distortion that are placed on his voice just could not save otherwise though this track would be a highlight on the record really with no exception lyrics on this project read like the random musings of a STONER which could be cool for a little bit of inspiration but their points on this thing where yung lean sounds very audibly high out of his mind to the point where it affects the quality of his rapping and his delivery namely on the track Afghanistan where he's just sounding painfully awkward or on the track fire where he literally has no breath control and can barely stay on tempo in one breath I appreciate that yung lean has sort of done away with a lot of the reverb and has sort of given us a clearer picture of him as a performer but this clarity hasn't really revealed anything other than flaws and shortcomings shortcomings that were kind of obvi guess beyond the reverb on the previous projects but now here they're just kind of confirmed I guess it's sort of at this point on the album the song fire where I no longer feel like I'm listening to something that's really trippy really intoxicating just high blissful up in the clouds it's not this mind altering experience anymore and it's just kind of become drivel there are a few flashes in the pan like on the refrain of the song slow down which I think lyrically puts very well the bliss and the monotony of young leans routine and I guess druggie routine and the vibe the aesthetic of this record but most of the tracks in the latter half of this record are so bad they're funny like so high I'm a bard bard a flow and a set of lyrics on the song I contact that I'm surprised anyone would put pen to paper to write these the song Air Force Ones has a catchy hook but the thing is that this project much like young leans previous projects just has a really shallow aesthetic to it that gets really stale really fast there are several tracks that are decent or even good and all the other songs just kind of try to hash it out with the same formula with very little variation and with so little results this project is about as shallow as internet rap gets right now I think and what's the weirdest thing is that from one project to another project to this project vocally and lyrically it seems like yung lean hasn't improved at all maybe in this instance regress a little bit he still sounds like an amateur and now he's several projects deep but he has no amateur charm I'm feeling a light two decent three on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you two best you two best what should I review next hit that like if you like you hate me because I'm not a big fan of yung lean this record anyway Hoover Cooper's good way God was underground man way I gotta know has ended forever

info on that through the best mailing list in the universe welcome to the show Maddox yeah man that's quite the intro you nailed it you hit all the all the talking points you nailed it everything a 1 awesome awesome so as I was saying before I turn this recorder on this has been sort of a weird cross-section of paths here because I've been reading your website since high school and sort of going back on your website now and looking through a lot of those old archives it was pretty funny seeing you rant about stuff that just has a totally different context now like I reread your jared fogle article which in in retrospect now it's like it's that's that's so great if only you just had the the premonition just throw a child molester in there casually you know it just it just would have made sense you would have predicted it yeah man so a long time ago I wrote this article called how to spot pedophile and I talked about this phenomenon that I felt that a lot of pedophiles had after you know I after seeing their pictures and mug shots up here in the news I noticed some some patterns and they all had kind of this distinct type of smile that I called the pedo smiles and it was a slight it was almost like a Mona Lisa smile like if if the Mona Lisa were a dude you know imagine that smile on a dude and that's a pedophile that was my theory anyway so I wrote that articles you know kind of a satirical article like what can we spot pedophiles based on their smile and then about four or five years later there's this science journal that published this article that is actually giving credence to this theory they're saying that there may actually be some truth to this and I was cited in some like some scientific articles on a website somewhere you actually got credit oh yeah yeah they linked to it and they they they begrudgingly linked to me to they said well you know this guy's language is very colorful and we don't agree with all of his conclusions but here's the article anyway you know doing what you do I don't know I'm just I'm just really impressed with how negative of following and just uh just how unique your your reputation is online I mean over the years and you've been doing this for a while you've you've made quite a few enemies uh enemies of everybody from New Yorkers to Penn & Teller to the Apple Corporation to even a pepperoni lover's yeah pepperoni lovers who you know for short I just like to call them idiots um a pepperoni pepperonis a garbage topping in a waste of time now you know I waited it's article about pepperoni while back and I know I'm going on a tangent here cuz you mentioned about the other stuff but I just it's fresh in my mind someone linked to me a YouTube video recently where a guy I guess he was was near near Italy and he wanted to have a test to see if he could drive to Italy and buy a pizza in the time it took for his friend to make one from scratch and anyway so he drove to Italy and he asked repeats that was pepperoni on it pepperoni does not mean pepperoni in Italian pepperoni means peppers there is no such thing as pepperoni so he ordered his pizza and brought it home and was disappointed to find out he just got a pizza full of peppers on it so yeah pepperoni is a garbage topping it's stupid and I will fight anyone on it thank you so considering your your strong opinions on everything they're very strong negative opinions on everything you know I mean me me person as as someone who critiques something you know I review music on a regular basis and we're talking about like hundreds of album reviews coming out every year I mean I'm astounded with just how many things you find to hate in in the world and it's it's it's a talent to the point where usually things that either I maybe like a little bit or maybe I'm kind of neutral on you sort of bring this perspective where you bring out everything's inherent shittiness a little grayer you know I think you know hey thanks man was maybe not the response that I expected obviously you sort of seem to take pride in it yeah well I mean here's the thing if I if I hate something there and enough to the point where I'm going to take time out of my life to write an article on a website and then also create a video and do all the research like it's really got to invoke some strong feelings but I can also say the same of things that I love like for example Mad Max the new Mad Max movie was so awesome it's King shit right it should be picture of the year of 2015 of 2016 and 2017 I'm gonna go out on the record and I'm gonna say that the Academy Award is gonna go to Mad Max for all three years and it's such a good movie i rated that movie out of 5 stars i gave it a hundred stars a hundred out of five stars I loved it so I look I'm a passionate man what can I say I love things and I hate things to the max so the man the it makes me sort of want to ask you to what do you what do you feel is sort of the importance of negativity online or just negativity in general because the internet generally sort of seems to be this place where we see things is really negative there's negative comments there's trolls there's haters there's a lot of vitriol getting thrown around everywhere and it seems like people who own websites where comments and interactions can be posted do their best to kind of clean the negativity up get rid of it throw it in the trash and you just sort of seem to put it out there and not hold back on any of it maybe you kind of just go a little over the top with it I mean you know you you're obviously much more personable in this conversation that I think a lot of people would probably assume you were looking just looking at your videos right so there to get real here for a second I I read this there's this book that that I read a while back called you are not so smart and he does a podcast as well and he talked about this guy recently on his podcast his name is Paul Graham have you heard of Paul Graham before enlightening Paul Graham is he's a he's big in the tech world and he wrote an essay I think back in 2008 called how to disagree and he talked about this phenomenon of disagreement on the Internet and the reason there's so much of it and there's so much negativity it's because liking something word agreeing with someone is something you can do passively when you like something or someone you don't even have to comment especially if you read a news article however if you dislike or disagree with someone you have to voice your opinion you have to post something so more often than not when someone comments on a website just by virtue of the fact that they're commenting it's going to be more negative than positive and with the advent of Facebook and social networks they have lowered the cost of liking or disagreeing or extremely liking or agreeing with someone to simply clicking a like button so that that is why sometimes when you glance at Facebook or the youtube comment section you will be you will come away with the overwhelming feeling that everybody hates everything out there and it's all very negative and that just isn't the case the people who are likely to comment aren't necessarily representative of the majority of people who are viewing your content or news article so basically when people like something or they're fine with something they're more likely to respond with just silence and then we're just watching it and then walking away whereas they sort of inspire something in people yeah exactly look I mean just look at the comments section of a YouTube video of we're the majority of the up votes extremely the majority of the the votes on the video is thumbs up as opposed to thumbs down and then read the comments and see if the comments correspond to those votes you've more often than not they don't because people who are very if you like something if you like a YouTube video you're less likely to comment saying hey I really like this video because otherwise you're going to see you know hundreds and thousands of people commenting the exact same thing saying I like this I think this is great good job keep it going you're gonna see less positive reinforcement and more negative because negative behind the negativity is usually a reason if they didn't like something you said they're going to say specifically what they didn't like about it and why did is agree whereas if they liked it well what do you need to know we liked it got it yeah this this sort of makes me think about the Internet age and new media versus old media because I mean you you and I are obviously at an age where we can remember we're not going on the internet most of the time to expose ourselves to news and entertainment and so on and so forth and a vast majority of the entertainment that we were seeing on TV or in the radio or in newspapers I mean all of those sources were very carefully compiled and created so that they wouldn't elicit hatred from the audience you know I mean if people hated what they were being exposed to on a certain TV station or in a book or what-have-you that meant the loss of sales or some kind of drama you know the bottom line would be affected and now in the Internet age it seems like there's been this rise of content that people just love to hate watch hate watching is very much a thing and now that people can really just kind of indulge in that side of themselves I mean there are people online who you know essentially make livings even on places like YouTube making videos where they know they're just kind of effectively trolling their audiences and just eliciting negative responses yeah I've seen some of that I've seen some people who are intentionally trolling but so let me ask you this again because as a music and culture critic yourself do you ever look to hate review an album like do you know going into an album that you're not going to like it or a certain band and you're going you're kind of just doing it to take the piss out of it just because you know they're there a handful of reviews where I know that I'm going to hate it sure and then I end up hating it and I know that I know that as a result my audience is gonna go apeshit over it yeah okay it in a positive way or a negative way Oh in a negative way you know and and sometimes and sometimes I try to sidestep that there was one time way back earlier in in my youtube video series where people were just and I remember I had posed this idea on Twitter and everybody just reacted negatively to it at first limp Biskit was coming out with a new record and then I said hey guys Newland biscuit record just got announced do you want me to review it right and I got all these responses up here people were just saying no fuck you shut the fuck up you moron and so then the album it's like a week away from getting released and then I just get inundated with all these comments saying the Newland biscuit you got a review it you're gonna hate the shit out of this thing and then I just decided to instead of review it I just ate food on camera for six minutes straight I just uh instead of reviewing the album instead of reviewing it I just sat there and ate food the video actually got posted on BuzzFeed I know you love that site oh my favorite yep big big fan of BuzzFeed love all their content that are doing great work so so yeah every once in a while I try to sidestep it there was actually a review I had done last year of this particular rapper his name is Big Sean and the album is yeah yeah the the song was titled are that record was titled dark sky paradise and Big Sean is a rapper I'm not really a big fan of I don't think he's intolerable but what sort of arcs me about him is that in in the world of hip-hop he seems like such a non essential character like if hip-hop were a horror movie he would be the first get killed off because he just really adds nothing to the cast of characters what are you talking about have you heard his song ass very deep very deep track the first ten words are at that's it's true so oh and and uh I mean they write like he'd rhyme and words in a row what more do you want you know there's there's even a track off his latest record called what is it I I'm not fucking with you he's just pretty much saying that phrase over and over again again really deep important artists here significant contributions to the art form yeah so for about three or four minutes I just said the word know you know over and over and over and over but kind of freezing in such a way where it sounded like I was saying sentences like no no no no no no no no no no and then I would like to have album covers kind of flipping back and forth you know behind me as if I was talking about the album's and the review hit the top of Google so if you googled his name like within a few hours if you googled his name my review would be the first thing to pop up people vandalized his Wikipedia page and just put the word know throughout the whole page and put the word know throughout like the page of the album and it was it was pretty crazy for a little while you just you just could not escape my review if you were looking for anything related to Big Sean that's made I love that oh I love it too you know it's if I'm gonna hate something it which I know is you know it comes with the territory you know you're not gonna like everything but when I'll know I'm gonna hate something I figure you've really just got to go all in and just just go completely off the wall and just kind of give people you know not what they something that they didn't know they wanted you know just like give him a left hook right left hook left hook Sucker Punch BAM you didn't see that coming I love it when you take over the the Google results of somebody's like for example when I had a similar instance when Christopher Reeve passed away I wrote this article titled Christopher Reeve as an asshole and I wrote this before he passed away and in this article I talked about how he didn't really give a shit about paralysis until after he became paralyzed and after he became paralyzed he raised a lot of money for the paralysis Foundation which is great um definitely how he's definitely helped people paralysis but again he didn't care about it until afterwards and then the amount of attention he gave to it exceeded the amount of people who were suffering from paralysis at some point so I made this article called him an asshole and then after he passed away when you googled Christopher Reeves name on Google it was the second search result the first one was his paralysis Foundation the second one was mine so I got a lot of hate mail so many people came to my website cursing me out wishing I was dead I got death threats rape threats you name it and I even got a contact from the lawyer from the Christopher Reeve Foundation and he told me to take the page down and I wrote back to him and I said look man whether or not you agree with what I'm saying here all around the internet people are having a debate about the merits of what I am saying here essentially I'm asking the question should we care about an illness only after a celebrity becomes ill with it or should we start looking more critically at people who need help regardless of whether or not we suffer from that affliction and he wrote back to me and he said you know what Maddox we we disagree with the way that you're you're saying this message but we agree that this is an important debate to have so voluntarily I decided to add a little disclaimer to people who are coming to my website from Google looking for Christopher Reeve just letting them know that this is not the Christopher Reeve Foundation and they were okay with that they let it go mmhmm yeah one thing that I have to give you is beyond the cynicism of a lot of what you say it seems like you're not really provoking people to to just further dive down into just selfishness and nihilism and so on and so forth it's like you're kind of challenging some readers to actually care I mean one article that sort of comes to mind is your SOPA and your PIPA article where it's it's not like these issues aren't important it's more like you guys aren't actually engaging with the problem here getting involved you're just kind of talking about it on Twitter and that's it correct yeah that's that's a that's a really good example that when SOPA became the Internet's big cause and I'm sure people listening today right now don't even remember this whole incident that happens but there was this piece of legislation called SOPA it was the Stop Online Piracy Act I think is what what it stood for and it was a terribly written piece of legislation that that essentially gave far-reaching powers to corporations to essentially shut down free speech if they wanted to they could shut down they it caused all sorts of problems online so people got up in our arms and they said let's stop this bill from passing let's let's make sure this doesn't occur but I think everyone missed the point of this bill and and and how poorly it was written the point is that the people who passed it are still elected they still have their jobs and they're going to try again and again and again until they get some permutation of this bill passed which is exactly what happens the same jokers who passed this who try to pass this SOPA bill try to pass another bill unset and they've since been successful several of them because not every bill is going to be on everyone's radar all the time we don't have enough time or energy or power to constantly black out the front page of Google and YouTube and all of our web sites every time we disagree with the bill we have to go to the root of the problem which is get these jokers out of office that's essentially what I was trying to say yeah it's a I don't know it's kind of an interesting a position to sort of be in or I guess kind of a lack of change on that level despite seeing so much fervor and so much anger and so much unrest in the streets of some cities and especially on social media people sort of seem generally very unhappy with how the system is working but continually a lot of the same legislators and congressmen and women just continually get elected and re-elected right it's an office it's an awful cycle that will continue to go down this path so long as we allow it and and I remember a long time ago during a book tour someone came up to me and said hey Maddox I love your website I love how much you hate things and I I kind of pointed out to him that it's not necessarily that I hate things it's that I really care I think that hating hating sometimes is is the biggest form of love that there is because you really care and you really want to change things so that's why I write these rants that's why I write these articles ultimately on some fundamental level I do want there to be some positive change in the world and I think that by drawing attention to these problems and asking people to actually do something rather than just retweet an article or retweet a position get out there and do something change something make a difference make it better and by complaining about it that's my ultimate goal I think that my form of complaining is the biggest form of love that there is so basically underneath the hardened shell you're just a big pussy I was literally reaching for my keyboard to hit my buzzer button because I have a buzzer that I play on my podcast no no absolutely not I'm a hardened I'm a heart I'm I have a I have a cold dead heart but I would like it to get better by making the world a better place how about that yeah okay I understand that I understand that so after you know sort of exposing yourself here sure sure there's caring beyond the negativity and there's concern there but does that necessarily mean that you feel that there's something to sort of look forward to in the future you know are you hopeful generally about what is coming tomorrow especially in light of the shit show that has been sort of the the current election that's coming up well sure yeah I'm hopeful I think that things are getting better I mean PA look man as much of a cynic as I am you just look at the world today compared to 50 years ago sure I mean how much better how much better things now seriously like we have a better life expectancy we have better drugs on the market porns it way better we have we have a hole on the second your time out how positive and how much better the world is now than it was 50 years ago and the first three things you cited was what life expectancy porn and drug quality yeah keep going keep going now let's see what's on the rest of this list thing things are way better buddy look cars are more efficient we're learning yet new rocketship that's cool right we can sure fly to the moon that's where I want to go and things are better with in terms of race relations they're not perfect we still have a lot of problems to overcome and a lot of issues but things have gotten a lot better for a lot of people just look at the women's rights movement from the 1970s until now gotten way better not even you know it we have a black president and it wasn't even one generation ago that there that we had his father and his father's generation being sprayed with hoses and being segregated based on the color of their skin that was 50 years ago and look how much we've come adjusting that small amount of time look there's a lot of progress to be made but I am hopeful and I do think that things are getting better okay so so in light of what you just said there obviously you see progress being made and you think we're moving toward a brighter future you know but obviously you bring up instances of idiocy and stupidity and just the shortcomings of mankind consistently in your videos and your reviews do you see this stupidity amassing into anything or down the road becoming a threat or is you know stupidity just always presence the stupidity just always present somewhere in the history of mankind it's always just buzzing away in the background and all that really happens is over the course of time it just kind of changes flavors and and just changes disguises and it's just I guess kind of takes a different tone or ideology well I guess I have to ask what you mean by stupidity do you mean people who are ignorant or people who are just not intelligent I guess ignorant you know the the types of things that would inspire you to I don't know make a video about I remember one video that that was pretty successful for you over the past year so is that uh that video about the Spider Man a comic cover yes Spider Woman comic cover specifically the the the the type of ignorant that would inspire you to make that kind of video you know that type of ignorance that obviously creates an emotional rise in you that sort of demands you to get up and say something about it and do something about it you know when you see this very prevalent ignorance on a particular topic does it worry you does it concern you I mean obviously it does you make a video about it but once you've made a video about it I mean it's still kind of free to continue and persist the idea the bad idea it's free shit I guess you know as is is there a looming threat of bad ideas in your opinion so one of the most pervasive problems in that I see today is the demonization of sex and sexuality and specifically I'm seeing it come from a lot of women centric websites like bustle calm and Vox and Mike calm I guess not box with Mike calm and Huffington Post for women and cetera et cetera they kind of it's this idea that sex is bad and if you are working in a sex as a sex worker or in a sexual field say as a pornographer or as a prostitute or as somebody who does who gets nude on webcam or a stripper or male or female escorts like that's somehow degrading or shameful there is nothing wrong or shameful about sex and sexuality if you are working in these fields by your own choice and you are doing this to earn earn a good living there is absolutely nothing wrong with that the the problem is that when you start to demonize sex and sexuality you get this this weird phenomenon that occurs where people are afraid to have sex and they're afraid to be identified as someone who likes to have sex specifically with women and you have this phenomenon of slut-shaming right you have you heard of the expression slut-shaming sure yeah yeah slut-shaming is essentially where a woman likes to have sex or has had sex with lots of people and she gets called a slut and she gets shamed for it whereas that doesn't happen with a man if we got rid of this concept of negativity with sex that would that would be eliminated and it would also remove the pressure on on people to lie about having had sexual relations with people and potentially even reduce the incidence of rape I think because if everybody chilled out a lot more about sex and sexuality we wouldn't be so open up in arms about it I believe it's it sort of perplexes me that that these hang-ups that we have in regards to sex still sort of persist especially now that religion doesn't seem to be playing as much a role in our lives as it used to as a society maybe you disagree you know you can let me know but now that it's not what's exactly keeping us from sort of moving past these hang-ups or are we still kind of dealing with the residue and sort of the of this culture and kind of we've still got the the traditions ingrained in us as a society and maybe even though we're not going to church every day and we're not sort of you know preaching the teachings of the Bible we're still kind of stuck on a lot of these traditions and a lot of these points of view yeah I think that a lot of these taboos came by came about I think you hit on something important here which is it is tradition it is part of our culture and it's going to take some time to undo that and reverse it however it's also steeped not just in religion but also I believe that most of our taboos today that we have in our society come from in the past some some sects of society had a problem right thing they did or something they ate gave them a disease or made them sick and if you're not careful you can get some diseases and you can get sick with promiscuity so sexuality probably became demonized in part because of that so there's probably still some some very rich hidden taboos that we have that we just kind of take for granted based on sex and sexuality because it's something that we didn't understand and it's something that made some people sick and people still probably have that association that attachment to it but getting rid of it getting back to the demonizing sexuality once we get rid of that I think it will solve so many problems there's just so many problems today that we can get rid of and I I don't know that society is moving in a positive direction in terms of sex and sexuality specifically because we are living in a culture now where go look at women's magazines man just look at women's magazines there's no cleavage anymore it's almost like there's an unspoken message where if we show cleavage or anything that can be too provocative it's a bad thing so or that it's degrading and shameful to the woman to be to be nude and it's not I think that that we are sending the wrong message here speaking of big problems here you know we've talked about your YouTube channel we've talked about your website tell us a little bit about your podcast that you do every week the biggest problem in the universe were you guys kind of are actively trying to compile all of these problems and get people to vote on them and I'm trying to remember right now number one is anti-vaxxers I believe on the list right yeah yeah so how long have you been doing this podcast and how close are you guys to finding the biggest problem in the universe well I've been doing the podcast for two years just about two years now it'll be two years in May and for anyone who hasn't heard it there's a brief introduction it's basically a problem where a show where we discuss problems every week my co-host tonight and the listener votes on which problem is bigger so that over time we have a comprehensive list of every problem in the universe rent from biggest to smallest and yeah that's essentially the podcast in a nutshell and how close am I to folks you're solving the biggest problem I think I haven't brought it in yet personally I think it's it's asteroids which we totally take for granted that we are just leaving our lives and we don't have to worry about them but man that it just takes one to wipe out all of humanity there's just one Apollo asteroid and basically Anthony we don't know when the next one is going to hit us we predict based on past instances where asteroids have hit us once every hundred thousand years or so it's been about seven hundred thousand years since the last really big asteroid hit Earth so we're long overdue and nobody's doing anything about it nobody's doing anything to prevent it we are just sitting ducks we're just basically sitting on this rock right now hurtling through space unleased time and we don't know when it's gonna be at when it's gonna end only thing we do know for sure is that it will happen it is an inevitability I saw this documentary with Bruce Willis where they blew up an asteroid that was gonna hit Earth and I don't see why they couldn't just do all that over again yeah I thought that documentary to you is a good one it was on PBS I think yeah Aerosmith did the soundtrack too yeah yeah yeah Ken Burns I believe right yes yes yeah it's great here's the thing man look uh on some level it's my gut hope that that our government has some response to the asteroid the potential asteroid threat but I don't know in this political climate if we're even able to respond to that say for example US researchers and scientists say that we hey hey Russia we see this asteroid coming in right they notify Russia they notify all of our allies and they don't notify everyone they say hey we see this asteroid coming in we want to we want to strike it down with nukes and this is the best-case scenario to if we actually see it in enough time to respond to it well who's to say that all these other competent countries are gonna cooperate and go along with it look of North Korea they're scared shitless that we're gonna launch a nuke and they could just view this as premise that we would use to bomb them right so what if North Korea says you shoot a nuke up in the sky we're gonna shoot a nuke down the to your west coast of California like what if what if that scenario could happen we don't have time to react and worry about the politics of the situation and we may be crippling ourselves by not cooperating you're giving me nightmares dude mm-hmm think about that put that in your pipe and smoke it yeah you guys tuned in to this podcast not expecting such a deep combo but you got it III remember one article in particular maybe last year that I had caught where NASA or maybe it was even the Russians had spotted an asteroid that that was not going to hit Earth but it was coming awfully close and they hadn't seen it until a point where I guess we wouldn't have even really been able to do anything about it if it had been on a trajectory with earth right yeah these these asteroids we see most of them well I guess I mean you can't really know that how many asteroids you don't see cuz you don't see them but yeah we see we see a good chunk of asteroids that come with come within near near contact to earth and the ones that are in our paths are called Apollo asteroids Apollo asteroids are specifically ones that will cross our paths eventually those are the ones we really have to worry about and we know of a few of them there's one that's scheduled to pass near Earth around 2036 but the problem with asteroids is that some of them are really dark in in the literal sense of the word they're just really dark there they're made out of iron and it's we don't see a lot of light reflecting on them so there could be one coming towards right now that we just don't see all right um I want to finish off this conversation talking about your upcoming book it's gonna be the third book that you published correct correct yeah and you haven't really told a lot of people at least publicly about this book can you give us a bit of a preview as to what we can expect from it when it's going to be out and you know how you've been what your process is sort of been working on it sure I so I haven't told anyone anything about this book and I won't be giving away too many details but I will say this when I wrote my first book the Alpha bit of manliness that was a really fun book to write but it wasn't the book I wanted to write first the first book I wanted to write is the book that I'm writing now and the reason I'm able to write it now is because I have more clout and credibility so I'm able to write the book that I really want to write now even though I really enjoyed alphabet manliness and so did a lot of fans this is the book that I feel like is really captures my voice and it's all new material it's all new stuff it's something that my fans haven't seen before and I think it's it's really gonna resonate with a lot of people it's really gonna piss people off I think mmm should people sort of go into this book expecting the same sort of comedic tone that they've read in your two previous efforts yes to an extent for example my second book was I am better than your kids yeah or our crappy children's artwork that was based on an article for my website and the alphabet of Manliness to an extent was also based on an article from my website called a tribute to manly men or real men that I wrote a long time ago so in that sense yes it will be similar to the content and voice of my previous books in that those previous books we're also similar in content and voice to my website is is this book inspired by a topic that you've approached before either in a video or in an article no I don't well to an extent yeah but not really it's it's pretty new stuff it's it's stuff that if you read it I think I think people who are familiar with my work if they read it without my name attached to it they would know that it was written by me okay it's it's a very much it's very much a Maddox book oh yeah okay so when are you planning on releasing some more details about the book and then hopefully releasing the book itself if you cannot talk about that I'll release more details about the book I believe this June June I I should have I should be ready to make an announcement around June and then the actual book release is probably going to be next spring spring of 2017 it was going to be this fall but the publisher decided to push it because everything in fall is going to be crazy with the election ends everyone's just going to be publishing it electrolitic essentially mm-hmm okay yeah all right then I'm going to uh yeah I have I have a question for you okay as a music critic can I put can I plug them the music that I'm listening to and earth do yeah alright actually that that would be a that would be another good question to sort of end it out with so yeah you know we'll talk about like so if you want to talk music and I didn't know you were down for that conversation you know sure plug some shit if you want to plug some shit and then maybe we could talk some favorite records or something sure sure there's two things I just - two albums that I'm listening to lately there is a band I heard on XM XM satellite music they have this metal this metal station and I know a lot of people don't listen to metal anymore because they're idiots but you guys are making a mistake and you should give it another chance so it's a it's a it's a Latin American metal band called puia PU y a and they have such a fresh sound I've never heard Mexican metal before like Mexican thrash metal and it's a really cool sound it's just it's like you get those Latin rhythms in there it almost sounds like a Latin folk song at one point and then it busts into some heavy fucking metal that rocks your dick off it's pretty awesome I highly recommend people check that out and then the other album that I'm listening to is Luke vibart I don't know if you you know Luke vibart but he is also known as wagon christ and he's worked with a bunch of different people but there's an album he just came out with called bizarre stir and that came out in October of last year but it's a pretty cool it's like downtempo downtempo trip-hop I guess that's what you would call it okay I've written both of those down and I'll throw some links in the description if if anybody uh if I can you know sort of come across these artists or at least write their names down in the description so people can search them up going back to the whole metal thing though yeah I mean metal is a chapter and it is a section that does turn up in your alphabet of Manliness book how long have you sort of been a metalhead and I guess why is metal so central to you when it comes to your personal life and just kind of being male yeah I've been listening to metal since about high school and I remember when I was a kid I felt super lame because I couldn't relate to any of the music anyone else was listening to and like in my class I remember going home one day after school and just combing through the radio going station from station starting from the bottom of the dial all the way to the top trying to find the station that played the music that I liked and I really didn't like anything I heard you know here and there there was a saw a pop song that was okay like I was a fan of Michael Jackson way back in the day but that was about it I was never really a big fan of pop and then the first time I ever heard metal was when a skater kid brought it to school and he started cranking and I'm like what the hell is this why is so angry why is so awesome and it made me feel alive and by alive I mean dead it was such a good feeling you know that was like the first time I really felt dead inside and that was like yeah I totally doubled down on metal and I started finding heavier and heavier stuff and stuff that I find I finally landed on that spoke to me the most is southern thrash metal like Pantera and that was the band that spoke to me the most Pantera and Sepultura which is a Brazilian metal band yes Apple tours great and Vulgar Display of power was probably one of my favorite CDs in high school I actually just I I don't know where I put the CD I mean I lost it so long ago and I just saw it in a record store recently and I had to pick it up because that was just like something a part of sort of my growing up so I had to have it it's so damn good one of the first concerts I ever went to was Slayer and wild as well the band was setting up they had an opening band and they also had some music just playing through the PA system before the actual show started and a and I everyone was kind of milling about and talking and waiting for the show to start but when a Pantera song came on the entire place went nuts it was like they were playing live in the room the play this is like people started moshing and chanting along and singing and it was like nothing it was like no other metal band that that that was played that day except for obviously the headlining Slayer but it was really badass no other you know they're essentially a classic at this point you know I mean they've made such a mark especially during a time when sort of simultaneously around that era I mean there was a lot of good metal music but there was also that whole new metal thing going on which sort of ended up being like a bit of a cultural dead-end because a lot of people just all of a sudden it seemed like overnight people just stopped taking new metal seriously and just sort of saw it as a joke and it was it was kind of hard for a lot of those good groups Pantera being one of the few that actually you know we're a great group and sort of and saw widespread popularity despite not being one of these trendy or metal groups actually a lot of those trend of your groups are kind of ripping off a lot of their ideas so it's it's it's kind of great to have at least you know a metal band like that from back then still sounds so great in retrospect since you know a lot of people look back on like a corn record with a lot of disdain or a Slipknot record yeah man when new metal came out and started becoming a thing I think that's when a lot of people either got out of metal or got into this weird thing that it became one of the newer metal bands that I finally came around to was and I begrudgingly say this but Avenged Sevenfold I started listening to some of their stuff by accident because it came on and I thought that it sounded a lot like Metallica like new Metallica stuff and I looked at it and it sounded so much like metallic I'm like this is actually kind of ok I kind of dig it and there it's funny because they're old fans like there are old new metal roots and they're new fans I think more people like me who like them because they're kind of biting on Metallica style but they do it really well you know as far as newer metal music I mean there was there was especially a lot of Records last year that I thought were pretty good I know I know that you're talking about thrash metal but I don't know and also you know Pantera with the whole groove metal thing an alternative metal I don't know if you're much into sludge or like grindcore or anything like that I just recently started getting into hardcore I don't know about I've heard some some stuff that could be considered sludge but I'd not not I'm not familiar enough to name any names except for the hardcore that I'm really into is this band called trapped under ice okay trapped under ice is norcal hardcore band and it's like the Brosius music I've ever heard but I guess I can't stop listening to it and their fans are all really big broke but it's really cool I could dig it there's a pretty awesome sort of bro-bro ish hardcore band that I like a lot or at least I like one of their records a lot I'm trying to recall the name of the record so that I don't mess up the title their name is Shiv Baba and I believe they're from there they're from California as well and it's like a bunch of Latino guys and I think some of them might be from Mexico or yeah they're from Los Angeles some of the songs are in Spanish but they're all super fucking heavy and they had this great record called hasta la muerte and the the the album cover is amazing and it features kind of this lone figure sort of standing in front of this I don't know giant pyramid with all these like epic towers sort of in the in the pyramid so there's Shiv Alba with like an X at the beginning they're good a band called Baroness came out with a record last year called purple or the purple album and they take a lot of inspiration from Metallica - on that record there's a lot of really catchy songs on there some great rips it's really heavy and thick a lot of bass another hardcore group that's really good and hopefully they come out with a record this year their name is nails they have a debut album called unsilent death that i think is about maybe like 16 or 17 minutes long in total and it's amazingly fucking heavy and hard and in-your-face if you're looking for more hardcore and like metalcore a group from the East Coast because hardcore was such a huge thing over here in the 90s and the 2000s groups like converge are really great Hatebreed is sort of a big group from Connecticut yeah hatebreed actually opened up for Slayer at the first concert I ever went to okay yeah dude like when I was in high school every hardcore band wanted to sound like Hatebreed from around here like I'm pretty much go anywhere and see some local hardcore bands playing and everybody's just pretty much blatantly ripping off hey breed so so yeah and they and they were pretty you know popular during their time also the band ghost I mean a lot of people think they're corny and they're a little over two theatrical but you know if you're really into Sabbath and merciful fate and Blue Oyster Cult they have a new record out called meliora that I think is really good I'm trying to think of a napalm death had a pretty decent record last year and also a good sludge metal band called high on fire had a record come out last year that was great called luminiferous oh man this is even a lot of recommendations I'm gonna have to look look all these up after Booker Bobo is the first one though right yeah should Bulba shabam oh I'm gonna look that up and oh and a thrash group that I just saw play live recently and they told me that they have an album coming out soon and I don't know if you heard of these guys they're really good like a really good new thrash band their name is a vector no I haven't heard I think they're from New Mexico the dude who soo fronts the group has this amazing shriek that I I think I've heard very few and far between singer you know very few singers sort of like hit the notes that he hits and the guitar parts are great the drums are fantastic the grooves and the the riffs are wild as hell and a lot of the lyrics deal in science fiction which is sort of odd for a thrash group man enough and what they called again their name is vector V ok t/o are well they're really big they're really big into bands like Voivod I believe they're actually kind of doing some tour dates with them so yeah their name is vector they have a great album out called black future I was when I actually caught them live the lead singer had this really crude tattoo on his shoulder this it's sci-fi or Die which you know considering the stuff that they sing about I mean they have a fucking song called asteroid yeah big big problem buddy you know considering everything they sing about you know it wasn't really surprised to see that tattoo there it was just kind of a hilarious confirmation so uh so yeah I mean there's a lot of great metal music coming out that I think is really good you know the thing is is that a lot of guitar music just isn't as relevant as it used to be I guess it's it's sort of fallen to the underground you know as far as mainstream music goes guitar doesn't really have as much presence as it as it used to yeah that's kind of a shame and I'm kind of guilty of listening to a lot of synthetic stuff and I listen to a lot of chip tunes actually because I love video games and I love video game music if I could plug one other person right now there's a guy his name is Bert the irt he's been a long time seeing dude who's done a lot of chip tunes and now he's got a career making video game he did the soundtrack to the new contra game that came out on the Nintendo DS contra 4 and he's done stuff for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and you've heard his music but there's a track that I don't think is in any video game but you can find it on YouTube if you just go check YouTube the name of the track is staring at my spaceship and it's like Bert the irt it's a really cool chiptune track it's very layered and complex compared to most of the chiptune you hear out there but it's a really really cool track sorry I just wrote that down yeah and I'll throw that in the description box too well have you ever heard of or do you do you know of the group Anamanaguchi yeah I'm a fan of it though yeah I've uh I've talked with those guys quite a few times and you know featured their stuff on the show a lot and have caught them live as well and they're really good live oh very cool yeah my buddies my buddy Roger Barr from the website I mockeries Spain is a friend with their friend of theirs and he seen them live a few times I their stuff is always on my playlist awesome awesome that's great okay then well that's great great music conversation that I did not expect to have yeah man nice yeah yeah okay then we will provide links to all of your stuff down there in the description box again I want to thank you for coming on the show and sort of giving us some insight into what you're doing and you know sort of dropping the dropping the tough-guy fucking attitude to come on here and just be the nice guy that you are underneath obviously oh thanks man but that's that's absolutely flaner I will sue you for calling me nice we'll have your lawyer send me an email and then I will politely disregard it yesterday response that sounds fair and all due respect and Anthony keep up the great work to yourself man I know that you have your your loyal fan base and everything but your reviews are really on point you have you do it you do it well and there's a reason that you have a following I've checked out your stuff even as I told you before this all started when you I'd seen your videos before and when you message me on twit like hey you want to do an interview and I didn't recommend it with you based on the picture that you got in there was a little caricature that I clicked I'm like oh yeah of course yeah feed your channel before oh yeah keep up the great work yeah appreciate that 
mmoxvwDfyCc,[Music] hi everyone Han thony band solo here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this various artists compilation Star Wars headspace there are few movie franchises out there that are as / merchandised as the Star Wars franchise I have seen everything from Star Wars coffee-mate to bottled water to even apples Star Wars apples and of course there's music too and considering a new Star Wars film just dropped this year there's of course no surprise that you can get the soundtrack of this movie on CD if you like but what I did not see coming in terms of Star Wars related music was this it's a compilation of artists making various shades of contemporary electronic music and electronic dance music inspired by Star Wars and this isn't just like any old bunch of no-name producers working in a bunch of cheap Darth Vader samples this is a bunch of well-known producers working in a bunch of cheap Darth Vader samples on this thing we have Bauer Flying Lotus Rick Rubin rusty slo-mo bonobo break bah and even röyksopp and a handful of other producers who wouldn't look too out of place on a major EDM festival lineup this thing is 15 tracks long and the first song really does set the tone for the entire project the song c-3po is played by cascade which is about as nonspecific as dance music gets and then it just incorporates all of these gimmicky c-3po samples into the beat for a Star Wars tie-in there are some glistening lead melodies and some grand piano chords that kind of kick the track off I mean there's really nothing about this other than the corny Star Wars samples that makes it distinct enough to even describe accurately and there are other tracks here that overdo it on samples from the movie franchise as well like gta's help me which just has prominent Princess Leia sample almost throughout the entire track it's got this sort of generic trap banger a vibe to it and the drop on this thing when the big blur t remember melody that you might usually catch on a song of this style drops and it's just so painfully weak there's like no oomph to it at all troy boy comes through the track that has a bit of a trap / purple sound quality to it if you've heard Rusty's glass swords you're kind of already familiar with this sound and on this song like with some of the previous tracks so far there are these really incessant Darth Vader breathing samples worked into the track that at this point have just become so annoying and tedious it seems like pretty much all the artists here pulling from the same sounds the same piece of inspiration without really worrying about what each other are doing so as a result there's a lot of recycled ideas here it's kind of like everybody in class was cheating on the test by reading off the same guy and that guy got a D even though there's a new Star Wars movie that came out this year you wouldn't even know it because not a single track here alludes to it however when bauer comes on with cantina boys the track that also features darth vader breathing samples this is probably the best track on the project so far and i'll go as far to say the best track on the project period good job dude you showed them as far as bangers go this one's legit and it's so good that i think this could be played out of the context of this compilation entirely it doesn't over play the whole Star Wars thing to the point where it just becomes a gimmicky commercial tie-in it's actually got a great groove to it I could see the song being played at a festival with little to no objection the percussion sounds great the synth leads are great the basses thunderous and it's got kind of this wide open I don't know industrial kind of vibe to it it turns the factory floor into a dance floor unfortunately right after this bauer track the quality on this thing takes a nosedive again specifically on the song r2 knows by Claude on stroke strike which is essentially these really terrible r2d2 samples worked into the most generic of acid house beats and then we are treated to some wonderful lead vocals the only track on this thing with Lee vocals from berry drift and he sings really awkwardly about the most obvious plot points from the older films Luke's where the little green man odd Diggle bond shot first and Gordo never shot a guard and that's literally how the vocals sound and this track even though it's six minutes it feels like it's 60 minutes leia talks on art to get a hover over one bug it's shameful that they would try to make money off of this music I mean it sounds commercial but only in the sense that the the only place where this music would sound passable tolerable is if it was playing in the background of a commercial for some kind of piece of Star Wars swag things don't really get much better with Rick Rubin with the song NR g7 and this track seems like I don't know in older electronic dance music song that he might have had sitting on the shelf and he just works some Star Wars samples that do it I guess it's not bad but again it sort of suffers from the same gimmicky sloppy formula that so many other songs here do it doesn't really get much better with Flying Lotus either his contribution sounds phoned in as well he gives us a really plain uninspired Flying Lotus style rhythm very loose and organic on quantize like usual and there's not really anything all that musical about it we're melodic about it that is inspiring or interesting all the sort of tosses on top of this beat for the most part are just tedious r2d2 samples which at this point in the compilation we've heard so many bonobos contribution isn't too bad although it also kind of just suffers from that same annoyance of the Star Wars samples that the beat is okay the beat change up and the second half is pretty ambitious at least it doesn't suffer from the same lack of progression that many other songs here do the beat röyksopp brings to the table it sounds like the produced it with one hand tied behind their back schwa Moe's track is painfully underwhelming with the exception of the very last few moments where we get kind of a crescendo Rusty's II walk pump though is one of the better tracks in the track listing here it sounds like at least he had fun with the freakin project instead of doing something drab or overly serious or just working in a bunch of awful Star Wars samples and just kind of letting those be the most prominent voice or the most prominent piece of sound in the track he gave us a really colorful banger that's just off the wall and I guess uh melodically is inspired by the idea of Ewoks I mean in my head I guess I could imagine he walks just totally twerk into this and the closer break bop brings to the table features these epic string sections that kick the track off it's very orchestral seems like it's heavily inspired by the original Star Wars soundtracks but then it breaks into a groove a rhythm that seems very Daft Punk inspired it's okay there's not really much to this project beyond that it's just such an awful clutter of songs that are mostly bad songs that would have been terrible even if you sucked all the Star Wars samples that were totally unnecessary out of the formulas of these songs but adding them in the tracks become almost worse because the same sounds the same plot points are rehashed again and again and again it makes me sort of wonder how much creative Asaka some of the artists had over these tracks where they told they needed to work in certain sounds certain plot points make certain references that they couldn't reference like The Phantom Menace I don't know I I really don't know yeah there's very little on this thing that I would call salvageable and even the tracks that I think were good were maybe only relatively good what I think they were amazing sort of held within the the album track lists of future albums by these respective artists like with this bower track just stopped me in my tracks if I were listening to it on a Bower album with that rusty track stopped me my tracks if I was listening to on a rusty album I'm not totally sure but at least they did provide a little bit of relief from the generally high threshold of pain that a Luke hang on they go about that a lot of these songs bring to the table I'm feeling a light - decent - on Star Wars headspace transition have you given this cop a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you do best you the best what should I review next hit that like if you like in-your-face Star Wars

orERYdw_JsU,hi everyone spin 'funny site Fulton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new map most record ultimate care to experimental electronic music duo macmost they're back with another new record they are known for their collaborations with artists such as Bjork and for their plethora of solo albums that feature a pretty eclectic sample-based music style incorporating sound clips from amazingly odd sources such as sperm dogs rhinoplasty just to name a couple I even loved their 2008 records supreme balloon which includes no samples at all since this record the duo released a couple of ambitious collaborative projects a solo album but nothing I was like head over heels for but this new project over here really wowed me this thing is a single track 38 minutes long features contributions from people like Dan Deacon Jason willette of half-japanese members of horselords and it's this multi-part piece based off of the wash cycle of a washing machine essentially the entirety of a wash cycle was sampled and all the sounds therein were taken and reconfigured into a musical piece and this results in very intense rhythmic passages ambient interludes and drones and all these things are assembled out of metallic bangs and clangs and swishing water weird clicks and even whales and howls some of which might have been added in post-production I can't really tell if every single sound that's popping up in the mix is coming from this washing machine or if there's some synthetic sound added into the mix it could be the case but no matter what passage I'm in the midst of even if there are added sounds that the presence of the washing machine is still very much there so I'm really impressed that the duo was able to take all of these sounds and assemble them into something so musical but what's even more impressive is that the piece alas thirty-eight minutes and it's so engaging from beginning to end there's real flow to this piece all the respective parts of it come together really well even after multiple lessons I felt really engaged with this thing the only part that I think left me underwhelmed was the passage around the twenty seven minute mark where we are literally just getting several minutes of washing machine noises pure unadulterated washing machine noises still though I was just kind of on the on the edge of my seat with this thing really just wondering where the duo was gonna take it next from these really bustling metallic industrial heavy parts of the track to these really abstract and melodic and serene and soft points in the piece that are nice breathers and they're even spots here that sound like I'm listening to some very textured sample-based IDM kind of like something where FX twin is meeting some old Four Tet or like some Blue Man Group and even on that passage where I was talking about the just the washing machine sounds around the twenty seven minute mark even here I have to give it to the duo because this part of the track really just seems like a sort of a calm for the storm before they come through with their last final passage of the song that's super heavy they really end things off with a visceral bang and then all of a sudden the washing machines buzzer kicks on and the piece is just as over as quickly as it started this was a really cool record and I think it's the best thing and most creative thing that most has done in a while I just don't really have much negative to say about this thing I mean I think it could have been a little more epic maybe a little more over the top maybe a little more grandiose I think that would have made things interesting for sure but just as is there's so many great and intriguing things about this piece I'm feeling a decent a strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it washing machine on the team you're the best what should I review next hit that like if you like warlord forever 
8aApVlBDQ14,right right right right hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're gonna do a quick track review of this new Joey badass song ready Joey badass is a New York rapper who broke at a very young age and he's slowly been coming into his own ever since with a few great mixtapes some decent singles off of those tapes and it seemed to take him a while to finally come through with his full-length commercial debut which he did last year and it was well worth the wait because it seems like he really took his time with it and we got a lot of quality tracks on this project now consistency is certainly key to the long run but it would be nice for Joey to kind of strike while the iron is hot and deliver some new material sooner rather than later and that's essentially what he's doing with this new single over here is there a new tape on the way a new album around the corner I'm not sure but as long as all the tracks on the project are as good as this one I hope so this track is pretty much no BS at all it has production from static Selecta kind of moody chord progression some soft keyboards glistening lead melodies it's a little sad but there's some urgency to it the percussion is really tight it sounds like there's this really prominent metallic cowbell worked into the be very tastefully it's got a great groove to it reminds me of some underground New York hip hop from the 2000s it's a great instrumental don't really have any complaints about the beat now Joey he sounds hungrier and hungrier with every new single he drops I think he really sounds great on this track his flow it's not super technical or flashy but it's got a great groove to it I think it's a catchy flow but Joey is showing improvement on this track I think with his delivery and his breath control he's really able to on this song really deliver each word with passion and have a really dynamic delivery on this track emphasizing some words over others I mean you really feel every single word coming out of his mouth it's like he's gotten so great at rapping it's come as natural to him as talking on this track as far as the lyrics go on this thing it's not really about the bar or any incredible wordplay or any quotables as much as it is sort of a personal update of everything that's happened with Joey since his last album dropped he outsold Troy Ave which isn't exactly anything to brag about but he is from New York and he's got a bit of a territorial thing going on I guess he mentions freeing Bobby shmurda talks about his independent grind his album sales I do like the wordplay on the hook here where he's talking about swimming through a sea of people making waves with his sound he makes a Lion King reference he also says that he doesn't regret not signing the Rockefeller records very general topics for any successful rapper very general topics for Joey not really too much we didn't already know again the track really just seemed like a bit of a personal update I love the instrumental I thought the flow was great I thought Joey's delivery was energetic was passionate and on this track he also kind of moved his sound forward a little bit and continued to show that he's gonna be a versatile artist going into the future I'm digging this track and I hope you are too you can find a link to listen to it down in the description and we're gonna leave it there transition have you given this track a listen did you love it did you hate it what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Joey badass ready for ready 
s7a8WB6lvHI,ah hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the self-titled never Men album never men are a collaborative project featuring prolific singer and songwriter Mike Patton TV on the radio's tonday a Devon peg and then abstract hip hop artist dose one on this full-length album world's really are colliding here I mean artists coming together that I thought would never have anything to do with each other I'm not even sure there's that great of a crossover audience between a lot of these artists I could be wrong wrong wrong this thing could either be one of those situations where it's like great minds just forming and they create one of the greatest contributions to the art of music over the past ten years or they all kind of cancel each other out in an insane clutter which would be entertaining in its own way as well and this is kind of the the latter of those two this thing is like a grandiose 100 car pileup of hip hop rock and metal and a mess of other sounds and influences too and they don't even blend together into coherent songs it's kind of like Mike Patton and company here just hop around from one genre and sound and an artist's respective style quiet piano interlude a drone BAM horn section screaming wild harmonies heavy guitars it's kooky and it's cartoony and it's got e to the 10th power and it seems like there's a lot of intentional silliness on this record sort of like when you're listening to refrains such as Cheatham like past 2 which could be like a Slick Rick reference if not that the song does seem to find at least a little inspiration and something that like Beck would have done on midnight vultures or at least it's similar to something that he would do with the squeaky lead melodies and the kind of animated rap verses you can really tell listening to this record that these guys were just in the creation of this project we're just being as ridiculous as they felt like they wanted to without worrying about how obnoxious or uncool that end result might be because truth be told this thing sounds about is unhip is like a mindless self-indulgence record this thing is going to send rap rock chills down the spine of anybody who survived the the early 2000s but that's just one of many sides of this album the very droney and sinister ballad on the song hate on I think it's really great the song mr. mistake is maybe the most coherent tune on the entire record it's very colourful silly just uh I don't know I'll use the word cartoony again pop it's the track on the record that reminds me the most of TV on the radio maybe because of the lead vocals but TV on the radio with an otter instrumental approach as the beats are really heavy and lumbering and some of the backing instrumentation seems kind of glitchy and the album does have a very blissful spacious patient closing track the rest of the record is really in your face and it's kind of ridiculous and it's a little tasteless but I can't help but be sort of intrigued by it in that I mean though there are a lot of very ugly clashes of sound and musical style on this thing it is kind of intricate it's complex I love the track shack which features these just freak out vocal harmonies and and this track and many others on here I could only just begin to scratch the surface of describing what goes on in this song I mean to describe what goes on accurately would be to have to pick up on every single little minor detail and put it out there into words for you guys and it's just so much more worth it to listen to it for yourself because really it's a tangled web of just musical insanity the song at your service features the speedy rap bars set between booming beats and kind of Skippy glitchy harmonized vocals it's like circus hip-hop from hell not ICP no and then there's a weird part that comes in where they are essentially [Music] delivering lines based off of the whole who stole the cookie from the cookie jar Nursery Rhyme well really these guys are throwing everything and the kitchen sink into this record if you've enjoyed patents freakier projects in the past I think you're gonna find things to like on here I'm just really in awe of how over-the-top and eccentric this thing is at the same time and it all fits in within a very tight thirty nine minutes there are some tracks here excuse me as a result that I think are a little short the ends really feel like loose ends specifically on the two-minute cuts here or on the song naan Babylon but still there's so much to like here it's a wild ride it's not this super deep moving experience I wouldn't even say it's all that catchy not instantaneously though I think it could become catchy over time as I gave it more and more listens the very sporadic and kind of unpredictable nature of the album did where a little bit and I kind of became more familiar with the project and I did come to really sort of expect and enjoy the weird heavy guitar passages that would pop up the freaky in-your-face just so overdone vocal parts it's just so extremely strange and funny even though it does feel like a little unfinished and you know a little bit like lightning in a bottle again there's just a lot to like it's just so nuts I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing Tran forever 
Bn_CTDEucco,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new santigold record $0.99 santigold is an American pop artist this is her third full-length album right here right on schedule four years after her last full-length album which was four years after her first full-length album this singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist is back with her trademark quirky and eclectic collection of influences post-punk dance music electronic music hip hop new wave reggae and art pop with this thing you're essentially getting 12 tracks of pop music on the fringes and it kicks off with the incredibly blissful I can't get enough of myself which is a sunny self-love anthem with a sweet groove to it doo doo doo doo there's buzzing bass in the mix here some kind of chirpy synthesizers a lead melody that sounds like it could be coming from a woodwind or something it's got a bit of dust on it the song sounds old but the instrumentation has it feeling modern and sort of oddball and the tune the instrumentation are both so sweet that they make the blatant narcissism of the song of palatable I would actually say it kind of sucks me into the fun confidence of the track and the vocal performance is decent - I mean Santi gold her vocals have never been the best she's always made up for her lack of vocal chops with a lot of character and a lot of personality and that's no different here she chills things out a little bit on the next track big boss big-time business where we're getting a bit of synth lead spacious dancehall it's kind of like listening to an mi a song fused with a weird obscurity from the trojan record singles collection and the refrain on this track is really funny I'm not sure if it was a intentional or if I'm actually hearing this word but sometimes it sounds like she's singing about how she has big balls on this track you know like whoo guts and I I do think in some respects this is a ballsy record especially on the track and she which is one of the hardest hitting songs in the tracklist here it's sort of borders on this super saccharine vibe that a band like Passion Pit has going in their music but it doesn't step so far in that direction that it turns me off I love the bright come on come on refrains that seem like they're being sung by dozens upon dozens of vocals maybe a child course or maybe Santee's vocals just layered on top of each other the rhythms hit really hard on the chorus too and and leading up to that point the synths are kind of revving up really noisily this track has maybe the most adrenaline of any song and the entire album I will say though I think some of the reverb zand the echos that are thrown onto numerous pieces of instrumentation on this track and on many other tracks here do kind of leave the mix feeling washed out as well as the album as a whole it leaves a lot of tracks here sounding very similar and not necessarily in a good way kind of like the tracks are bleeding together aesthetically where for a pop album like this with a series of songs that kind of all have their own emotions and personalities and topical themes I think it would have made more sense for each track to kind of go in a different direction because I do think there is an emotional flow to this record it's just a shame that it doesn't translate better because of how the effects kind of washed these songs out like on the next track here santigold changes gears once again into a lumbering beat and kind of a warped piano the instrumental chasing shadows this is the track I'm talking about reminds me of like Jay Z's hard-knock life but without the Annie sample it's kind of breezy I wish it was a little more in-your-face but it's still a decent tune after this the album takes a few turns that I didn't really care for like on the song before the fire this is one of the more moving and emotive ballads on the record but the instrumental is just kind of very one track and not very dynamic or dramatic and I don't think it really complements Santee's vocals very well as she's trying to hit these emotional highs the track is just kind of doing the same thing and then not really following her lead per se on the song I feel like I'm listening to a trap fever ray as I hear some heavier beats and twittering hi-hats and Santa cold on top with these weird chorus effects on her vocals that her voice is very quirky and I think it takes those quirks and doubles them up in a way that does not sound too good it becomes slightly obnoxious and on the following track who beloved me I think the obvious Achilles heel of this track is I love Makonnen this feature would have made way more sense being released when I loved Makonnen was actually still semi relevant but the reason he's not relevant anymore is because of horrific vocal performances like this one I think it's a cute song I think the lyrics are endearing and I know santigold is hugely influenced by post-punk so I can kind of see this track from that angle where a lot of songs in that genre kind of embrace pop music but perform it relive it rehash it in this kind of lazy off-kilter way where everything doesn't completely sync up it's not very clean it's not very well groomed I can see it from that angle and appreciate it from that angle the song does kind of have a silly dumb euphoria to it that I can't deny thankfully the energy and the enjoy ability of this record picks up immediately after on the song all I got how catchy Poppaea media and energetic this track is on the song rendezvous girl' Santigold takes us back to the 80s this track I think only could have been created with a time machine it is just a driving NuWave fist pumper with a great drum beat great groove and some kind of shy synthesizer arpeggios that are simple but they're effective I like the very sinister outside the war I just wish this song was a little heavier I think this kind of washed out spacious vibe works really well for the sunnier tracks for the breezier tracks for the tracks that really just don't have a care in the world but for this song which is obviously taking away darker approach with the melodies with the vocals I think the bass could have been thicker I think the guitars that are looped and mixed into the song could have had way more presence and Santigold vocally is kind of doing her best yeah yeah yeahs impression here not necessarily in the worst of ways I mean it's a decent tune it's a decent sound it's just one of the many moments on here where I think the production if tweaked a bit could have been way way better thankfully the ending of this record is strong the song who I thought you were is another track that kind of takes us back to that 80's pop new wave pastiche it's very well crafted catchy just instantaneous - great lead melody throbbing synthesizers on this thing and kind of a message coming through and the lyrics talking about people that you knew or that you thought you knew changing or just not living up to your expectations as you kind of move forward with them through life overall I like this record I think it's a fun record I think it's not your average pop album it's an interesting record and I think it's got some decent performances it's got tunes the vocals are cool it's got personality it's got quirk I wish it came a little bit later in the air because I think this would have been a decent summer record especially given how bright and just in your face the cover is here I was hoping for a pop record that displayed all of Santa Gold's just various influences but was also just very upfront not impersonal not hidden away not veiled in effects just BAM and there are moments where you definitely get that santigold where I think this album has such great tracks and such sharp simple ideas that it really pierces through that veil other tracks unfortunately do kind of succumb to the waves of echoes and effects and just drown in themselves thankfully those songs are not a majority of the record the majority of the record here I thought was really good and if you're looking for a pop record that is just a little left-field and it's going to do something a little weird a little crazy kind of playful then give this thing a listen I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP Tran Oh have you given the sound and the listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it your the best you the best what should I review next hit that like if you like Santa a gold album good that your thanks for watching forever 
Hxife3fs_BQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and in this video I want to do this before the week is over I want to go over some of the recent Grammy winners the Grammys just happened over these a 58th 5858 Grammys 58th Grammys just happened and I want to go over some of the winners some of the potential winners that I talked about in my past Grammy Award anticipation video and which awards I'm happy with which awards I'm not all that happy with generally though overall this this year's Grammys not that big of a disappointment for record of the year we had uptown funk from Mark Ronson a record that I was hoping would have won record of the year I think there might have been another song that I liked in the running there but that record I would have been happy with that song winning and it won and of course Taylor Swift walked away with the award for album of the year for 1989 not a record I'm all that big of a fan of I was hoping that to pimp a butterfly would win but considering that the Grammys are the Grammys that that was a long shot I didn't really see that coming it was or something I was hoping for ed Sheeran one song of the year I don't really mind Ed Sheeran but Meghan Trainor whoo whoo all aboard the Meghan train one new artist of the year best new artist of the year which anybody in the music industry by now knows is kind of a kiss of death but even though my dude Kendrick Lamar did not win Album of the year he did walk with quite a few Grammys I guess it would be a co Grammy win because he appeared in that Taylor Swift music video for bad blood he also had raps song of the year also rap collaboration of the year rap song performance of the year and to pimp a butterfly did win rap album of the year the musical theatre recording for Hamilton won an award this year I got to give a shout out to my dude Davi Diggs of clipping because he is deeply involved in that Alabama Shakes who I was pulling for walked away with a rock performance award as well as an alternative album award I was kind of hoping Bjork would have won that but Alabama Shakes their last record was great so can't take that away from them the electronic awards went to jack you this year the U stands for uh and surprisingly enough metal performance went to ghost yes host ah their last album is great listen to it however the rock album of the year went to muse for the record drones which is absolutely depressing not just because that album is not really that good but also because the rock field was just so pitiful this year that an album like drones was even in the listing was even in the running in the last few Awards I was really happy with was D'Angelo walked away with R&B album and R&B song of the year so D'Angela pretty much ruled that category except for the weekend he won Best R&B song performance the Jazz an instrumental field for some reason again Kumasi washington's new record did not make it anywhere into there maybe they didn't submit I don't know but whoever whoever's fault it is that that album wasn't nominated for anything you're up those are essentially the categories that I want to give a nod to for this year's Grammys again overall not that disappointing this year good job Grammys not that disappointing that's that's that's that's a high-water mark for you guys and I think we're going to leave it at that were there any awards or nominations that you were disappointed with that you were happy about artists that you think should have gotten a nod that didn't anybody who you thought was snubbed let me know in the comments I'm sure you will you're the best transition that's it for the video although I cannot completely end this video out without at least giving a nod to Kendrick Lamar's fantastic stage performance at the show that those crazy visuals I felt almost bad for the drummer playing next to that giant fire and also that moment were the black lights kicked on and just saw the body paint that was nuts chills Challis we're going to leave it at that Grammys Anthony Fantana forever

Kanye West who's sort of Twitter rampages over the past few days that have been sort of put out there in conjunction with his recent album release have a spark a lot of internet drama I think part of this but let's be honest here like this is Kanye is now paying voice to something that I think you and I have probably seen over the course of our our careers reviewing hip hop for you probably for a lot longer than I have and just in terms of it's been a comment that's shown up for both of us oh absolutely well I mean what market has not said explicitly yet is that what we're gonna be talking about is this idea that white publications supposedly white publications should not be covering black music whether it be and I imagined that label sort of extends out of the hip-hop realm as well if we were to be covering some jazz or something too I'm sure that would that sort of sentiment would most likely apply although I don't think I've ever seen whenever I rarely touched a jazz round because I don't feel I don't understand it enough to me to make a forum critique of it but I can't imagine I'd whatever somebody who would if we were commenting or viewing a jazz album that the criticism don't review jazz it's black music would be so vociferous and it's so vociferous in some occasions well it's uh it's it's kind of one of the many elephants in the room of this this conversation or of this Colome seoun you know because jazz right now is not really at the peak of relevance that it once was so when a white publication covers a jazz record I mean not only our jazz musicians happy to have the coverage because very few other outlets are actually talking about their music but also artists like Kanye who will sort of throw these cries of unfairness and white publications out there he's not going to come to the rescue of a jazz record that seemingly gets a Pandora bunch of negative reviews from these white publications that he's kind of throwing shade at oh I would agree with that completely so well I think in the majority of this conversation at least where I've seen it or because there when we expand out to discuss black music there you're gonna run to a number of genres that are intrinsically about the popular by the popular definition are coded as black so hip-hop obviously I'd also probably say funk or soul to some extent R&B but even when I would describe an album that would be so so an album that also came up at the Grammys recently and well-deserving at the wins it got to was black Messiah but D'Angelo sure which I would say would I would have no qualms describing that as an extremely black album in terms of the way that it was put forward and presented absolutely and yet when both of us covered it both of us I think if I remember correctly both of us like did a great deal yeah I loved it it was definitely one of my favorite records of the year yes or Die and I would also say and yet even when recovering that we never got those comments of please don't like stop reviewing black music yeah well I mean okay well let's let's unpack that but before we do let me say something maybe slightly for comedic effect but just to just totally get it out there full disclosure mark and I are both very white yes oh so maybe we come at this conversation with with a certain opinion on this on this claim that white publications should not be covering black music in the first place so just to put that out there and you're free to sort of assume that we're right are we're wrong due to our whiteness if you please but you know just full disclosure right there just letting everybody you know yeah I mean it's it seems that this critique doesn't really get thrown out there as long as the review is of a popular album and it's a review that's popular you know I mean it's a review of a popular minutes a review that's positive you know as long as the the the point of view and the opinions are positive but the thing is even in Kanye's case I mean pitchfork gave him a nine out of ten which I felt kind of bad for pitchfork at that point because it's almost like he broke up with them in a way because they just kind of stumble over themselves to congratulate him and just praise him with every single thing he does and then at the end of the tape the nine out of ten is just not good enough and in that case he's well pretty much in that case they as much of a jerk offer a room now he's basically left the bed now they're sleeping on the wet patch yeah kinda because he's essentially just pointed them out as an uncool white publication when I mean cool is really sort of the only collateral that they have you know and and not to say that Kanye I think was successful in his smear of their site or of rolling stone or whatnot you know and I'm sure pitchfork in order to maintain some kind of level of objectivity or at least the appearance of so which they haven't tried to keep up in the case of people like Mark kozilek for example but in but in this specific case I'm sure they'll continue to say positive things about Kanye's music when they can continue to find them despite this mention despite this kind of a negative tweet that they've been thrown but you know as crazy as Kanye is I feel like we can't completely take this argument seriously when we look at it purely through the lens of it's just an it's just one of hundreds of nutty tweets that Kanye West has launched since he put up his Twitter account but but if we just kind of look at this argument and look at this idea in the abstract isn't there you know an argument to be made that there's some kind of merit to this this idea that maybe not that why publication should avoid covering black music but if you're talking about a white publication or a white music writer aren't they inherently not going to go into that album or that sound with as much understanding of it as maybe a black writer given that maybe didn't grow up on the kind of music that they're reviewing or maybe because they're white they're not so well-versed in the social issues that might have been discussed in the music I think that question comes out and you have a couple loaded elements that immediately come out there the first if and this is the bottom thing I find hilarious about Kanye specifically targeting pitchfork because pitchfork is now at the state of mind where in their in their overall acceptance and discussion of hip-hop and predominantly and more black music they that you go back probably to the late 90s or even the early 2000s there were outside of some very specific underground artists they weren't covering a lot of black music or at least not to the degree of legree of favorability and the degree of in-depth analysis and credence that they do that they deliver today yeah let's a future put out dirty sprite 2 and 2002 that album would not have gotten the best new music no most likely not I mean maybe it would be an incredibly futuristic sound but I mean you could you could pun not intended but but you could say yes pitchfork back in their in their inception they were not covering a lot of hip-hop it was mostly just underground indie rock and indie pop and so on and so forth you know that that those were their stomping grounds you know that they weren't into the mainstream they didn't have a foot into that world like they do today and I would agree with that so let's take the question back to the intrinsic whether or not there's certain element of intrinsic blackness that well add to specific types of music or art that oh that a white critic or a white publication might not otherwise understand I think there I think this question can be unpacked in a number of different ways and I think the place to start with is the music itself so you can beat the argument let's say what is it about music that would code it one way or the other in terms of being black for instance cuz in the one case is it the sound well you can say that but what is post Malone doing that is so much different than future sure I hear you and and I've made a you know that that argument as well you know when he sort of put that tweet out I mean I had retreated it and made the joke that you know this guy knows that that cornball post Malone is on his record right and almost instantaneously I had gotten a tweet back from a black person saying but post Malone makes black music and then I was like oh okay fair enough but what he's that's what he's doing but wait and not that I disagree I don't you know but I guess I guess that's you know that's that's all I'm saying I agree with you and and I think the general population would you know there's not really that much different between what post Malone is doing and what future is doing sure so you have that basic premise that okay let's let's follow that he's calling that black music so okay what is it that would make it black is it the delivery or is it the content and because this is the one thing that I found hilarious about Kanye and making that specific specific remark with reference to the life of Pablo itself because I'm sitting here and I'm like if you want to talk about the struggle if you want to talk about white privilege if you want to talk about major issues you have one song arguably on that album that deals with these issues the most next feedback and you cut it off you cut off your probably the most compelling image you have with your Oprah skit sure and I found that skit to be absolutely hilarious but at the same time it's it's not like Kanye is stepping up and making a profound statement so it's for him to intrinsically co-opt that argument finds it puts it in a really frustrating is position because it's not whenever I hear that it's you shouldn't be criticizing black music it's never in a situation bizarrely when the content is explicitly speaking on black issues because when I've talked about Kendrick Lamar when I've talked about the roots when I've talked about blackness seiyya butch by D'Angelo when we've got when I've gone into depth on to these hapax I don't tend to get that remark you shouldn't be talking about black music it's when I come down on someone when typically some of the more let's call it more some of the more beast side of hip-hop something a little bit more the ignorance side where the comment that I first got it was when I talked about Nicki Minaj's the pinkprint mm-hmm and basically when I think it's coming across as saying this is this is now being coded as black music when on some level it comes across as passing it off as an excuse for some of the content being presented the way it is sure whereas in reality I come down when I come down on content that is just as based or just as ignorant when presented badly if it was done in bro country or when it's done in hardcore punk sure okay yeah I mean I I see that argument and and I think it's it's also worth saying that the the types of things that at least for me that I could see being critiqued on Kanye's new record specific lines like the lied about the model having bleach on her asshole or maybe another line a lot of people have taken issue with the line about you know having made Taylor Swift famous by sort of embarrassing her in front of everybody at that award show you know lines like these are certainly well worth critique are certainly reasonable issues that people could have with this album also you know the fact that many of the tracks on the record are so brief and sounds so unfinished what do these things have to do with blackness black music or black culture you know these things are critiques that really could be lobbed at any number of albums created by any number of people of any number of races you know and and I sort of take it back to my initial question saying that I do think there is some merit to that critique of of white publications or white writers inefficiently covering black music because I have seen reviews and I have seen reviewers on YouTube you know look at albums like Kendrick Lamar's to pimp a butterfly and just take a listen to the content and say but how am I supposed to relate to this you know when that's the thing we're going about the same person here yeah we probably are thinking about the same person here and he shall remain nameless but but still you know it's that that's an example you know it's a glaring example of of that sort of fear that a black artist might have when trying to show their music to a white person and you know I for one have had a lot of people after my Kendrick Lamar review did get a lot of views did get a lot of attention you know I got my fair share of comments and tweets and and I'm positively sure this wasn't black people tweeting this at me people telling me that you know I was a cook and I had white guilts and I was like a black apologist and I just loved Kendrick Lamar because he's black and I hate myself I hate my whiteness so I'm giving Tim a butterfly a really positive score and I'm saying it's the album of the year just because I just love love love black people and I hate white people and I hate whiteness so you know there's a lot of drama around racial issues in North America and and our history very clearly points out as to why that is and you know music and culture it's very much about context and I think you know even some of the most talented writers can't help but at least bring a little bit of that context into their writing because it's just kind of the world that they've grown up and they can't quite help it I think you can do your best to work past it and not look at an album in in the sort of point of view where I can't relate to this guy because he's black you know you can sort of grow beyond that and sort of see the person on record as a human being and sort of try to empathize as best you can and just enjoy the music for what it is rather than just trying to enjoy the album because you know you sort of see yourself reflected and it as a white man or woman I I would agree with you there I think the whole idea that you have to be able to relate about something in order to either write or to listen to it and discuss it I think that's ultimately very narrow-minded because you see a lot of this coming out in a lot of modern trends towards fiction in terms a lot towards music because and I find it ultimately very narrow-minded in kind of a little insane because you had the idea that you take a lot of number of great authors who write things that they haven't otherwise lived like Kurt Vonnegut was never abducted by aliens what do you have sigh when you have sci-fi authors incest or thing who write outside of their typical experience then then the the by the same extension being able to absorb appreciate and discuss that this not solely confine you to something that you have to otherwise experience because we do all have empathy we do all have the ability to be able to understand and spleen put forward what's on display and that's where I think some degree the artist himself comes in because if the artist does a very good job outlining and articulating the struggle of what they're going through of what they're thinking about I think that can ultimately transcend the racial barrier look how much Kendrick has been universally praised across the board because not just because of his blackness but because of how damn good the musically the record is sure yeah and and I think that's another sort of elephant in the room when we take this argument back to the context of Kanye's tweets this idea that music writers would be negatively reviewing or misunderstanding his album because they're white or the publication is white and he's black is sort of a silly charge when you consider how popular other black artists are especially artists like Kendrick Lamar who are so blatantly putting their blackness out there in their music now I can't now there will be the argument and this is gonna be something that there will be some audiences who I will say probably will not be able to will probably look at Kanye's will probably look at some of Kanye's or Kendricks music and and they all still push it aside by saying it's black we don't want to listen to them this stuff it's but that's the fault of the audience like to credit the rule of the critic is still to rise above and give every art give it every piece of art affaire a fair sharing regard less of that additional cultural baggage that comes with it a good critic can put aside that or it can at least step outside of their own personal experience is to some extent of course you're not gonna be able to step outside of it because we're not automatic but on some level that though there can be relatable factors that can transcend race sexuality and gender that can be evidenced in all music hmm alright so moving a little bit further into some of the stipulations that I think you could pose to this question in your head is there anything different between a supposedly white publication covering a black artist of black record and somebody like you were be doing it who you know are essentially just kind of on our own we're doing it independently we're hopping on camera and giving our own personal opinion directly to our audience and you know we there's no bureaucracy we're just kind of left to our own devices and relying on our purely our own opinions we gotta be careful okay I got to be careful here i phrase this in terms of relationships that I might have um don't burn any bridges exactly from what I know and I'll aim this to keep this as vague as possible that there are certain review sites and where there is a bureaucracy and there's an approval process when it comes to assigning certain rankings or certain scores to a record because on some level like on some level the publication's still has to deal with the hate mail and then some injury will occasionally get the publication who just does not give a fuck and we'll let the writers you actually say this is trash here is why we have an average to the point where some role of the bigger publications have been either bought out by larger conglomerates and and thus in order to maintain relationships they have to be able to they have to be a little bit more polite or you're gonna run into situations where they're just not where they're trying they're trying not to deal with the comment section later yeah well I mean a lot of huge publications as well have sort of the you know the the marketing side of things to worry about too and I don't think we have to care about that as much like as much as we might have relationships with an artist I also think that the YouTube platform allows us to be less faceless like we can come out a point of view and there can be artists who might disagree with how we might say our review or how we might articulate our points but at the end of the day I have no I have yet to encounter an artist we when I even when I'd slagged an album who has come back at me and told me to go fuck myself sure you know and I think um I I think there's sort of even though you know we we are white as fuck I think that we have kind of uh we can put up this shield or this defense that well you know the thing about our reviews is that their personal and at the end of the day we're only doing this because we're fans you know like sure I mean we're doing it to get subscribers and get views and and you know make some money off of it but you know like nobody is paying us other than sort of ourselves you know or Google rather but you know Google isn't directing us to do anything you know it's all done very impersonal II through the Adsense platform you know nobody's directing us other than us you know there's no bureaucracy there's nothing political about it you know we're just kind of doing our own thing but still I feel like that that sort of racial hang-up can be there because you know still I mean we are white critics if race does matter in this in this argument however these supposedly white publications I have talked with online and I know of many people who are employed by these publications who are black or are people of color and and write about artists like Kanye regularly on these websites and on the flip side there are traditionally black publications or publications that cover hip hop regularly that employ a lot of white writers to I think the the whole stipulation that it is a white writer or a white publication I think it comes in the presumed assumption I think it's a ultimately probably more accurate than it isn't is that the lot of the these publications are run by white executives and that the executive Haltom Utley had the final sign-off one way or the other cuz let's think about how Kanye would consider one of these publications giving one of his albums a review one way or the other he's not gonna be looking at this individual writer gave me this review it's this institution gave me this review yes you know and and and that's the thing I mean when you're talking about a publication versus what you and I are doing ultimately you know that's that's no matter how good or positive your review is you're not gonna be able to kind of back yourself away from that look of an institution you know and and I think I think that's what's I think that's something that not only musicians but also music fans like you and I are kind of opting out of now that sort of the Internet has democratized opinions as it were mm-hmm and I think that that gives us a little bit more it give it's a mixed blessing because we don't have the protection of the institution but on some case is not like we're gonna it's not like we would take it if it means that our opinions would end up getting compromised sure absolutely so it's it's it's it's an interesting conversation I'm wondering how how much else we can kind of unpack out of it I feel like you know is there anything so far that you feel like we haven't completely uh explored my next question I actually think there's a number of things we could actually further go deeper because here's the thing as much as when Kanye made this statement as much as we as a group we didn't step back and we can say this is kind of as an argument there isn't a lot of legs to stand on here and of course you consider the source but keep in mind this is something that's been directed to us prevalent ly over a period of time that there is clearly people who buy into this concept that white critics as it is do not understand the cultural issues or are approaching the music with a certain with a certain idea of privilege that we that thus we it will not resonate with us on that deeper level so I'm seeing this come become a fair bit more prevalent whenever I cover and he's forget like whenever I cover that sort of hip-hop that caters to that audience is like well you don't understand the struggle you've never been there it's not KITT it's not catered or marketed towards you and while I would agree with that what I find a little bit interesting is how that attitude is becoming more prevalent and spreading out over a larger period of time and a large group of people that we've got this before Kanye said it so yeah where do you think the root of this is coming from I think the root of it mostly comes from just culture and how people tend to favor their culture or the culture that they sort of personally identify with and to sort of either see an institution that they think misrepresents or doesn't represent or doesn't come from the culture that they are critiquing or discussing I think somebody who's actually from that culture can kind of see the assessment by that institution is kind of unfair and this moves beyond the music world you know this could be as simple as somebody from Sudan having seen some kind of very negative or disturbing news report about something horrible going on in their own country on CNN you know and obviously the news coverage isn't really that accurate or doesn't put the entire scope of the country into light maybe just kind of this one incident and and I guess you know in that same way you can paint some of these publications in the music realm as not really being that deeply invested in the hip-hop world as much as they are just willing to talk about the genres most popular and most relevant artists because that's going to get them hits that's going to get them views that's going to get them people clicking on their articles is Kanye is is pitchfork as invested in hip-hop as a website like DJ booth or a website like double-xl I mean there are hundreds upon hundreds of mixtapes and albums that various hip-hop publications cover every year but they also cover the Kanye record to pitch work is a little more casual when it comes to hip-hop sure they're covering a lot more than they used to but you know now that hip-hop is incredibly relevant we're all kind of covering a lot more hip-hop than we used to hip you know rappers are essentially the rock stars of today you know uh the they're essentially the new van Halen you know the new Quiet Riot and so on and so forth you know the excesses of of 80s hard rock and hair metal I think are kind of playing out once again just in a different genre of music so having said all that I think there are people who you know listen to hip-hop not just because it makes for great music but because they personally identify with that culture because they have backgrounds and mindsets that are similar to that of the artists that they're listening to so to see a critic who very clearly doesn't come from that world I mean I grew up listening to hip-hop but my window to the hip-hop world was like television and radio you know wasn't something that I heard a lot of my friends personally listening to it wasn't something that you know cars were booming out of their windows driving down the street from where I lived you know I mean only occasionally so so I mean I didn't grow up where you know I I didn't grow up in the kinds of environments that you know nas is rapping about on on illmatic you know so so naturally you know as much as I me try to understand the music and as much as I do enjoy the music there are going to be people who have grown up in in those environments who enjoy that record and probably see themselves maybe relating to it a little more than I do personally and in and through that I think they they most likely see their point of views of it their opinions of it how they feel about it maybe holding a little more water than my opinions of it you know and and I can sort of understand that argument I mean maybe I can put together a better review than this imaginary person that I've sort of drawn up in my head but it would only kind of be the the various to Deus wirdy kind of you know review that I usually put out you it wouldn't be this authentic personal kind of account of the sort of world that nas is rapping about which could be interesting as well you know I mean I guess there's a certain level of authenticity to that that you can't really you know deny it's interesting that you brought up the authenticity point I want to come back to that in a second but the funny thing is this is something I've noticed as a trend that's come up when you look back at music writing and how it's evolved over the past 30 to 40 years while you'd always have artists that would put a lot of themselves into their writing I think that over the course of the past at least especially since the dawn of the internet the writer has actually taken upon its me often becomes less about the music and self and sometimes it can become more about the author's experience within the music it's trying to tell a little bit more of a story trying to find that that that Quint that more human experience instead of more of a instead of more of I would say a clinical evaluation about what makes the music work so I guess that that's the one thing where I find it gets a little bit interesting because we're ultimately do we draw the line between going into a little bit more that technical trying to assess everything with the fairness and objectivity of the critic rather than going in and rather going in and trying to find that deep interpersonal connection with something that resonates with you on your core and draws you back to your childhood and finds those those those essential memories for instance yeah I mean well I mean I think I I think I think kind of an argument that I want to throw in here in relation to the devil's advocate that I that I just kind of played yeah that is that relating to the music that you're listening to doesn't necessarily make it good there is you know there's tons of awful like a white guy hip hop out there where guys are essentially just crying over how upset they are at their moms and their dads and they're trying to be the next Eminem that I just cannot stand not even a minute of or they're you know our dudes out there who our rapping about walks of life that I mean I've never lived I don't care for them I don't care for their music but they have fan bases who very much relate to their music and very much care about the message that they're putting out there in their music because they've kind of walked that walk you know something relatable doesn't necessarily mean it's good I guess is the is the argument to be made there just because you're black and you feel comfortable listening to artists X because they're black as well doesn't necessarily mean the music's good just because you're white and you're listening to artists X because they're white because they grew up in the same punk scene that you did or you know you're a country boy and they're making country music so on and so forth doesn't necessarily make it good either you know music sort of has that power to tap into culture and and reflect culture out to the listener in a way that I think very few artistic mediums do but it doesn't necessarily make for like I was just saying I'll repeat it again great music across the board you know to me something that makes for a solidly great piece of music is something that can kind of transcend that culture and sometimes even transcend genre and appeal to people who have never even been in touch with the kind of world that that music comes from and actually maybe even make them curious about the world that that music comes from and I would agree with you there and completely in terms of that in terms of that position but now but here's the other thing that I had I was thinking about midway through it ties back to the question of authenticity especially when it comes to hip-hop because a lot in terms of the whole one of the hip-hop has always since its inception put a great deal of value and it and put a lot towards that whole question of authenticity in terms of when you actually live that life you came from that struggle you were able to uh you were able to relate to that because I think that ultimately one of the reasons that we'll have come down on white prints is that it feels inauthentic because we haven't lived it that I can see that authenticity has that has at least a component in that argument so but yet when you go to certain hip-hop artists who have never even pretended to be authentic and yet that criticism still and yes so when you have that particular put forever that's saying yeah it's it's dumb party music it's put for it and they're like well you still have an understudy struggle I'm like yeah but it's not like the artists themselves is putting is agreeing with that struggle either way I remember was I was doing a little bit of research for a memory store an episode of billboard breakdown and the one thing that struck me about future is that he said that yeah I'm not I'm not drugged out on lean all the time like I'm not that I'm not totally in that headspace all the time yeah and and you couldn't be otherwise you couldn't function look at Lowell Wayne so I think the PISA that's coming out of it is that how much more can you use the eye can you use authenticity as an argument against critics having to not live that life when the artist themself is putting forward a fabrication yeah I mean I think um you know that there are instances of what you're talking about there even more egregious than the one that you just cited I mean look at a guy like Rick Ross who I mean the guy is nothing but fabrication from you know his sort of drug kingpin status to the amount of money that he says he allegedly makes or has in his bank account yeah I mean fabrication in hip-hop runs pretty deep I mean one of the few artists out there simultaneously polarizing and very hated artists people but maybe not as much now as he used to be who from what I can see is is more factual than most is probably Drake you know I mean at least everything that he brags about actually happened maybe he's you know a little too tough than he actually is sometimes on record but you know I mean he's not sort of making these mental leaps of faith like I see Kanye is on tracks like facts where he's essentially painting his little niche fashion shoe line as being more important or relevant than Michael Jordan's epic you know a shoe line which will probably outlive him he'd himself yes and it's go ahead oh I was just gonna say you know and even amongst hip-hop fans and hip-hop writers you know it's widely acknowledged that the fabrication in rap music runs pretty deep it's just all over the place and it's it's just so glaring so with these rappers sort of not necessarily living the lives 100% that they themselves are rapping about why should a music writer have to have lived that lifestyle you know or sort of gone through that struggle that they necessarily have very little connection with exactly and I would agree with you there and then it actually brought to me actually it's a similar criticism that's often thrown at the flip side of the coin which is country because you get a lot of country artists who are who are trying to put on a rougher sound who are trying to say we came from the out we came from the outback we're very much drawing back to that rule sound and yet and the sometime you grew up in downtown Nashville you're an ingrained part of this of the Nashville songwriting machine and it's very much that same claim towards authenticity and yet people will I've gotten the courtesy of someone country music you're not country enough boy it's interesting I will Eve it I believe it is the interesting thing because it does it because it's this in this case it's transcending the racial boundary and so even when you can sit like it's saying that you don't understand the struggle even when the artists themselves hasn't put forward the struggle themselves and this actually raised an interesting hypothesis and this is something that honestly I think Mike c-town might be better apt to speak to art than we do but if there was critics who were who are into let's say cut music that was typically coded as white for instant and the easiest one to point to his country then basically say that there are they're the Arab why people who not only make country music but who like country music and who are fans of country music and who probably right and who there might be some who even write and criticize country music does this make their up like it in that particular case that that the they are not speaking well not the race factors into it when you flip it the other way around hmm sure does no I mean I don't think it does either you know and and I think I'm kind of another issue that uh isn't as often brought up because I think race is so much more a hot-button topic in this country but I think another issue that kind of plays into this a bit of a more of an unspoken issue is one of class because I think you know a lot of this music specifically in the case of you know I could bring up you know Drake once again especially Rick Ross or even for example Beyonce with her latest single and music video sort of throwing in these elements of very urban culture within their music in an attempt to kind of gain some sort of authenticity for the art that they're putting out and I and I don't begrudge these artists the ability to sort of access their blackness as it were to put it into their music you know but I mean at the end of the day these people are going back to their mansions after these music videos are over you know they're not sticking around where they're shooting these music videos you know they're leaving immediately after because they have money and they have you know music careers to run it's not hashtag DIY or Die here yeah absolutely you know and the thing is um and in in I don't necessarily dislike music that that tries to sort of put that sort of reality and that grittiness forward you know I mean I would rather Beyonce do as she did on formation then you know come out with another video that you know just kind of sexualizes her and is just nothing but dancing and just you know very good looking very pretty I mean obviously artfully shot but I guess I'd rather see a music video like formation than see another Katy Perry video where she's at a party or kind of floating in the clouds or some other bullshit mm-hmm and that's it and that's the interesting thing that ultimately comes out of this is that but the question of that class consciousness whether or not they might be pulling something from their past or something that they have it's the same question of authenticity when it's coming but it's not something they might have otherwise lived its its claim for yeah I mean you know you're when you're talking about a guy like Drake I mean you're talking child actor here you know you're talking lifetime entertainer who simultaneously telling us that he started from the bottom and now he's here and the thing is that a lot of hip-hop a lot of hip-hop heads there are a lot of like emcees through that in his face and and yet he sort of managed to coast fast that's almost because he's mandated of Teflon he doesn't need nothing sticks to him but as long as he's dropping those hits man he's bulletproof so you have to ask the question like even in hell even when he had the Ghost Rider he let him and then that was out he was bulletproof so screw man the hits make you bulletproof although but I'm thinking more if the hits are making him bulletproof but at the same time will there ever be a point where the exaggeration where he is so far outside of what one can since it or believably Drake that it will ultimately push people away and uh I think I think that's a really good question because I think that's kind of what happened in Kanye's case I mean the public for a long time is just so use of seeing him as this really nutty character but it's almost like with these past few Twitter rants he sort of pushed us into a realm of unbelievab ility and weird and so many people are just like looking at what he's saying with a lot of skepticism interests thinking is this guy nuts I don't even know if it's if it's not so much as desperate in a sense where I don't think we're I think he's creatively I think he's run into a point of creative bankruptcy honestly because while he's was an incredibly gifted producer I think he's just does not know what to say on record in order to provoke controversy over to provoke a reaction you just I think if anything he's falling victim to his own hype machine sure yeah I mean it could be people looking at him like he's nuts or seeing some other kind of ulterior motive behind what he's saying and what he's rapping and what he's tweeting it seems like nearly everything that he do is that he does these days is not for the sake of making great music but more for the sake of just getting people to gawk at him whether it be something he's rapping on a record something he's putting out there in a tweet whether it be you know who he's you know dating and and having kids with the the people who he's associating with his ultra weird fashion line I mean is it seems all like just a ploy for attention sometimes you have to wonder what you have to wonder what's driving that and what entry and what intrinsic quality gets people to look at beyond the spectacles eventually people are gonna get sick of it eventually people are going to stop looking and stop paying attention it's it's possible but I feel like we're I think we're in the midst of like the the spectacle generation right now you know I mean if if a guy like Donald Trump can basically get within inches of the hoop of the presidency just by saying the crazy things that he does I don't see why Kanye can't sort of in a way maintain relevance in the hip-hop world by saying the things that he does true although given 2020 Kanye's gonna run for president so yes we could actually see that play out in terms of how I would otherwise work which is tennis yes hopefully hopefully Kanye comes through and challenges the Trump presidency which is inevitable you're scaring me here dude I think yes you're Canadian you don't got to worry about it yeah pretty much well we do our economy's linked to yours like yeah I know I'm kidding you got you gotta worry about it be very afraid yeah so in summation cuz I think we pushed this conversation deeper than I would have otherwise expected I guess the question is where do we go from here as critics I think I think you and I personally I think we're in a good spot you know I think we whether we review a black album or a piece of black music positively or negatively we're coming from a good genuine and a well-intentioned place because ultimately at the end of the day we're music fans you know we're not in it for the drama we're not in it for the politics we're not in it to rub shoulders with celebrities we're not in it to align ourselves with certain views within the realm of identity politics you know ultimately we're here for the love of music and the love of musical discussion and music culture we're just trying to share in that with the people who view our content so while these discussions are interesting to have ultimately I don't think they're anything you are I have to sweat because if a viewer comes across our videos white or black brown whatever and is listening to the things that you and I are saying and the critiques that we're giving hopefully what comes across is that we care about the music you know and we're and we're not trying to you know sort of incite any drama or argument that has to do with race or or you know portraying a certain bias against somebody because they're from a certain culture so on and so forth again you know I just think we're music fans and and that should be reading in our videos and obviously people are understanding that so I don't know if this is something that you know you and I need to stay awake you know but at night over but this is something that maybe publications that tend to be more fameless' and tend to be more nameless faceless and more bureaucratic might need to be conscious of in the future because for these brands these very large brands some of them employ a lot of people this type of drama might be something they want to avoid because they have a bottom line to worry about at the end of the day do you think the whole I when you brought up a keep in mind that we're doing this for the love of the music we're not putting inside Ella some elements of identity politics that would otherwise coax out one particular reaction one way or the other do you think that there is gonna be some credit there gonna be some critical outlets that realize that catering to that catering to that crowd and bringing forward that argument might lead them to getting at least a short term bit of acceptance oh yeah absolutely you know but the thing is as much as a website like you know we'll just say pitchfork for example we're all adults here we can admit who's on what side of what fence you know and you know pitchfork has a model that they run their website with and it's not inherently wrong you know they just run their site differently than you or I probably would or how we run our YouTube channels but having said that you know very much a lot of the thing pieces that they put out there on the website and other music whoops to sort of toe the line of social justice which is cool if you actually identify with that point of view but none of these websites are gonna go as far as to actually listen to the request of somebody like Kanye and basically relegate themselves to the corner of white publications and just hold themselves off from reviewing his music for the rest of his career that's not gonna happen yeah because they're they because ultimately on some level Kanye needs to them as much as they need as much as they need him sure absolutely you know and and while they may be sympathetic towards some of these points of views that some of these points of view that come come out in their think pieces like I was just saying they're not gonna respect his wishes per se and just say oh well you know Kanye is a person of color and he's making music within black art form and we as a white publication need to understand that we can't critique this kind of music and we just need to review music that is uh white and just never review a black artist ever again that conversation is not being had by anybody thank God all right I think we can leave it there I want to uh I want to thank mark Grondin of spectrum pulse we will link his YouTube channel down in the description for appearing on this podcast with me yeah and thanks a lot for having me on here and Anthony that was an interesting conversation yeah no problem and you know obviously as as previously admitted mark and I are very white and if you want to start just kind of a some counter point or a conversation down in the description or if you just kind of have a different opinion about everything that we've been

you're cheap and you don't got nothing better that's true hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new panda bear haha Animal Collective record painting with famed neo psych outfit Animal Collective this is their latest record over here the group has numerous great albums under their belts at this point you could say from their album song tongs all the way to Merriweather Post Pavilion in the 2000s they were on quite the streak but as a longtime listener of the band this record over here is kind of a moment I hope I hope a moment of redemption for Animal Collective because as you may or may not know their last full-length LP centipede Hertz was met with mixed reviews from fans and critics alike the songs on this thing did not translate well and the instrumentals were more messy than they were imaginative which was just a letdown because we're talking about a group here that has a reputation for creating music that is catchy it's sweet its infectious but also mind-bending and exciting and looking forward to this new album over here you know you never really know Animal Collective is going to do on their next record they're unpredictable in that sense so I couldn't come into this thing expecting or really wanting anything other than to just like it and it seemed like that was going to be a real possibility once singles like Florida came out which i think is a great track hectic fun catchy song that seemed instantaneous super straightforward but had that that manic wild side to it that reminded me of strawberry jam and upon initial listen to this album it seemed like almost every other track here was also following suit with flora da da these songs are not as booming or as wide or as panoramic or is drenched in effects as Merriweather Post Pavilion but the record is also not as cluttered as centipede hurts they're not being as indulgent they're keeping things kind of basic and skeletal I wouldn't even say the sounds on this thing are all that trippy occasionally sunny and kooky and silly but not trippy the vocals are super upfront and intimate very in-your-face and the synth bass and the loops and the bedroom percussion this record really has nothing to hide now there is still a little studio trickery going into this project it's not like you know just plain everyday sounds going into this thing but it's like a vie panda and geologists tried to make a record here that that stood solely on the merits of its standalone songs not that it sounds like this one big psychedelic pop opus or these indulgent musical passages or weird sound play which can be hard to adjust to for a hardcore Animal Collective fan because if you're a fan you know the animal collective is a band of not just songs but also sounds sounds that are usually unpredictable adventurous and complex and all of that is just kind of missing here and the group tries to deliver songs tunes instead and there are some highlights as a result floridaa like I said is great I love the song golden gals which seems to directly reference the show Golden Girls I think that's what it seems like the song features one of the better lead vocal performances readable lyrics really sweet harmonized background vocals golden gals and I like the buzzing synth bass on this track too this synth bass also appears on a lot of other tracks here but on this song in this context it seems especially good the song the burglars I love the fast quick little vocal melodies on this song and the explosive woodwind freakout in the second half is pretty cool and the vocal melodies on bagels in Kiev are weirdly seductive so there are some tunes here but I don't think enough to carry the entire album there are tracks where it does seem like Animal Collective could use a little more sound play or that these songs could use a little more length to push them past like the two minute and forty five mark as they are on this project the sounds the instrumentals are just so uninspired and just unimaginative the synth bass and the redundant loops and the basic drum patterns they all get old after a while the auditory orgasmic experience of previous animal collective records is just not here and it's not replaced with thing because these toons are just not as satisfying now they're not as patience testing as many tracks from solo av tear and panda bear albums but I still kind of feel like in a way I'm listening to a solo record av tears wild side just does not show up enough on this project and a lot of the lackluster characteristics that I've heard on solo AV Taran panda bear records also show up here but they're kind of pared down into more digestible song lengths I appreciate the group trying to step beyond the veil of mystery that usually shrouds their albums but without the layers upon layers of strange effects and and incredibly weird sounds it's like animal collectives appeal has almost evaporated into thin air on this thing especially as characteristics that are kind of core to the group I mean trademark things sort of like the the vocal style that you'll typically catch on an animal collective record these things become kind of obnoxious because I cannot stand some of the vocal performances on this thing especially on natural selection summoning the wretch song spilling guts which has a lumbering beat that gets old really fast unfortunately I just don't care for this record and that ultimately can be boiled down to some of the songwriting just being lackluster some of the course is just not contrasting all that much from the verses some of the vocals sounding kind of obnoxious and the instrumentals are just not that intriguing I'm feeling a like the dz-5 of this thing transition have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate at u2 best you the best what should I review next hit that like if you like and share this album review with your mom if she's a big animal collector's fan forever "
zVlcqnrWUT8,hey hey hey oh the Holy Spirit here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new porches record pool porches is the longtime musical project of mr. Aaron Maine this is one of several albums and EPS that he's already dropped under this name but previous porches records had not only an entirely different label this record is now on Domino records but an entirely different sound this thing clearly has a bigger budget behind it more clarity to the instrumentation and with that clarity with that bigger budget it sounds like Aaron wanted to kind of graduate the project beyond its loafie aesthetic its lo-fi rock aesthetic of the previous records which is fine I don't want an artist to have to force a sound that they don't feel natural playing with anymore especially if they're in a different place creatively but what the band has graduated to on this record is very simple straightforward mutti mutti mutti synth pop it's a little 80s pastiche with a kind of standoffish demeanor and even though it is very much a pop affair there's nothing feel good about it this thing is like the soundtrack to some light depression or trying to look cool and even though I I do see issues with it on the surface level deeper I do think there are some good intentions behind this project generally I think the instrumentals are decent or okay on this thing they maybe run a little too skeletal and lethargic but this thing is really upfront it has nothing to hide it could have easily been another washed out synth led dream pop record that I've been using for the past few months to keep warm this winter looks like it could use another word record though  those guys the instrumentals on this thing they're soft but they're meaty the beats are really resonant the synth bass is really resonant the lead synthesizers are very glossy the shimmer they're pretty some tracks like be apart have a really strong groove to them or at least a relatively strong groove in comparison with the other tracks meanwhile other songs kind of elicit some very light head bobbing there are some nice additions to these tracks and cool since solos or instrumental bridges there's a nice saxophone that pops up on the song shaver that was really sweet there's some decent hooks here and there the song car is definitely a highlight that song has a lot more energy behind it than some of the other tracks here and I love the driving bass and drums on the song mood the chord progressions and the synth leads are really cool they kind of have a nostalgic quirk to them that reminds me a little bit of aerial pink but the obvious Achilles heel of this project something that I think takes down the quality of these instrumentals of these songs and it makes this record difficult to listen to are the vocals and given they have not been perfect or top-notch on previous porches records you could even argue that that was just a part of the Bands style but that's one of the few things about porches that seems to have carried over to this new project over here and it just does not fit all that snugly into these very glossy sleek simple synth pop instrumentals in fact they sound kind of awkward not only is most of the singing on this thing just super lethargic and elongated it monie but as far as pitch goes singing is flat flat flat flatter than day-old store-brand soda that's been sitting out and the singing can be kind of endearing for a few songs but it gets really old really fast especially on the slow cuts they don't really have a strong beat or an instrumental to kind of carry the track and then there are a few cuts here the feature auto-tune which just sounds silly and the off-key singing I think could have been helped along with some more passionate vocal deliveries or maybe even some lyrics that were just swallowed but the singing style on this thing in a way is just so one note occasionally Aaron does reach up in his higher register which isn't exactly on point either but it is a change of pace and like I said his singing does tend to kind of smudge the lyrics to the point where the lyrics are no longer even a focus if I want it to be one you know it's it's just a shame when our record just has one glaring characteristic about it that makes it difficult for you to enjoy the things on it that you see actual merit in and I think that the vocals on this record funnily enough have some potential to them like maybe the singing could be better with some practice sort of lessons or maybe just a little more focus there are moments where the singing on this record is okay it just seems like it could have been cleaned up I'm feeling a ladies in five on this thing transition have you given the something a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate at you two best you die best what should I review next I need sleep go to sleep Anthony Fantana porches Rob Scallon you're the man you're the man Rob Scallon forever 
hm7jy9HNl3w,oh yeah would you hurry up and just contribute to this thing so we can get out with you ladies and gentlemen don't review the child been waiting for it's any Fantini with the way of battle okay yes thank you I appreciate that hey everyone Anthony fan tanto here and it's time for a review of the new Kanye West record the life of Pablo infamous rapper and producer Kanye West's latest album over here we've been waiting for this thing it's the follow-up to his very polarizing 2013 record yeezus a record that galvanized hardcore mostly younger fans while also turning off people who kind of missed that college dropout era which is something that Kanye blatantly references on some bars from this very record and for a moment I thought well maybe he'll be this consistent throughout this entire record maybe he'll give us a record that's a little nostalgic a little bit of a throwback but it became very clear very fast that all bets for this thing were pretty much off once Kanye started promoting this record changing the title changing the cover changing the tracklist intentional or not this was like a genius marketing scheme because with each alteration of this project came a new wave of social media and media coverage because he gave us another opportunity to talk about the record now the product we're getting here is just as chaotic and unpredictable as the days leading up to the release of it of this product it's like 18 stem of two or three-minute tracks with sporadic features sudden sound changes weird little detours from the I love Kanye freestyle to the noisy and lo-fi freestyle for to the very glossy track famous to the heavenly and gospel inspired intro cut and the production on this thing is pretty diverse as well I mean you have underground producers and jazz rap heads like creme Riggins and Matt LeMond here side to side with artists like Hudson Mohawke and Metro boomin as many of you already know most likely I wasn't a huge fan of uses that record to me had just a lot of shallow appeals to an alternate sound but I think the life of Pablo actually has some legitimately weird moments if Jesus didn't challenge you this album will or will at least confuse you for a little bit this record will essentially rush you from one idea one sound one tune to the next and I can't help but feel like the creative process behind this album was the same way it feels like Kanye didn't really give himself a lot of time with this project for the sake of getting this kind of rough around the edges aesthetic it's like he's taking a lot of risks and just kind of leaving things up to chance it doesn't really read to me as a Pablo Picasso comparison or anything sort of avant-garde or well thought out on that level to me this album is more like a Jackson Pollock painting where each color is a song and they're all just kind of splattered on top of each other because this thing is all over the place stylistically emotionally and quality-wise as well but I think fans are going to love this project for its flaws just like they love Kanye's personality for its flaws at this point we know Kanye's m/o we know he's a bit of an antihero we know that as the masthead of the entitlement generation that he comes with some baggage his sense of privilege his narcissism his tendency to over inflate himself and his accomplishments he's too stubborn to quit while he's ahead and he wants to live for today but be remembered tomorrow and how these things play out into the songs really depends on what song you're listening to it could play out in a really beautiful interesting way an intriguing way or a horrifyingly ugly way the opening track on here ultralight beam absolutely stunning awesome gospel vocals a killer parents and since since Kanye's vocals are flat as usual but his performance is really heartfelt I love the swelling chords and the hip-hop style drum sounds but they're kind of cradling this really awesome chord progression very gently the horns that pop in in the second half of the track are gorgeous and chants the rapper's contribution on this song is tender and also hyped and inspiring however the quality on this thing takes a nosedive instantaneously Kanye mixes artsy and annoying in a way that only he can the song father stretch my hands the production here sounds kind of demo ish with the really stiff high hats the muddy bass the muddy drums the auto-tune seems completely out of whack not only that but once Kanye eventually pops into the track he starts singing about fucking a model who just bleached her asshole now if he gets the bleach on his shirt he's going to feel like an asshole the only saving grace of this track I think is the chorus and Kid Cudi's vocals on it aren't too bad I don't mind the melodies of this track they're just kind of mired in this really bad production but this track is just one of many moments on here where once I start listening in deeply to the lyrics they just kind of make me groan like on wolves where Kanye drops a line about uh and it's I guess some metaphor leaving the fridge open and someone takes your sandwich out of it that's some like life ruining stuff or on the song facts which I'm surprised it actually made it onto this track - not that good of a song however I like this revised version a little bit more but still the lyrics are borderline delusional and I mean only kids and want to be socialites care about emoji on the song highlights the series of lines about wishing his dick had like a GoPro or GoPro abilities yeah that was awful the second half of 30 hours really could have been cut entirely I'm not really sure what the point of this meandering moment was sure Kanye says that oh some of his favorite albums do stuff like this yeah I enjoy how biographical the first half of the track is but the second half of the song is utterly boring although I can imagine Kanye fans saying oh he's being so real he's really exposing himself to us he's being so natural we're really getting a picture of the real Kanye by that I guess they mean Kanye regurgitating pieces of like celebrity press fodder that we already know that we probably already read on Twitter this stuff was barely interesting when it was fiction on my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy now that it's real life it's even more boring and then we have this Fuli corny max be intermission which I don't really have anything against max B in general it just feels like this was thrown onto the album to prove an unnecessary point we have part two a father stretch my hands which I thought was decent a very glamorous banger lyrically Kanye digs back into his past again referencing his broken jaw his car crash then it closes out with some really weird vocoder vocals a la Laurie Anderson this is one of many moments on the record where I feel like I'm listening to some odd experimental art rock or something kind of like on the very last moments of fuck my life where the the twisted vocals and very sinister eerie tones hanging in the background remind me almost of kid a on the song famous one of the most controversial tracks on the project Kanye actually pulls together a banner that's a great track Rihanna's vocals on this track are great the lead vocal melody is fantastic although it seems like Kanye hands us the sample that it came from at the very end of the song Swizz Beatz ad-libs aren't too bad either and yeas verse on this track is just hilariously cocky some people might say it's a little over the top with the you know I feel like a good fuck taylor swift line but i thought it was funny and I think the beat change in the last third of the track is really pretty on the song feedback the ego continues the beat is very noisy it's very dissonant Kanye's flow a little sloppy but it's kind of made up for by how expressive his delivery is and I think on this track he's funny once again I love how just sarcastic and and nasty he is as she's talking about people sleeping on him having a good snooze but still once you dig deeper into the lyrics there are of course more contradictions Kanye saying he's not dictated by money he's not dictated by getting paid which we know that's not true also the idea that hey named a genius that's not crazy the false equivalence right there and then the weird ghetto Oprah skit at the very end of the track run the album instantly goes from batshit insane to completely full of itself on the song lowlights this was a completely unnecessary detour that does nothing other than just try to make this album sound so cool so deep and why do we need a two minute distraction away from a series of tracks that so far just kind of sound like two-minute distractions although I will say on freestyle for Kanye gets so jaw-droppingly abrasive and weird that even though the track is short it did leave an impact on me it's erratic and it's manic I can't help but just be like what the fuck is he doing as she's just kind of shouting what do we fuck right now but if we fucked right now not exactly a song I love but it's a bit of a thrill the I love Kanye freestyle is cute it's a little shot back at the people there saying they miss the old Kanye and while I think Kanye proves a point here in a funny clever way you could point to any number of moments on this project and be like well you know admit maybe this new direction it's not so great like with the off-key singing on the very redundant waves which and I never want to hear this much Chris Brown ever but Kanye continues on this pattern of rejecting outside points of view rejecting other people's opinions much like his buddy Kid Cudi although it doesn't seem to be destroying him in the way that it was on a speeding bullet to heaven or at least not at the same rate because I think you could make the argument that this record over here is kind of destructive and katni does go into that behavior a little bit especially on the song fuck my life which is a super dark moment on this record I love Kanye's lyrics on this track his singing isn't too bad and once able the weekend comes in and gives his vocal performance I would say the song turns stunning the production is minimal it's chilly its frigid and it's one of the few tracks on this record that from front to back are deeply satisfying it has an idea it follows through with it great instrumental good lyrics and it doesn't just detour off into something else at random the song real friends which I have reviewed previously on this channel in context with the rest of the record I think it's the best song here and the song wolves which I'm kind of surprised made it onto the tracklist I never really cared for it although we have a revised version of it over here which Kanye says allegedly he's going to fix maybe this new iTunes version is going to be radically different from this version that we're hearing right now if it is then I'll make another video I'll talk about it a little bit more but as of right now I don't hate this version I mean it's kind of underwhelming the beat could use a little bit more meat on it but I think it puts more focus on Kanye's lyrics which actually aren't that bad here he raps about his mother and about how if she could see him now she'd see that he's totally wild makes comparisons from Christian imagery and from you know wild and and just predatory imagery to his children kind of being born into this world of sin the song facts which again I don't care for the lyrics here all that much but it has an alternate instrumental to which I like a lot more this track seems like a much more even balance between making a statement while also bringing some great music I would actually say the beat is so good I'm willing to have let some of these bars fall into the back of my head and just enjoy Kanye's flow and enjoy the beat the instrumental now is just so much more bombastic noisy it's fun I love the synth horns on this thing and just as the album seems like it's about to end on a somewhat high note we get the song fade which is I think the worst track on the entire thing it kicks off with like this really awkward synth bassline and a really bad early 90s dance music beat with ty dolla sign delivering some painfully awkward vocals not that I think that he's a bad singer or anything I just feel bad he had to sing on this beat and then we have post Malone popping up here very quickly who is just the living cornball the very loud vocal samples that pop up here and there throughout the track are obnoxious and Kanye's presence is barely felt on this track this thing is a mess and it's not really that beautiful of a mess even though it would like you to think it is and I'm sure that there's going to be a Kanye stand out there too who will make the argument that sure there are verses in their tracks on this thing that are bad and they're messy but almost everything on here is messy and because they are good messy moments and there are bad messy moments it's all part of a larger concept that's how it's all supposed to sound it's intentional if that's the revolutionary idea that this record is supposed to be standing on it's kind of late to the party it's been done before this is not Kanye's white album sure it's all kind of messy and you have tracks just crashing into each other but some of them are not that great the parts of this album that are mediocre they're actually mediocre they're not enhanced by the rest of the tracklist the thing is that Kanye doesn't really string them that far out so there's not a big investment on your part as a result they don't really get that annoying and on top of these tracks Kanye is just weird enough just strange enough to keep it kind of intriguing and keep you ah going at it because you know we just want something to gawk at for a little while now I will say there are highlights on this thing fuck my life is great real friends is great no parties in LA is great ultra light beam is great but they're just as many weak spots on this thing the appeal of this record doesn't really rely in the music I think most fans aren't dying to hear yeh make great music as much as they're dying to hear yeh in the raw get it a real authentic just completely unadulterated piece of yeh through an album which is alright for a spectacle which I think that's kind of how you can boil down Kanye's entire past 365 days the Yeezy season 3 event and the promotion of this record his fashion line the fact single yeah it's it's all right for a spectacle I can stare at it for a little while and be like a little weird this is not the sound of a man on the edge this is not ODB this is not David Bowie black star this is Kanye consciously just stirring the emotions and ruffling the feathers of his fans who are just very deeply invested in him and what he's doing and I'm not saying I never been toyed with by a group or an artist that I really like before it's just that after having been annoyed with I was given an album that I thought was really great can't really say that that happened in in this case I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you two best you the best what can I review next Kanye the life of Pablo forever
