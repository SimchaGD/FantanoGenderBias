JboovPNjOXs,hey everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review classic classic rock as a review of Talking Heads remain in late 1980 album legendary new wave and post punk outfit Talking Heads David Byrne Tina Weymouth Chris Frantz Terry Harrison formed in 1975 and they were one of many great bands to play at the legendary New York music club CBGB's which was formerly the stomping grounds of many greats television richard hell the Ramones Patti Smith Sonic Youth the list is endless the place was literally a petri dish for some of the most essential alternative music ever recorded now in their early years Talking Heads sound was a bit of a crossover kind of a bridge between two worlds the band while their music was alternative and had the eccentricities and the risk-taking qualities of punk music they were very in touch with contemporary pop and dance music as well borrowing grooves from the worlds of disco and funk and applying them to some really strange ideas eccentric vocals and lyrics from David Byrne really her key and jerky bass and guitars give a listen to the iconic single psycho killer if you're kind of looking for an example over time the band's music would only get more ambitious bigger instrumentation awesome ballads like the song heaven and eyebrow-raising cover of take me to the river incorporating elements of african music especially into the rhythm section of their music the band's rhythms became smoother more danceable in a way more accessible but still simultaneously david burns vocal performances would also become wilder and this would all come to a head on the band's 1980 record remain in light their most popular studio album which also contained their most significant hit song once in a lifetime and with brian eno on production of roxy music fame he's also had some great solo records ambient works this album would not be assembled in the same way that previous Talking Heads records were the songs on this album are essentially a series of licks and snippets and loops recorded from the band itself and then assembled into these longer compositions and the instrumentals are masterfully assemble as the grooves on this thing really hold water we're talking about a lot of instrumental layers on this thing considering that that many of them are samples that many of them are just chunks of sounds guitars bass vocals and background vocals horns polyrhythms hand percussion since and various sound effects and weird glitchy edits none of this probably sounds all that radical in an age of LCD Soundsystem but when you consider this album came out in 1980 in a musical landscape of Michael Jackson Olivia newton-john sticks air-supply hardcore punk blondie Queen Billy Joel and straightforward synth pop this thing's pretty progressive the grooves on this thing as I said they're flawless their hypnotic their fluid throughout the entire record and the album essentially works in two halves it kicks off with a really explosive visceral start and then eventually knives are made into something way more abstract and Spacey around houses in motion the song born under punches starts the entire record it's a song that is as funky as it is unsettling the track features these pop pronounced bass lines very jerky guitars its clunky its cluttered but it's got a beat to it a really good beat - I also like the little diddling eerie strange guitars that sort of find themselves looping back into the track again and again and again and David Burns lyrics here seem like he's talking about government oppression and pressure to sort of lead a certain life or give in to what the system wants you to do which is not a new lyrical theme for him but it seems like he's approaching it in a more abstract way with these really pronounced proper proclamations I mapped on below and then chilling those out with these very stone-faced refrains as you singing all I want is to breathe there's also a freaky twisted guitar solo on this thing that sounds like it was mangled in a tape machine or something I love the studio trickery that goes into this record there's so much detail in the these linear hypnotic songs and there's also a really cool refrain in the second half that I like a lot I sort of wonder if lyrically it's kind of a play on the idea that the beat goes on but david byrne and company are singing instead the heat goes on and he goes on and the heat goes on the songs cross-eyed and painless and the great curve really turned the heat up intensify the record they deliver some of the tightest speediest beats the dense layers of instrumentation on this thing are awesome the vocals the guitars the poly rhythms the bass the keys and lyrically once again David Byrne sort of goes neurotic much in the way that he was on psycho killer and many other tracks too as he obsesses over lines and shapes and facts underneath David Burns emotional chaos each instrument is sort of just like a little tiny sliver of sound and melody sort of just a very small embellishment that altogether it creates this larger tapestry I just love the layers on this record I love how the Assembly of these sounds comes together especially as the band works in these refrains these vocal refrains that are all thrown on top of each other it's not odd to hear three different refrains being sung over one another at different speeds and paces the great curve is an example of that and lyrically the song is I think going into this idea of being anxious over not completely understanding the world and this is set against imagery of a woman dancing and this woman is being controlled maybe remote controlled it seems like those themes of government control or system control are coming back that were introduced at the intro track and with the song once in a lifetime we have a career-defining groove on this thing I mean it's it's so good boom boom boom and this bassline is just plunged into a sea of just swirling sparkling shimmering arpeggios and the band maintains the beat as they switch from this chorus that is super sweet soulful inspiring almost heavenly and then these very pronounced animated spoken word vocals the comparison has been made before that David Byrne sounds a lot like a preacher on this track and I have to agree it's it's almost as if he's you know telling the crowd something preaching something but but that only kind of comes through in tone of his voice I feel like lyrically the song is a little too abstract and is really just supposed to confuse use an emotionally stir the listener and kind of reflect on the speed of life and how water for example is brought up as a theme in this track is kind of like the current pushing you on to the next stage of life and you can't really control it the album goes dark and introspective on houses in motion david burns vocals turn very soft very quiet spoken word and then he's switching that off with his trademark eccentric yelp ii vocal delivery on the chorus but what really steals the show for me is the really gummy bassline the awesome guitar licks on this track and what sounds like horns just popping up so sporadically in the mix that they're unpredictable almost like glitchy just really interesting sound for this record and for anybody really and the record gets even more cerebral on the song seen and not seen the instrumental is enveloping its watery its psychedelic its vast and the lyrics sound like they're dealing in vanity with a man who is thinking about his facial structure and how he prefers these particular facial structures that he sees on celebrities on magazines and so on and so forth so he's thinking that if he imagines the facial structure that he wants to have in the forefront or in the you know backburner of his mind that he'll eventually have that face it's strange to say the least but that's you know sort of the odd feeling is that a talking head record could bring up and then there's listening wind and it's kind of interesting to see the trajectory of this record I love the flow of this album comparing this track to the first track here we've gone from something that is really complex progressive noisy clunky dense to something much more sparse and primordial this song here in comparison with the earlier portion of the record is like a dream state the track is relaxing it kind of puts me into a lull but it's haunting - and what's even more haunting is the closer here the overload which is super dreary and dystopian the vibe of the song is is almost gothic in a way which makes the tracks stand out like a sore thumb and I guess it's just another moment where the album's flow has to be sort of admired because started off with so much fire and now as it's finishing it's in an incredibly dark place it's not exactly leaving you on a happy ending here but still I love this album it's a great record it's progressive record a it's a forward-thinking album but yet and maybe this is only because you know it's we have hindsight when we're listening to this record it's still so catchy you know it's still so easy to listen to it's so so visceral still so danceable and even the tracks that don't really rely that heavily on a groove and the latter half are engaging at least on a you know a mental level this thing is just a bold eccentric out there statement and I will probably continue to love it and admire it for that for years to come and I can only hope that you're doing that with me with this review it will do I think we're gonna leave it at that classic transition have you get in this album listen I would hope so classic review man I would hope so and if you have did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you the best you the best what should I review next have a good day that's what I say arms will looking sharp sorry sorry guys sorry don't mean to don't mean to flex on yeah yeah forever 
jFSJnr1rktI,hmm hey everyone pink theny pink tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review a classic review in fact of the 1996 Outkast album ATLiens legendary Georgia hip hop duo Outkast big boy Andre 3k we are reviewing their sophomore album right here on the channel a little bit of context this thing comes out a few years after the release of Outkast first full-length album southern playlists ik Cadillac music which was an important album for Outkast not an obscure album for the duo a record that broke them however it was very much steeped in sounds that were trendy for the time that this album was released it was a huge G Funk vibe on the Trekker you could tell that Andre 3ke big boy and organized Noize who handled a lot of the production on this record were hugely influenced by like dr. Dre's the chronic and just G funk from the west coast in general Outkast was still developing their sound and so was much of the south around this time sure you had prominent artists from places like Houston such as the ghetto boys and and Scarface but even these artists were hugely influenced by what was going on on the west and east coast around this time it wouldn't be until a little later where you had these seminal southern artists that not only dropped classics such as UGK and you know also like three 6 mafia and a Balin mgg but ATLiens which dropped 20 years ago this year was a deviation point not only for southern hip hop in general but for Outkast an important deviation point a record that while it wasn't as loaded with hits as quim and I or stank onea definitely not as punchy or as hard-hitting as those records this is the album where Andre 3000 and Big Boi really start to come into their own on the production here we have organized Noize who handled a bulk of the production from Outkast last album and also we of earth-tone ideas or earth-tone three which was just kind of a production moniker for Outkast itself teaming up with mr. DJ and together they would come out with an album that was completely unlike the wave of aggressive hip hop that was coming out of the East Coast and the west coast though I will say Andre and Big Boi maintained that incredibly smooth melodic sound from their debut album which was very g-funk inspired and the smooth grooves and rhythms and very sweet melodies would be taken into a direction on this album that was very laid-back very smokey nocturnal moody kind of mystical with very simple percussion subtle guitars and keys subliminally groovy bass lines topped with these very thoughtful and occasionally clever and cocky lyrics and Andre 3000 and Big Boi showcased better flows on this record too Big Boi is constantly changing his flow up all over this record just always throwing in these triplets all over the place and sort of completely gone is that amateurish appeal of some of the tracks from Outkast first album Andre 3k is coming through as just way more expressive and eccentric he's really animated on this record even on these incredibly subdued tracks I actually think that's what makes many of these songs work even though the beats are incredibly quiet and just not hooky not poppy at all Big Boi and Andre come through with such huge personality that it kind of makes up for it now the whole album kicks off with this you may die intro which features what sounds like these psychedelic ghostly jazz samples hanging in the background gentle acoustic guitars these beautiful harmonized female vocals some spoken-word delivering this prayer in Portuguese right from this very very short intro we know that this is going to be a hip-hop record unlike any other that would drop this year or even really in this decade and then we get into the first full length track a two dope boys which in a lot of ways is kind of like a mission statement not only for the record but just outcasts whole vibe for the next several years the core is talking about how they're surrounded by people who are indulging in destructive behavior whether it be drug use or something like that and this could be people in Andre and big boy zone neighborhood this could be about the whole East Coast versus West Coast thing that was going on at the time but what's important is that in the chorus here it is stated blatantly that amidst all this chaos they just kind of stay in the middle calm and they're dropping bombs lyrical bombs at this point to them the aggression and the machismo of a lot of hip-hop just kind of seems a I don't know a little tired and cliche at this point the verse on this track the Andre delivers toward the back end of the song he seems completely above petty confrontations and he uses this MC who may be imaginary may not who's like challenging him to kind of display you know just another idiot trying to you know getting my craw and Andre essentially doesn't let his aggression and him kind of getting in his face get to him Andre is always coming through a super thoughtful philosophical I can tell that as he's spitting he takes what he's saying super seriously and imagines what he's saying is having some kind of huge influence or impact not in a way where he's sort of stroking his own ego but it's it's almost as if he feels some kind of heavy responsibility with the words that he's putting out and he just doesn't simply want to you know just lead anyone in the wrong direction or set anyone on the wrong path big boy he can get personal too but he's just a little more straightforward he's a little more cocky a little more braggadocious he's funnier he's dropping lyrical gems like on the title track here where he says that he's a cooler than toenails on a polar bear he's just always got these great one-liners and there's just a mess of them all throughout this record meanwhile andre 3000 you go boy asking for that firm of consent right after all that quickly oral stimulation the song wheels of steel is a little bit of a change of pace goes harder than many of the cuts in the tracklist here and feature some fantastic DJ scratching from mr. DJ though Andre 3000 and Big Boi do a fantastic job on this cut it's really his cuts mr. DJ's cuts all over this cut that kind of steal the show in my opinion on the song jazzy Bell which is just a kind of reworded or the word Jezebel Big Boi and Andre 3000 go into the politics of sex with this really dreary sour bassline and these cool hypnotic female vocal leads very easygoing beat and the lyrics deal a lot in that women love promiscuity being abused and used the sex is just kind of taking advantage of one another to get up in those guts in one breath I see it as a little I don't know too eager to police the sexual choices that people make specifically women however it kind of goes with a theme generally on this album and specifically in andré 3000's verses where he kind of gives us this warning to stay away from excess you know not to just simply give it up or just have sex with anyone not to indulge too deeply into drugs and alcohol because as I was saying earlier he feels he has this message that he has to deliver and there are points on this album where he specifically says their points on this album where he blatantly says that he needs to have this message coming out clear so he stays sober the song elevators features this super eerie and nocturnal beat one of many courses on this record that are super subdued these are not glitzy punchy hard-hitting choruses I mean this is an easy going rap album it's very cerebral but again the lyrics on this course and the singing on this course me and you the singing very much reminds me of something that would have turned up I'm like Kendrick Lamar's first couple of records I mean maybe even on one of his latest records I guess what I'm just trying to illustrate here is that at points like this artists like Kendrick Lamar pull a lot of influence from Outkast Kendrick Lamar is one of the many ripples that we can hear today that are as a result of an album like this just dropping so hard into the pool of mainstream music and what's so funny is that even though this song is so quiet and it is so subtle it was a lead single from this album and was actually as high as number 12 on the Billboard charts and I understand why it's not really so much about the beat or about the chorus as much as it is about Andre and Big Boi because again they come through with so much personality and Andres verse on this cut where he goes on about living by the beat like you live check to check it's just such a legendary set of lines that it's been sampled countless times on many hip-hop albums to come his finishing verse deals in how the duo has grown and advanced since the release of their first album and this isn't really the only moment on the record where Andre and Big Boi and whoever else they have on the record sort of address the music industry in some way like for example the song mainstream or on the song Ovid was where Andre compares labels to pimps but they're not fly like blimps like them they fly like blimps and then there are spots on here where Andre and Big Boi get incredibly personal like on the song Babylon where Big Boi goes on about his on and losing her and she was incredibly important and influential to him whereas Andre goes into this verse about his early exposure to cocaine as he was a growing child in the womb there are a lot of passionate telling emotional and important moments on this album like this throughout the entire thing it doesn't really seem like lyrically Andre and Big Boi are trying or putting a lot of thought into what they're saying at any point on the record it's just that so many of these mellow super cerebral tracks stacked on top of one another for almost an hour it does create a little bit of a lull in the tracklisting in my opinion I do wish some of the cuts in the middle point or at least the back half went a little harder sort of like Wheels of Steel you know at least that punchy even though that track again is not like the most hard-hitting hip-hop track on the block however this is a balance that Big Boi and Andre would strike much better on subsequent records and I do get that the whole point and concept of this record in a lot of ways is to be super Spacey is to completely sidestep the overwhelming aggression that was prevalent in much of the hip-hop that was popular around this time which is why this album is so heavily influential to a lot of the spacey abstract superconscious rap that you find today I mean album even mellows out further on the last two tracks like on et where the hook pretty much blatantly puts the music into like I don't know this Spacey backdrop like Andre and Big Boi I imagine their music coming from another world and we also have the closing track which kicks off with this very long spoken word diatribe from big rube where there are a lot of religious undertones in this piece he kind of warns I think of like a godless world and what he sees as pagan onyx lyrically a lot of the themes that Big Boi and Andre circle around on this track have to do with growth and change and sort of where they're going as artists and sort of where they kind of see hip-hop or maybe their hometown going as a community and we also have the little growing old mini verse at the very end of the track which to me just kind of makes Andre seem like he's like two albums in and he's just I don't know almost portraying himself as being way too artsy and mature for this world that he's kind of put himself and placed himself in as a hip-hop artist which is again kind of a theme that's run throughout a lot of outcasts songs and albums I mean right from the intro track of their next album return to the G we have bars like big boy talking about a you know he doesn't want to deal with any of this G shit he just wants to hang out with his daughter blowing bubbles and just like you know be a good dad which again I think is another reason that Outkast is such an important group because they made incredibly significant influential important landmark hip-hop records and they did it while completely detouring away from a lot of the pettiness that dominates a lot of hip-hop culture and in a way creating an outlet and another lane for any other artists who wants to get into the genre and create music just simply for the art sake and not only with this album did Andre 3000 and Big Boi just give us great music and a great record but they've also kind of you know given us a bit of a handbook and and proof that that is possible you know you don't need to sell your soul and you don't need to give up what you see is kind of your ethics or really what matters to you deeply in life in order to make music that speaks to people that sounds great and I think I'm going to just end the review there because essentially those those things really are just the the power that this album holds I hope that you have given this record oh listen if you haven't please use this review as an excuse and an opportunity to listen to it and the rest of Outkast discography as well I hope you're doing good transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hit what would you rate it uh eat your fruits and vegetables and drink some goddamn water stay hydrated forever 
DvlnYSvvqpU,am i green screening over here yes does my shirt have green in it and it's going to get caught in the in the chroma key yes who gives a fuck you know fuck it that's kind of the ethos behind this record hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of Captain Beefheart and his magic band trout mask replica singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist and poet the good Captain Beefheart one of rock music's true eccentrics and his unique personality every shred of it came through in his music almost to an idiosyncratic fault he's an artist whose previous work I admire quite a bit his debut record with the magic band lit my decals off maybe dock at the radar station his 1980 record where he was still wild as hell but trout mask replica is probably his most widely known record and it's a pretty polarizing album too it's not one of these classic albums that just has across-the-board critical and fan acclaim it's not really the kind of album that elicits a mild reaction in my personal experience listeners of this album fall somewhere on this binary either they are hit with pure euphoria and they somehow get or understand the intricacies and the genius of this album or you're going to think this thing is just total bullshit there are a lot of albums that over time lose their potency and that may be because the bands are no longer around anymore and they're irrelevant the ideas and the sounds that they were putting forward are no longer trendy or inventive or cutting-edge as they have now kind of grown old and numerous artists that have followed them have kind of repeated those ideas so they no longer sound fresh or innovative to newer listeners but this is still an album that without a doubt I could show to numerous people who've never heard of it young and old and I will most likely get the response of what are they doing and again even though I do say that people fall very hard on either one side or the other side of this fence I personally do feel somewhat in the middle here I do admire this record for its bold experimentation howl for its time it was incredibly cutting edge and riding the fringes along with artists like Frank Zappa who Captain Beefheart was a frequent collaborator with him a Velvet Underground can and despite this record being 50 years old we've had about 50 years of music after this record a few artists have actually stepped to the level of freakishness or even surpassed it what Captain Beefheart and his van presents here believe me only a few records kind of come to mind here like maybe a Scott Walker bish Bosch there's just so much to take in here from the disorienting instrumentation much of the time the bass the guitars the drums don't even feel like they completely match or sync up it's like each it straight is playing its own song and they just all happen to be on the same recording as you get sometimes these different wailing guitars in each channel and bass and drums that just hate each other so much they just do not get along on the tempo and when there is some harmony and some cohesion in the mix here there's so much tension that it's almost like begrudging and feeling even more out of place is Beefheart himself on these instrumentals he was clearly added after the mayhem and he doesn't so much participate in the insanity that the instrumentation brings as much as he just kind of does a funny lyrical jig on top of it the vocals are mixed so high on most of these tracks that beef heart just drowns the instrumentation out especially since his vocal performances are very expressive they're loud they're raspy even when you try to listen past what he's doing and actually make sense if you even can of what the instrumentation is doing your attention is just instantaneously going to veer back to beef heart because he's just so here and his performances are so wild and so uncontrolled on these songs I bet you could probably switch vocal performances from one track to another HAC and the results would be mostly the same still mad still out of his mind still cacophonous still all over the place again you cannot just take your ears off of the dude he has the rasp of a dirty street beggar who has a chain-smoking problem and swigs rubbing alcohol to pass the time and the imagery in his lyrics are either weird abstract allusions or allusions to sort of tropes and lyrical cliches from roots and blues music like on the song china peg there are numerous lyrics on here that are so random and unpredictable and just so nonsensical so many non sequiturs that this album surely is like the earliest or one of the earliest examples of music memes as undoubtedly among the band themselves and among this album's earliest fans I'm sure there were numerous lyrical moments that could have just been repeated and in laughed at until the end of time fast and bulbous neon meat dream of an octa fish another reason I have to respect this record are the countless artists and albums that Beefheart and this album would go on to influence and I also like the fact that this record is a loud and an explosive reminder of hey let's break the rules the rules don't matter we don't gotta follow these will smash everything and in the recording and the writing process of this album I can imagine the incredible difficulty especially in 1969 of trying to market sell and just make an album that is this dissonant and goes this far in this hard against the rules of traditional rock blues and jazz music we're talking about musicians here who can play coherent songs and can write coherent songs and have had years of playing in a band and practice and now they're kind of breaking all of that apart avoiding all that training and trying to make something that makes almost no sense and you've also got to take into account that the brain favors very much patterns and predictability in music so they're also working against that natural tendency to employ patterns into the songs that they're writing and patterns and grooves and harmony and musical coherence does show up on this record at points but you can tell even when it does the band is trying their hardest to fight against it or sour it or like mutate it in some kind of way so this record is so horrifyingly unpleasant that it's almost admirable it's like awe inspiring so that's kind of style of this record that's the sound of this record that's in a sense a little bit of the context of this record which i think is bulletproof you know this album has earned its pedestal in the history of modern music but when it comes to my visceral emotional reaction when listening to this album I kind of swing back and forth between this is alright to outright hatred this thing is 80 minutes that is too long and this thing gets really annoying really fast and believe me I know that and I have known that for a very long time which is why this is the first time I force myself to listen to this thing all the way through in a long time I hate the mixing on this record when there is mixing because some of the checks here just like weird noisy lo-fi detours that just and even on the tracks that aren't particularly loaf I I just kind of giggle at the idea that there was a producer and an engineer involved in the recording process of this project this album makes Velvet Underground's white light/white he sound like a big-budget production there's so much on this record that I guess in a way I could call filler that is if the other tracks on here didn't feel or sound equally as messy or just nonsensical I find a lot of this albums experiments to be kind of goofy and obnoxious and childish I find the more studied playing and the more muscular playing and the more intricate experiments of a band like King Crimson like on larks tongues and aspect for example to be way more intriguing also when it comes to experimental rock in this era I'd rather to listen to I don't know some Zappa or just other Beefheart records the musical tornado on this album the only people who are truly in on it were the people who helped make this recording everybody else just has to kind of look at it perplexed or just kind of feel dumb listening to it because there's some kind of depth to it that they don't understand but maybe that's just kind of a shortcoming of the average music listener or the average art patron who seems to think that there has to be a meaning that there has to be some kind of you know significant thought behind everything which is clearly not the case here I mean that there are so many absurd moments on this record and Captain Beefheart and companies seem well aware of the absurdity when I do enjoy this album and occasionally I do I found the best way to approach it is with a very strong and absurd sense of humor especially since captain be far and his band we're so focused on making something so wildly different that this could almost be categorized as a novelty record you can't listen to tracks like Big John sets up or little moments like the the Rocket Morton sketch on this thing and not hear that there's a very intentional sense of humor to this record now there are spots though that I think are legitimately interesting or cool where the instrumentation smoothes out a little bit and I hear maybe a few cool riffs or dissonant guitar harmonies or some off-kilter grooves or maybe I'm just kind of charmed in a way by Beefheart's insane morbid hilarious ramblings like on frown land or sweet sweet bulbs or moonlight in Vermont which in a way I think is one of the more coherent tracks on the record my human gets me blues is probably as proto as proto-punk gets and i also think this track has one of Beefheart's most electrifying performances on the entire thing I like the track Dolly's cars kind of a standalone dissonant guitar piece the moments where we just get beef hearts vocals on this LP weird me out a little bit there are plenty of interesting ideas that I could pull out of this thing and take kind of seriously but doing that is kind of the like just just shoving your hand into a pricker bush and trying to pull gems out only to just make your fists and your arm bloody in the process looking for moments on this record to kind of just dissect out of the context of the greater cacophony is just not how to enjoy this album even if you know enjoying the tracker from beginning to end is even possible this isn't really a record to scratch your chin to and go hmm yes you loo it's so deep this thing is a shit show and it's it's very much self-aware of that shit show we miss of it and if there is something I can say about the tracker that I do like consistently from beginning to end I like how overwhelming it is and I like how over stimulating it is to the point where like it just fries my brain it's so loud it's so colourful it's so obnoxious it's so just dizzying and unsettling that you can't really put it on and do anything else which is something unique about this album it's sort of sours just any atmosphere it comes into contact with and becomes the focal piece this isn't really something that you can just kind of put on as a little bit of mood music as you don't know like the assemble a puzzle this is very demanding music and it's not particularly music that once you start giving it your full attention it just instantaneously becomes gratifying and fulfilling you know it's kind of like inviting a hundred parrots into your room very crazy parrots all on their respective perches just going fast and bulbous so let it be known that uh uh what this album brings to the table is is not what your average album brings and while it might not always be sweet the tongue or the ears or even digestible as if this record were food and you had to consume the whole thing I imagine a great deal of it would be thrown up later still though a unique experience can't deny that unique experience and you know sometimes that's really what classic records are all about because even when that unique experience might not be particularly good it may go on to leave a huge impact on a lot of listeners a lot of artists who go on to make a piece of art or enjoy a piece of art in a way that they would not have before just because they came into contact with a little piece of madness like this those are my thoughts on this record thank you for watching this review you're the best Captain Beefheart transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it you're the best thank you bye forever 
TqiY1YR4X-o,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and in this video I'm doing something that I don't typically do I'm responding to an article I read online something that has kind of been bugging me as of late is just kind of the quality of music writing that I find on the internet on major music publications specifically a lot of the think pieces that I see dropped and and this one really is so horrendously bad that it really is the straw that broke the camel's back not just Nazis all genres have always been safe spaces for white people this is the dumbest shit I've ever read for one thank you to the good people over at fusion for this this amazing failure of an article let's get into the meat of this thing for one our writer in this article doesn't really have much of a point so she spends half of the article explaining what the alt-right is Richard Spencer that total douchebag and his ilk she has to go into deep detail sort of drawing background about these people just to kind of lo the reader into this sense that she knows what she's talking about so that she can make the gigantic logical leap to sort of hook the alt-right on to alternative genres specifically alternative rock yes simply because all right has the prefix alt in front of it that means that it's worthy of comparison to alternative rock also I'm totally confused about the titling of this thing when I look at this thing on google it says all genres have just been safe spaces for white people but when I actually look on the page on the website not just Nazis is also worked into the title I can tell the fusion really wanted to put up an article with the word Nazi in it just to make it a little more click Beatty our writer also cites this over or under note so that seems to make a stink about the fact that alternative rock radio stations never really played all that much hip-hop which seems like such an out-of-touch point to make so out of touch that I actually assumed this article had been written in 2016 by a millennial who didn't understand how radio programming used to work but in fact this article actually dropped in 1999 like Public Enemy got about as much play on alternative rock radio stations as Weezer did on rap radio stations and that doesn't make power 105 a safe space for hip-hop fans come on what are you stupid also even at this point in rap radio history Public Enemy was not getting all that much play I mean they had already moved on to Biggie and Tupac the hardcore hip-hop movement the gangsta rap movement artists of the late 90s like DMX maybe a little Eminem - and then we get this weird paragraph about how alt-country kind of separated off from country but of course country being a predominantly white jean rrah our our writer here doesn't really have a point although she does seem to tease out this idea that all country was more for hip urbanites which seems kind of like a dig like ooh it was just a hip urbanite genre when i mean who do you think the audience for this article is going to be and then she tries to make the same point about alternative rap which is a term that not really many people have ever used I mean sure conscious hip hop which he says in this article a lot of people back in the day used to just call it backpack rap at this point I think our writer has lost her train of thought and maybe she even knows it as she says that a conscious hip-hop or alternative rap was basically a place for music listeners who had discomfort with the political sensibilities of an artist like Tupac are you fucking kidding me there dozens of conscious rappers whose politics are way more radical than that of Tupac and yet they were celebrated by white and black audiences alike how you could just kind of characterize conscious hip-hop fans as people who can't handle Tupac I don't know but and also the writer brings up alternative R&B which you would think that this would be her basically disproving her point that alternative genres are just safe spaces for white people I mean for alternative R&B it's not even a predominantly white genre in terms of artistry and audience some of the biggest alternative R&B artists include Miguel and Frank Ocean and Anderson PAC sure you have your James Blake's and your Jamie wounds and so on and so forth but the whole label of safe space for white people doesn't exactly apply here nor does it to an ocean of other alternative genres and the elephant in the room that's not being talked about here that I have to add to this video is that our writer doesn't address Punk not one time throughout this entire article despite it being the alternative genre of alternative genres where artists of color thrived for decades I'm not really sure what to say about this article I mean bling ignorance toward the history of music bling ignorance toward the way that people actually consume music blatant ignorance to who is actually consuming the music complete inability for the writer to prove her point because she can't really apply it to that wide of an array of situations and a lot like that knuckleheaded unbearable whiteness of indie article that dropped on pitchfork a little while ago this thing is just beating a dead horse when was the last fucking time an alternative rock radio station actually had any sway on what the masses are listening to when was the last time that alternative rock was actually a cultural force in the music world our author also kind of erases the existence in the history of music fans who didn't happen be white but actually enjoy these alternative genres artists who worked in these alternative genres who might have played on these alternative rock radio stations but weren't all in fact white she sort of writes Rage Against the Machine off as a white band she doesn't mention system of down she doesn't mention living color she doesn't mention Hootie and the Blowfish I don't know and she also neglects to mention that the very people who listened to these alt rock radio stations in the 90s and into the 2000s most likely had figures like Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix immortalized in blacklight posters on their walls as teenagers so I don't know this article is really just crap painting music fans as racist and connecting them to dickheads like Richard Spencer just so you can make a little ad revenue it's kind of shitty so yeah that has been my take on this crappy article transition what did you think of this article if you've given it a read did our writer have a point did you agree did you disagree what were the your biggest points of contention over the moments you really agreed with let me know also all sorts of links next to my head other videos you can check out subscribe to the channel official website and that's it I hope everyone has a good day Trevor 
ktFcXYmy2Fc,a little bit of hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is it is time for my highly anticipated review of this new on the Jules album run a Jules best LP and killer Mike beloved hip hop duo on their third full-length commercial effort together which they saw fit to a drop early on Christmas as a download the physical is coming out in 2017 and I'm not flying solo on this review not only is this a highly anticipated review but this is a highly anticipated combination collaboration conversation with a true original in the YouTube music reviewing community mr. big quint we've been talking for a long time about hey what are we going to do a review together when we going to do a video together and it just seems like this album over here was the most appropriate moment to make it happen so we're just going to be shooting the shit talking about this record talking about its pros its cons what we love but we didn't love and giving some final thoughts on it at the end and that's it guys so let's get into that conversation transition and here we are finally through the magic of the internet linking up for a long anticipated collaboration review when I told people we were going to do this we're freaking out oh man I'm telling you I'm telling you now it needed to happen and I say needed happen you know I'm waiting for do this for a while so you know got it happen now right on time you know so you've you've already heard the record you know oh yeah you already have your thoughts on it this is going to be a full reaction or anything like know you know though people anticipate that on your chance that's coming oh yeah that's coming so well sure we'll be talking about just afterthoughts basically what you and I thought of the record yeah give me your general opinions what did you think about this album how did this album hit you what are you anticipating from this record and did it did it deliver well first of all listening to the last two run the jewels albums I'm expecting a certain sound a certain energy of course yeah and I got to tell you I got to tell you Anthony this this might be my favorite one she got favorite of the three out of the three yes but just just that energy is still there man it is it is just such a it's a treat man it's true it's crazy to see you know LP and kill a mic in their you know their their chemistry throughout this thing man it's just it's basically they found that that groove now you know and it's just like it's everything that I expect it to be and just a little bit more and it just like the messages came right on time you know just what the uh was it a social commentary the political aspect of it as well as when they were talking about was just really well done on their part on both killer Mike and LPS part and just a production it's just in fucking sane it just it's crazy as far as um political commentary this is definitely the project of the three that is oh yeah the most with oh yeah oh yeah for sure don't get captured to Thebes into a twenty one hundred oh yeah then kind of um a little bit on everybody stay calm and oh mama and circling back to that a really big way on the closing track to yeah yeah what I was like who you master yeah that's revolutionary shit there man I was unreal unreal yeah they were trying to push that revolutionary angle on ya these lyrics here first oh yeah oh sure you know meanwhile that that's really a lot of the second half of the record for the first record it's really just kind of like run the bases yeah exactly they get exactly just you know kicking the raps man it was funny you know witty all the book I mean killing Mike in LP just doing what they do best man it scene is just just killing the game man killing the game had me cracking up and just with the of course the production would LP and his group manages it's crazy is a crazy mix you know and they have that you know that that that that sound you know that signature sound it's not like some regular ol like trap shit it's like it's definitely a run to Jules type of sound that I'm used to at this point yeah it's maybe see it's heavy it's very authentic it's definitely a banger quality to it but it's not like just anybody else's banger that are out there today you know a definitely exact zone sound it has some groove it has some vibe yeah oh I will show that the first half of the record to me was near flawless the exception of the intro track yeah it was very columns like it was very like you know it was very comfy you know intro track to run the jewels to was not like this hard-hitting like we're fun it's just you know guns blazing from the gates but it was dark heavy kind of ominous song you know it was like down I feel like really kind of failed to set any kind of tone you know wow it's kind of felt like a spacey kind of non track but then when talked to me started that to me really fast yeah that was intro that that was the fucking intro third album it like went down he was talking about of course you know going through um you know just he could have fell off they both could have fell off but you know you know overcoming and I guess it's kind of like an like it I don't know a prelude to what's gonna come I guess I don't know what you can even call it that but it's basically a very calm moment and probably only calm moment on the album I mean once it takes off it takes off and it does it stop oh it's crazy it does in the first moment where it's like I mean talk to me and legend has it great tracks don't run the jewels oh yeah to their strengths at this point alien it's not really for the first half of this record nothing too experimental or adventurous they're just kind of giving you what they do best but then when call to curtain comes in that's really weird beat for them don't you think it yeah right kind of busiest it's really Nettie there's like a lot going on it kind of reminded me of like some I don't like some Timberland type of shit like Missy Elliott's I've shared as far as just how the appreciations were going and stuff it's just it had that energy to it I actually would love to see that like live honestly that would be kind of nuts but yeah it's just like this weird like switch up in it I loved it I loved that you know that's right yeah it definitely added like some good diversity to the first yeah parse or Kurd then we had hey kids with Danny Brown which was a campaign yeah that opening line yeah my Twitter page which was really sick yeah said he's a word architect and he arcs the tech and any party yeah neck oh yeah I thought like a good Alec gently out of like eternal rhymes in one bar that was sick as for sure for sure it was indeed indeed ready they did a damn good job of that one like this that little was an example of the beginning kind of summed up how I felt that oh my god this is crazy yeah that's what I felt the shit out of that because I was thinking oh my god it's just everybody stop and it doesn't of course no I lost my shit I lost my shit I mean shortly after you feel that way that's when like the album sort of falls into that kind of low and gets kind of yeah oh yeah things down a lot I mean our gold is a decent track I mean there are some cuts on here and that is one of them where it just kind of feels like wow there's a player to your strengths it is a little deja vu in a way huh for sure for sure but absolutely don't get captured comes in like the tone really changes like it's not yeah mess that they get political it's then the beats get way more Spacey and yes it yak - yeah and arias yeah what did you think about them sort of going down that road in general do you think they did it as well as they could have done it taking a more moody angle with their song absolute the fact that the jewels is like typically this aggressive regress yeah children oh I think they did a good job of painting a picture you know as far especially with LPS first on that track but it's like it seemed like he's kind of taking like in the perspective of a police officer that's you know that's kind of you know crooked in a way I guess you could say that was that was really like it was kind of disturbing but it was it works you know as far as what type of picture they were trying to you know paint they keep going like throughout you know what said with that one and then thieves and did I was like 2100 they kind of you know hold that kind of life you know it's like if it like a dire situation and that's why I think what they're trying to you know paint it's a really fucked up situation you know that's going on and you know lyrically I really liked those tracks especially with what they were doing on thieves because thieves know track that to me was probably the most well thought-out and console you lyrics you know oh yeah oh yeah with that this picture of how the news media portrays oh yeah but we're sort of rioting and responses to and profit from this brutality that they're rapping yeah their songs oh yeah you know but like I'm not sure if like LPS production really lent itself to this more easygoing moody Spacey style you know especially with the bass lines kind of being I don't know a little uninspired just like kind of ascending descending just a couple notes and it's like uh you know yeah it's like you guys are still trying to put together something boo me and and and laughs but also shook trying to be moody at the same time and it's like I feel like they could have like um I don't know I think they kind of workshop it a little bit more because I think the song Thursday in the Danger Room with Kumasi Washington's horns yeah and on that check that was definitely a great example of them going short direction we also think everybody stay calm was a great example of them going that yeah there was little mood yeah little yes be and 2262 you know who I love hearing boots on that track again you know his vocals you know do add a ton of melody to that track you know whenever he does collaborate with them I was kind of surprised to see oh they're going back to boots again you know for a new project but like once I heard the song I was like yeah you know it makes sense it's yeah they work together well yeah for sure for sure I think that um I think what this the strongest aspect of those tracks are is basically the narrative and what they're trying to push and honestly that's that was okay for me you know I'm saying as far as just how the beats a good suffers you know are kind of different and kind of Moody but I think it's a part of that picture that they're trying to push you know and it makes sense to me at least that'll make sense the the song Panther like a panther that song sir yes out in the second half because it yet got kind of like you know Cheney goes medical it's like it goes back when you use these moodier tracks for too long no how did that song strike you sort of at this point on the album well for one I realized that Trina was on it which is hella random to be like Trina that's crazy you know fucking Trina it I mean she's not like wrapping it and she's on the hook but it's cool though it was really cool it's like a nice little break from the yield of doom and gloom I guess you could say yeah but I'll you know it works it fits in it in its you know in the against consistency of the project itself hmm no I mean I think it's a good change of pace like you just said although it is another one of those moments where it just kind of hits me is like okay you guys aren't really like pushing forward or anything at this point it's just kind of feels yeah another like song that could have been on run the jewels too you know and that's the thing there are a couple tracks on here that to me felt like they could just snugly fit into that album um you know especially uh kill your masters with the Zack de la Rocha yeah although yeah probably the one moment on the record where the lyrics get the most revolutionary yeah no shit oh god yeah massive and yeah I don't know it's like a report to the shareholders was probably another moment where I didn't care for the production as much right right the weird kind of switch up from one beat to another because it is kind of like a two-part track yeah was really interesting to me you know sort of like in the way that down didn't feel like the the most necessary intro like me didn't really fit as the most necessary outro it almost felt like the beautiful horns and kind of the the finality of Thursday in the danger room also also like felt like a closer to me you know it was also like talk to me was it was the opener and Thursday was the closer and I wouldn't get rid of kill your masters I think it's a great absolutely not but yeah it could have fit like in the first half easy and could have actually brought that revolutionary vibe throughout the whole record that's probably an option I actually kind of like the placement of ugh was like a ambassador but if anything I would have probably have cut it into a certain like an actual separate track itself and not have to be after you know share order if you know if anything but honestly yeah it fits I think best probably in the second half just to end on that kind of you know that high note really yeah so actually I like that aspect you know definitely you know because I have to kind of at least be a little critical of the record I mean those are crucial issues with the record but oh yeah all those issues I feel like I am being at least a little nitpicky because I mean everything that's been good about run the jewels up until this point boom which carries over onto this record oh yeah man like oh yeah the chemistry between LP and killer Mike which to me really kind of reached its apex on run the jewels to ingest is good here you know on the furniture to kind of felt like they were still getting used to each other but on the second one it was just like flames and on this yeah yeah they really kind of tried to show how dynamic they could be like she really could still like drop another run the jewels to a collection of Iglesia tracks that makes it hard but oh yeah given you know there were a few moments on the last record where it seemed like they were trying to make some political points and no songs did do pretty well like especially with that an incredible music video they did with that song with Zack de la Rocha with yeah sort of that black-and-white film of the yes or in the guy sort of you know in endless battle mm-hmm it's like they really tried to go down that political route further which yeah you know is sort of a in a way could be very natural because of sort of how political killer Mike is on his own for sure oh yeah yeah going down that road wouldn't be weird for them at all nah not at all so again it seems like they're trying to show how dynamic they can be on here um and for the most part I would say they definitely succeeded yes men me too absolutely absolutely they did a damn good job in the aspect so I mean as far as the lyrics and the production it's like again it's just really much just really very much a continuation of run the jewels to in terms of the quality personality wit you know humor yeah LP and killer Mike - yep shine through again yes indeed what was that one line that LP said about like kids roasting s'mores over like the crotches of his enemies or something yeah Oh hilarious yes he had a bunch of them actually been oh he was uh he was on I was one um Stay Gold yeah one that stuck out to be a lot when he said I was like piss on power golden shower if it's some crazy shit man just he just kept going on this scheme of just you know gold which was just kind of tight to be you know really cool yeah that's you know that's what he does awesome he like grabs a concept or grabs an idea at the beginning of a verse and just sort of like go he just it's like a gauntlet of references today I'm telling you a idea that what big it's so first like he's really excellent at that I'm telling you man Oh telly hmm so I mean outside of that uh so again well you know this is like the best of the three records in European yes indeed so what sort of inches this album beyond run the jewels to in your opinion you know is it well variety is it political sort of charged I think it's it's the variety and the they're like the political charge like I'm saying like they're the pushing up towards us narrative that needs to be talked about you know and I think that they did a good job at doing it I kind of had a feeling that kill him I was gonna go this route because you know he's been in the news lately you know and I just felt that you know their chemistry and their two different points of view kind of you know it kind of shines through on album on you know shedding light on to this situation you know with politics and you know the government and you know what's in the situation that are going on today you know just with police brutality and you know the police shootings and the riots and what-have-you so I think they did a good job that actually you know pushing force that narrative you know in a way when it doesn't really come off as preachy but just kind of just you know showing you know people what's going on and you're talking about it yeah it doesn't really come off as too preachy and I would say that Thebes is probably the one track where it seems like the flows come off really clunky especially with how you have one line come out and then there's like a line being set in the background sort of in that yeah yeah it's kind of quality yeah like they just had a lot to say on that song like and it's it's like a really intense thing to try to talk about and all yeah Jon would track that explains it well right oh so it's like there are obviously moments on here where the that challenge I think got the best of them a little bit but yeah like songs like 2100 and we stay calm and kill your masters still come on like really fluidly really naturally they don't come off preachy you know and just sound like just as good in his quality and it's hard-hitting and as instantaneous as any run the jewels track that we've enjoyed so far show Michelle definitely what I like oh god what were you going to say I was going to talk about I like the fact that I was named killer Michael in 2100 when he was talking about the situations even though you know he's painting a really downward you know spiral of chaos really he's basically saying you know you still gotta keep hope alive basically type of deal because if in fact you know you lose hope then I guess you know evil takes over you lose itself is based yeah which is it's you know just those like little simple things that are in this are in these tracks it kind of you know they kind of kids home with me you know me um so tell me what your uh your final thoughts are on this record you know like you would you know in your reaction because obviously yours yeah for this video for show yeah Bansal my final verdict is simple BAM uh the beats are there um the lyrics are there killing Mike LP got this crazy mystery okay um I love the political aspect of this album I love the fact that you know they are pushing forth their own there to this well and some of these tracks with uh what's that um was it Thursday in the Danger Room mm-hmm that was really that was some deep stuff man talking about you know losing them a friend rather till you know violence or also losing a friend you know because of illnesses you know from LPS perspective I really love the fact that they're pushing out the wrong little stories there too and you know teaching people you know are showing people how they would cope with the situation also forgiving people that may have you know killed their loved ones I love the fact that you know they show they're very dynamic in this one as well so I'd say very simple simple enough if you've actually watch if you listen to uh run the jewels wanted to and you love those that I guarantee you're gonna love this one so I say the people who have listed run the jewels one run to us to go ahead cop this album for sure for those who haven't listened to run the jewels go ahead listen to running two is one and one through em burn the jewels to see how you like those and definitely go ahead and check out running jewels three and for those who may not like LP and kill them I for whatever reason that maybe I still say go ahead and give this a listen for sure definitely give us a listen there's some tracks on here that you may like definitely okay for me uh this is to me just as quality has run the jewels to but just don't go into this album expecting a similar experience you know this is a more mature album this is a more thoughtful album at points this is a more contemplative album you know it's a more cerebral record again it's not just that relentless high-octane hard-hitting you know explosion happening in the background as LP and killer Mike are flying in slow motion forward at you sort of experience that run the jewels to is you know there's some serious very serious topics sort of being explored and talked about in the second half of this album and sometimes you know I think killer and Mike a killer Mike and LP go through some growing pains trying to express some legitimate feelings and thoughts on these issues you know and even if I think these songs occasionally do falter in a musical way or actual way the lyrics are there the narratives are there the performances you know the emotional performances and everything are definitely there you know so I can't take that away from them at all you know and actually like there were some songs that once I read deeper into what was being said they sort of clicked a little bit more than they did initially when I was like oh this one kind of sounds weird to them you know weird for them you know for the most part the first half of the record you know with the exception of the intro which I for whatever reason no matter how many times I listen to this record it just seems more and more unfitting as the intro track on the first half of the record is great it's just one hard-hitting song after another there's not really a song or a moment I would take away from this album as being like totally lackluster or unnecessary other than just kind of like a few spots at the very beginning and the very end so you know it's just like another quality record from run the jewels in my opinion and you know they continue to sort of push forward the envelope of hardcore hip-hop you know there aren't too many artists out there who are taking hardcore hip-hop and you know because this in a lot of ways is hardcore hip-hop when you look at the the the lyrical content here when you look at the political content when you look at the the sort of emotion that the beats try to evoke out of the listener like this is hardcore hip-hop all the way and yet it sounds nothing like anything hardcore hip-hop has done up until this point you know and that's been all run the jewels one run out a little to run the jewels three while this album in some respects may seem a little safe for them because they've kind of established this sound and they're sticking to it on this record for the most part they're doing it as quality as they would you know on run the jewels to and on run the jewels one you know so this is by far not a disappointment at all what I loved him to push the envelope a little bit more sonically sure but they definitely did politically and they definitely did narrative wise on this record this to me is easily you know like a strong 7 to a light 8 definitely to be one of the better hop hip hop records of well I mean it's obviously one of the best better hip hop records of 2016 you know sure I am sure that they came out gladness at the tail end of the year so this is probably just going to end up on my 2017 list off big so uh because err I already came out with my 2016 list yeah you know as a lot of people have pointed out you know they're like Anthony what are you gonna do they already came out with a doctor advised your whole list now you totally fucked up dude you didn't well tell I'll tell you I waited in um I think it'll probably end up somewhere in there maybe we'll see we'll see good but uh yeah I'll definitely enjoy the shattered his album man I love this one this is a really good job okay man yeah well that has been our review of this record thanks for coming Oh talking with me about it man oh man not a problem any time any time all right I got a good win big quint

IAHgAEpNF5I,ah hi everyone not again theny not again tan oh dear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kid Cudi album passion pain and demons slain Ohio native rapper multi-instrumentalist songwriter singer Kid Cudi a man whose recent musical works in my opinion have been some of the the biggest blunders of the decades so far specifically that wizard album and that indicud album and especially speeding bullet to heaven Cuddy's failed attempt at 90 minutes of Kurt Cobain worship and grunge pastiche Kid Cudi's last album was so lackluster that this new one could not be anything else but better it had to be better couldn't have been worse there's no possible way and thankfully of my presumptions ended up being true this is a superior album to speeding bullet to heaven primarily because it's not like on the outset Kid Cudi is reaching for something that is is really beyond his grasp maybe with the exception of the song releaser on this album which just kind of sounds like a bad Portishead revision but even though on this album Kid Cudi is not failing miserably at something that he's not really all that skilled at this is still an album that contains many of the same flaws that have plagued a lot of Cuddy's recent work there are songs on this thing that lack any semblance of structure or progression the instrumentals just kind of are cut and paste they repeat the same musical phrases and ideas and rhythms again and again and again as Kid Cudi just kind of directionless Li vocalizes and moans to his heart's content for about four minutes or so like the song swim in the light which basically sounds like one four-minute long intro that never really progresses into anything else and there are other cuts on this thing that are similarly similar for nearly every minute that the song spans frequency all in mature nature and the song dance for eternity Kid Cudi has this bad tendency on this album to stretch like a minute in 30 or 2 minutes of ideas to 4 or 5 minutes then there are the lyrics on this record which most of the time feign emotional depth but they're usually as redundant as the song structures and instrumentals that they're plugged into Cuddy even gives off some crazy creepy psycho ex-boyfriend vibes on the song distant fantasies although this track may not be as weird as the end of the song the guy where you can hear Kid Cudi simulating some sex breathing in the middle of delivering the bars on the final verse of this song and then there's Kid Cudi's ridiculous humming and singing voice which for whatever reason recently has become hip to clown despite the fact that his singing has been excruciating ly subpar for years now points on this thing where he sounds goofy are abound like on tracks such as wounds where you can hear them singing dip dip burp and of course there are countless moments on this record where Kid Cudi is is blatantly off-key and of course there are at least several songs on this album where Kid Cudi reaches a new level of corny and lazy when it comes to the chorus is on this thing like on the song by design where of course Kid Cudi has to make a some kind of play on words relating to interior design a saying don't fuck with the feng shui and don't fuck with bungs where and oh fuck what the bungs way then with the song commander we might have Kid Cudi's most lyrically anemic hook yet he just kind of says no no no no no yeah no no no no no yeah and the song the kitchen not only can I not resist a song that rhymes mission and kitchen but also just the idea of staying out of the kitchen because this person can't stand the heat of your love and once again on a new album Kid Cudi fails to render the project down to its most essential tracks this is another 90 minute project and it didn't need to be there clearly subpar tracks in the track listing here they're clearly duds he even repeats a few features despite the fact that one of the two features with Audrey 3000 as well as Pharrell clearly outshine the other having said all that this is still an improvement so let's try to see the silver lining in this cloud shall we for one passion pain and demon slaying sees an uptick in dance grooves for some reason and these actually play pretty well too Cuddy's strengths his singing and his songwriting style on this record because if we're going to get locked into maybe one or two ideas they might as well be backed up with the danceable beat and a catchy synth phrase like on the song by design love the groove here in andré 3000's many little lyrical moments on this record actually break the song up nicely and give the track some natural structure the song surfing with Pharrell was a track that I loved from the moment Cudi T's toured this album with it not only is Cuddy's vocal delivery his performance on this track way more animated than many of the tracks that preceded it but I also love the instrumental on this song the rhythm as well as the synth horn leads kind of have an African flair to them and the verses and course is on this track are more defined than they are on much of the record and I love how lavished some of the instrumentals on this album are the horn sections and and strings on the song Rose golden with Willow Smith are actually pretty nice these very same string sections turn dramatic on the song does it and then the string sections turn so active and nimble and melodically dense on the song kitchen that it's almost forgivable that the verses on this track are under written nonsense and lovers cliches and the song allusions has kind of a weird synth Odyssey interlude in the middle of the track and I love the way that these very steady patient arpeggios color the background of the back half of the song so there are moments where it seems like Kid Cudi is making more of an effort to structure his songs a little bit more add more detail it's just not most of the time and I would prefer it to be most of the time and generally I would say this album as far as a kid Cuddy's Cuddy ism's it is a tad more tolerable than a lot of his recent material has been again this album is better than Kid Cudi's past few records but it is still a deeply flawed project in my opinion and the album gets by mostly again on not the production not the composition not Kid Cudi's lyrical abilities not his singing abilities but really more his cult of personality but despite all of my criticisms I will say that I think Kid Cudi is doing a better job of playing to his strengths on this album at least still though I am feeling a light too decent for on this record treta Tran and those are my thoughts on this new Kid Cudi record did you uh did you love this album did you like this album do you like it more than me let me know I'm sure you will down in the comments if you're if you're you know feeling some type of way you're the best I believe in you you're my favorite hope you're having a good

PkDH0RquNYo,hey everyone - to the English Channel here list week is taking its toll on me this is just too much guys and in this shirt is starting to smell I had a throw this thing in the wash ASAP stop texting me dammit look let's let's get into this album listen let's banish this 2016 list down to hell because this will all be stun this all be finished without further ado here are my favourite albums of 2016 I recommend all of them and I'm gonna blow through the first chunk of this list just like I did in the singles video DRAM big baby DRAM Big Ups P for a million universes show me the body body war various artists southern family pop 1280 paradise no name telephone own moon sorrow juma Calton iike Connor killed the Sam awry vector terminal Redux preoccupation self-titled Solange a seat at the table Sturgill Simpson a sailor's guide to earth neurosis fire with it fires the O sees a weird exits Denzel Denzel curry Imperial the ilyce come with boundaries Conor Oberst ruminations and yeah Ruby knows black tarry cat the drones feelin kind of free lemon demon spirit phone Aesop Rock The Impossible kid yeah yeah yeah that ESOP rock albums very good you should give it a shot shout out to him sitting at our number 30 spot definitely one of my favorite records of his definitely one of his most accessible albums to date a really interesting how he gets very personal on this record - and not that his previous albums haven't been personal but just the stories and anecdotes he tells on this album about his friends and his life in the music industry and and him when he was younger are actually a pretty intriguing at number 29 we have one of the most somber and unsettling albums that dropped this year Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds with skeleton tree Nick Cave goes into supremely dark and spacious territory on this new record highly recommended and at number 28 it is the crazy futuristic slave Space Odyssey that is clippings splendor and misery this experimental hip-hop trio not only continues to push the envelope sonically but also uh with the narratives that inhabit their albums as well as the story told on this record is unlike that of any hip-hop album really really it's unlike that of most albums that are released at number twenty-seven we also have a very narrative intensive album that is the new Beyonce album lemonade a very interesting album detailing her feelings about her relationship with her significant other jay-z presuming that you know everything on the album is real we have elements of betrayal and heartbreak but also reinforcing their relationship and coming back to the love that sort of brought them together in the first place and sort of building on top of these mistakes to make a stronger foundation and she tries her hand at a myriad of different genres on this record and I would say successfully so and of course it has the killer single formation on it moving on from there at number 26 I give it to ty Segall with the album emotional mugger incredible lo-fi rock and garage rock record over here some of the most interesting and most experimental sounds ty has ever worked with on record and I know that he's kind of unpredictable always trying something new with each album but I wait for the day where he once again sort of explore sound in the way that he did on this album at number 25 it's one of the most beautiful inspiring wintery and mystical singer-songwriter records that came out this year that is Marissa Nadler strangers quite a beautiful record and actually Marissa's most instrumentally dense album yet part of the reason that the album really lit up for me personally I loved a lot of the backing instrumentation on this record and in my opinion it made a lot of Marissa's songs really come five and she didn't exactly slouch on the songwriting either so really nothing in the way of complaints about this record it's just a very beautiful folky album if you love your music gentle if you love a very introspective and kind of lonely give this thing ah listen on the opposite end of the sonic spectrum we have Street sects with an end position and God is this album disgustingly loud noisy filthy and tortured oh definitely a high point at least a sonically for industrial music this decade I know this band has really sort of taken off this year and not that I sort of expected them to this is a challenging abrasive very tough listen but as far as industrial rock goes and noise rock goes this thing is a fucking hell scape and I don't I don't see riously not exaggerating over here when I first laid ears upon this album this was seriously like in an ear burner an ear drum buster at number 23 I got to give it to my boys out of Arizona injury reserve with their album floss which was a really incredible return for them from their last project their breakout tape live from the dentist office injury reserve came through with some of the most vibrant hard-hitting and fun but also thoughtful hip-hop that came out this year then it is the cyclical psychedelic garage rock Odyssey that is king gizzards nonagon infinity this album literally loops into itself and plays forever and ever and ever and ever and I love the intense performances all over this album King gizzard pulled together a hell of a record on this one and it's an album that I anticipate myself spinning for years to come and has me excited for what they're going to be doing in the future at number 21 it's a very interesting electronic music record experimental music record format most ultimate care to one solid long cohesive piece that apparently pulled much of its sounds if not all of its sounds from the cycle of a washing machine sounds crazy I know but this is kind of Matt Moses MO taking weird everyday sounds but turning them into legitimately great music and even though there are elements on this album that do sound like machine it's not this super gimmicky distracting thing they take the sounds they sample from the washing machine and actually morph it and manipulate it into coherent and compelling electronic music at number 20 it's one of the best underground indie rock records that came out this year the new crying album beyond the fleeting gales a record that pulled together elements of yeah not only like indie rock but garage rock and also like classic rock and adult-oriented rock and some progressive rock in there too and synth pop as well at we so many influences and sounds all coming together into this crossroads of an album and doing it so incredibly well the the playing on this thing is so muscular it's so flashy it's so intricate it's complex candy the vocals have this amateurish charm to them they're very sweet and soft easy on the ears the production is very bright and brittle and lo-fi it's an interesting combination of elements and sounds and all of which works to this album's benefit at number 19 it's a half conceptual pop punk epic from mr. Jeff Rossen stock the album worried thank you Jeff for this good ass record and then a Weezer with their latest album at number 18 the White Album Weezer really came through with a good album on this one Weezer is back they return to form on this thing and they put out a record that actually celebrates what made their music so great in the first place at number 17 it is the Netherlands band swain fresh off of the name change from this routine as hell who have come together on the long dark blue with an album of songs that mix together elements of hardcore punk sort of metallic heavy hardcore punk and grunge and 90s alternative rock and it's actually a cool mix of sounds of course the high quality songwriting that was on their last record translates over here I would say a little bit more because they're not so much worried about delivering a visceral overly aggressive performance like they were on their last projects which were more purely a punk experience this new album over here is more dynamic more easygoing has loud spots as well as soft spots on the latter of which the melodies the lyrics really tend to shine through Swain is showing how versatile they are and actually coming through with one of the better records of this decade to kind revive some of these 90 sounds because a lot of the bands to do so so far I think have fallen terribly short at number 16 I got to give it to Angel Olson with the album my woman love that record especially the first half some of her most punchy and fiery material recorded to date definitely one of the youngest and brightest songwriters out there right now excited for her future is going as I am a mr. Kendrick Lamar who was sitting at the next spot at number 15 with his untitled unmastered project even Kendrick Lamar's b-sides are better than most of the album's that come out this year why it's it's crazy at number 14 it is the soul-crushing tale of struggling with the death of a loved one on the new Touche amore album stage 4 I don't want to spoil too much about this record as far as the story goes but this is an incredible post-hardcore and screamo record also on top of that to che amore works in some elements of you know some indie rock and some post rock kind of softens their sound up a little bit makes her sound a little more dynamic bring some variety on this record and if you get the chance to listen to this thing and really follow along with what is being said in the lyrics it is going to be one of the most emotionally crushing moments for you of 2016 at number 13 I got to give it to one of the cutest pop records of the year if not the cutest pop record of the year kero kero Benito's but you know generation god I am addicted to this album it is so fun it is so colorful it is so sweet on the ears the songs are so innocent and cute and endearing I can't help but just listen to this thing go ah ah this album acute I love how cute this album is this album warms my heart everybody that's legitimately why I like it so much I will kill all who disagree at number 12 one of my favorite rap records of the year I guess my favorite rap record to come out of the West Coast this year and that is a YG's still crazy man I was not anticipating my enjoyment of this record because I thought his last album my crazy life was so painfully underwhelming like there was certainly potential there and that potential is realized on still brazii yg really sat down and focused on this thing he got his breath control under control actually bringing some steady flows he actually focused on a series of topics throughout these songs which he sticks to on every single track the production on this thing is great brings back that old-school g-funk vibe but with sort of a modern punch it's very tasteful very fun very catchy and then the hooks on this thing are awesome two great features lots personality charisma III don't know it's it's a great record I like it a lot at number eleven I struggle with my number eleven spot because that means like this isn't going to be in the ten you know like what's my top ten going to be this is number eleven but you know it didn't make the top ten but it is it is still one of the best albums I've heard this year an album that I didn't anticipate to love so much given how underwhelming I felt the band's last album was but that is Radiohead's a moon shaped pool this was such a oh such a dreary just emotionally impactful record which is interesting because it's such a soft album it's such a subtle album it's not an album that sort of hits you over the head or anything like that this is very much a lonesome sort of experience a very introspective album very cerebral though I'm sure I don't really have to explain this album to you guys a lot of you probably love it enjoy it already at number ten goddamn it it's nails it's nails skill of F upping one of us ah god I love this fucking record I mean there are so many things about this album that remind me of their previous two records at least at first and I was just like you know nails came through with another solid record you know that's it I loved it you know but I was like yeah that's another good nails record it's another good nails record the very consistent band but then as I listen to the album more and more I was like goddamn this thing is like it's it's so heavy and crushing like the second album but it's like just as catchy as the first album and yet it's longer and they've got a little more ambitious with their compositions on this record and I love the fucking lyrics on this album can I just say that I love the lyrics on this album especially on the title track the the way the band is just so fuck you to the whole world and I feel like no other band sort of embodies that fuck you attitude in the way that nails does like they just do it in a way that no other band does or I think even can like there's like the serious sense of nihilism and just like antisocial behavior on this record that just makes me so infatuated with it so intrigued by it they're so unrelenting they're so uncompromising at number nine one of my favorite singer-songwriter records of this year that is the nude regina spektor album remember us to life I didn't think I was going to love this thing as much as I did because I haven't loved a Regina Spektor Spectre record for a long time but I think her recent work with orange is the new black kind of lit a bit of a fire under her butt and she came through with some wonderful arranged instrumentation on these tracks some of her peppiest and punch iasts and really actually most seductive tracks that I've heard her come out with in a long time also endearing songs as well like the closing track the visit on this thing is absolutely gorgeous and heartwarming I love the gamut of emotions I get on this record from the tracks that are making kind of a socio-political statement about the strong screwing over to the weak or the rich screwing over the poor so on and so forth or the tracks that are you know just gentle and and inviting and just kind of like a sweet hug from a friend who you really like I just appreciate the variety both emotionally and musical on this thing how great the performances are on this record from Regina's singing to the piano playing and the production on this thing is incredible it's vivid it's crisp it's vibrant it's well layered if you're sleeping on this album I don't know what to tell you and unfortunately there have been a lot of people sleeping on this album this year people who probably think at this point yeah I've heard everything Regina Spektor has to say at this point but you know what she came through with a killer record and if you like singer-songwriter records if you appreciate singer songwriters you're gonna like this thing at number eight it is car seat headrests with teens of denial god this is such a good album ah the funny personal stories of self-deprecation on this album and just you know misfortune I love so much we'll Toledo does a fantastic job of just like putting his emotional breakdowns into song I love the raw recording and performances on this thing I like the way that the band lairs instrumentation into these songs that are intricate and they're well-written and they progress really interestingly you know they're not just like these basic verse chorus verse Tunes you know there are some interesting detours that a lot of these songs take but they're delivered in this kind of you know upfront punky not nasty but you know just like very raw kind of way and the more I listen to this thing there's just like not a hook on this thing that just is not snapped for me a bends goodbye Bowers yeah yeah I love it it's so good at number seven is mr. Frank Ocean with blond goddamn Frank you came through with an incredible record in 2016 listen channel orange didn't love it but I heard potential there and this album is that potential on this album you can't deny that Frank Ocean has matured significantly as a songwriter from the way that he structures tracks to his lyrics to what he writes songs about like he's a totally different artist at this point and the way that he actually builds these songs instrumentally with such minimalistic instrumentation is actually really interesting like he didn't overdo it on this album this is not a heavily layered record he seems to find an incredible amount of power in simplicity and quiet volumes but yes still manages to come off like you know really bold and upfront like you doesn't really have anything to hide this is a really creative moment for modern pop and modern soul and I love it Frank Ocean key putting out music at number six this album is a series of covers yes but the way that the band reinvents these songs not only you know on an individual level from the their compositions to the way that they sound to the way that they kind of formed all these tracks together into a coherent album format is absolutely amazing and that is shoo-shoo playing the music of Twin Peaks man shoo-shoo killed this record I didn't know I'd be that enamoured with a covers much less a covers album that covers a soundtrack but man shoo-shoo came through and made these songs scary and frightening and harrowing for 2016 I mean originally the Twin Peaks soundtrack is very eerie is very strange is very unsettling not only from the way that it sounds texturally from the way that some of the instrumentals move compositionally from these like really bright warm inviting beautiful chord progressions to something incredibly dark and dismal and tortured and Shu Shu makes those contrasts even greater on this record the album is a really great I just don't have anything else good to say about it I could just say good things about it all day let's keep going at number five I got to give it to A Tribe Called Quest for their latest record their comeback album we got it from here thank you for the service a Tribe Called Quest uses their skills and their experience in hip hop to basically bring a new perspective a fresh perspective and experienced perspective on the genre and on culture and just a you know spring some good tasteful jazz rap tracks you know I think it is pretty fortunate for them that their sound back in the 90s just so happens to still kind of be relevant today or just has aged very well so as a result like they're still kind of able to stick to their guns and come out with a record that actually is compelling it actually translates with people that I think is fantastic but the thing is in a lot of ways I think they're living up to their older material too with some great features from Busta Rhymes and consequence all over this thing fantastic beats good song subjects to thoughtful versus clever bars really great to see some vets just putting out some great music that's all at number four I got to give it to Swans for the glowing man this was an incredible musical experience ah swans came through with an album that is very much built on a lot of the same compositional and conceptual foundations of their last album - the kind which as you remember I gave that a 10 that was my album of the year but this new album over here is a little more Spacey it's a little more meditative and I like that this together with to be kind the seer make four really one of the best rock trilogies of this decade and swans it's amazing that they've been able to come out with so much great material not on it not just in terms of like hey three good albums also each of these albums is like well over an hour in length very very dense listens swans just continue to kill it and I'm really looking forward to listening to the band in their next incarnation moving on from there our number three spot what's number three going to be number three it's where we're really narrowing it down not too many other albums can be in these three spots what's number three number three is Deaf Death Grips number three is Death Grips a little bit really great album from Death Grips one of their most catchy immediate and memorable albums so far some of the most interesting material lyrically in my opinion some of their best instrumentals - they really did kind of live up to the hype of their last album where they finished off Jenny death with a song titled Death Grips 2.0 because really they went back to the basics of the Money Store a little Knoll of Deep Web really they kind of pull elements from every single album they've come out with so far and they just put together this album that I feel like at this point in their career they're just kind of making a record that they couldn't have made before because up until this point they've had all these experiences they've come together with all these production tricks that have have sort of earned them the unique idiosyncratic sound that their fans love so much there's so many artists out there or blatantly ripping off right now so even though this record isn't really the most creative or boundary-pushing for them it's almost like a really awesome victory lap they're like we just sort of out of the ether pulled up all of these insane sounds and here we are kind of refining them and sharpening them down to some of the deadliest tracks we've dropped so far I love this though I will say moving forward I am going to be more interested or I guess more excited to see Death Grips continue pushing forward and trying out new things down the road at number two this record gave me nightmares and creeped me out and and I have a really weird theory about this album that I may talk about at some point in the future but that is the new David Bowie album blah pack star David Bowie black star amazing record and unique for so many reasons and not just having to do with the context you know where David Bowie passed away shortly after the release of the record people get a chance to listen to the album and oh my god it's like David Bowie reflecting on death and being in heaven and talking about his career and his stardom and his relevancy and so on and so forth really powerful and kind of creepy stuff given again the context around the album but also musically it's a really intense listen to of course some of those glam elements come back but there are a lot of very strange hard-hitting fast-paced noisy chaotic and experimental moments on this album some of the most challenging material David Bowie has released so far all I can say is I'm really happy that you just got to go out with a bang go out with one of his best albums yet and I'm just going to continue enjoying this album for years to come and there we are people our number one spot our number one spot our number one spot Rod's Danny Brown atrocity exhibition goddamnit I mean the more I thought about it just became clear to me that I couldn't put any other album in this spot and that's because on this record Danny Brown came through the hip-hop record that sounds like no other album in the genre this thing is so weird and off-kilter and freaky and bombastic there are tracks on this album that's still to this day when I listen they blow my fucking mind not just with you know incredibly solid cuts like really dough which feature all these great features but songs like dance in the water or ain't it funny or a bunch of other tracks on this thing I still listen to this record and I think how are these songs real ike real like these beats are so weird no other rapper would even dare to try to rap over these instrumentals and the way that he sort of attacks or I guess explores sort of that downward spiral he talks about on Triple X it's like he was able to sort of go back to some of those subjects that he originally built his career built his style built his lyricism around and sort of give them the darkness that was really appropriate for them I know album isn't technically a concept album but in a lot of ways it does feel like that to me though the more I listen to these tracks the less they feel like just kind of a random smattering or mixed bag of songs but really just kind of like a complete emotional portrait or profile of Danny Brown as an artist he just really kind of like brought us into the the madhouse on this one he brought us down the rabbit hole on this one like the raw emotion of this album is so powerful and potent even if some of the lyrics he tries to portray them with are very direct and raunchy obviously Danny's killer sense of humor is still very much intact on this album but a lot of the time those jokes those one-liners are just kind of a momentary giggle to kind of distract away from like this whirlwind of pain and suffering that envelops much of the record and not say that pain and suffering are just in and of themselves a good thing and that pain and suffering is something that we as the audience should enjoy you know it's actually the way that Danny Brown sort of a stronger and more focused and a better person at the end of all of it that is part of what makes this album so interesting and compelling just finally with this record he came out with the project I thought he had the potential to come out with when he came out with xxx and I guess he just needed some time to really kind of ruminate over this thing and you know and I'm just really happy that he did I'm really happy that it happened because again this is my album of the year I think it's an incredible fucking record and I'm gonna leave it at that

dWLzwObFzcY,hey everyone Anthony fan taro here the Internet's busiest music nerd and list week trudges on I hope everybody is doing well obviously this video you've clicked on it you've seen the title it's my top 50 singles of 2016 now a few things with these tracks I'm picking singles here not just like deep album cuts I mean there may be some songs that I prefer to others that these artists have released this year but these are the singles these are the promotional tracks to the albums that they released this year if they did in fact release an album and then also I limited it to one song per artist some of these artists may have dropped a myriad of tracks that I loved this year but I've limited it to one song per artist just so I can get you know as many artists and as many different songs and different styles and sounds on this list as possible because we are talking about 50 spots here I don't want the listeners to be dominated by one artist I want a variety here now I'm not going to explain my thoughts on every single one of these 50 tracks I typically blow through maybe the first half of the list or so just to kind of get those songs listed off and um I think the way that I'm going to do it this year is I'm going to do it in song acapella style to attune that many of you may be familiar with I'm just going to be listing off the singles the numbers of these singles where they sit on this list are going to pop up in the corner let's go PJ Harvey the wheel the avalanches Frankie Sinatra Rae sremmurd black Beatles riff raff four million no worries like the Sturgill Simpson brace for impact live a little JPG mafia and freaky I might vote for Donald Trump The Dillinger Escape Plan Limerick death childish gambino redbone gucci mane tom my children Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Jesus alone Solange cranes in the sky the drones Taman should preoccupations anxiety clipping baby don't sleep run the jewels legend has it rich chigga dat stick Fox legitimate erricka king gizzard gamma knife yung lean Hoover that's a that's far enough down the list I'd say at number 30 we have a punchy grimy dirty dark single from schoolboy q groovy Tony wasn't crazy about the blank face album but still it stands out to me is one of the best hip hop tracks of this year at number 29 it's A Tribe Called Quest with we the people a great single great album one of the best hip hop records of this year in my opinion but there were songs off of this record that I liked so much more than this particular song not only that but I think this album works best as a whole this isn't really the type of artists you could sort of just pick a single track and be like ah this is what makes them amazing it's really the full album experience especially with this new LP that makes it so good but still some quality jazz rap on this track let's move over to number 28 absol with the song drugs goddamn I didn't know absol to come through the Moody intoxicating melodic ballad of a track like this and have it end up being so good at 27 we have Iggy Pop with yeah such a great sexy fun rock track very catchy sharp ass hook on this thing Iggy Pop still has it I hope he continues to drop high-quality material into the future because this album really just seemed to be like a creative peak for him at this point his career at number 26 I have to give a shout out to and known me with the song drone bomb me one of the most emotionally gripping and really harrowing art pop ballads I've heard this year really intense lyrical content on this thing and at number 25 it is the Jon T it is the quaint fun and poppy Regina Spektor with the song older and taller Oh doodoo duty to God I every time I think about that song and I think about how the pianos just pop off the beat and I think about how sugary and sweet that vocal melody is how the instrumentation is I just get a smile on my face God at number 24 its Missy Elliott with song WTF where they from love this track banger be fun hook great lyrics from Missy awesome Pharrell feature not really too many complaints about this song it's just a really fun track and an awesome return to form Missy at number 23 I got to give it to mr. Kanye West for ultralight beam beautiful fusion of hip-hop and gospel and soul on this track love the chance feature on the song as well and it's you know one of the handful of songs from his latest record life of Pablo that I think are really great at number 22 it is Weezer with la girls please act your age god I love that song god I love that melody oh it's so catchy it's so great such a great highlight from their new record and is this number 21 yeah oh man 21 Denzel curry with ultra oh fuck I almost broke my fucking laptop that is just how hard that goes and how exciting that song is to me Denzel curry came through with one of his best bangers super dark awesome flow on this track God he is relentless I can't wait to see this dude continue to grow and evolve into the future because he's very young and he's coming up with some hard-ass stuff some of those tough-as-nails hip-hop out there at the moment at number 20 it is the epic progressive thrash metal outfit vector with gang jacket yeah that's not quite a mr. de Santos amazing voice that was a very bad impression of that but still if you're looking for some of the best metal to come out this year some of the best thrash music of this decade make sure you listen to this new vector album specifically this single at number 19 it is my dude Kendrick Lamar with the song untitled oh seven aka levitate Kendrick Lamar come through the great single on this one amazing hook on this thing the the beat is kind of low five but it only adds to the character of the track I love how sort of Spacey and otherworldly and woozy the song feels awesome stuff and at number 18 god I love this single this year it is a prime piece of electro funk I'm talking about mr. Bruno Mars's a 20 fuck I have too much fun listening to that track I don't know I mean I'm not much of a dancer but uh there are very few instances in which if you had that song playing on a PA I don't know I'd probably step up despite the fact it would be massively embarrassing not just for me but everyone witnesses what would transpire after at number 17 we have kero kero benito reminding us that every once in a while we should take a break on the song break it's a really cute little pop tune that warms the heart and calms the nerves at number 16 I got to give it to my dude able the weekend for a mothafucka a mastaba oh I missed a black great Daft Punk production on this record love Able's vocals on this record love how mu D then gorgeous and lavish this song is one of his best tunes even if I didn't end up loving the album that it came off of in my opinion this is still one of the best singles this year had to offer at number 15 it is the only anti-donald trump song that we needed this year of you know that JPEG mafia song is fun though I do like that song it's a little tongue-in-cheek though it's not blatantly fuck Donald Trump but you know I digress it's YG's FDT yg not a conscious sort of progressive on the fringe experimental underground rapper he's this mainstream chart-topping gangster rapper and he's the last guy he would expect to be the first to drop a significant anti-donald trump song and yet he was and what's funny is that even though everybody had all that time between the release of this song and the election of donald trump to drop some good anti Trump music his song in my opinion still stood tall as the best fuck Trump anthem and whenever I'm feeling like I'm in a fuck this is the song I go to cuz it's got a catchy ass hook really a no muss no fuss kind of chorus you know it's really everything you need and nothing you don't but beyond that you know he goes on to explain some of his reasoning in the verses I love the instrumental on this thing it's a good gangster rap throwback and obviously I think it's one of the best singles of this year - now at number 14 I got to give it to Radiohead with the awesome and the wonderfully string backed lead single from their latest LP the song burned the witch very eery very unsettling track from Radiohead love it love it love it at number 13 it's one of the most captivating acoustic ballads of this year in my opinion Lady Gaga's and give a million reals before you go fall down the path it gotta make the wood seem bad so many good things about that track I love the funky structure of the song I love the sound of the acoustic guitars out of the way the instrumentation blossoms on the hook I think Lady Gaga's vocal performance is immense on this track it's one of the moments on her new record where I think her performance translates nicely to sort of the more folky singer-songwriter direction that she's moving it at number 12 I got to give it to mr. chance the rapper of featuring little Wayne and 2 Chainz on this track you don't wanna bother mondo banner with me you don't want no battle on the bathroom with me I love this track - it's such a good track ah I might take a bullet for this fucking track it's one of the best tracks chances come out with this this is one of the songs that when people say hey man a coloring book no way it was good as a strap no way it was good I just look at them like I but I don't know what you're saying you're not speaking English dude because no problem is on this album now I fucked it up I fucked up the grand screen I did it at number 11 I really struggled with this track I wasn't sure which one to put in this place because I was putting DRAM here but I wasn't sure whether to put broccoli or put cash machine broccoli is obviously like one of the biggest singles of the year but my heart still says cash machine I still prefer that song a little bit I love the illustrious piano on that track I love the way it's chopped into the beat I actually love the the sound effects of like cash machine running in the song I thought that incorporation of that was really creative I loved rams voice on this track but I like broccoli too really the 11 spot is shared by both of these songs honestly broccoli and cash machine two of the best singles of the year and I hope that DRAM just continues to come through with amazing music in 2017 2018 at number 10 giving it to car seat headrest with the song drunk drivers killer whales a really amazing lo-fi indie rock highlight from their latest record teens of style and at number nine it's my dudes and Death Grips with I'm getting bad people good ideas I give giving bad people good ideas after he became a good idea amazing Industrial hip-hop right they're very noisy one of the most rock-oriented tracks and one of the strangest vocal performances ever on a Death Grips song this is one track that they released this year that proves that the trio despite releasing so much material thus far is continuing to push forward and do new things try some risky stuff and continue to sound like one of the weirdest groups on the planet at number eight it is Beyonce with formation such a good single such a good banger haha and she keeps hot sauce in her bag y'all she keeps the hot sauce in there I love the width this track fuses elements of trap with contemporary R&B and soul the hot horn sections in the song some great vocal harmonies layered on top of each other and I like that Beyonce more than ever on this cut brings this strong just really slathers it on this hip-hop swagger she sounds mean on this track and that's very much the case for the album that this song comes off of and I love here in that sort of gruff side of Beyonce my number seven spot here may surprise you because it is a song that comes from an album that I didn't really enjoy this year a lot of people got up my ass about not liking this album really but this song was really the diamond in the rough of this record and that is Travis Scott with mr. young thug pick up the phone babe love this track I love the I don't know I can't quite put my finger on it is it sort of a tropical Caribbean vibe coming off the speed I'm really not sure all I know is young thug vocal melodies on this track are great Travis Scott's performance is great instrumental amazing it is such a sexy sexy song and in the lyrics I get this legitimate sense of devotion from especially young thug not usually a vibe that comes through in his bars it's just such a great single number 6 this is going to piss a lot of people off but I don't care little yachty with Minnesota fuck yes I love the fuck out of this song got a Minnesota called like Minnesota cold Eggman Oh God like Minnesota it's like a dumb fun track if you don't like this track if you fucking hate this track I don't know you you just don't know how to have fun this is just such a goddamn smile inducing song I love the way that the track was remixed and you had those editions of you know quavo and young thug and so on and so forth so you know that version of the track I am a very enamored with I this track is just great it's such a great song it's just a great fun dumb kandi song that I just can't get enough of I just want to listen to it on a repeat again and again and again I just can't get enough of this fucking track I'm sorry it's when I favorite tracks of the year I apologize at number 5 I'm giving it to a angel Olsen with it shut up gets me homie diet whoo I don't know why I'm so hyped right now the middle this list it's probably because I love these songs a lot yes I am giving it to Angel Olsen that song really got me excited for her new record like I wasn't hype on this album until I had heard that song I was like goddamn she is like going nuts on this track this is her most passionate off-the-wall performance yet it's really her her shuddering her shattering her a shouting voice on this track that makes it such an immense performance and I love the rough garage rock instrumentation hanging out behind her - adds a lot of oomph adds a lot of swagger and it's a very well-written song as well moving on from there number four a one of my favorite pop tracks of this year from the PC music camp Hannah diamond with the song hi not only is this song well produced it's super catchy well-written amazing hook great vocal melodies but I also love the message of the song - this track gets at love and relationships in the Internet age that no other artist has even begun to approach yet and it's 20 fucking 16 I feel like this song could have or should have come out back when myspace was popular but no we're getting it today and we're getting it from PC music we're getting it from Hannah diamond and goddamn is it good and attacks or rather displays its point so fucking well this song goes far enough to portray it as almost a beautiful thing and I think that's beautiful moving on from there three I give it to Danny Brown with one of the best posse cuts of the year if you can call it that if not well really actually the best posse cut of the year and that is a really know off of his new album atrocity exhibition awesome beat from Black Milk Danny Brown's performance at the start of the track is amazing love absol xinput love Kendricks input Kendrick on the hook is great and Earl drops a killer aggressive verse on the finish so much chemistry from all of these guys and it's just non-stop like it was supremely one of the most oh fucking shit moments in hip hop for 2016 but it was not as oh shit as my number two spot and that is injury reserve with the song oh shit banger of the year everybody banger of the year oh shit oh I threw these on the floor to prove this to you I threw these on the floor I do my own stunts there is not another rap song that I've heard this year that like it was just such a in my brain from the dreary piano to the heavy immense beat to the gruff wild crazy awesome hook from Richie with a tee just the way he delivers these yells on the hook oh shit like it just makes you want to budge something and then the verses that come after that are great it's just such as such a good track such an animalistic track such a piece of Rage might not my number one spot let's get it to number one people let's get it to number one we can't be lists and shit all day you know my number one spot is reserved for an incredibly dark and and winding twisting crazy track song that I'm going to be excited to talk about when we do my albums of the Year lists and an album that I reviewed very positively early in the year this track comes from that is black star David Bowie the title track to David Bowie's latest album his final album not only was this a dizzying a weird a very off-putting an unsettling song one of the most unsettling songs of 2016 but it becomes even more so once you actually think about what the song is about and add it on top of that David Bowie's recent passing oh it's crazy it's such a mindfuck don't even make me get into the music video of the track which actually I had to stop watching because it was giving me nightmares the song itself is a nightmare enough yeah for me just really weird powerful soul souring track here I don't know what else to say it's my number one song of the year it's black star and that's and that's it everybody that is my favorite singles of the year 50 favorites thank you for watching you're the best Tran and there are my 50 favorite singles of this year everyone and thank you for watching links videos next to my head subscribe to the channel hope you guys are enjoying list week and staying in good health in during this holiday season Antoine Fant on you know who it is catch you guys in the next video forever 
NcEAdtuccP4,hi everyone thanks for the phone call here guys the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a list because it's still list week list my top 15 EEPs of 2016 yes my favorite EP releases not quite singles because they're too long not quite albums because they're too short those weird in-between releases that a lot of people don't really even pay attention to here are 15 of them that I think were actually worth some attention this year at number 15 we have another piece of forward-thinking futuristic off-the-wall Pop production from my dude Clarence clarity I really hope I hear a new album from him next year really enjoyed the song on this EP titled same as well as all the other tracks on this EP titled same which I'm pretty sure were all the same at number 14 we have Tony Molina with confront the truth who came through with sort of a an acoustic sort of a softer approach on this new project over here not quite sure it totally fit his short songwriting style but he did come through with some interesting material here regardless at 13 it's some fast paced in your face punk rock with a bit of a vintage edge there from turn style move through me and at number 12 Sleaford mods do what they do as well as they typically do it on the TCR EP if you're looking for some very wordy verbose post-punk with some great vocal performances very energetic then give this thing a listen at number 11 its gloss with trans day of revenge the group's most hard-hitting release yet though unfortunately I guess they disbanded this year and I don't think we're going to be hearing any more of glosses music into the future sadly but you know for the moment that they were around they put together some really hardcore amazingly heavy punishing punk music and the fact that their songs were centered around trans issues only made them even more interesting at number 10 we have one of the most interesting bands and underground progressive metal kralik's coming through with the Hyperion EP definitely a nice direct and hard-hitting change of pace from the kind of obtuse album they had dropped not too long ago and at number nine mister yachties EP one of a couple he dropped this year this one the the terrible tales of scary Jones this guy is a total character and and particularly so on this EP where he raps from the standpoint of some kind of pirate who comes from this odd surreal land with some usual pirate tropes you know like the the briny deep and you know walking the plank that sort of thing but it's like totally cuckoo it's a funny P give it a shot moving on from there number eight its Chelsea wolf with the hypnose flame to two tracks DP single sort of thing and though not quite a single shout-out to Chelsea wolf keep making that dark brooding atmosphere tortured music I enjoy so much at number seven its death grips with their interview 2016 ap yeah like some weird instrumentals a lot of people have kind of written it off but you know as far as EP releases this year go it's not bad and you know it's cool that Death Grips hit us with so much material worth talking about this year at number six a glue ghost graced us with a little more material I can't wait for him to drop a new album because his production style is so dense so intricate so colorful so amazing so off-the-wall in a lot of ways I think he is ahead of the curve of what a lot of electronic music producers are doing these days and I love how he mixes together so many different styles of electronic dance music and wonky and obviously there's some hip hop inspiration there and in some elements that are just uniquely a glue ghost and I love that brain feeder has given him a nod as well but anyway I can't wait for that album again and the couple of fresh tracks from this little grids EP are a few of my favorites from this year at number five I have to give it to clipping with their wriggle EP the raw dirty filthy and somewhat low five set of tracks that they put out not too long before their splendour and misery album which they dropped this year nice they sort of gave us two different sides of the clipping project in 2016 this weird conceptual Space Odyssey about this future slaves stuck on a cargo ship and then you have this nasty dirty noise rap kinky sex filthy raunchy dirty uh listen to it at number 4 we have gore guts with pleiades dust this long conceptual seamless piece of technical death metal is one of the most massive and soul-crushing but also uh exhilarating pieces of metal music I've heard this year then it's Carly Rae Jepsen with the emotion side B tracks these are basically leftovers from her recent album emotion but they were treated with no less care they have great punchy beats soaring hooks sweet innocent lyrics and some peppy catchy sharp earworm melodies definitely one of my pop highlights of this year but at number two I was really happy to hear massive attack come back with a great set of tracks on this ritual spirit ep after hearing these I can only hope they come through in 2017 with a great album I was also really happy to hear them working with young fathers on this project to basically massive attack just makes the case for themselves and this decade not that we need them to make the case for themselves but you know there are a lot of groups whose paydays in the 80s and 90s aren't really making great music today massive attack has sort of a with this EP in my opinion sort of thrown that assumption thrown that stereotype to the curb and has said we can still be contemporary we can still be cutting-edge we could still be doing something interesting we can still be writing compelling music after all these years so please keep an eye out for us and finally at number one one of my favorite one of the most colorful one of the most odd and one of the most unexpected EPS I had heard this year has to be at my number one spot it is Charli XCX with vroom-vroom up until this point I have by no means been a Charli XCX fan let me just put that out there but she joined up with the good people over at PC music for the production on this new EP and the way that they came together on here absolutely immaculate some of the weirdest and most bubbly and just strangest pop music I've heard this year the beats are hard-hitting and colorful and just really kooky and Charlie swagger and charisma on these tracks only enhances the beats further though I was kind of disappointed with the fact that Charlie XCX seemed to go back to what she usually does with like one of her latest singles after the after party featuring little yachty I guess I can always come back to this EP and just hold on to a little bit of hope that maybe there's an album in the works where she's doing something like this for the duration of an entire LP or as she comes out with albums into the future she is kind of keeping an ear out for something that is a little experimental a little left-field that she's actually using her position to sort of challenge the norms of pop rather than just simply embrace them and that's of course what this EP does so well and you know it's not just about being the odd woman out on this project you know there are great grooves on this thing there are really funny tongue-in-cheek lyrics and hooks this thing has a lot of personality it's got a lot of oomph it's got a lot of chutzpah it's bold and that is why it's my EP of the year so there you go those are my top 15 EEPs of 2016 transition that have you given these EPS a listen did you love them did you hate them do they end up on your favorite APs of the Year list what were some of your favorite EPS of the year hit me with them down in the comments also various videos next to my head subscribe to the channel official website as well enjoy the rest of list week everybody for forever 
ebQcgnlz5SU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the the Internet's busiest music nerd it's still last week this tweet 2016 and the next video in our list week series is of course the 10 worst albums of 2016 only 10 because I can only put up with so much pain and boy are these albums special they will all have a special place on my suicide note that's for sure reviews and/or music for these albums are linked down there in the description box now let's get to it no more stalling no more mincing words the list at number 10 we have an album that I wasn't even really anticipating that sort of caught me off guard mr. Lance Skywalker's introverted intuition now Lance Skywalker is on Top Dawg entertainment one of the most interesting and forward-thinking rap labels out there in the mainstream at the moment so going into this thing I was just looking forward to hearing a new artist that TTE brought on that could potentially be on the cutting edge instead I was absolutely amazed at just how much of an incoherent mess this record is I just can't pin it down and that's not to me what makes it one of the worst albums of the year it's really that it just seems like an alphabet soup of random anything and when a coherent idea does actually come through we get a rap verse or like a legitimate piece of song structure it's not like particularly good the vocals come off very goofy the production is kind of cut-rate it's just so uniquely directionless that I just can't imagine it as anything else other than some kind of mutant whose arms and legs are mangled and something that as its writhing there on the floor it's like I want to die I shouldn't live so that is our number 10 spot at number 9 we have the new 303 album the night sports these guys are a pop music comedy rap duo if you consider what they do funny their song my dick made my worst of the year list this year so of course it should only make sense that this album landed on the list too because my dick from this album is actually just the the tip if you will excuse me using that word in this situation the tip the throbbing purple tip of the iceberg of this album if you like your music so corny and so tongue-in-cheek that your tongue has literally just torn a hole through your fucking cheek then maybe you might appreciate this album a little bit but for me I'm just this just not me this is not my bag moving on from there we have an album slash mixtape from another artist that I had just heard about for the first time this year but listening to his music for the first time just really blew me away because God was it a tough listen I'm talking about little peeps hell boy this album is like a weird and abrasive mix of like hip-hop and sort of dark southern hip hop trap music but also like scream oh and emo and metal music it's super like tears and my diary type stuff with just these throat shredding howls over these rap beats that are just overblown and not all that well produced for whatever reason there seems to be this really big following for dark edgy rappers on soundcloud and this album is is most definitely in that vein but it's like all the elements of that executed and in the worst and most extreme way possible again it was just another moment this year that I was really taken aback just wow this is like such a rush of you know we have some releases on this list that are obscure some that are bigger more commercial more popular I was really trying to look for the album's that just rubbed me in the worst way this year and this next album at number 7 certainly did that and it was an album that I was anticipating being not just good not just likeable but great and that is actually the new ASAP ferg album always strive and prosper ASAP ferg fell so miserably short of making that good album I was anticipating on this record I mean again I wasn't expecting you would drop a classic or anything like that I thought he would just merely live up to the standard just reach the bar that he had set on trap Lord which was not a perfect record but at least a catchy fun rap album this however is like him trying to go so commercial so hard so fast that my head is fucking spinning not only in the process of that does he lose his style does he lose his appeal with all of these glitzy cruddy glamorous beats these sung just really clean unlikable hooks also some of his worst verses and rap performances to date you know trap Lord had a sound an aesthetic a vibe to it it was not only dark in sort of atmospheric but it was also very godly feeling this album has no sense of identity whatsoever ASAP ferg really just starts coloring outside of the lines and into territory that really just was not his strong point at all just this really trashy pop rap that oh just leaves a nasty taste in my mouth I mean hopefully he can actually come through in the future with a new project but really this was just such a massive disappointment that I fear that that will never happen moving on from there we have another hip-hop release at number six that I thought was even worse mostly because it's it's barely even a project it is unfinished as unfinished as a project can be and that would be the new designer mixtape new English again if you can even call this thing a mixtape a myriad of the tracks on this project are just like half songs or snippets I wouldn't even call them interludes they're like what's supposed to be a song but then just stops abruptly because it just finished this was clearly a rush job because he and his producers and his label wanted to get something out because panda was taking off and he needed something full-length he needed something bigger out I was expecting you would drop an album at some point this year but apparently that has been pushed back or it just wasn't ready if he was gonna drop a record it really should have been this year because in 2017 obviously less people are going to be curious about a new designer project especially with Timmy Turner being as lackluster a single as it was and if new English over here has done anything it's lower to expectations further because it's that lackluster it's that hollow it's that lacking in any sort of substance and I don't just mean like lyrical or conceptual substance I mean again it's like unfinished material and the material here that actually is finished just feels like we're listening to once again just a minute and 30 seconds of ideas just repeated and repeated and copied and pasted to the point where we're getting a three or four-minute song so this makes it on the list because there's not really any project I've heard this year that sounded quite so effortless and blatantly thrown together at number five though I can only assume that our next artist here was trying and that would be a deed aunt would with their new mountain in G album which is easily their worst project to date I've never really been a fan of these guys and prior I've always sort of chalked not liking their music up to just not totally being my cup of tea for sure a lot of their songs were kind of corny and in bad taste but they were clearly self aware of what they were doing their music was a little tongue-in-cheek and prior to Antwoord they were actually making some pretty interesting left-field experimental hip-hop but now that this project is blown up and they've gone through a few hype cycles with a few albums and they've settled down on this one it's like the aura is completely gone the production is no longer punchy and fun and bouncy or really even all that house influenced the beats are incredibly muddy and messy sounding and just not really up to what sounded like the budgetary standards of the a few projects the rapping and the vocal sound like badly recorded - this thing is just really unflattering it's one thing to put together this musical comedy rap album with what sounds like the musical budget equivalent to that of a movie like The Hangover but then when you're trying to pull off that same sort of thing but like I don't know on a shoestring indie whatever money is in your pocket kind of thing it sounds a lot less vibrant punchy and fun it's like their music at one time sounded like this wild and sane party with bouncy houses and fireworks and the craziest drugs you could imagine in a pool and sexy people in every single direction and now that's been kind of boiled down to a few six-packs of soda and a old couch in the living room with some Netflix on the TV moving on from there at number four we have probably the worst compilation of the year that is the new Star Wars headspace various artists collection of tracks god this thing is terrible I don't I don't know what to say about it it's just that bad it's a collection of tracks featuring a bunch of producers and songwriters putting together these electronic music tracks that are all Star Wars themed and pretty much the only thing that makes these tracks Star Wars themed are all the crappy Star Wars vocal samples from the older movies not even the new movie because this was kind of like a I don't know orchestrated to sort of be released in line with the past Star Wars film not rogue one the one previous to that but this album has nothing to do with the force awakens many of the artists on this very same project are sampling the same stupid Star Wars vocals and there are actually some artists on this project whose music I enjoy a lot who I have a great deal of respect for but even their pieces of music on this thing are very lackluster all I can hope is that they got a big fat Disney check in the mail for putting together whatever mediocrity they did on this thing and I feel like it's one thing to come together with a lackluster starwars electronic music track on this project it seems like some of the people here really went out of their way to make awful electronic music none of which I'm going to remember specifically because I'm trying my hardest to erase this compilations memory from my brain so if you'll excuse me if you haven't heard this thing and you are curious just just google it online and torture yourself I'm not gonna suffer for your pleasure on camera at number three and even harder to listen this year a 90-minute album from none other than broke inside the album all grown up yes broke inside that broke inside yes these guys are back new album and what's horrible is not only is the music just as bad as it's always been maybe the production is a little bitter but really they're at the point where they should be it's too old to do this you should have grown out of this and I don't mean making music I mean making this music after all the album is titled all grown up but there's not a lick of maturity from the their first album to this of course because it's 2016 some of the production is super trap influenced there's some auto-tune on here that they take on some modern pop tropes and motifs in their song so there are elements of this that do feel contemporary it's not just crappy screamo crunk core from their MySpace days but in a lot of ways they still do sound like the same old broken side which makes me want a suicide only two more albums left everybody and and these are doozies these are special at number two we have six feet under with graveyard classics what is this number four god damn it the number of the priests a six feet under if you didn't know are pretty infamous in the metal community as being the worst death metal band walking the planet I mean maybe there are some other examples out there of worse death metal albums and bands but Six Feet Under you got to give him credit they've really over the years been consistently bad the fact that this thing is titled graveyard classics number four should give you a hint now I'm over here it's a special record in the band's discography this is not one of their albums where you'll be catching a whole lot of original material I tell you this because I think there are probably a lot of people watching more familiar with these guys and if you do check out some of that original material please don't expect it to be good or actually take that music and I don't know use it as an example of death metal on the whole these guys are particularly bad and with these graveyards classics album six feet under do what I like to call abuse the discography of a particular band for the length of an entire record and unfortunately on this one they're doing Iron Maiden so it's like a dozen or so awful Iron Maiden covers done in death metal style but the thing is the instrumentals on here because Iron Maiden have this speedy heavy-metal vibe the six feet under doesn't even really change up things instrumentally all that much if we're simply going on the drums the bass and the guitars it just sounds like I'm listening to a crappy or more rickety version of some of my favorite Maiden songs but then of course on top of that we have to have these rough growled cookie monster gargled vocals that are absolutely disgusting to the ear and add nothing to this style of metal it's just all in bad taste and there's really nothing on it that hints to me that they're actually doing it I don't know with it with it even a lick of self-awareness because they keep coming out with these things when they should have just stopped at that bad ac/dc covers album that they did and my fear is that in the future we'll see a graveyard classics number five but hopefully it doesn't come to that hopefully the buck stops here because this album as far as their covers records go is a whole new apex of awful and finally at our number one spot on my worst albums of 2016 a lot of you most likely saw this coming because of the very popular and very long review I released for this video earlier this year and that would be the new Corey Feldman album angelic to the core angelic Funkadelic slash angelic raka Dalek yes ladies and gentlemen this 90-minute mishmash of every genre corey feldman has ever heard murdered is my worst album of 2016 not only because it's awful as far as music goes but this thing is so bad it actually sort of starts to come full circle and become good because it's hilariously bad personally in a lot of ways I think it's musics answer to Tommy Wiseau's the rim because it's that corny it's that awful it's that lackluster it's that unaware of how bad it is like they're seriously as a ninis a loopiness to this album that is clear even before you listen to the record just look at the cover we have grandpa Skrillex being pulled up from Hell by two scantily clad angels you don't see that kind of cover every day of course this is gonna be a unique experience and when I was writing my review for this album I was struggling struggling with putting pen to paper and describing in my opinion accurately what I was hearing I mean sure I was writing about how bad and how terrible the music was but I feel like no matter what words I used I wasn't even coming within a mile of accurately describing what it was that made the music so awful how awful the music on this album was in a way this record made me as a reviewer feel kind of inadequate I felt like in order to talk about this album I had no other option other than to grab my laptop throw right here and just literally play clips off of the record as I just go insane in front of all of you on camera so this album was so bad it just literally broke my review format because it just didn't fit into it I mean even Kid Cudi speeding bullet album wasn't beyond description however Corey Feldman's angelic to the core truly is which in my opinion not only makes it the worst album of 2016 but potentially the worst album of this decade because even some of the worst albums I heard this year I at least had an idea as to what they were going for where Corie he's just mad he's all over the map so many things about this record just don't make any sense and the more I talk about it the more anxious I'm gonna get I don't want my heart rate to kick up I don't want to have a conniption in front of you guys on camera over here so I'm just gonna leave it at that and close the book on this one and say that that was my 10 worst albums of 2016 thank you for watching and yeah Tran that's the list everybody the list that you said and the internet YouTube thanks for watching video next to my head over here other list you gotta watch for last week and do boobie doe doe B do subscribe to they say YouTube please forever 
thEYVY5zmxQ,whoo its list week boys listen week ten oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd oh it's list week right get some action ear splosions splosions sponges we're going to kick off this week with our first official list the 15 worst songs of 2016 the most awful songs of the year the songs that I could not stand now of course there were a lot more than 15 of the most awful songs of 2016 and you know I pretty much stuck just to commercial tracks here you know I'm not I'm not talking about how your your your friends a freestyle or a track off of his or her mixtape is the worst song of the year some video of some random indie band off of YouTube I'm not doing that that might qualify as bullying rather I'm going to talk about artists who can actually take it no more discussion worst songs let's go at number 15 I had to put yeah boi Drake with the song one dance not only is this completely boring dancehall it's a non song it's not even that well written also one thing that I do dislike about this track quite a bit is that whenever Drake does something every other artist has to do it too who wants to be in the top 40 there was this whole wave of whitewashed boring atmospheric wintry dancehall plaguing the Billboard charts this past year all because of this stupid track and this thing is is basically patient zero and then the disease spread throughout much of the music industry and who knows if we'll ever recover in 2017 it's not looking good it might turn terminal next and number fourteen we have the new maroon 5 single at the doing a note no no no a done no no no easily one of the worst pop songs of the year awful kendrick lamar feature at the tail end of the track kendrick you don't need to do this you're like a legitimately good rapper how much are they paying you I hope it's a lot because seriously tracks like this appearing on this it's embarrassing essentially we have another non song here the hook isn't even that different than the verse and Adam Levine's vocal melody is completely drab instrumentally it's like another pop tune that seems like it's trying to do as little as possible it's trying to be Spacey atmospheric maybe a little moody too but all that ends up doing is just sounding like wallpaper with a verse in a chorus terrible track it's like they weren't even trying next at number 13 we have seen him with happy holiday I can't totally blame this tracks awfulness on its composition because it's it's not their track it's a cover but it is so lackluster of a cover that I was really blown away this is the most unfair song I've ever heard with again how open and minimalistic and needlessly Spacey and non-existent the instrumentation is not only that but Zooey Deschanel sounds like a foghorn over this track especially at the point where she's like happy holiday [Music] can someone get her a vocal coach please get her a vocal coach at number 12 we have Rob Zombie with everybody's fucking on a UFO literally one of the most ridiculous titles of a song this year and when you actually listen to the track given this given the song title Rob Zombie does not disappoint the hook is is quite literally everybody's fucking everybody's gonna have oh so if you've ever wanted to hear a song about intercourse on a spacecraft that which everybody apparently is taking part in then look no further than this thing but in all honesty this is one of the cringe eeeh Strax zombie has dropped in a while and I get that this kind of raunchy alien horror themed heavy rock music is sort of what he's known for but it seems like he's not exactly doing a good job of making the case for its existence in 2016 with this song next to number 11 we have one of the many political tracks that the Russian group Pussy Riot dropped this year all of which were terrible but maybe the worst of them was straight out of vagina need i say more at number 10 we have Charlie puth completely ruining the memory of one of the greatest singers and songwriters in popular music history mr. Marvin Gaye with the track Marvin Gaye which I believe has Meghan Trainor on it I don't even want to think about her I hope I'm wrong about that I hope I am completely inaccurate there and my memory just sort of is proving me wrong and that she's not really there if Meghan Trainor could just not be there history can be erased right now and sort of rewritten based on what I'm thinking right now please but if there's one thing that makes this track terrible it's not a Meghan Trainor's appearance rather it is the hook let's Marvin Gaye and get it on like again I don't even want to remember it was so painfully corny and it's another one of these tracks where the instrumentation is trying to do this vintage 50s thing I don't know why this a fetishization for this era of music has come back all of a sudden maybe it's coming from all those people who want to make America great again I'm not really sure what I do know is that this track is connealy sweet and dumb I really could not stand it at number nine we have mr. McLemore with Ryan Lewis the song white privilege to off their latest record probably one of the worst and most stomach-churning songs about racial tensions in America in 2016 a song where McLemore just like anything else he has to make it about him it can't be about the racial struggle in America it has to be about sort of his confusion about it and his lack of understanding or the fact that he wants to understand the fact that he wants to make a change so he's going to read some articles basically speaking to and admitting to the ignorance of his audience generally who know very little about hip-hop or black culture and in his attempt to educate his listeners I feel like he's only made his music more unappealing the more Macklemore tries to insert himself into social issues that don't necessarily have anything directly to do with him the more unlikable he becomes as an artist at number eight we have the Birdman song respect which was not really a diss track more of a response track to a recent temper tantrum he threw on The Breakfast Club radio show where he told Charlemagne and company they may put they put put some respect on man on his name he looked totally ridiculous and of course to add fuel to the fire to add insult to injury his own insult to his own injury he had to come out with a song called respect one of the pettiest and most unnecessary rap songs of the year at number 7 we have another classic song totally ruined by disturbed their version of the sound of silence originally recorded by Simon & Garfunkel this bombastic overblown huge heavy compressed version is utterly unbearable it's just too much the songs quietness the songs subtlety is a part of the point it's part of the appeal it's it's it works with the title and the lyrics of the song to do a version of the song that's super loud and super obnoxious is uh it's uh it's counterintuitive and number six God all the half of the songs on this list are older songs that are ruined this time it's an artist ruining their own song it's the Black Eyed Peas who did a revision of the song where's the love which was a track that they recorded and released back before they were recording crap so of course it's it's not enough that they come out with new awful music they have to redo their older music and make that awful - so they redid this great track where is the love with an awful string of totally unnecessary features of rappers who are typically rapping about how high out of their minds they are how much money they make but they're just taking a break now to you know just just spit some game about some you know real stuff real social issues you know and just make a quick little black and white face appearance in this dumb video did not did not need to happen this did not need to happen but moving on from there we have a track from the music duo 303 the song is titled my dick need i say more the track is literally about them rapping about their dicks being big as big as the fucking whatever as big as whales as big as this as big as that your dick of course is small in concept I'm not against a track like this but it's so not funny if you're going to make a track like this you have to have a sense of humor and 3:03 completely lacks a sense of humor unfortunately like this song would only appeal to ten year olds - twelve year olds but the thing is you're rapping explicitly about your dicks no parent in their right mind would want their 10 year old or 12 year old to listen to this given that it's more likely that older people are going to be hearing this and I I don't know I I pity the adult soul that wants to hear this song moving on from there we have an even more moronic song from b.o.b who earlier this year came out with a track about how the earth is fucking flat this song is dumb there's no scientific evidence to the bullshit you're saying on this track you're a moron even Neil deGrasse Tyson had to put you in your place dude this is a serious low point not only for humanity for hip-hop and popular music in general but an even lower point for our society had to have been the Leonard Dunham track a sexual pantsuit anthem good where she really made her own worst fears come true as she says on the track Hayes is this song actually hurting Hillary's chances to win is a song hurting Hillary's chances to win is it maybe it was meant in jest but in fact you probably were this stupid pro-hillary rap song video which a Charlemagne should feel ashamed for appearing in Jesus Christ is not funny it's just a bunch of bullshit talking points and it's basically the leftist hubris that made us lose the election all compacted into one unbearable piece of footage maybe if we actually sat down came through with some good policy ideas not back to candidate who was incredibly corrupt and in the pocket of major corporations then maybe we would have won but no we decided because the guy who were facing up against is such an idiot we're just going to cakewalk this and just jerk off all the way to Election Day and look what happened look what happened at number two we have a song that I seriously struggled to get through when I first heard it I was actually floored amazed at how terrible it was and still it floors me to this day and it's been months since I've heard it and that is the Corey Feldman song go for it featuring Snoop Dogg snoop Dogg who will show up anywhere for a paycheck apparently this thing is one of the worst pop songs of the year it's got these terrible dramatic singing vocals this awful dubstep instrumental dubstep in 2016 you're still trying to make a dubstep song I mean sure there are some dubstep producers that are still making dubstep but for a pop artists to try to incorporate it into their record it's kind of old hat at this point no longer a fresh or an interesting sound Corey but I digress the lyrics the beat the vocals the singing the rapping there's not a single good redeemable thing about this track it's so bad even the people at that morning show that he appeared on saw how terrible it was the performance was God off on I thought I might have been able to get away without talking about this record if not for the fact that he had that terrible viral performance of this song thanks for ruining my life song or at least my life for a good chunk of 2016 the worst song of the year number one is not even going to mr. Corey Feldman I mean jeez what could be worse than that what could be worse than that you know I gotta get it to leti grrah for I'm with her God is this song shitty not only is it another pro-hillary anthem which is just basically a bunch of crappy talking points and Democratic propaganda not that there aren't legitimate policies and platforms that could have been brought up in a song like this they just weren't but it's not just the proliferation of empty platitudes the lack of thoughtful lyrical content it's also how disappointing it is that leti grrah it's been years since they dropped a track and all of a sudden they come out of the blue to release this and it's one of the worst songs I've heard this decade the vocals the singing is awful sounds like a cat being choked the beat is super cheap and noisy and unpleasant and not even in like a rebellious Punk kind of way sort of in like a crappy we mixed and mastered this in like a day kind of way on the cheap kind of way because we're just doing this for attention into virtue signal kind of way so we could get it up on the pitch for YouTube channel kind of way yeah I mean I thought and I thought and I thought about it and there's just not a track that I thought was worse this year and the fact that the Left lost this past election makes this song even more bitter on the ears because instead of winning and making great points we were doing this bullshit I don't have anything else to say other than that I'm just disappointed I'm just disappointed not only in how awful this song is but what it represents philosophically and the horrible moment in our history it also is a part of to we're just not really at our best right now and this song is a reminder and I have to leave it at that but I have to mention one more track this song doesn't exactly make it on the list because it's special in a way the Troy Ave freestyle the Troy Ave track badass on this song it's a Joey badass diss track where he saw fit to call out or sort of a diss or make fun of make light of the death the suicide of Capital steez Troy Ave you're an asshole so basically this song isn't 1 through 15 it's just asshole n that was our list of the worst songs of 2016 whoo this one's in the can that these songs are in the trash and I am out of here transition have you I don't know but listed out any of your least favorite songs of the year hit me down in the comments and let me know what you think the crappiest songs of 2016 are that'd be nice that'd be a nice conversation to have down there also links next to my head other videos you should check out probably other list videos and thanks for watching guys I'm going to leave it at that hope everybody's well forever 
HSzXhVr3T6E,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and yep it's it's good it's good it's good this week has begun it started with this video I'm going to be listing off the worst songs of the year worst albums of the year my favorite EP is my favorite songs and then my favorite albums to finish things off but this video is honorable mentions the albums that I wanted to shout out that were highlights of this year that were very popular a lot of people talked about them a lot of people enjoy them I enjoyed them but they didn't end up making my list before I get into this video I want to give a shout out to to lists that are on the website right now two contributors to the needle drop Austin and Jeremy have their own favorite albums lists down there in the description they have very different tastes from yours truly so there are a lot of albums on these lists a lot of very good albums on these lists that do not turn up on my lists having said all that let's get into it the first album I want to give a quick shout out to is the new Dillinger Escape Plan album dissociation this is the death knell this is the death rattle of this awesome metalcore and mathcore band sad that it's their final album but if you have not given this thing a listen please do it is one of this year's best metal highlights next inu no worrys album yes nod anderson pack was a busy little bee this year and this was one of a couple projects that he dropped this year that were very much of note and it's just this kind of throwback soul funk album but of course with some tight hip-hop production from knowledge lots of swagger lots of personality on this thing and a real raw vintage feel young thug's latest project Jeffery I think I can say unequivocally this is the best thing he has done thus far and only makes me more excited for the future as long as he doesn't keep just hammering out these mixtapes that just do the same thing over and over and over I would love to see him space his projects a little bit more and get a little more adventurous like he does on this one and boil the project down to its best tracks I think he did at least most of those things here and that's why I think Jeffery turned how so good skepta with konichiwa this is one of the biggest hip hop's to come out of the UK in a long time and hopefully it's not the last for a long time I'm hoping that sceptic and sort of with this album get people a little more interested in UK hip hop interested in grime and really get the ball rolling open those floodgates some more British rappers can make albums that are turning heads in the u.s. chance the rapper colouring book as much as I loved some of the songs off of this thing there are some amazing tracks on this record there are also some incredible flaws on this album too which you can catch if you watch my review of this record still though I did like it more than anything chance had done thus far and has me looking forward to whatever he does in the future it's a good hip hop project lots of interesting gospel elements worked into the music - jazz lots of very peppy beats and chances performances from beginning to end vocally as far as lyrics and as far as singing are dead-on Iggy Pop's post pop depression is another record that I want to shout out this is definitely one of the best rock records I heard this year and a really good album considering how late it is coming out in Iggy Pop's career not only that but it's a pretty interesting record where I feel like in a lot of ways pop sort of looks back on rock music looks back on his age little retrospective and not in a nostalgic kind of way it's like he's in not just the third act but really the fourth act of his career at this point so we're kind of reaching breaching into these waters and rock music that we haven't quite before where our stars in the genre are so old so aged that we're getting these weird twilight years releases that I think are pretty intriguing so far I want to give a shout out to one of the most polarizing mixtapes that I reviewed this year I enjoyed it though many people didn't really enjoy that I enjoyed it and constantly cited this mixtape as one of the low points of my reviewing career like how could you like this more than this how could you like this as much as this because everybody in the comments has to turn music into a dick-measuring contest of course I'm talking about the latest little yadi mixtape little boat still still really like this tape still really like little yachty and hoping he comes together with a project as solid as this in the future because that that last sort of Apple music exclusive project that he did or at least it came out on Apple music first it didn't really care for that all too much want to give a shout out to the actually very tasteful and a well written collaborative project case Lang there's their self-titled record didn't expect these three to cohesively fuse together on a series of song was this good in the way that they did I thought that um you know they're probably maybe a little chaos or maybe some things just not really feeling like they're working but actually think they could come out with another record under this name and it would still be at least as good I mean sure it kind of seems like one songwriter takes the reins on one track another takes the reins on another but they all play very good supportive roles for each other on these songs um you know maybe it's a bit of a mixed bag but still a good singer songwriter record good indie folk record very tuneful very good performances next I want to give a shout out to open mic Eagle and Paul White for the he'll a personal Film Festival album some of mr. Mike Eagles most clever tracks turn up on this project and it's it's basically a cool little indie art rap album with a lot of personality a lot of wit if somehow this thing slipped by you and you're an underground hip-hop fan please don't don't don't let the rest of 2016 go without you having heard this thing and potentially even buying it off band camp from these guys support the artist Jesus Christ Childish Gambino's awaken my love want to give a shout out to that record liked it quite a bit again not an amazing record or perfect record in my opinion but I think it shows great potential for maybe this sound that Donald Glover could explore more in the future or at least it makes me excited to potentially hear Donald lever explore more sounds in the future I'm not like the biggest fan of his of his hip hop and his alternative or as sort of contemporary R&B inspired releases this however was like wow you really do this well not that he doesn't do the other things well maybe they're more just not my cup of tea but this really wowed me as far as his transition into this very vivid and bold funk style also want to mention the avalanches who came back after over a decade of studio album silence with the album wildflower which was a really big musical change of pace and not really that bad of a comeback and finally maybe one of my biggest regrets of the year is having not given a full review to the Leonard Cohen album wanted darker especially in light of his recent passing I didn't really care for some of the mixing on this album but still I think I may spend early 2017 listening to the album again re familiarizing myself at the record and who knows if I get some time might come out with a more in-depth review of the album and those are all of my honorable mentions for the year guys remember those lists that I mentioned earlier in the video are down there in the description and all of those other videos the worst tracks worst songs best DPS best songs best albums all come in this week all right excited for you guys to watch all the videos I hope you're doing well looking forward to the holidays to transition and that is the honorable mentions video again more list videos on the way some of them are linked next to my head or at least they will be once they drop and I hope you're doing well click on one of those videos subscribe to the channel go to the official website and that's it you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best you have us forever 
jGfK-R4rKxY,"yeah hi everyone good here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new injury reserve project floss injury reserve is a rap trio hailing from the unlikely location of Arizona this is their second full-length project following up 2015's live at the dentist office which was actually recorded near a dentist's office not sure if this project was recorded while flossing I was pretty psyched listen to this thing because injury reserves big breakout tape last year showed them to be one of hip-hop's most exciting rising up-and-coming acts taking the flows and charisma and lyrical chemistry of jazz rap and updating it for 2015-2016 with progressive production and banger beats and they're not beyond dropping some introspective dreary tracks either if injury reserve is anything it's versatile Richie with a tea and grogs together bring a set of bars that are clever insightful funny and occasionally personal all of which are laced with a myriad of quirky pop-culture references and with this new project over here they seem to be just pulling out all of the stops coming through with their most aggressive set of tracks yet off the wall bangers with a dump truck of personality and wit the kind of that's insanely catchy will most likely go over well with most modern hip-hop fans but could also you know open up a mosh pit - that is pretty much how injury Reserve sets the tone of the record with the opener oh not just because of how the shouted grimy chorus pairs up with the dreary chopped up piano samples it's not just the trunk knocking bass and a hook so strong you could catch a great white shark with it and it's not just the lonely auto-tuned singing at the very finish of the track which is surprisingly good or bars like remember when I had a composition in the backpack like a notebook now we killing with all the composition like the Rat Pack which links back into the very funny refrain this ain't jazz rap this that this that spaz rap uh it's not it's not just those things it's also that the the song the song is good the trio keeps up the momentum on this project with the song bad boys obviously a reference to the movie franchise starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence I love the gospel spiritual vocal samples laced throughout the instrumental sort of reminds me of college dropout Eric Kanye the track is basically this sort of jazzy awesome instrumental and two solid verses with memorable bars about dropping a tape that was classic but couldn't find it sort of talking about how great but also how obscure the trio's last project was then rich he goes on to say something about them being like the rap game Weezer and how he's dressed like Carlton he's the black ben Carson and the trio brings yet another barn burner with the song all this money another one of the year's best rap singles and Richie with his monstrous growl on this hook and just the instrumental these guys are unsigned what they're making most mainstream rappers sound like lit lit a cute fluffy kitties hey baby that's this track obviously a little funny a little tongue-in-cheek sort of about recklessly spending your money you could go on a spending spree to this track whether you have $2,000 in your pocket or two dollars in your pocket and from here the trio effectively sways between these powerful bangers and more nuanced cuts the song s on your chest is buttery smooth jazz wrap with some amazing fluttering horn samples complete with some pretty prominent little brother references right in the first verse very sweet very tasteful definitely a highlight and then all of a sudden they bust out with the song what's goodie which features this loud bang or off-kilter instrumental but most importantly one of the best features of the year from none other than cakes the Killa who brings all these braggadocious bars about sort of being a trendy socialite getting drink tickets in his Mishka hoodie I love his closing line saying that if you kiss the Don don't leave a hickey his voice gets pretty animalistic right there it's definitely one of the best performances on the mic I've heard this you so fast so intense so precise so energetic and then with the track girl with the gold wrist we have this sort of funky desert vibe going on this groove going on with the track that has these really prominent acoustic and electric guitar licks dudu boom one of the most unique rap beats I've heard this year the topic of the song being about this jaw-dropping woman at the club as grogs and Richie detail all these inner feelings of lust and desire infatuation and a bad decision making the 2016 interlude I like as well I typically roll my eyes when people sort of use the current year argument when they're sort of debating politics although I find this song to be sort of funny a little tongue in cheek as Richie sort of flatly says hey you know the you know you're not talking about where your family got their wealth you're not admitting that you're wealthy you know what that flag on your belt buckle means why are you pretending global warming isn't a thing I mean again as silly as I think the this go to argument is there are some things that just really it's sort of hard to believe that we're still doing this in 2016 now I will admit this is where the album wanes a little bit for me we have all Quiet on the west side which has a solid verse to kick things off I love the pitched sort of very deep chorus vocals on the track too reminds me of like an interesting ASAP mob or something but after this verse the song just turns into this like extended instrumental outro and I feel like there just could have been more and I have to give it to eenie meenie miney moe as my least favorite cut on the project although it's not like terrible and I think I've sort of grown to tolerate it a little bit I do like the lyrics I do like the verses quite a bit especially when Garage is rapping about what it takes to make it in the rap game but the tracks full-on blown out distorted in-your-face almost industrial flavored instrumental paired with the sort of incessant redundant Nursery Rhyme hook it's just not like the best pairing it get kind of old yeah yeah yo a little fast and this sort of industrially tinged sound is something that I feel like they return to on the song back then another banger sounds huge has this gigantic auto-tune chorus and thematically the song is not too much unlike that of a track by the same title once performed by one of the Great's Mike Jones sort of comparing the fact that people are obsessed with you want to mess with you want to have something to do with you now because you're successful versus back in the day when people were in that's not so much interested and I'm not so much sure I'm all that crazy about the weird auto-tune solo and sporadic drum solo an outro of the track still though love the song keep on slip in a very dark moment on the record with a fantastic feature from vic mensa whose verse is really an emotional roller coaster especially the point at the very end of his verse when he raps about trying to get his together working to make everything go right but as he tries everything just goes wrong everything gets worse and it's at this point on the album that I kind of wish that injury reserved maybe went down this road on one other track on here especially since some of the dreary er moodier cuts off of live at the dentist's office are some of my favorite songs of theirs period and I think that they pull this mood they pull this vibe off better than a lot of rappers today do they can go personal they can go heartfelt and it's actually you know legitimately compelling but I could sort of understand that they wanted to reach a new audience with this project that they wanted to hit people over the head with this project they wanted to deliver a a high octane experience with this project still the closure does satisfy as another personal moment on the project it's really triumphant moment it is in a way a feel-good moment but very sentimental to as the trio looks back on the long road that took them to where they are today there's some gospel vocal samples sort of fading in and out of the beat sporadically I like their inclusion although I'm not really all that happy about how they were treated I wish they were a little more prominent in the mix and it just got really I don't know moving as grogs and Ritchie started rapping about just their efforts and their family and their loved ones as Ritchie was referencing sort of you know writing a card his mother with rap lyrics on it to tribute her dancing in the kitchen dancing in the street as a young boy this one moment where he says it just sucks when I'm at your funeral and no one knew I existed the referencing his father's funeral but I ain't really tripping man that's family business had the same outfit on I graduated in because I heard you were fighting the doctors and they still made you miss it which at the time when I had first heard that lyric and really listened to it it really me up and I love Gragas closing line on this track when he says you know we took you to the dentist's office and now we took you to church on this new record over here I love this project I mean it's not a perfect record in my opinion I've been seeing a lot of people hype this album up and saying hey it's album of the year and honestly I'm really happy that some people feel that way because I think this is great and I think in a lot of ways this is a step up for injury reserve and regardless of how much I like this record or how much I don't like this record in comparison with live at the dentist's office I would love to see them do well because I do think they are an interesting creative force in the underground that I see no reason why your average rap fan wouldn't love a song like oh wouldn't love a song like all this money wouldn't love half of the songs on this project so hopefully this album spreads a little virally for them at the end of this year start of next year I like to sell them a lot some of their best material so far lands on this thing a few shaky tracks in the last third but nothing that really bucked me off of the album nothing that really had me disappointed with the project in general I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing try transition have you get in this injury reserve project a listen God I hope you have because it's the last best project of 2016 is the last great project

-U-BG__zpjU,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd here for another episode of on track with TNT our ongoing interview series with the good people of Skype and today's guest from Hamburg Germany it's Danny Brown Detroit rapper Danny Brown is an artist - I've been dying to do a formal sit-down interview with for a while and that's because in the hip-hop landscape of today I feel that he is one of the most unique artists walking most unique artists rapping and I feel like his latest album atrocity exhibition proves that even further with it being one of the most envelope-pushing dark and tortured rap records I think to ever be recorded so in this interview I'm looking forward to diving into this new record with him and finding out what is sort of been making him tick as an artist over the past several years since he released his last record old Hey Dude what's up woodland awhile since I seen you at least now I get to ask you a few questions just kind of see what's going on with you bags yeah all right well let me start with a your new album atrocity exhibition are there any sort of like direct pieces of inspiration that went into this album like that I mean you know I have a sneaking sort of suspicion that like you know and I know you're conscious of ol Dirty Bastard and I know you enjoy his music but like when he was in the booth but you know really going crazy on tracks and screaming his brains out I mean that sort of seemed to me to be like a bit of a piece of inspiration as well you know just like kind of create that same vibe that same sort of insanity in the booth I mean something I mean I wish I do it on purpose but subconsciously gear and this is like come from a lot of other people too like Jonathan Davis from core and funny is that for me I really like did I use do his vocal performances on follow-the-leader like I was a real fan of that so I kind of like take from that to you know think you know used to do his little rap thing to like here and there you know but and I so I kind of like adapt with that even that's why be real was on album too cuz be real was a huge influence on my flow and just that voice like having that voice I think I got that a lot from be real so I was real honor to Adam to get down an album that was just a really aha moment for me because even though I was conscious of Cypress Hill when I finally heard him on your record I was like holy like of course of course he's like an influence like it would only make sense yeah be real so huge it was like that first I presume I listened to it religiously like that was the days when we used to go by like the bootleg tapes 3 for $10 I Robot like Cypress Hill and like TLC I don't know I think maybe like I think it's black sheet probably something like that and I listened to that album religiously I didn't like you know but it's on like dr. green spelling and stuff like that came out like I just super looked up to what they was doing like even when he was doing like souls like soulless ass and stuff with DJ Muggs and stuff like that like they never really be in a daze from the west coast they didn't let they they region you know like like really dictate they music because you can put like Cypress Hill in the same bed as wu-tang which I listening to a lot at the time too so it wasn't that far-fetched for me to get into Cypress Hill then they had the rock influence too you know themselves like a lot of genre-bending like they was like one of the first festival rap artists to me so I really look at them as like trailblazers with it yeah it's sort of interesting during that decade they were just way more crossovers between rock and Gotham excuse me between rock and hip-hop definitely not as many as there are now it kind of seems like even though in the Internet age culture is just really kind of bleeding into itself in a lot of different directions it seems like rap and rock that separators come back and it's sort of like been like no we can't we can't have these two worlds collide and I think in a way it's kind of as a result of like for whatever reason people look back on on bands like Korn and they're like that was terrible we've never done oh it's like where I said we got a blank biscuit it's all that biscuit for me it's all Fred Durst for there so we go with it I was going to say I used to have that a follow-the-leader CD good and um there's this you probably remember it there's that song on there where the players and Jonathan Davis have a rap battle yeah there's not the best way then that second track is so but I don't know it's like it was great I know it's not great but like lyrically that track is so Doug I didn't even like to summarize QB that I wasn't a big fan of the show ice cube under either but I thought the song was the high point but yeah black fred durst but even if we want to look at me still had stuff like rage you know I'm saying rage get me I'm saying it straight to me and you know since moving down a little bit hip hop influences I would say so it has been good it has been so good with rage but I think we got a blank Raiders [Music] one more influence that I would like to maybe get your words on that a lot of people have brought up just in relation to the title of the album you know it are there some sort of JG Ballard or Joy Division sort of connections to be drunk or obviously of course is the Joy Division but I never read the JG Ballard book I skimmed through it I looked at it but the song come from if the title come from The Joy Division song because you know people get started getting caught up into this word I don't know I like I've meet a lot of fans and they'll just be like they care more about like my actual lifestyle and actual music so it started making me feel like a spectacle or something like people was taking it for a joke but everybody expects to get around me and I'm just going to be happy and it's all going to be hunky-dory and we're gonna do drugs together have a party but that's not what I'm about you know trying to turn it down a little bit you know yeah I mean you were you were old when you came out with old is there chance is there chance of doing a sequel older Danny Brown older uh no no because oh it's really bizarre so going back a little about going back to like the d'être state of mind stages like everybody talking about oh they could talk about side to but you know but really to me the album could have stopped after ready to go and you're not gonna put flow down at the end but then what you know I always had to put the icing on the cake a little bit you know this is like you know we're rapping you know you can t bar but you can become another artist look can you still go back and still have those styles you know like I want to still be able to be sharp enough to go and be able to do the low register points deep thought songs and still be able to have the high-pitched turn-up happy funny songs you know yeah I want to that's it either side so I gotta you know keep my story sharp on each a you know do you have a quick take on this perception that rap is just kind of a young man's game because I feel like that is solely kind of melting away as the genre is aging and you have more rappers that are 4050 and sort of getting up there and still sort of add it and still talented you know guys like Busta Rhymes still bring an incredible amount of talent and and technical skill to attract when he when he doesn't appearance I think it always was looked at like a young man's game but I think it's is a young band game but it should be policed by our elders you feel me like we still need some type of like I don't know we still need some type of guidance you can't lay if this is a young man game and his kids and if he is then what's going to happen in the future you know because I know me you know a lot of a lot of kids not growing up with fathers and a home so hip hop city fathers some of these rappers are they dad's like too short was my sex ed teacher you know to say he 40 was my life coach you daughter there who change taught me about religion and others is like so a lot of things I learned from rap music so how could someone your same age teach you some you feel them Sam so we got rappers so now I'm like you go look you got rapidly 40 now who's 49 years old about to be 50 you know and he's still doing some pretty relevant stuff you know so I just think it's all on the artist I think some time guys start thinking like that being you art it you start feeling old and you become old but if you you know like me I'm still playing video games watching cartoons so hey I don't think the bars is going nowhere fast with me you know they do you feel like there's truth to the assumption to the stereotype that younger rappers younger artists out there lyricism is just in the trash guys like little Yadier saying notorious b.i.g is overrated and you know all that 90 stuff is old hat and we shouldn't care about it anymore and we should just you know invent our own thing and do things by our own standards I guess I can't really speak on it in that sense because you know I'm in like some other and some of it is whatever you know but I got to give it time before I could just say anything we'll see five years from now you know because it'd be a lot of rappers they're you know you look at you praise and I won't even listen to them right now you know them saying so far is that it could be a trend it could be a phase it could be some real best thing I could say form is just a kind of just put their money where their mouth is because I feel like they just talk more than you know I'm standing show so I got us they got to stop talking and start coming with the product you know I'm saying because all you do is make the listen to your music with a negative approach you know like view saying biggy trash or whatever and I listen to your music I'm expecting it here so you don't say like I can't so the best thing for you to do is just put your Meno just let the music talk for itself you know kids know always talk you know but they gotta let the music I got say we're seeing five years we'll see in three years possibly you gonna say so oh well I will actually see it will actually see in six months they're not anybody's listen to their music you give it a six but that's why see for me I feel like I'm blessed in that sense where I can take three years to make a album you know and come back and steal you know people still same people that you know acknowledged me before still acknowledge you know you got a post recently on Instagram where you had said you know sort of the ideal artistic process or at least your artistic process you know kind of involves the stage of disappearing out of the limelight for a moment to do your own thing recollect reinvent yourself or reinvent your sound in a way and though you know also as a result of that you maintain a certain level of mystery because there was a while there where everybody was like where's Danny Brown what's Danny Brown doing like you know it's like what's going on with this guy we have heard from them in a long time yeah you know it's how important is that part of the process to be able to kind of sit back and just unplug from all of it I think I just had that from growing up in Michigan you know we have that four to five months out of here but we can't go outside just so cold we have to hibernate so I think I just got done just deserts I just steal them you can well run so I know they knows for five months I'm gonna be stuck in a house with us I'm going to do but work on music you know so they just get to the point where I'm just piling up piling up like even after this tours long as I feel home I'm just going to start back messing around and seeing what I got because I don't know how long it's gonna take for me to make the next one so I might as well get it going as early as I possibly can you know you know with your growth and popularity and and and the success that you've sort of gained so far has it been easy for you to sort of maintain and you know relationship with your home city and just sort of stay in touch with Detroit at least in the respective uh that's where you live or where you're living and and it's a place that inspires you I mean for the most part like I only hang out in Detroit too much like I go see my family dinner and then most of the friends that I have like their music friends to like if I go on tour they on tour with me so most of the friends that I have them time with them all the time so that's a different story you know but for the most part when I'm at home now I'm so tired I just wanna hang out at home because you know hang out with my cats you know and play video games and chill you know so far that though I always just like try to go and check out and see what them with the younger guys doing in the music scenes you know like I might every 90 and pop my head up at a certain little music spot that I know that's happening just to see what's going on but for the most part I only hang on so much Detroit's pretty dangerous yeah let it be you know so I know I really like back in you know them saying you have to be like Batman in Detroit you know we're gonna bring in a few guest colors over here they're gonna ask you their own questions hi I'm Mike from Birmingham ah we got the homie Mike in the house little bit you lit ready for Christmas yeah he's looking really nice it is real cold in Germany man you have to stay warm out here yeah it done in Hamburg you know he oh yeah I got a good I won't I won't talk about all the opportunities for fun in Hamburg let's just leave it there shall we I already know you lo how you doing I'm good good I want you to ask you a question if that's all right I am moving congratulations by the way on the album you are you it's it's it's the work of an insane person right that's it it's crazy I love it man I love like like when you when you came out like it sounded you obviously you brought the way that you talk you just felt like Detroit you know you brought all the the the Detroit stories straight out into people's faces but it feels like with this one you've brought the the music that they experimentalism mm-hmm of digital so glad you was able to see it because that's what exactly what I was going for with it man Thank You Man so does your dad still have any synthesizers nah man he don't he don't he kind of fell off with it but he still he'd you've been trying to get back in and been collecting vinyl again she's been a little bit so yeah so you've been trying to get back in but now I wish gift you had an old-school rolling it away on it but I don't know hey so uh how long is your your German tour um I go to acts I'll go to Copenhagen tomorrow I've been out here for I've been in Germany pray for like a week maybe oh no I

during everything right Oh noona spewed oh yeah what are trying to be here oh yeah I keep five days and then a six day they'll be a mixtape so did you get that jumper in Germany yes I got it from disability G an endorsement endorsement to follow growing up make bread Greg no I can't anyway no clues and a teach there you go yeah very proud no you know I'm ready whip out the sport coats and the Blazers you never saying with some nice loafers you know got a dress for the job you want next time you're in London hit me up seriously cuz because I want to teach you how to cold filter nurofen plus yeah yeah definitely weighted it up definitely with that sure gonna be back in London you know and you okay around encounters up man alright actually I want to move to London there was a good thing about getting apartment out there man yes listen come we got a spare bedroom and stay in a spare room Mike thank you for coming on we're gonna bring in all you have yeah yeah the other probe Mike you get unwilling to you [Music] alright next we have a few questions from Tavares from Ohio that's reverse no much great show at the grog a while back like uh Thank You Man don't get great hotdogs in Cleveland my question for you was what could you two keep creating and going the moat when things got kinda dark oh I guess that's like my only release like maybe if I was like I had like a therapist or like was able to do things right there I probably but I don't know that stuff like that I don't think we do stuff like that being what we from you know how to say we want us like as a therapist or shit like that so the only way for me to get it out is please like make music because I've made for that put that 30 seconds you in the booth you ain't thinking about no problems and you know a lot of the same like like probably the same the same shit people give them drugs you know where they can just do some and it just grind them to it you know if I'm a boob recording a song or if I'm on stage performance but that time I'm not thinking about no problems on that thing about what's going on so it was an easy escape it's a easy waiting release and get stuff out so even if I wasn't like you know like a rapper or whatever I still try to find some artistic where I can just like get out you know I probably been doing boxing or something I don't know you let him say I just got to get some type of release you know then rap motherly that's probably why I rap the way I rap I'm gonna move them they're dying half the time you know to see have to barely breathe you know there's what I people to understand where I rap with that high pitch that's me holding my voice just me holding my breath EXO second chunk in myself half the time you know so I doubted it I guess hey keep going that is trying to be a definitely best best thing I heard it here huh Thank You Man I worked hard on it man so I just you know I'm just humbled everybody else like it man you know because it was the wrist you know for me I felt like so I'm glad everybody liked it uh was there a specific turning point in your life or something or someone that sparked like your artistic past wrecked on me I always want to be a rapper but I guess the most important part was when I went to jail you know because before going to jail I was you know I'm a music nerd like everybody else you know and it's mom actually so I want to listen to the music all the time I don't want to listen to whatever kind of music I want to listen to what I want to listen to it and going to jail it wasn't like that I couldn't listen to I was listening to the top 40 radio whatever they play on the radio that's all you could hear and you know get these magazines that were it was like when Ghostface fish-scale came out and I would just read a review on coast exams like can't like in my hair trying to figure out what this could possibly sound like that is that was such a good album to miss I mean I got it when I got out of jail but it was it my heart to not be able to hear it you know what so I was like there's one thing that fuck the jail made me like maybe like I'm never coming back to this money is because I could listen to the music that I wanted to listen to and ever my heart more or anything so I think that drove me creatively cuz then now I had to get creative in my own way to try to be able to figure out what was feel going on in a world and get out and feel be able to rap and not sound like I got left behind to virus thanks for coming on and asking your questions dude thanks for having [Music] transition you've been watching on track with the needle drop our guest today was Danny Brown and if you want to watch our first episode featuring the great Alice Cooper click over here and don't forget to stay tuned for more episodes on this YouTube channel [Music] 
HldIcbmkLvg,this new post Malone album it's uh it's not good this day was going to come ever since I pretty much did a non review of mr. Malone's August 26 the mixtape I'd have to give an actual opinion on this person's music and now that the commercial debut is here unsurprisingly it's underwhelming ever since his big breakout single white Iverson I just have not gotten the appeal of post Malone I mean his music seems kind of okay to just zone out to while you're a high out of your mind like it's nice background music it's sort of airy and ethereal and melodic enough to just kind of hang back and you know just be wallpaper to some bump and trap rhythms but outside of that what makes him a compelling figure in the current musical landscape I wonder if his label even has faith in his musical career going forward because this thing is essentially a summer album that UMG essentially made him drop during the winter because this record probably would not have competed all that well this past summer or next summer and now that I hear the material here it's pretty obvious as to why you have tracks on here like broken whiskey glass as well as a go flecks these tracks that have kind of a guitar backing track hanging in the background hey man post Malone he's different man he plays some guitar listen it does not matter how many trap rhythms you throw behind that guitar and Malone's vocals doesn't matter how many effects you sort of throw on his voice at the core of these songs essentially what you're listening to is a cargo short wearing college-age bro who is strumming his acoustic guitar and crooning in the common area of his dormitory hoping some babes are walking by and just are totally blown away by his deep sad lyrics and immense talent then we have cuts on here like deja vu with Justin Bieber ever since hotline bling and ram's ChaCha every artist needs to come through with some kind of apical pop rap ballad that nobody is going to be listening to you by next year like almost a year later and white Iverson is on here I mean I guess it's one of the better tracks and the track listing there are a couple tracks on this thing where I really like the beat and I think the the tune on the course is actually pretty solid sweet catchy I like it but I feel like a loser listening to it but once I start reading into the almost totally irredeemable lyrics of this track and many others on here I'm quickly reminded that there's not really much to what I'm listening to it's pretty vapid and then we have cuts like cold which they're just far too many of on this project where Malone is trying way too hard to be Moody and with really nothing to be Moody over what's even worse is these moodier tracks are very spacious very minimalist which only serves as an excuse not to change up things on the chorus all that much and this one cut I fall apart which it's one of many cuts on here where the vocal track sounds like it was recorded at the bottom of a well or something or at the end of a tunnel I don't know why some of the vocal recordings on this record are so bad well on this cut in particular I feel like I'm listening to some kind of trap alternative R&B boney vert and if you caught my review of his latest record I'm not even a really big fan of the regular boney vert and this duet with Kalani there's absolutely no chemistry on this track both of them are just a flat emotionless cold fish on this song book my one hope on this record my one glimmer of hope to kind of pick things up and make this thing entertaining was Cuevas feature on congratulations but rather than come through with that hard-hitting migos flow he tries to sing pretty much in the same inflection and tune that Malone is and I just find his singing so insipid it's long it's drawly the melodies aren't even really that memorable or they're not even really that varied from one track to the next it's like his singing style isn't even really changeup is either doing these triplet notes that are kind of speedy or you just sort of smell things bad when I won no no and it's like he's doing the same thing on every track there's just nothing special about this album in my opinion and then the things that do make it stick out aren't necessarily good things I mean the inflection of his voice is subpar lyrics it's like he tried to write a bunch of white Iverson's and just hand the album in with a couple songs here and there that kind of changed things up but I don't think these acoustic cuts really reveal another side of post Malone or really sort of a bring him any depth as an artist and the song deja vu despite a feature from Justin Bieber has been one of the biggest duds of the year as far as a single from a major artist the song made 75 on the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one in New Zealand though New Zealand post Malone really needed to come through on this album and prove that he had some kind of staying power that he had some kind of artistic ability beyond the fluke of a hit white Iverson but I think he's really going to pan out as a one-hit wonder given the lack of compelling material on this album which 2016 just had to throw out there before the year was even out it's like hey 2016 is over let me just kick you in your ass on your way out it's not have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry

W4A0ViBBnrk,hi everyone bring thyn a death tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new absol album do what thou wilt absol Top Dawg entertainment zone abstract asshole one of the more interesting artists on the labels roster in my opinion and that's because he's a bit of a conundrum he's hard to categorize he's not quite as highbrow as conscious as a guy like Kendrick but it's not like he makes totally lowbrow or ignorant music either and I don't think he inhabits some kind of middle ground or middlebrow area with his Tunes either I actually think absol wordplay the way that he structures versus his one-liners are all really smart but he typically uses his talents to say something really trashy and kind of hilarious he's basically the kind of artist who would say something like this an atom is a molecule and atom was a mighty cone but if he would have never ate the Apple he'd be mad sad and would have never pulled the leaves off of Eve and seeing all that ass also this wonderful line over here that he says about the American flag is a doozy which doesn't seem to be a part of some kind of greater context or anything like that he just kind of puts that nasty little bar out there not to mention all the weird philosophical contradictions on this album absol seems to be on both sides of the aisle of a few different political issues most notably feminism or women's rights are just basically the treatment of women in general but this is an issue that he returns to numerous times on this album I mean maybe not so much that it's the concept but it's certainly the most prominent theme on this record and he talks so much about it even though some of what he says seems kind of ridiculous there has to be something to what he's he's trying to do on this record he has to be building some kind of point or at least maybe being purposefully inconsistent as a way to fuck with the listener he will write a song like threatening nature where in the lyrics he will question the fact that black women got the right to vote after black men but then he'll have no problem whatsoever with like sexually objectifying women on a later track even the song now you know ends with a pledge to the he-man women haters Club and women Naga me is one of the weirdest concepts for a track I've ever heard I don't even know if this is offensive or if it's progressed progressive I'm not even again sure absol were kind of smudgy on this record they're difficult to pin down I mean even on the song Braille as he repeats over and over on the refrain that everything's been done before nothing's original yada yada then he comes straight out to say but you've never heard it like this and even if it seems like absol is sticking to one idea or taking himself all that seriously on this album there are a couple spots toward the end of the record where he employs some serious conspiratorial stoner logic like on the track evil genius but for the most part on this thing absol is playing it sort of tongue-in-cheek and difficult to read like on the song invocation where he directly repeats lines from the track Bohemian Grove from his big breakout album control system and then immediately in the midst of repeating those lines repeating that refrain he stops himself he interrupts himself to say oh I have a heaven I've been here before haven't I said this before there are plenty of moments on this thing where he's creatively offensive as well like on this gem of a line back to reality sadly I'm actually Jewish or whatever Jewish to call me of course this comes right after a line about sucking Jesus's penis on Venus and there's a wonderful bar on the song beat the case where he raps about beating it beating it beating it like a runaway slave the lyrics on this record are highly quotable but they're all very kind of tasteless and have a similarly dark sense of humor kind of reminds me of Eminem's sense of humor from back in the day but of course updated for 2016 and tagged with the type of head in the clouds third eye otherworldly mindset that you can only get from ab-soul which even on this record itself he parodies a little bit like on the song wifey versus Wi-Fi where he makes reference to you texting him if you have your third I phone this album is is odd man it's weird just like absol it's difficult to pin down I don't feel like it's this conscious head II listen or anything like that but it's it's not a casual listen either this album is dense there are a lot of twists there are a lot of turns there are a lot of lyrics that even though they may be making a dirty joke once you get to the nitty-gritty of it you actually have to think of the bar you actually have to think of the lyrics and how the wordplay works in order to really get it there are all sorts of tracks on here where there's like a weird detour toward the finish that's actually pretty interesting some very experimental and progressive instrumentals odd flows now this isn't always for the best the song gods a girl feels kind of disorganized a shovel not all that well-structured meanwhile the track now you know is a little aimless in my opinion feels a little kind of redundant the verses don't contrast that well from the choruses but not every moment on this record is blatantly left-field there are plenty of tracks on this thing where the hook is really catchy or the flow is really catchy of the song raw that kicks the album off absol comes through with this kind of slow lumbering slurred flow that I remember pretty vividly from that waka flocka flame song mo n ey from his flock of le 1.5 mixtape which he might have gotten from somewhere else I'm not entirely sure most likely the case but that's what it directly reminded me of when I had heard it also Braille incredibly catchy Huey new then incredibly catchy and it feels like absol in a way is making more accessible music without sort of making those mainstream commercial music concessions that he did on these days I get that maybe in a sense he was trying to parody some of the mainstream rap that he was toying with on that record but it seemed like he was coming so close to making it in the midst of creating that parody that he was just making that music if you get what I'm trying to say here and as much as I didn't really care for these days I did come away from that project feeling like there was something to it still though trying to make something with a more commercial edge isn't something that absolutely given up which is most definitely the case on the track of the law with Mac Miller and Rhapsody and which features in the background a very glitzy glamorous jazzy smooth instrumental and then one of the other lead singles from the Trekker drugs is a super catchy track and not really a banger or an aggressive track or all that poppy of a cut in my opinion it's a very slow moody ballad that takes a rap singing angle that I wouldn't have imagined solo to pull off as well as he does on this cut it's very woozy it's very intoxicating I enjoy the sentiment of the song to his love his passionate love for drugs really comes through outside of that I don't know if there's much else I want to say about the record I do think generally the last third is the weakest point of the album some of the songs least likeable tracks and most messy tracks come through there and just generally in the second half I think the album starts off really strong features some of AB Souls best and most creative and off-the-wall material there are a lot of great ideas instrumentals and verses on this thing but I can't help but feel like he's so close to coming through with a concept maybe inadvertently that once he realized he was just on the precipice of doing something maybe about the gender dynamics in the modern age because again he does bring up the male/female thing quite a bit then maybe he should have just taken that full step and just done it but then again being preachy like that isn't really absol demo you know there are just a couple tracks on this thing I don't care for because there's not that much oomph or viscera to them they feel a little unfinished or the topic that comes through isn't all that clear or in the case of the last song on here ymf the flow is a goofy a little silly comes off kind of amateurish but for the most part I think absol has come through with a good project big improvement on these days takes more risks drop some clever and funny bars successfully pulls off making a record that is left-field is odd is kind of on the fringe but I think has a pop sensibility to it and hopefully moving forward he continues to challenge listeners with his mix of creative instrumentals thoughtful wordplay but a very dirty dirty words I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this album Tran then have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry Anthony Fantana

c_A7jwZypEQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new J Cole album for your eyes only North Carolina rapper dreamville figurehead a lot of people see him as sort of a bit of a jay-z protege as well but then maybe not right now at one point for sure but not now he is coming up to bat on this thing for his fourth full-length commercial album following up 2014's 2014 Forest Hills Drive which went double platinum with no features as the meme goes and with this new record over here I feel like I'm getting a bit of deja vu with Cole's last record once again he is dropping an album very late in the year he also teased toward this album like he did his last one with a pretty aggressive cut where he goes at other rappers I like the track a lot but it's kind of disappointing that the song didn't make it onto this record though but in retrospect after listening to this thing I I get why that song wouldn't have really fit into the narrative of this album I guess other parallels between this record and Cole's last album is that they are similarly low-key lots of very smooth jazzy instrumentals on this thing which are also paired with a handful of very nocturnal very Spacey track bangers to the beats are Pleasant but none of them really come off as all that urgent and the same kind of goes for Cole's very laid-back rapping and and moody singing which occasionally is is kind of off-key like what is it on that song vile mentality that the singing at the start of that track is terrible hmm sonically it's nothing groundbreaking for Jay Cole or for hip-hop in general but I do think some of the jazzy instrumentation and string sections that are paired with tracks like For Whom the Bell Tolls and she's mine are actually pretty gorgeous but the power of this album doesn't really lie in the instrumentals but the story the narrative of the album although I think the tale Cole spends on this record could have been told a little more cohesively basically on this album you have a young Jay Cole you have a friend of his from back in the day who died young dealing drugs which person Cole is rapping from the perspective of isn't always 100% clear but the most obvious part of this story is Cole's friend's daughter who is now fatherless Cole is essentially trying to tell her father story to her through this album he says as much on the final track where he goes into an incredible amount of detail the detail that in my opinion many of the previous tracks really lacked a lot of the songs before the closer he read more like vignettes and the title track is kind of like an epilogue that explains why all of these songs sort of makes sense on the same album but it's kind of strange that j cole would couch this whole album underneath the title track this story about his friend that he's trying to tell to his friend's daughter when a bulk of this album is just about jay Cole as much as I like a song like neighbors that track doesn't really seem to fit into this conversation that he's trying to have with her and there are other spots on this record where Cole goes into his own experiences with love and making bad decisions as a young man and also fatherhood specifically on the song she's mine Part two which in my opinion is the most touching moment on the record I appreciate the sentiment of this album as a whole on what is trying to say the point is trying to make but again I think it could have been told in a more compelling cohesive and logically flowing fashion and also with less filler lyrics like the intro track for Whom the Bell Tolls we have refrains on here where Cole is rapping about as whatever in his eyes and it should come as no surprise such an obvious rhyme such a filler lyric why should it come as no surprise it that makes no sense it adds nothing to what you're static that's just a placeholder bar still though the track does a decent job of setting the moody tone of the album and and sort of the dark tortured mentality of the fledgling drug dealer that Cole portrays on the next track immortal which features these gritty lyrics and these simple spacious trap rhythms and reverse melodies that are kind of hypnotic but immediately after on this track we have more filler lyrics kicking off the song deja vu put a finger in the sky if you want it put two fingers in the sky if you want it and so on and so forth does this mean anything but probably not and what this refrain has to do with the love song that transpires after it I don't know and course because it is a love song ended his coal there has to be a handful of like sort of cringy bars worked into the track but at this point on the album coal starts developing a story we have boy meets girl then he starts sort of revealing himself on the song vile mentality and telling her about himself and sort of revealing his vulnerabilities then the deepening of their relationship on the song she's mine part one which of course head games stronger than two excedrin I wanted to shut the album off still though I think the way that Cole is bearing himself to his lover on these tracks is sort of admirable and I like that we are getting some kind of story here that's building momentum but then it all sort of changes pace on the song change which I do think is one of the better cuts on the record but it doesn't really add anything to the story that's been building up for the past three tracks here again we get kind of a bird's eye view of the the drug game that Cole was rapping about on the song immortal and he sort of gives his thoughts on not only the vicious cycle that a lot of people might find themselves in if they enter into that world but also the prison system religion he's speaking on all of these obstacles and in Justices within the system but he puts responsibility for change on the individual talking about on the hook that you might expect change at the pen glide meaning that you might expect some rapper or someone like me to just write or spit a lyric that all of a sudden will just change things but that's not how it works change real change comes on an individual level it comes from within you I like the track a lot I think it's one of Cole's best tracks and it's really insightful smart and tasteful piece of jazz rap and again I like the really dark and moody song neighbors which is essentially about racism and stereotypes talking about Cole moving out of his old neighborhood into a predominantly or I guess a presumably white upper-class neighborhood where his neighbors think he's selling drugs so they call the cops on him which brings us to the song fold and clothes really the the worst track on the record not just because of the obvious statements and filler lyrics where Cole is rapping about wanting to do the right thing so much better than the wrong thing we know that we know that the right thing is is better than the wrong thing that's that's like saying the sky is blue really on this track Cole is making a mountain out of a molehill nobody's gonna give you a medal for doing the laundry dude and also your rapping about your girlfriend having a lot on her plate and having a lot to do but she's just sleeping on the couch they're not to say that she shouldn't be everybody deserves a nap but you know it just seems like an obvious contradiction to the story that you're telling and I do the laundry at my house when I do I don't got to write a song about it it's just hilarious that Cole brings up doing the laundry after saying he feels like the best version of himself like whoa the the greatest version of me folds clothes like this is really you at your best watching Netflix hanging out on the couch rhyming almond milk with almond milk this is just regular life for a millions of Americans in 2016 this is not an act of heroism I get that the song is about the simple things in a way sure but Cole goes about portraying them in such a corny fashion that it's just such a skippable track and that's pretty much the album even though it's over 40 minutes it feels criminally short for the issues for the the pieces of story the pieces of narrative that Cole is trying to develop here the execution is just way off because I think for what Cole was trying to build and accomplish here there are just too few moments directly and laser focus on the life of Cole's friend on Cole's friend's daughter on communicating these messages to her on young Cole's life the only reason this album makes a lick of sense is that the closing track sort of wraps it all up and explains hey here's here's at what this album is actually about guys despite all this I do think this album is one of Cole's better projects it's just kind of a mess really Cole has a lot of loose ends that really needed to be tied up and they just aren't I feel like he wanted to or at least he was implying as if he was going to bring the listener on some kind of journey into his life or his friend's life or into his past but instead we got like a few weird scrawled diary entries that are barely legible and a weird track about folding clothes I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best or should I review next hit the like

XXmMojUmFwg,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is look look at me looking toast see you guys um this is our weekly track roundup where I go through a series of songs that to me were the best tracks of the week the songs that was kind of indifferent toward me and the songs that I felt were the worst tracks of the week before we get into this segment as usual want to shout out the amazon associates link down there in the description anything you buy on Amazon after you click on that link if you live in the u.s. of course we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price use it to buy some stuff you were going to buy anyway it's Christmas time it's the holidays get some presents with it y'all alright let's get into the roundup over here first I want to give a shout out to King Ghidorah 'he's snake-charmer mix on the solid steel podcast solid steel radio program if you didn't know that's a pseudonym of mr. MF DOOM it's MF DOOM guys dem f doom and in this mix you can not only hear like a bunch of MF dooms like music that he enjoys but also they're like reworked versions of popular songs and like some I guess unearthed material in there as well that you're not going to hear anywhere else at least to my knowledge so all the MF DOOM fans all hardcore MF DOOM fans give that little podcast segment to listen and also if you can subscribe to solid-steel because i always put out some good stuff alright let's get into the worst tracks of the week only a couple over here don't want to overload you guys with terrible songs you know what I mean I'm just trying to get the newest of the new the worst of the worst I'm not trying to bully anybody here guys okay I'm just like trying to pick what's what's sort of the the cream of the crop what's rising to the top in terms of the worst and for me this past week it definitely was one that new Shia LeBouf freestyle which is link down there below along with all the other tracks would be talking about here it's it's terrible I know that you guys are probably like well Anthony he's not a rapper and that that is true he is not a rapper and yet we we keep hearing and seeing recordings of him rapping and this is another one of them and of course it's bad the rhymes are corny his flow and tempo is off he has no delivery to speak of and yeah in a word terrible but even worse than that my least favorite track the worst track of the week is this new duet for if I use the word loosely from Zayn and Taylor Swift this track called I don't want to live forever which apparently is on this new extended version of the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack like there weren't enough songs associated with I don't know this this movie the story that middle-class housewives and bored people use to kind of you know spice their lives up a little bit just to think about kinky sex so of course you know we need to add more music to that we need to add more fuel to that fire and this new awful Zane Taylor Swift collaboration is a the latest installment of that the vocals are bad the beat is super cheesy it's corny its overblown they're trying to make it like this big presentation like whoa isn't this epic it's really not and in my opinion Zayn and Taylor Swift no chemistry no reason they should be out of track anywhere near each other and this this song basically confirms that so uh yeah I don't know let's let's let's just spare ourselves from diving any deeper into that and move on to the new segment of the songs that I definitely want to recommend to you guys I'm not like head over heels from I don't think they're amazing but you know III think they're worth checking out there is a new Saint Seneca song called all the best which is off of a new EP on anti records I believe check this thing out if you're into some kind of low-down dirty kind of rough around the edges funky indie rock the tune to this track is pretty solid and I just like how you know quirky and textured all the instrumentation sounds on this thing it's enjoyable ii messy moving on from their lunch money lewis the song ho featuring ty dolla sign i have a love-hate relationship with the song it's corny as hell and it's not in good taste however the whole idea of turning the word ho into an acronym which stands for heaven on earth and turning that into a love song to me in a word genius so and the tune of the track isn't too bad either and of course you know ty dolla sign is on it so you know there going to be some good singing vocals on there you know there's gonna be good vocal performance and lunch money Louis isn't bad either so you know uh proceed with caution you know don't expect too much from this one I guess the D the excuse me the Jesus and Mary Chain damage and joy not a bad song I'm not really carrying all that much for the kind of puttering tiny little sequenced electronic percussion beats hanging in the background but I do think the tune is okay the guitar sound textured and interesting the Jesus and Mary Chain are putting out their first album in about 18 years in March of 2017 so pretty exciting not a bad start with this track over here I'm not predicting they're going to come back and drop their most amazing record ever but this song is not disappointing so that's pretty good you know for a comeback record for comeback standards these days moving on from there we have bonobo with break apart featuring rye if that's how you say that I'm still not completely sure and this is you know bonobos chill laid-back kind of electro acoustic production sound but topped with some you know very soft sophistical 'z which are pretty beautiful it's a nice track it's very pleasant on the ears if you're looking for something to chill out - someone's going to maybe I guess a quench that fire in your soul and just kind of you know soothe that savage beast give this thing a shot and if you want to actually encourage the savage beast to go even more savage I would listen to this Advent song called weight of the world found this track via Stereogum shoutout to the good people of Stereogum this track is some metalcore that is super hard super heavy some really good guitar embellishments on this thing it's not just kind of this trash bash wham bam thank you ma'am kind of thing there's actually some great guitar lines in this thing and the vocals are super aggressive the grooves are super mean and apparently this thing is a part of a new EP that the band is going to be dropping next year I don't know just looking forward to hearing the whole thing because this track it's it's off to a good start so shout out to these guys for a quality metalcore track that does not make my eyes roll in 2016 alright moving on to what I feel are the best tracks of the week got to give a shout out to the experimental progressive metal outfit corrales for the song hate power this is a new Adult Swim single didn't these just used to be like summer singles I feel like they're just continually dropping these singles forever now like Adult Swim singles or is that a year is it has that become a year-round thing it's it's December has that become a year-round thing if it has please let me know because this track hate power is actually very nutty it's dense it's intricate like a Kraus song should be like you would expect from a Kraus track and it's very aggressive and that that's kind of the turn that they took with their last project which I am enjoying and I'm hoping they sort of go further down that road that this track isn't just a leftover it may be though moving on from there yg with the song true featuring little Wayne with production from t minus and boy Wanda on this one this track is a little glitzy it's a little glamorous maybe it's little too clean for my taste and I'm not that crazy about the fact that little Wayne goes first but still it does kind of have that old-school West Coast groove to the baseline and and YG's performance on this track is pretty good I just wish little Wayne came through with something a little better you know that's that's all I wish but I do I do like this track I do think it is one of the better rap songs of the week as is this new vic mensa freestyle the heathens freestyle which is nasty vic mensa i think he's great when he goes down this road when he goes down this sort of grimy like really lyrical road and i'm hoping that he sort of heads down that path more with his future material and that this song is basically the reason why you know i think he's come out with some good stuff though the cover on this thing does weird me out a little bit what what is he doing what is he doing I'm not totally sure but it is attention-grabbing and you know we need people doing things that are attention-grabbing in 2016 moving on from there the band yucky duster from infinity cat records this was also a track I found out from Stereogum this was a song we premiered over there the song elementary school dropout is not only fun melodically but hilarious lyrically this is kind of a bit of a slacker indie rock tune that's very quaint very silly very tongue-in-cheek very ironic but it is a lot of fun a lot of personality to this track enjoyed what the band was doing quite a bit on this one and it has me curious as to what they're going to be dropping next year on infinity cat records because they do sort of have a very playful attitude that I like quite a bit that comes through in spades on this song moving on from there absol with the song drugs which is one of the more tuneful and ballad like songs absol has ever dropped didn't really see that one coming on the song he sings about how he loves his mom and he loves this and he loves that but he really loves drugs so if you're not really into a intoxicated sort of slurred very moody but very melodic drug anthem I would avoid this one but I actually like this track quite a bit I do think it is one of his more compelling songs and I did not think he had it in him to write a song that's melodic and have it come out this good so I actually am very pleased with this track and a couple more at the drive-in with governed by contagions at the drive-in are back Cedric and the gang are back Omar and the gang are back and I don't know it's actually like them really sort of returning to form in a lot of ways coming through with that very fast very speedy very progressive and a very energetic and uppity sort of punk progressive rock emo fusion that the band has always been known for and I do think the I don't know the lyrics are a little much a little conspiratorial maybe a little cringy at points like especially that line about the biting into the cyanide tooth but I do generally think this is a good track from at the drive-in and it has me psyched for the album they're going to be dropping next year the performance is great as far as the drums and ours and bass all really tight all really relentless high-energy and not really too many other complaints about this track and finally we're going to end it off with the song Terminator with a little yachty and ASAP ferg which is a hilarious track little yachty and ASAP ferg i'm really happy to hear both of these guys on a track because in my opinion they are two of the most fun and goofiest rappers working today and i feel like on this track they really sort of enhanced one another's goofiness a lot the beat on this thing bangs of course given that a little yachty and ASAP ferg it has to and the whole repetitive refrain about you know the terminator and all that shit is very fun funny too so yeah I'm going to leave it at that and those are all the tracks that I wanted to recommend to you guys

zAlIMc8I0ZQ,hey guys hitting you with another quick review today and I'm just going to talk quickly before the year is out about the new blank Banshee record I have like a short Twitter video plan for this thing but there's really too much on this record going on just to kind of like cast it off or just kind of say one thing about it and then just you know that's kind of it I mean for me it is an interesting record but it's also a flawed record what makes it interesting is I think compositionally there's a lot going on here like there's an incredible amount of detail in these tracks and I like the way that blank Banshee sort of mixes elements of trap music but also like ambient music to like the sound of these tracks super smooth like very new agey to the point where it turns me off a little bit like not so much into that smoothness not so much into that like raw MIDI sound that it sounds like blank Banshee is playing with I'm pretty much all these tracks although I do like those songs those tracks really do stick out to me where Banshee is playing with them like some vocal samples or something you know kind of chopping them up for like a really funky interesting and noisy effect I believe the second track on the record is actually one of the grinding and hard hitting on the entire thing so Banshee can go aggressive on this record and occasionally does but most of the album is super smooth super easygoing you know you can really kind of zone out to it it falls into the background but it's detailed enough that if you were to give it your full attention you would get something out of it but again I'm not so much that into the smoothness and I do think the the constant raw MIDI vibe of a lot of the Tambor's and drum Tambor's on this thing do give it kind of a one-dimensional feel and then the other thing about the record is that some of the songs are painfully short like pretty much every track is like one minute to two minutes and change and I feel like with there being such a high amount of detail in a lot of these tracks they could have gone longer you know there could have been more especially since a lot of the endings on this thing are super abrupt I do think this is a another piece of evidence or you know another piece of the ongoing trend within the vaporwave community because a lot of people will sort of classify this as a vapor wave record call it a vapor wave record I think this is another piece of evidence that vapor wave has been diversifying has been trying new things has been growing has been maturing and I think is is getting more interesting you know they're moving away further away from the stereotyped slowed-down R&B samples and the marble busts on the album cover or whatever and blank Banshee initially like when when this rug like banshees debut record broke on YouTube like I believe that was a YouTube and VanCamp of part of what made that record spread so virally mixing elements of vapor wave with trap that was like sort of a pretty much a breaking point for like over way you can do other things like there are other tentacles to this monster you know and blank Banshee continues to push forward even though I think at this point that there's not too much of a vapor wave vibe going on on this record I mean sure you know there is again that kind of that raw MIDI sound there is a sort of New Age vibe to it but uh but outside of that you know this to me is like some IDM in a lot of ways without detail than sort of a nutty a lot of the compositions on this thing are but again it sort of has that that Spacey Varia glassy and chill laid-back aesthetic to it to the sound that you know that I think a lot of vapor wave fans will vibe with sort of regardless of what the compositions are doing and yeah that's the sort of my take on this album I think it's interesting I think it's pretty good I'm not crazy about it's not anything that you know I feel like I would return to anytime soon but you know giving it a sort of four or five lessons all the way through I came way like yeah pretty impressed you know it definitely felt way less I don't know gimmicky or sort of way less of a really obvious fusion of one world in another world like the debut did you know it definitely feels like there's a bit more variety on this record as far as like the compositional styles amongst these tracks I just wish a lot of them were sort of them developed more and fleshed out a little bit more and yeah that's my take on the on the record if you guys are given this album we'll listen let me know what you thought of it did you let hate of why and I will catch you guys in the next review list week coming up soon forever 
__PxaWntvhg,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here you know it isn't you with a couple quick impromptu reviews today this one record that I want to recommend to you guys is from a Brazilian band by the name of meta meta their new album is titled mm3 and jazz fans need to take notice jazz fusion fans need to take notice and jazz rock fans need to take notice on this one because this is a pretty gritty hard-hitting record in those Styles I wish it was a little more improvisational it's not quite as improvisational as I would like but the guitars super crunchy and very nimble very active the drum grooves are nice and a very punchy we have the horns which are actually like very smooth and then sweet sometimes pretty wild and the lead vocals which are really sort of like the the star of the show in my opinion are absolutely gorgeous sometimes very fiery and passionate though they really convey quite a bit of emotion obviously there's a bit of a language barrier for me personally but you know it doesn't really take away that much from the music in my opinion some great performances very tight performances on this thing so really amazing sort of melodies can composed on this record some of the some of those sort of themes melodic themes written on this song on this album are really nice and I'm not really sure what else to say about it other than that I just wanted to quickly kind of recommend this thing to you guys you know there are a few moments where maybe the smoothness of the vocals doesn't quite match the bustling instrumentation in the background and the closing track features a male vocal I guess from another member of the group aside from the the female vocals that actually are on every other track and they are not as not as skilled the the vocal performance on that last track where they do that so I'm not exactly sure I mean they wanted to I guess do a bit of a change of pace for the final song on the album we think it went over all that well but aside from that there's not really anything on the album the sticks out is bad like a sore thumb you know there's actually like a really quality really solid record again if you're in a jazz fusion you want to hear sort of an ensemble of drums vocals guitars a little bass in there too and sex playing in a very fiery passionate way I was a very straightforward rock rhythms but of course like they do a really good job of working in some Brazilian music as well some of that Latin American jazz and dance music sort of seeps its way into some of the grooves and in some of the tracks on this thing in a really interesting way which of course gives these guys a bit of a unique angle bit of a unique vibe and sound that not a lot of jazz fusion groups have so I definitely go into this record expecting that expecting a bit of a you know South American Spice there that you wouldn't get anywhere else on that you wouldn't get from any other band sort of playing with these styles of music and again other than that there's not really anything else I want to bring up about this record link down there in the description where you can check out some of the music from this thing again I recommend it jazz fans jazz rock fans jazz fusion fans this is a must listen before the year is out I'm not saying it's going to sort of just climb up to the top of your list or anything like that but there are a lot of good things about this record the band clearly you know is a rugged tried and tested on their third album I believe here and then three I hope that's a you know that assumption is correct and so they're clearly not going anywhere and what they're doing right now is super good and I can only imagine that from here they can only improve so again link down there to the description so you can check out the music from this record out and enjoy let me know what you thought of this record if you gave a listen let it hate it why and you're the best catch you guys in the next review forever 
4dp6INLTdho,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and y'all know what time it is it's Grammy season everybody yay it's time for us to get pissed off when the artists that we like doesn't get a Grammy because the Grammys are all about popularity and politics not so much about talent and artistic vision but still I'm going to go through some of the major categories in the 2017 Grammys and talk about who's eligible who I think is going to win and who I would like to win let's do it in the album of the year field this year seems like we have Adele with 25 Beyonce with lemonade purpose Justin Bieber views from Drake and a sailor's guide to earth from Sturgill Simpson the left-field totally out of nowhere nomination in this category now as you guys may already know I have reviewed all the records in this category over here and though I did like the Adele and I do think the Sturgill Simpson album is great I personally am pulling for Beyonce and I think Beyonce will win although I will not complain if Sturgill wins I will not complain Fadel wins however I will consider jumping off of a bridge if Bieber or Drake gets it record of the year we have Adele with hello Beyonce with formation Lukas Graham seven years Rihanna featuring Drake work and stressed out from 21 pilots and personally I'm pulling for Beyonce again on this one I do love formation although I would not complain if Adele's hello ended up winning this one is that was a huge song this year I would argue maybe even a little bigger than formation the Rihanna track is trash II and I do not want to see the song win the Lukas Graham track is overly sentimental and very Chloe don't have anything to do with that track and two twenty one pilots let's go to the next category now I want to talk about the best new artist field over here which some people are kind of mad about that there being a few snubs in regards this there are a lot of new artists every year or sort of new artists coming up every year so I can understand some people not being happy about all the nominations here but we Kelsea Ballerini the chainsmokers chance the rapper Maren Morris and Anderson Peck I think chance the rapper is likely to win in this category or the chainsmokers because they have been pretty huge this year in the electronic field however I personally am pulling for Anderson PAC I will not complain if chance wins though in the pop field we have Best Pop Vocal album where I am actually pulling for Adele against Justin Bieber ariana grande Demi Lovato and SIA and I also think she will end up winning that category too the best dance electronic album filled is pretty interesting this year as well with submissions from flume foreskin we have Joel Michel Jarre with electronica one The Time Machine Tycho's epoch underworlds a new record Barbara Barbara we face a shining future and Louie Vegas Louie Vega starring the two 20:28 in Roman numerals just because I do appreciate him as a figure and I did like some of the tracks on his new album I would like to see jar win it although if we are going to talk about a contemporary winning this one I think flume is is the way to go and um he seems to be the hippest in this whole field here so I wouldn't be surprised if you walked away with the award now we have the best rock performance category over here we have Alabama Shakes with Joe Beyonce with Jack White on don't hurt yourself David Bowie's black star disturbed with the sound of silence god that is an awful cover how did it get nominated and then 21 pilots of heathens personally pulling for David Bowie hoping David Bowie wins this one even though he's not with us but symbolically it would be fantastic and that is an amazing song black star to me is the most amazing song in this list although beyonce is probably most likely to win it because the Grammys just want to probably give Beyonce all nine of her nominations and just sort of get that image of Beyonce just carrying all the Grammys and the Grammys are just falling out of her arms as she's walking down the red carpet that's a good photo op for the Grammy so I'm sure that they want to try to do that or sort of get as close to that image as possible so again pulling for David Bowie Beyonce is likely won't complain if she wins because I do not mind that don't hurt yourself with Jack white best metal performance though interesting field this year we have Baroness Gojira Korn Megadeth and periphery all in the same category personally I want Baroness to win shock me amazing song and purple is an amazing album one of the best metal records of the past couple years but very surprised to see Gojira in here good for them first Grammy nomination for them Korn obviously not a huge fan of the Korn record hated that new Megadeth and periphery not really a fan though you know I do appreciate what the band is doing for the most part and I'm sure their fans are excited the best rock song field is pretty intriguing as well as we have David Bowie Radiohead james hetfield lars and obviously a Metallica for hard wired we have Tyler Joseph songwriter 21 pilots for heathens and we have my name is human from the band highly suspect I wouldn't be upset about it going to really a lot of these songwriters I mean of course David Bowie the Radiohead song would be great because that is a fantastic track it would be cool to see Radiohead walk away with a Grammy this year and also hard wired I love that Metallica song off their new record so uh no reason not to celebrate that too although the Best Rock Album filled hautboy starts off with blink-182 we also have caged the elephant in there Gojira again for Best Rock Album panic at the disco and Weezer with Weezer aka the White Album personally only album I loved in this list was Weezer's White Album the blink-182 album should not even be in this category please just take it out please God Jesus Jesus take it out the cage the elephant record I thought was okay Gojira again good for them you know I wouldn't mind them grabbing that Grammy that would be really fantastic for them I wasn't a fan of their new record but it would be really cool to see them get it and Panic at the Disco is is basically just Brendon Urie and friends at this point and not not really that fantastic of an album in my opinion pulling for a Weezer I think Weezer might get it guys I think Weezer might get it or the Grammys might play it super safe and super stupid just throw it to blink-182 now we have the best alternative music album over here in this field we have Bone Iver David Bowie PJ Harvey Iggy Pop and Radiohead really nice field really good picks over here though there are alternative records I would have liked to have seen instead in here maybe a few up and comers that I think could have gotten this spot but still interesting field pulling for David Bowie again though I wouldn't mind a Radiohead I wouldn't mind Iggy Pop you know I wasn't crazy about the new PJ Harvey record but I wouldn't mind to see her walk away with it either and even Bon Iver although he has won a Grammy before yeah you know what I don't want boney Verta with this Grammy get him out of here get this guy out of here David Bowie is my favorite out of all of them but I would be happy with a great deal of these artists walking away with this one and again this might be a year where David Bowie ends up winning a lot of Grammys because of just the fact that he's passed away he's this legend his latest record is an incredible contribution to rock music I guess my one gripe those that maybe he wasn't so alternative or alternative enough for this category I mean it is a strange record that's a given but David Bowie is a legend at this point he's a huge star I would argue maybe even a little too big for this category you know what I mean in the best R&B performance field I think rihanna is probably going to take it although I am personally pulling for Solange and on the best urban contemporary album it's either going to go to Beyonce or it's going to go to Rihanna although me personally I am pulling for Anderson PAC and even gallant walking away with our gallant walking away with the rogue award would not be a bad thing we move on to Best Rap performance over here and we have no problem with chance the rapper and little Wayne and 2 Chainz love that track Panda from designer of course one of the biggest songs of the year pop style with Drake featuring the the throne all the way up with Fat Joe Remy Ma featuring French Montana and infra red kind of surprised that that song is sort of inserted its way into this and that part with schoolboy q featuring Kanye West personally would love to see no problem win it I think Panda a definitely has a shot because it was such a huge song this year and the Grammys just love to pass Grammy over to whatever the most popular thing is even if it's not even really that great pop style with Drake God don't give it to that it's not even that good of a rap song and the throne barely contributed anything to the track all the way up not really that crazy about it and I'm not that nuts about that part although it would be cool to see schoolboy q with a Grammy now this one is interesting the Best rap/sung performance so if you're rapping but there it's also sung there's also sung and some Beyonce freedom with Kendrick Lamar pretty great track I would be happy to see that track take it hotline bling though featuring a you know yeah boy yeah boy Drake love that song broccoli with DRAM featuring lil yachty love that track to ultralight beam I like that track it's one of the better cuts off of the life of Pablo and then famous with Kanye West featuring Rihanna so basically to to Kanye West's tracks in this one category kind of surprising but whatever um and I actually wouldn't mind seeing any of these songs take it I think they're all great songs although if I had to pick one I love that DRAM song love that dream song so much it's so stupidly good I I would I'm pulling for that DRAM track although I think Kanye or Beyonce is probably going to take it or Drake it's it's really more likely it's going to be one of those three especially since Kanye is nominated twice huh a lot of these same songs are also nominated in the Best Rap song category so even if you don't win the Best Rap performance you could still win that best rap song and as far as Best Rap Album we have coloring book from chance the rapper the new De La Soul record major key from dj khaled Drake's views school boys blank-faced LP crazy that that got nominated really good and then also a Kanye West's the life of Pablo now let's scratch off views get it out of here it's not even that much of a rap record it's not even a good album stop pretending it's good Grammys stop I wasn't crazy about blank-faced but I wouldn't mind seeing blank-faced take it Kanye West could take it although I think it is one of his most odd and difficult to digest records so it might be hard to sort of celebrate that album with a Grammy I think a much more accessible record like chance the rapper's coloring book will be more likely to take it the De La Soul nomination is a good nod it's nice that it's symbolic and they're referencing that the fact that they are this classic very seminal very important group but I don't think they're likely to take it dj khaled could take it although I think I'm you know lyrically and instrumentally their superior albums here as far as the best country album category I'm pulling for Sturgill Simpson that is a great record though I would not be surprised to see Keith Urban take it and I also want to congratulate my dude Mitch Grassi on their pentatonix nomination in the best country duo/group Performance category yeah and those are basically all the categories that I wanted to address in this video that I wanted to sort of tell you guys who I'm pulling for and guess who I think will most likely win I hope you guys enjoyed this video and feel free to have an argument about these double Grammys down in the comments track Charitra true transition and those are my 2017 grammy picks everybody i know there are more categories of some of which have artists in them that I'm well aware of as are you but I didn't want to go through every single category I just wanted to touch down on the major ones I'm sure you guys appreciate that and if you are familiar with my reviews and my preferences you probably know who I'm pulling for in those particular categories anyway so yeah again let me know what you think about all these nominations down in the comments who got snubbed and who do you think's going to win and all sorts of other videos next to my head that you should check out and to subscribe to the channel official website as well and that's it forever 
9pXNow58ECU,ah hi everyone cold in the cache Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new common album black America again Chicago rapper actor we're assist extraordinaire ultimate poet cool guy voiceover commercial man common is back with a new album this guy has been at it since the 90s and in that time span he has dropped some of the smartest and most thoughtful hip-hop records in the genre and he is still sticking to his socially conscious guns in this third act of his career I was especially excited to hear him do that on this new record of his because I figure he's got to be reaching some kind of socially charged apex here given that the title is black America again also it's been a very contentious two years for race relations in America since Commons last record with all these stories of police brutality on the news the rise of black lives matter Donald Trump's rhetoric over the course of the election cycle the growing popularity of identity politics and the mainstream so I went into this thing expecting common to go into this deep dive dissection into a lot of these issues the country has been dealing with but ended up feeling disappointed in just how disconnected and impersonal common feels toward his subject matter on this album and it's not like there aren't moments on this album that aren't thoughtful and aren't politically charged or aren't great track songs like home and the title track black America again are some of the best songs I've heard calm and put out in a while though I will say the title track on here kind of feels like a poetic social injustice laundry list more than it does like Commons personal take on anything that he's actually referencing from Trayvon Martin to Sandra bland common mentions a lot of things because there's a lot of things to mention there's a lot of things worth mentioning but he doesn't really unpack any of it and maybe that would be excusable if he did that on the deeper cuts of this record I mean black America again I feel like is a worthwhile track if this is sort of the summation of all these issues that he's going to go deeper into later but after this tract common just detours into a series of really doughy neo-soul ballad some of which are so lovesick that they're hard to listen to the song loves star with Marsha Ambrosius I think will make even the most hardcore common fans roll their eyes a track that's not only awkward because of its oddly lovey-dovey lyrics but also because common raps on this song with the same volume and tone that he does on one of his more political tracks on this record it's like he has no appreciation for just like you know switching it up a little bit because you're you know subject matter is totally different he's rapping about being in love like it's an urgent political issue the instrumental though is disappointingly sleepy as it is on the song red wine - another moment that sort of slows down the momentum of the record and feels completely I guess unnecessary with lines like lying on the king like Simba good though I will say the track unfamiliar with PJ who really saves the hook on this cut is actually the best love song on the album and really maybe the only love song that the album needed not that some of the more thoughtful politically charged tracks are any better like the song pyramids which has a really weak filler hook which is just like a redundant old dirty bastard sample recycled again and again there's an odd lyrical reference on this track to common being a hero but a sandwich and a bar after that about being gluten free also on this track on ironically he rhymes the words lyrical and miracle right next to each other but the track on this record where I think comment puts his foot in his mouth the most is the song the day women took over which is an honest-to-god true blue simp anthem and as complementary as the track is in a lot of ways common essentially boils women down to just being these supreme perfect beings that are just sugar and spice and everything nice and theorizes that if women were given total control all the world's problems would just they just melt away also hilarious bar on this track about Beyonce's music starting the revolution even with the song freedom on Beyonce's last record she is nowhere near revolutionary also the track is with these stupid references to opening the door and leaving the toilet seat down as if serious issues that women have throughout the world can just be boiled down to these social pet peeves his take on women just lacks the diversity and the flaws that their male counterparts have he sort of just puts them on a pedestal on this track which is not really good for the social status of women either it's kind of like the whole nice guy side of the sexism coin now once these cornball floodgates are open common has to drop the song reign with John Legend which is just painfully glitzy and commercial I absolutely cannot sit through the song without like cringing although the song little Chicago boy is this fantastically personal take from common on his own father who grew up in Chicago we have lines on here about him being a young boy lines about the immense influence he had on common as he was raising him both philosophically and musically making reference to a moment when he bought him Grandmaster Flash's the message and though I do think Tasha Cobbs is a formidable singer I really wish that the album had brought more lyrics from common on the back end of the track instead of just kind of verging off into this instrumental break and an vocal passage and the song led her to the free The Closer of this album circles back to the kinds of themes that you would actually expect from an album with this title it's actually a supremely powerful moment where common turns a lot of these racial and justices he was referencing earlier into poetic gold asking questions like is the US ever going to be us and drawing parallels between slavery and mass incarceration you know it's not really that I disagree with Commons philosophy it's that I don't really think he went that deep into his philosophy on a lot of these tracks much of it seemed somewhat surface-level and he didn't give a lot of personal perspectives on a great deal of it that is when he was actually rapping about these socio-political issues there's some very powerful and politically charged moments on this record that I like a lot but for every track that is like that common whips out a dud or a neo-soul snoozer which leaves me feeling kind of indifferent to this album because it is wildly inconsistent I'm feeling a decent 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're mad all sorts of links next to my head other videos subscribe to the channel and the website hope you're doing good stay hydrated common forever 
IDYBhw_UTpQ,uh hi everyone disgusting mustache here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly roundup where I go over the albums that I love the most over this past month and links to music from these albums and reviews my reviews of these albums are down there in the description and yeah let's get into it we only have a couple here because it's slowing down it's the end of the year some of these albums are actually from earlier in the year and I was kind of playing catch-up a little bit but the newest and latest of the album's I want to recommend to you guys in this list the new a Tribe Called Quest album we got it from here thank you for your service jazz rap legends A Tribe Called Quest are back on this fantastic comeback album god is it good in my review I even said it is the hip hop album of the year I still I still kind of stick by that you know I we will see if that statement pans out completely once I finally put up my urine list but this thing is incredible hands down no question one of the best records of this year and I don't know I don't know what else to say I mean it just kind of sounds like q-tip and company don't don't miss don't don't miss a beat on this thing you know it's like the past 20 years have not been spent pretty much silent the Fife dog versus on here great you know the multiple appearances from consequence and Busta Rhymes are good they definitely add a lot to the record and the feature list on this thing is really impressive as well so you know kudos to a tribe called quest's you know sucks it had to be their last record but you know it's a good album the next the new kero kero veneto album which is titled bonito generation in my opinion one of the most fun and playful pop albums of the year a lot of interesting cross-sections of musical styles on this thing everything from house music - hip hop like a little bit of m.i.a influence on this thing also j-pop and beach rock and i don't know i don't know what else like top 40 stuff there's just a lot going on with this record but it's all kind of pulled together really well and really cohesively with this very cute charming demeanor that the band approaches their songs with and I would also say it's definitely required that you have a sense of humor before you go into this album as well it's not a record that takes itself too seriously so you don't need to take it too seriously either but as seriously as I don't take it it's still a very well produced well-crafted colorful smile inducing album that I love a lot and I have been returning to again and again and again since I've picked it up and I want to give a shout out to the new Swain album the long dark blue this is the Netherlands rock band's first album since changing their name from this routine as hell a couple years ago and I'm really happy with what they brought here I was kind of off put at first by the fact they just pursued so brashley this 90s grunge or revival a sound but they end up kind of mixing that with the heavy metallic hardcore that made their last album so great and when they make grunge music unlike a lot of other artists who are like you know really trying to ride that a nostalgia train they actually execute it with some good songwriting and like some legitimately dark and depressing feelings so they're doing this grunge thing justice they're writing good songs the album is well produced and those more aggressive visceral and savage elements of their sound are still in the mix it's just they're kind of just switched out with these grunge moments and it actually makes for a pretty interesting conclusion you know you have these dreary spots and then all of a sudden they go aggressive like I'm so sad but now I'm angry about how things are yeah that's that's my assessment of the record it's great it's one of my favorite rock records of the year and give it a shot and yeah those are the recommendations that I want to make to you guys for this month again links down there in the description and I hope all of you are well for a transition and those are the albums that I want to recommend to you guys this month before the video is out keep in mind I did record this before having done this review I do want to give a little nod here to the new childish gambino album as well I know if I don't do that there's gonna be a little bit of a hurt in the comments so uh you know definitely wanna give that album a shout-out and I give the new sleighbells I'm a nod as well why the hell not because I thought that was a definitely not amazing but I liked it more than I thought I was going to so there you go guys again all sorts of irrelevant links and all that down in the description hope you're doing well links next to my head as well other reviews that you should check out subscribe to the YouTube channel and official website I'm gonna get out of here forever 
BwC-hYrfKV4,ah hi everyone big theny BAM you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new childish gambino album awaken my love awake donald glover AKA childish gambino is back with a brand new album really excited to listen to this thing which was a surprise because i am not really that big of a childish gambino fan mmm but seriously up until this point all donald glover has done for me is create this really whiny pitiful rap music that seemed to come from like a really self-centered place more than that is typical for rap music and in my opinion whether it be the nobody gets me temper tantrum he throws on numerous tracks on the album camp or the rich boy blues he seems to be singing on the because the internet album which was a pretty overblown record to say the least especially considering its what 75 page screenplay that came along with this thing now this new album over here though Gambino is heading in an entirely different direction it's such a sudden change of pace it's hard to believe that this is the same artist though to be fair Donald was hinting toward being more interested in soul music and an R&B on his Stone Mountain mixtape that was back in 2014 although those desires those artistic influences we're not manifesting themselves on that project in the way that they are on this new album over here this thing is a straight funk album this thing is a straight vintage soul album which is a sound that is coming back in spades through artists like Anderson pack and chance the rapper Kendrick Lamar Donald on this record though takes a very purist approach to the point where it's very clear he's pulling direct influence from artists like George Clinton and Funkadelic and Bootsy Collins who he samples on the song redbone wouldn't be surprised if he was recently listening to some meters or maybe some Ohio players or something although even though he is playing with this older sound he approaches it with some newer fresher production a few touches of auto-tune on his voice here and there for a little added spice which is executed quite tastefully and a lot of very clear clean punchy percussion on this thing too a lot of which sounds like it's being hammered out in some kind of sequencing program or something but still carries a very strong groove there are lots of fat funky bass lines on this thing sharp guitar leads some beautiful keyboard embellishments and solos there is an incredible amount of musical talent going into the instrumentals on this thing instrumentally production wise I think this album is immaculate and pretty diverse - whether it be the grand showy intro on the song me and your mama which has these massive vocal layers which are really powerful and inspiring great start to the record I also love the very sensual silky and nocturnal redbone which is very very sexy and filled with this fiery passion that I'm just in awe the falsetto lead vocals on this track and the classy keyboards are a beautiful touch and they're very dark but kind of soulful grooves on tracks like zombies and boogeyman and have some love and some of the quieter low-key subtle ballads on the back end of this record - are sweet as well like baby boy where Donald is singing directly to his son about what seems like the failing relationship between him and his son's mother I also really enjoyed the flow of this record - the first half is a totally different animal from the second half of the ambitious and emotional hard-hitting highs of the start of the album contrasts really well with more emotional spots like terrified and santol there are a lot of good things going for this album personally it's my favorite project Donald Glover has been involved with so far though I think it would be kind of hard to say hey this is his best album because comparing this album directly to his previous material is kind of like apples and oranges this thing isn't just different in that it's a different musical style and it's a different vibe this thing is in a different solar system though I will say comparatively this thing I think is more mature than anything Donald Glover has done thus far now even though I have lots of praise for this project this album is not without its flaws for one there are a few tracks on here that I feel are a little under written like the song riot which is kind of unfortunate because it is one of the most energetic and vibrant tracks and the entire track listing but it ends really abruptly just after a really short two minutes not sure why and the song the night me and your mama met feels like nothing more than just kind of an extended instrumental interlude that is a really faint definitely not one of the most memorable spots on the record and the album's only other major issue for me is when it comes to the vocals and most of the time they're good and actually I'm pretty in awe of how well Donald sings on this record the range of emotion and pitch he shows throughout this project is incredible but there are some moments on here where I think he really overpowers the instrumental I think he over plays his performance and it comes off kind of cartoony and obnoxious like on the songs boogeyman and zombies so I do get it the song is supposed to be a little creepy and I do still like the lyrical sentiments of these tracks boogeyman talking about race and fear singing about how with a gun in your hand as a black man I'm the boogeyman and then the song zombies being about parasitic people are trying to leech off your fame your success your money and the song California is is really inexcusable you know you're being annoying here and you just don't even care the vocal performance on this track super questionable as it is pretty much just like strained auto-tuned moaning for the entirety of the track it's like Donald going through a series of really weird vocal contortions you want to go to California though I do like some of the bars he drops on this track like the one about her kind of repeating her bad decisions as if you were watching a six-second vine or something and this is another moment where I'm actually enamored with the instrumental - it's this sunny light-hearted piece of funk with a lot of quirky silly hand percussion worked in a nimble bass line and some shy keyboards that kind of pop in here and there so even on this track which i think is the worst track there are some redeeming qualities to it so again while it does have its shortcomings there are some tracks that I wish had better vocal performances some tracks that I wish were a little meteor compositionally or a bit longer I still think this is a quality project the worst thing about this album though is that this might be the only time Donald Glover tries to do something like this which is sad because he's way better at doing this than I had anticipated because I do hear an incredible amount of potential in what he's doing here not just because the highlights on this record are so high but as far as a lot of the people reviving the sound right now I think Donald has sort of carved out his own little niche within that just simply with this album alone you know he's not approaching this funk sound he's not approaching this soul revival sound in the same way that his contemporaries are I'm feeling a light to dicen seven on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're pissed off at my thoughts on this record all sorts of links next to my head other reviews subscribe to the channel official website hope you're well forever 
HhXHfjm9RZo,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly track roundup right into my best my worst my man tracks of the week

clicked on that link on Amazon and you live in the u.s. we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price again supports the segment and quick easy to use and yeah that's it all right and also a few shout outs things that I want to mention over here for one there are two fantastic lists on the website right now written by two contributors to the needle drop Austin and Jeremy they are their best of the year list there are best albums of the Year lists they both have very different tastes from yours truly and they make some good recommendations so if you want to get into some 2016 licks little list action early then give those lists a shot they are linked down there in the description and also a botanist has come out with a new split which is actually pretty fantastic if you're into a low five music for into low fine metal black metal give this thing a shot and then finally the good people over at spin did a feature on me a very lengthy in-depth interesting feature that sort of details my rise as what they call them what the most relevant music critic today that's very flattering it's very fantastic give that article or read if you get a chance it's actually really great really great article I'm really pleased with it really happy with it you know some interesting factoids in there for anybody who's been curious about how this whole needle drop thing came together and yeah cool cool all right let's get into the lists or the tracks rather again check out those lists let's let's give the worst tracks of the week sort of a shakedown one the feelings with been replaced you know I mean I was kind of up on these guys reforming and coming back from the dead because they're older material they're early material is so great but this track is just so oh the riff is generic it's played with no guts whatsoever the vocals have no energy no delivery no nothing it's like they're phoning it in as much as they possibly can it's the sound of not trying is essentially this track and I'm hoping that the feel ease put a little bit more oomph into whatever they do in the very immediate future really really not sure where this track is coming from or why this track exists it just feels like it doesn't even want to exist it just feels like it doesn't want to be there moving on from there though The Raveonettes with fast food don't really care for this track one of their worst tracks lyrically in my opinion and usually I don't know it's it's it's their usual shoegaze e on the backburner very uh I don't know nonchalant not really attention-grabbing sound that I don't know I just really don't have anything else to say about other than that it's just really uninspired I guess and that's kind of how I've generally felt about The Raveonettes music for a long time personally and this track is just not a not really changing the tide unfortunately but moving on from there I guess I could say this is the worst track the week or at least the most disappointing without a doubt and that would be the new track from Kid Cudi from his forthcoming record oh what is it demon slaying something kill me please but this track featuring Travis Scott which I was looking forward to because I like Travis Scott Travis Scott takes a lot from Kid Cudi he loves Kid Cudi so I figured there's got to be an immense amount of chemistry on this track they've got to get together and really pull something off on this track but it's the exact opposite the beat is very nocturnal Spacey little trap flavored it's it's a subtle banger not not a heavy banger of subtle banger and Kid Cudi and Travis Scott's verses on here are so snoozy this track is a snoozefest I just really don't know why this track exists either it's just a it's it's ambient man it's sonic ambien and that and that's really all I can say about it you know that there's really not too much going on I'm hoping that the other material on this forthcoming Kid Cudi album is a little more engaging a little more interesting because this is just posh but whatever moving on from there the songs that I wasn't crazy about kinda meh no on these tracks but I think if I'm worth checking out if you guys are into these artists or into these genres DJ earworm mash-up with the United States of Pop 2016 this track is a little gimmicky but DJ earworm does a pretty good job of pulling together some of the year's biggest pop hits into this one big mashup that's relatively catchy you know you have broccoli from DRAM in there there Drake songs in there what else is in there Justin Timberlake is in there like every major pop hit of the years like mixed in this track at some point and it's pretty interesting how he pulls it all together you know I do love mashups maybe this one's a little too top 40 and a little too ritzy for my taste but it's it's definitely intriguing moving on from their uniform with tabloid this like some noise industrial stuff it's really abrasive it's really heavy it's coming out on sacred bones soon I wish the production was a little cleaner it's like way too muddy for me to get completely like enamored with but it is a decent track Portugal the man with noise pollution these guys are back with a new record and this is like their funkiest dancey Ahsan yet like a total turn in a more poppy direction with some kind of nonsensical lyrics or what seem nonsensical maybe that has something to do with the title of the song being noise pollution the song is like polluting with noise in a way because it's not trying to make a point or anything you know it's just this dancey fun upbeat track I guess you could say with a strong rhythm to it as well so uh you know not not a bad track from Portugal the man the van emptiness is coming out with an album soon the track your skin won't hide you which is a frightening song title and and the music is even more frightening again with emptiness I feel like I enjoy them conceptually more than I do musically and I do certainly get a very scary vibe from their music especially with how they kind of layer these dense scary monstrous vocals and their songs and the very spaced out guitar leads and just generally backing instrumentation on this track are very eerie so emptiness still sounding very frightening on this cut so uh I don't know I'm intrigued to what they're going to do on this record though it sounds like they're doing very much what they did on their last album I'm hoping with this upcoming one maybe it sort of finally clicks with me because they do seem like a pretty pretty idiosyncratic band without a doubt then I want to shout out Kid Koala with the observable universe I haven't heard from Kid Koala in a while and this new track of his seems like he's taking things in a more ambient direction although it sounds like the melodies are coming straight out of like I don't know like a sort of sort of a generic post-rock song or something I mean compositionally I wish it was a little bit better but certainly I guess the vibe of the song was very pretty and very easygoing in very serene so definitely shout out for that moving on from there we have a handful of best tracks that I shot this week one Laura Marling with the song soothing definitely one of this singer songwriters most upbeat tracks nice groove to it and Laura's vocals on this cut have a bit of pep to them as well you know if you're looking for a singer-songwriter track that it has a good groove to it has a really strong energy to it but it's still very smooth it's still very pretty on the ears give this thing a shot really nice track then moving on from there run the jewels with legend has it fantastic banger rtj three drop-in first thing next year can't wait to hear it can't wait to review it I'm not going to say too much about this track because I'm planning on a reviewing album very soon but really impressed with the beat really impressed with the verses run the jewels and why they're doing things better than ever on this cut in my opinion you know it seems like rtj too but they stepped it up just a little bit they just give it a a pinch more spice so I'm liking what they're doing there J Cole with the song false prophets also reviewing his album very soon not going to talk too much about this thing other that it's clearly a dis some very biting bars on this cut and it's got a nice jazz rap vibe to the instrumental so yeah and I actually like Jay Cole's like delivery on this cut he's not like putting me to sleep he's not coming off real boring he's like saying some real biting shit in the lyrics so give a listen and read into what he's saying a girlfriend of the year from the PC music camp with the song heaven this is a very glitchy ambient blissful piece of pop music that I like a lot very pretty on the ears young ma with the song eat fantastic track from young MA I've always kind of written this rap artist off never really took her all that seriously like her previous singles didn't seem to me to have that much lyricism or like you know great songwriting or anything but this track is bars it's bars dude it's bars so I give her all the credit in the world credit in the world for that she comes through with some great one-liner some good wordplay it's clever it's in your face it's like a I guess a junkyard dog just remember that is this track in my opinion so give this track a shot too I want to give a shout out to TK my jaw an Australian artist who I heard about just recently I took a trip over there I did some live speaking engagement dates over there and I heard about her music while I was over there a lot of people recommending her to me and I certainly see why with this track called simulation this is a great piece of like hip-hop pop fusion over here and the the dududududu like the beat on this thing is killer and she can sing really well too you know like everybody was selling her like as a rapper and saying oh she's great rapper duh but she could sing really well too you know she could sing a great hook so she seemed like you know a good double threat and she keeps dishing out tracks like this then I think she's going to have like a hit on her hands very soon so give this thing a shot in a fun music video as well for this cut hot dad with the song sportsman the song is a cover but it's no less entertaining from a hot dad shout out to him again you guys know hot dad by now and the prom night which is a rapper I guess an artist who I I have not heard of this is like a WorldStarHipHop premiere but I tried this track out because it's got Denzel Curry on it as well as JK the Reaper Nell and 12 Len who I have heard on other cuts and this is like you know a really grimy southern trappy banger of a cut you know and obviously a bit of a posse cut with all those names on it to a really nasty track really like her really tough ass song so give this thing a shot and finally I want to shout out Tim Darcy with the song tall glass of water not only a really interesting and strange music video on this one but this is like a really tense strange singer-songwriter track it's got a bit of a post-punk feel to it as well I would say I'm not totally sure whether or not like I'm in love with his vocals completely but I just love the tension of the song I love how odd the song feels it feels so off kilter it feels so awkward so unsure of itself but it has like a ball of incredible energy within it that it can't help but let out and those are the songs that I want to recommend to you guys again they are all linked down there in the description box along with the year-end lists that I mentioned the spin article and that botanist EP and the Amazon Associates link remember hit that up if you want to support this segment christmas is coming up do some Christmas shopping on there again live in the u.s. click on it anything you buy we get kickback from it doesn't add to the overall price all right hope you guys got some good recommendations out of this thing and I hope everyone's doing well you're the best forever 
5p8fVJslbkM,"hey it's time for another y-you know review where I go over a bunch of records that I didn't get a chance to formally review over the past month and I'm talking about them in brief here now if you cut the last y-you know review you're aware that we have undergone a bit of a format change here in this segment on my Twitter page I have been uploading these very short green screen videos where I kind of give these you know really brief thoughts or one-liners on new records that I've been listening to and now this segment has kind of turned into a compilation of these videos if you want to catch these videos in more of an up-to-date fashion like when I actually drop them follow me on Twitter at the needle drop but you can always ensure that I'm going to take all of them that I have made over the past month and place them into this segment so just keep your heads up for it at the end or at the start of each month when I am usually likely to drop these sorts of videos um yes and we're also going to be doing title cards before each video so you are fully aware of which artist which album I'm talking about cool cool all right let's get into it [Music] dzdx bloodlessly race to 9 2003 my dear my ovaries these guys are one of the best metal bands out of Australia right now and essential in the metal scene down there and if you're into metal music that's super kind of I don't know cleanly produced melodic triumphant sort of sounds like the perfect soundtrack to Vikings raping and pillaging across Europe then give this thing a listen because that that's just the mood it gives off this is one of those moments in music where there there is an age limit to what you're listening to and I am past it probably also not not a very good thing to listen to this and have a mustache - that's probably creepy it's not that it's bad it's just that nothing about this album stands out to me from a technical standpoint there's some solid stuff here from the flows to the production but the guy just sounds like an amalgamation of all of his conscious contemporaries doing very thoughtful jazzy sort of left field but not so left field it's actually experimental or adventurous hip-hop it's just merely okay in ten years we're not going to be talking about this Sabba album not unless he actually comes through with something really ambitious with his next project fuck yes fuck yes fuck yes hell yeah yeah last year I was so excited for the pop group to make their return come through with this fantastic comeback record titled citizen zombie that I gave a very positive review but now with this latest record over here like the vocal performances are less while the instrumentation is less wild they're more sort of electronic and fused tracks on this LP which were some of my least favorite on citizen zombie it just feels way more stiff controlled and measured not as invigorating or as gratifying yeah unfortunately but some things it really just should stay on the cutting room floor and just not move from that space they stay there they don't go on to an album you don't go on to a mixtape they just stay there I guess it's not as rough as listening to yung lean try to make rap music but for whatever reason a lot of the same problems still carry over like it's it's not really that exciting it's not really that visceral it's really sort of I don't know navel-gazing and indulging in its own or to put it bluntly iceage if they couldn't write a song your favorite cartoony eccentric rapper producer and singer is back with a new project it's an EP that came out around my birthday I totally missed it just slipped through the cracks for some reason but this thing is colorful its vast it's nocturnal it's eerie totally different vibe from his last EP which was like a bunch of almost story songs about a pirate rapper guy on this one it's not so much about the singing and the rapping it's really the sort of dense dark and very intricate production that kind of steals the show although I do find it to be a little cluttered a lot of the time which which really works against it but still this is a pretty interesting ep I look forward to seeing what this guy does deeper into the future I thought I was gonna completely hate this thing but it's actually not bad I'd give it to Joe Jonas on this stuff sure maybe it's a little too boyish and a little too clean and top-40 but there are some sharp hooks on this thing some good guitar licks and the beats to just not let up that was inappropriate I'm sorry [Music] don't you need a sense of humor to start a joke band come on guys it's fka twigs for normies this new flume EP it's bright it's colorful it's textured and a lot of it is pretty beautiful a couple of his best tracks on this thing - definitely the song V you know it's too short to kind of make a fuss over but this EP for me is like that alternative electronic music route that I've always wanted flume to go down that he's always hinted toward but he always just sort of compromises it in order to sort of put forward some kind of sound aesthetic production style that would appeal more to like an EDM audience or something the most obvious attempt at doing that on this EP is heater but even that track isn't that bad it sounds like a cool fusion of old m83 and like some wonky music with its stuttering kick drums I hope you can keep up this consistency on his next project and continues to drop music that is not only interesting but is also pretty sweet to the ear and accessible as well good EP give it a shot conceptually I wouldn't say it's anything entirely new but what makes Tonya's approach to experimental rock different art or talents as a throat singer topping these tracks with some of the weirdest vocal contortions I've ever heard some of which are outright annoying others turn into like a total fucking nightmare in a good way like unlike blown away by how dark and disturbing it is it's intriguing to say the least and shout out to shad for the rap verse on this record there is a legit rap song in the middle of this thing I did not see coming but there's not much about this record I saw coming so there you go hey hey it's dance music you know dance music make me want to dance all the way over to the stereo didn't turn it off yo kids are you ready for some success leftovers ah fuck yeah I'm ready for some success leftovers bitch seriously it's it's pretty good if you're in a post-hardcore if you're in a noise rock definitely check this EP out especially if you heard any of ken modes past couple of albums you're going to dig what's here there are a couple like non-album tracks there are some demo tracks on here too it's it's worth trying out if you're into hard heavy Punky very wordy rock music okay okay you're the best bye bye there's some pretty cool jittery beats on this thing some intricate pieces of production and I think the subtle Konya influences the turn-up here and they're pretty interesting as well but is is there a reason the lyrics are so terrible on this thing how are the lyrics this bad I would die if you would dye your hair 30,000 times over and over no no no no no no no yeah it's it's kind of one-dimensional but it's still some really like brick in your fucking face punk music with kind of metallic edge to it and um it's free can't go wrong with free this is metal if you really like your metal to be like a Rubik's Cube of doom and the more that you play with it the more you you you suffer and the more depressed you get it the more just weighs down on your soul and rips it apart into a million pieces I don't even have a joke here that that's just literally Allison the sound makes me feel there was a time in the 2000s when most of us couldn't wait for this kind of metalcore to die and now that this band is just so brazenly bringing it back and just rejecting any type of progression or evolution just really stick into this whole beat down hardcore formula and not changing it all it's it's almost ballsy it's not a anything new but they're playing it with a lot of fucking heart and and I admire that and there you have it ladies and gentlemen the why you know review um yeah cool cool I hope everyone's doing well leave a comment let me know if you like the direction that the segment has been moving in recently and follow me again over on Twitter at the needle drop now all sorts of links next to my head the why you know review playlist probably some other cool video that you check out as well subscription link and the website and have a nice one guys believe in yourselves and and drink your orange juice bull "
6qadB8VyBRo,hey everyone enemy fit Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new witches album all your happy life these guys are a rock band based in the UK that broke with a pretty fantastic album back in 2014 titled Annabelle dream reader at that point I thought I had heard pretty much everything that modern garage rock would have to offer but then the witches come along and approach it in this really dark and scuzzy way this album was noisy it was tortured and it actually featured some pretty interesting chord progressions and and sinister melodies too it wasn't just this compositionally inept thrash and bashed session and i think on this new LP over here the band diversifies their sound even more this record isn't quite as engulfed and fiery distortion as the last one was right from the start of the record on the song seaside witches are matching their tense bass lines and wicked guitars with spooky organ chords and blood curdling strings toward the finish of the track on this thing they're sounding like a version of the black lips that's less infatuated with Rocking and being visceral and being just dirty and sweaty and in-your-face really they seem more concerned with kind of raising the hair on the back of their audience's neck sort of tapping into their minds at a cerebral level and triggering some kind of fear mechanism the song ghost House is most definitely an example of this with its kind of slow lumbering riffs the track sounds like I don't know the cross between psyche rock song but also the theme of a horror movie this move is a little different for the witches and in concept it's not really a move that I'm against swapping a little bit of the aggression out and creating this musical mindfuck instead the issue is though is that there are some tracks that are not quite as frightening not quite as unsettling and the band isn't playing quite as aggressively on these cuts so the the performances feel sort of measured it's not really the best trade-off the songs can't face it and throne and bone-weary it just feels like the band is operating in the middle of the road a little bit more on this record and again not totally sure why because all they're really doing is grasping at this slightly more sad and depressed sound but I will say in this search for a more subtle sound for a more moody sound the band does come through the few fantastic tracks the song of feeling we get certainly lives up to its title with these super dreary chord progressions and leave guitar melodies that feel like a punch to the gut and a kick to the heart I do wish the vocals carried a bit more emotional weight on this track though and that's the thing even though the instrumentation generally on this record sounds a little more vibrant a little more upfront less smudgy the vocals are still kind of thrown in the background slightly obscured not really all that prominent not as prominent as I think they could be thrown on the backburner there are a few tracks like a dead Knight again where the vocals do feel like they've been spotlighted a little bit on this cut the lyrics are surprisingly intelligible the story and the vocal delivery on this cut has a really strong bitterness to them that reminds me a little bit of the Violent Femmes and the balladry continues on the song dum Phil this track to me feels like a darker rougher kindred spirit to the kinks song Sunday afternoon a lot of the other vocals on this record though are still the same kind of throat shredding screams that you might have heard throughout the last record but against this Moody are just more I don't know softer instrumentation it feels like a little bit of overkill sometimes especially on cuts like crest of death and I like this song this is a highlight for me on the record not necessarily the intro though but I'll have the point at which the song sort of bursts into these slacker rock riffs that feel like they've been pulled straight out of the pavement playbook the band works these really tastefully into a bunch of other dark moody guitar passages throughout the rest of the track so certainly you know not every moment on this album is lackluster or leaves me feeling like yeah this could have been better though I will say the outro is pretty abrupt not really one of the better highlights on the record in terms of writing it really feels like a non-committal moment on the album unfortunately and maybe that's just the whole vibe of the record in general you know the band's last album did have a pretty focused uniform noisy sound while this new record over here isn't quite sure what direction it wants to go in I mean the witches certainly let their creativity run wild on this one and as a result I think they stretched themselves a little thin on some of these cuts playing with ideas that they necessarily don't have the ability to execute maybe with more time they would have sharpened these tracks up a little bit more all I know is that I feel like I admire the band more for the risks that they take on this album than I do just simply enjoy the album itself it's cool that witches tried something different and certainly came through with at least a handful of highlights but as far as the rest of this album goes I look forward to which is either just going back to the drawing board or retooling some of what they were trying to do on this record and returning with a more improved version hopefully I'm feeling a strong six on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you're ready to hear the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please no cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry all sorts of links to my head other videos next to my head other videos you can check out subscribe to the YouTube channel official website and I hope you guys are doing well drink your water don't drink your soda that's that's piss okay forever 
VvaS80m7L70,hi everyone finger prints under glasses in tanana here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new sleighbells record Jessica Rabbit sleigh bells are a kind of polarizing Brooklyn noise pop duo they've been at it for a while now this is their fourth full-length album and I personally will admit that up until this point I have not really been that big of a fan of sleigh bells I feel like their 2010 album treats was easily one of the most gimmicky and annoying albums of that year the music press is desperately hyped these guys only for most of their relevancy to dissipate in the next several years as I think sleigh bells with one album after the next kind of proved they were a one-trick pony so I gave this new LP a shot over here mostly out of morbid curiosity because I thought the lead single the intro track the first track on this thing was so mind-blowing Lee horrendous mostly because it features this tacked on chorus that transitions more awkwardly than America from an Obama to a trump presidency but once I actually know for into the tracklist of this record I was surprised to find that it's it's not really bad it's actually kind of good and without question it is their most mature album yet now we are still talking about sleigh bells here maturity is relative in a lot of ways sleigh bells is the same loud bombastic arena pop with blaring guitars and shouty vocals but the singing is way less bratty on this album and all of the instrumentals don't really revolve around these brittle ugly rock guitars like they sort of did on their previous albums the guitars on Jessica Rabbit are actually pretty good sounding like they're actually mixed and recorded really well and there's a variety of different guitar tones across the album and it's not just constantly just banging you over the head with guitar riffs over and over and over the guitars like play a role in a mix of a bunch of different instrumentation mostly synthetic but you know still there are some areas back there there's some background vocals of variety of beats and the songs I think are more well written to like I could see them working in different musical contexts and they would still be a catchy song built on the foundation of solid melodies and choruses like with the song I can't stand you anymore which sounds like at its core the kind of pop tune that a 2000s era pop diva would sing but with some ballsy gutsy guitars thrown in there for a little bit more edge I also love the booming beat in the wild bright synth horns on the song crucible reminds me a little bit of battles in a way and the instrumental break toward the back end of this track with what sounds like 8-bit synths and acoustic guitar samples was a really creative change of pace I also feel the same way about throw me down the stairs which also features a cool change of instrumental pace toward the back end sleigh bells are doing a good job of like bringing some cool little instrumental shifts on these cuts this track I also want to mention has some of the most aggressive lyrics I've heard on a sleigh bell song so far kind of sounds like they're reflecting a bit on I don't know all the haters they've accrued over the years or something Krauss's vocals are a little clunky on the verse but I love the songs blaring heavy slow fight riffs and the way the track speeds up on the hook now even though I like that there's more compositionally going on with this record it doesn't always flow very well like how I mentioned on the intro track it's just us now it's it's also the case for unlimited dark paths which features one post-apocalyptic beat and since scape after another than switching that out for some like heavy metal style riffs that are very driving very fast and that house is really overpowering the instrumental mix with her vocals then there's a sudden change of pace with these cascading pianos just bouncing off of one another toward the end but I will say most of sleighbells experiments and ambitions on this record do pay off the duo's music is still really gaudy and you can argue whether or not you think it's in good taste but undeniably it is more dynamic sleigh bells is sounding more varied and skilled than they ever have in the past whether they be crafting a legit pop banger on the song I can only stare or going really aggressive on the song rule number one which has a kind of surprising and unexpected rap rock vibe to it on the verses delivered with an incredible amount of swagger to me this cut is one of the most explosive moments on the record and then the song transitions toward the end into this really sweet ballad that I didn't really see coming and it's so nice it's so pleasant that I thought it was a different song entirely but no it's just this really great extension of this huge gargantuan track on this record and there are just a lot more moments on this thing where it's clear that sleigh bells was trying to make some kind of lyrical statement here about music about art about their rise and and I guess sort of fall in music the indie machine that in a lot of ways they're essentially chewed up in and spit out of they are in a lot of ways veterans of that and they now are putting out this record on their own label so maybe in lieu of that in their lyrics they're being a little more honest and open about their past experiences in the music industry that especially seems to be the case on the song baptism by fire by no means is Jessica Rabbit a perfect record it gets off to a very rough start there are a couple of lackluster tracks here and there and a handful of odd transitional moments where it feels like the band didn't really write a song and they're just trying to write some Spacey intermission track to just add a bit of filler into the mix I don't know the one track where they do this where I think it goes over well is no not to count on you the way the track transitions from the sequenced Richards synth arpeggios to these gentle acoustic passages matched with Alexis Krause's very beautiful background vocals was nice and the clothes are on this thing was pretty epic as well like a bit of a prog synth vibe coming from the tail end of the song overall I think this is a good album from sleighbells I think it's their best record some of you might disagree because I guess it is less hype and the sound is less gimmicky but I think I think they're coming out with some good material here and I hope they're able to keep up momentum with their music and with their fan base into the future now that they've sort of moved on to their own label because I think this album is a step in the right direction a direction I hope they can take further with another record in the future I'm feeling a life 7 on this thing transition have you given the sound of a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best through the

Yv4z3I-Auww,hi everyone than any tanum here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Tsar face album A Fistful of peril Tsar faces a new york hip hop trio featuring MC esoteric inspect a deck of wu-tang clan fame and producer 7l they assembled out of the blue with a debut self-titled album a handful of years ago which was a kind of soso album in my opinion very surprising considering the collective experience of everyone in the group at the time it just kind of felt like another boom bap throwback and a sea of mostly superior boom bap throwbacks all of the comic-book villainy references also felt a little I don't know stale in a post MF DOOM world - but the trio improved pretty greatly and quickly on their sophomore full-length album every hero needs a villain the star-studded feature list on this thing was fantastic the production seemed like it had improved - definitely grimy er than the previous record and most importantly it seemed like there was more chemistry going on between inspected deck and esoteric they were sounding like a well-oiled machine they sounded like they were excited to actually be recording this album and I think they continued to play off of each other pretty well on this new album - but this thing unfortunately is bound to turn less heads because the feature list is just not quite as hype and that's not to say the features themselves and the performances are mediocre on this thing most of them are actually quite decent you know it's nice to hear black ass tan on this record but considering that on the last LP sour-faced had Method Man GZA MF DOOM large professor how are you gonna top that apparently you you don't and it seems like ZAR face is not even really trying to come through with equally exciting features and um you know the runtime of this thing is surprisingly short - it's like 20 minutes shorter than its predecessor I'm noticing that there's less to be excited about on the production end of things - there are a couple of standouts on here that are like boom bat bangers such as the song dust but a lot of the tracks on this thing are just simply these one-dimensional loops that just carry on and on and on seems kind of like a very lackluster take on the instrumental style that you would catch on like a MF DOOM special herbs compilation especially on the track revenge on lizard City whose very off-kilter organ loops are actually pretty obnoxious sounds like I'm listening to esoteric and inspected deck rap over a skipping record and even vocally and lyrically I think esoteric and Inspectah deck have regressed once again exhibit a the very unenthusiastic and nonsensical bars on the song there is a dark side and that is just one of many moments on this thing that aren't necessarily terrible but aren't really great either just merely okay you know what is not a standout moment on this album just kind of sounds like 90s golden era rap music being pushed past its expiration date which is weird to think because just last year they were dropping every hero needs a villain maybe this new project over here is as a result of not really waiting and sitting on these songs and just kind of rushing together another project to strike while the iron's hot and just come out with something else and I think czar face kind of dropped the ball and really they should have focused on coming out with something even more ambitious to follow it up it's just really a step back in my opinion it's not totally a fall from grace for czar face or anything like that but it seems like again they've gone back to the standard that they set on the first album rather than pushing past that and pushing past every hero needs a villain I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this album Church for transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best and what should I review next hit the like if you liked and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry next to my head all sorts of links to other videos subscription also the official website and hope you guys are doing well forever 
qfG_-m51_7Q,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and going to do a quick review right now of this new ho C's album and odd entrances these guys if you didn't know are a garage rock outfit a psyche rock outfit they dropped a fantastic album this year titled a weird exits I said a weird exists in my original review for it but regardless it is a great album of weird strange jammy left-field rock songs and a lot of guts a lot of guts a lot of kinetic energy between all the performers on the record it's great now I got pretty excited or at least I was at the moment when I had heard that they were announcing a second album for this year and that is the record I'm going to be talking about now now this thing I don't know what I was really hoping for you know the OC certainly are prolific they drop a lot of materials so I thought in my head they're certainly capable of dropping two great albums within a year's time I mean they come out with a lot of material they're very creative they really like to strike while the iron's hot so let's give them a chance let's see what they're doing but this thing really just kind of ended up being a bunch of leftovers from the last record unfortunately I feel like conceptually stylistically the type of writing style the band went into that album with they also go into this album with but the thing is with these tracks is that they're even more odd they're even more left-field the jams are based on even stranger instrumentation which doesn't necessarily make this album bad I think it makes it a little less exciting because it's not as high-octane as a weird exits but I think that album could have been helped could have been I think um I want to say elevated a little bit or the word I'm looking for is hmm I can't quite think of the word I'm looking for but elevated will definitely do it could have been elevated a little bit by the incorporation of a couple tracks off of this record yeah because it would have been some good diversity to add in one of the weirder jams off this project is kind of slip in between some of the more harsher abrasive in your face cuts off of a weird exits so in a way it is kind of interesting to see the band writing songs in the same way but sort of just taking a different approach going for direction with it going in a stranger direction with it getting a little more abstract with it so I don't know in that respect it is cool it isn't interesting listen but it still does kind of just feel like a grab bag of miscellaneous b-sides and extras from a weird exits I mean I guess I should have anticipated that given the title given the album are of this thing although maybe in a way how you should consider is like the odd less attractive sister album to a weird exits or something you know if you felt like that that album a weird exits was just too normal then maybe maybe this is the record for you maybe this is the record to try maybe this is the one that you want to hear instead it's not bad it's not a bad listen it's just you know just kind of a weirder less exciting less visceral take on this very linear songwriting style at the band embarked on with their last record give it a shot give it a listen it has its highlights you know it has some admirably weird moments but it just kind of felt like I don't know something that I wouldn't necessarily return to anytime soon though you know it certainly is an improvement on some of the more brittle harsh just badly recorded super lo-fi material that the band had released not too long ago so you know it's not like this thing is total trash or anything don't completely ignore it you know especially if you're into this style of music but you know go into it not expecting the explosive just like brain boiling experience of the last record that's it guys what did you think of this thing do you think it measures up to a weird exits do you think its own thing entirely do you think it's just leftovers let me know and yeah hope you uh check out the next review and have a nice day forever 
38VsnLom3wM,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and I'm going to do a couple of quick iPhone reviews today just to sort of talk about some albums that I've been planning on talking about but just haven't gotten a chance to yet but I want to talk about them in a sort of formal single video I want to give my opinion on the new death spell Omega album which I want to get the title right here because the title of this album is so incredibly awesome it's it's it's probably the best thing this year as far as titles go yeah probably probably the best thing this year I would say in terms of a an album title and that title was the sinner key of molten bones these guys are a French death metal black metal band more of a fusion you know sort of the fusion between those two things and over the years they've come out with some of the most dense and intense metal music on the planet to the point where they really sort of pushed the envelope in ways that just kind of seem commonplace today because they've been making such intricate and such complex and such dizzying music for a long time very abrasive very intense I already said intense but still stands to be said again because that's just how the  music is anyway so this latest record over here I really was hype off of their last record which made me and my last record I mean their last EP which made me dive a little further into their discography and got me really excited for the band was gonna go next and then this album drops and I don't know it's not terrible I mean certainly the band gives their usual style a few interesting angles a few interesting experiments here and there like the riffs on the closing track are really intense and have some nice grooves to them some weird odd off-kilter groups to them the current sections and just orchestral instrumentation that kicks the album off is really stunning and overall the mix the instrumentation very heavy very thick very pummeling very overpowering but the album is a little on the short side honestly like it's just over 30 minutes and I feel like that runtime really affects it not only that but I feel like the middle two tracks and the track listing here aren't really the most memorable death spell Omega tracks from a compositional standpoint for sure they're really difficult to pull together the guitars are tangled in with the base which is tangled in with the drums which are topped off with these really monstrous vocals but again not as memorable as stuff even on that last EP that they just came out with and again I feel like that shortness that brevity on this record kind of works against it because you know for death spell Omega it's really about the the experience of listening to their music and sort of shortening that experience it's gonna have as a result less of an impact on the listener because again it's really all about kind of getting into the deepest darkest depths of the human psyche and really really kind of just crushing the soul down like a musical trash compactor of sorts and to me that's what's so appealing about death spell Omegas music and for whatever reason and I feel like that EP that they had dropped not too long ago was more potent than this album yeah just not really that crazy about this record again instrumentally and sigh listicle II the band delivers what you would expect but this is not one of the more satisfying records and their discography I feel so um so yeah you know it's a little on the short side I think the materials a little scant and-and-and you know the four tracks that are here on this project not every single one of them is like amazing you know if you're gonna bring just four tracks they got to be your four best tracks and excuse me I feel like that's just not the case unfortunately for this project but let me know what you think down in the comments do you love this EP or rather I say EP because it kind of feels that way do you love this LP are you excited for what death spell Omega is gonna do next do you feel like this album measures up to what the band has done recently in the past and um yeah 
9D3xjKDBsyI,ah hi everyone sarva nee Boitano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new weakened record star boy quickly following up his 2015 album Beauty behind the madness on which he had many chart climbing singles Abel Tesfaye aka the weakened is back with a new album technically his third album even though he's been around for years at this point originally breaking through with this series of free mixtapes back in 2011 that were very well received he's been going strong ever since I've been crazy about a lot of the material he's put out I mean here and there he has blown me away but regardless of what I think he is most definitely a force in modern music though at one point he was seen as just merely another Drake protege but recently he's really become a force unto himself and a huge trendsetter too because there are countless artists on the internet right now that are just shamelessly copying his moody sad R&B style to the point where just makes me sick as inconsistent as some of the weekends albums can be I will take abel over some shoddy ripoff any day which is why I went into this new record over here with high hopes that and the fact that I thought some of the lead singles from this thing were pretty great star boy the title track I actually think is one of the best singles of 2016 I love the songs moody tail of Fame and XS the track sad soft pianos and Daft Punk inspired production and that's another thing having Daft Punk on your record it's more than just a feature it's a sign of what's to come like there's going to be some kind of sea change or something though I will say in a lot of ways star boy is quite similar to Beauty behind the madness once again Abel isn't really able to settle on one sound and while he does come through with some highlights overall it's still a pretty inconsistent record whether it be because he's writing the same song and telling the same story after all these years like on the song party monster which is about this girl this drunk drugged out socialite that Abel seems to be infatuated with because he has it in his mind that she's going to understand him get him get his drive to party once again he's kind of looking for love in the wrong places and at this point it's getting kind of tedious listening to Abel call out into the night for this glamorized version of the girl who you see walking down the sidewalk at 3:00 a.m. with her heels in her hands and mascaras streaming down her face as she kind of hobbles her way over to the spot where her ubers going to pick her up then we have the song false alarm which seems to be pretty polarizing for a lot of weakened fans though I appreciate what Abel's trying to do here whether or not he succeeds I think that's debatable I love the tracks driving beat it's vintage synth lines I like that it's kind of a throwback it feels somewhat krautrock inspired in some ways and I like the way that the hook is so propulsive it's explosive the weird shrieking shouts on the track are pretty experimental too though these spots really I don't know clash I would say not just with Abel's style generally but the moments on this track where he sort of slows it down and just goes super moody like he usually does I actually think the vocal melody is on the verses are pretty weak too if only the verses had been more solid maybe the chorus would have felt like a bigger better more interesting payoff though some people seem to not really care for it I love the song reminder it seems like an interesting update from the standpoint of Abel in regards to his fame his lifestyle what he's been doing he mentions a recent nomination by the Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards for the song can't feel my face loved that single but not really the kind of song I would be sort of you know Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards uh it's literally about doing some coke so Abel does make some sharp and interesting observations about his status in the music industry saying that people can't replace him even though they claim that other people made him and sort of how he perceives his music who he sees as music as being for and I think the tracks smooth synthesizers and really easygoing beat are very intoxicating and that line about his Asian girl going lo mein is uh definitely a gem a moment of Danny Brown style inspiration but then we just go headfirst into a pothole right after with the song rockin which is another track where a Abel is happy to wear his Michael Jackson influence on his sleeve the tracks house B is really obnoxious sounds like a lesser version of what you might find on a disclosure record and Abel was really out to lunch on these lyrics some of the worst lyrics on the entire record and I don't care what you think about this album love it hate it but the pre-chorus vocal on the song is inexcusable when you start singing why would you yeah not not not a bright spot in uh this this album's tracklist and the song loved to lay is an equally tacky attempt at trying to insert dance music into the weakens musical equation the song secrets though is another refreshing change of pace instrumentally and even vocally it sounds like Abel's really trying to throw back to another decade a lot of things on this track to me are pulled right out of the NuWave playbook however he sort of manages to carry over the genres unbearable corniness that eventually led to its demise as Abel is singing that he hears the secrets that you keep when you're talking in your sleep but then we hop forward ten years just really like that miraculously on the song true colors were able does incredible justice to the ninety slow-jam which to me is one of his most honest heartfelt and moving ballads that he's ever done it might just be the glistening instrumental talking here but when I read into the lyrics of this track it sounds like he actually wants to get to know this person who he's singing about there doesn't seem to be a lick of sarcasm here or cynicism some legitimate feelings of true love and desire and infatuation come through on tracks like die for you and nothing without you as well though honestly I really do have to suspend belief in order to believe what Abel is saying on these tracks considering what what you typically sings about and says in regards to the women who he sings about usually just wanting to you know coke them up and them up and then throw them to the curb maybe not the best tracks in the track listing but certainly an interesting alteration of angle from Abel and then with the track a lonely night I love the electro funk vibe of this cut sounds like Romeo did the instrumental and some how it just works even though I would never imagine in my head able doing too well over this kind of beat especially since on his last record when he was on a warm instrumental II came off so cold and stiff but he does pull off some semblance of swagger on this cut as he's singing about how he and his lover are bad for each other I'm not really sure the album needed two songs with two future features honestly he could have picked the best of the two tracks and just left it at that I'm not really crazy about either of the two songs but but really just two to two is redundant and while the songs attention and ordinary life aren't awful tracks they just kind of serve as a reminder that at this point Abel is really kind of running out of things to sing about he's successful and he's being hounded by shallow women who just want him for his success want him for his fame want him for his relevance etc etc etc wash rinse repeat you would think that since he's so deep into his career at this point he would have some kind of new refreshing perspective on these issues but he's really singing about them with no more nuance than he was in 2011 his descriptions of the lifestyle he leads the lifestyle that he glamorizes are still shallow and the characters are still one-dimensional i commend this album for the handful of risks that it takes and for the fact that it's a little more consistent sonically and instrumentally than Beauty behind the madness was but still the album's best songs stand shoulder to shoulder with filler redundancies and experiments that either go up like a rocket or down like the Hindenburg so again in that respect this album is really not that much different than Beauty behind the madness it's long and it's really spotty you have the star girl interlude with Lana Del Ray which is just I don't know an opportunity for her to bring the fusion of a in orgasm and a whale call and and then right after kendrick lamar on the track sidewalk which is easily one of the best tracks on the track listing in my opinion the weekend actually on top of a kind of a boom bap eb kendrick kills it on his verse in my opinion he sort of gets filthy sexual lowdown and dirty like you would want on a weekend record shirts not real classy but i think you fits the bill and it's just this constant rollercoaster of like wow this is great wow this is not wow this is great wow this is not so unfortunately I'm feeling a like decent 5 on this thing but they're just enough highlights on this record to make me curious once again can able actually like pull it off on the next one I'm not really sure I mean so far this album formula seems to be working for him so I guess there's probably no real reason to change but you know still at least in the case of this record and most likely the next one there are a couple singles I can take away from it and really enjoy and probably throw onto my year-end list again light the decent 5 Teran and there you have ladies and germs my thoughts on the new weekend album I hope you enjoyed it a little more than me maybe and if you have deeper thoughts about this record leave them down there in the comment section angry positive whatever totally cool all sorts of links next to my head other videos I think you should check out subscription website and hope you guys are well eat some fruits and vegetables get a good night's sleep forever i anthony bandana 
adF7aDSYUxg,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is it's your boy back in the spot doing the best and worst tracks of the week catching up on a few tracks from last week as well because we sort of have a holiday in the middle of this week er we had a holiday in the middle this week so you know there were a few days where tracks didn't get posted people are talking about tracks people are sharing tracks so there's a good healthy amount of songs to be recommended here but of course first before I get into the songs that you should hear we're gonna get into the worst tracks of the week let me think you're what okay okay I know which one I have for here and I just in my mind now picked which one is the worst okay so here we go first worst track of the week new yung lean song Hennessy and Sailor Moon featuring blade this is a totally lazy boring auto-tune mess yung lean sounds like he went into the booth and was just high out of his mind barely sort of has his flow together and yeah the melody of this track is a drab as well so if you like hearing slurred broken English trap rap music that's super auto-tuned and lifeless then give this thing a shot moving on from there we have McLemore with Wednesday morning probably the worst post-election song I've heard out of all the you know sort of sad angry post-election songs that have been posted obviously this one of course is another track for macklemore's trying to make us cry with a dramatic Ryan Lewis instrumental with loads of piano God if he didn't have access to a piano how would he make instrumentals no one knows but from from there the instrumental doesn't really develop too much Macklemore sort of mumbles his way through the track maybe he's trying to do some that mumble rap stuff that's so hot right now with the kids and of course he lays some auto-tune on his voice again don't know why sounds terrible and a lot of the stuff that he says in the song is just kind of a lot of empty platitudes which is part of the reason why Hilary lost the election anyway so uh actually come through with some ideas come through some passion come through with some convincing points of view and maybe you might actually make a politically charged song that actually gets people excited and doesn't make people who really probably agree with you philosophically throw up in their mouths moving on from their car see headrest the song not what I needed which is a song off of the band's latest record which is fantastic but this is the Simlish version yes the sins if you didn't already know many songs over the years have been turned into Simlish versions of songs and this is one of them and yes totally unnecessary ruined the song just stop oops my camera stopped because I told the stop I wasn't I wasn't meaning you camera I hear Sims four isn't that good anyway fix that shit guys fix it but yeah so car seat headrests Simlish version not like in that but that's not even the worst track of the week the worst track of the week is actually actually from a myriad of different artists who are performing a vocal cover of the song best day of my life from American authors I believe they wrote that song but these guys didn't just get together people like Jennifer Hudson and in others and the Steve Aoki isn't on as well they didn't just get together on their own accord this is actually kind of like an ad for Shell gasoline or I guess the shell energy company because some kind of alternative energy advertisement that um actually doesn't show any real like alternative energy initiatives or anything it's all like a bunch of cutesy little dioramas while everybody sings this horrific cover of this song that does not sound good at all B sounds cheap and a lot of the guests on this on this song are not really all that greatest singing either Jennifer Hudson obviously the best singer the rest of them could could really just take a hike in my opinion and I don't know it's just kind of depressing to sort of see this I don't know pro shell propaganda set to pop music I mean this is the song that thankfully they will be having loud speakers with solar panels on them rolling down the road along parallel to the bread lines that people are waiting in because climate change is a sin we brought great famine to our nation and we're all starving and shaking but you know we're all going to be like this is gonna be the best time ah ha ha ha that's that's sort of how I imagined this song really sort of seeing its fullest potential being played in some kind of post apocalypse situation where global warming has essentially ruined everybody's lives so thank you Shell gasoline for that we we will fully appreciate the soundtrack that you've brought to the table for that situation moving on from there I'm going to get into the songs that I'm kind of indifferent toward men men they're not bad not awful you know but they're not amazing either but you may like them a little more than me if you're into these artists so I want you guys to be aware of these tracks common has a new track out a remix of the song black America again with gucci mane and pushing t & bj the chicago kid that's not that bad it's pretty good we have pissed jeans with the bar is low sort of sounds like a mix between like some kind of noise rock band and a Motorhead like the vocals just remind me of Lemmy so much we have Freddie Gibbs with the song all day Freddie Gibbs is out of jail in Europe he was just in jail overseas because I guess he uh got caught on some kind of a rape charges or something which I guess ended up getting thrown out because they were they were bunk and now he's back in the u.s. you just came out with this new track with Harry fraud it's okay but I guess it's a good reminder that Freddie Gibbs is back in the States we have father John misty with one of the better but not an amazing track but one of the better tracks post-election tracks where he's kind of musing about the cultural shift in America and just the insanity of our politics right now in our culture we have Cloud Nothings with the kind of drab and very generic alternative rock song internal world not really sure where the band is going their songs recently seem like a lot less fiery a lot less passion a lot less exciting and I'm hoping that the deeper cuts actually brings some umph to the table because these past couple of singles are just really bland in my opinion and moving on from there the evaporators with the song Mohawks and dreadlocks a really cute fun little punk rock song I think about sort of bringing together hardcore punks and hippies it's it's quite heartwarming in my opinion and in the in the music video itself is very very dorky but you know that's just kind of the evaporators vibe you got to respect that that's just their thing that's just the thing for gnar doir and the crew to be very very dorky shout out to those guys all right now best trash the week right into this I want a shout out to poly vinyl records they have new compilation out where artists on the label cover other artists on the label you can stream that over on SoundCloud link down there in the description that's the poly vinyl plays poly vinyl compilation pretty cool fun idea guys good job but ok here are the tracks that I'm recommending this week love these tracks really enjoyed them we have Matthew Squires with shape of your heart found this track via Stereogum this is a weird kind of fun little piece of I don't know pop music but it's got some psychedelic undertones to it and it's definitely like one of those home produced things where he sounds like this jack-of-all-trades who's putting all these like quirky sounds and his productions and the the tune at the core of this very sort of quirky instrumentation is pretty solid as well definitely looking forward to what he's going to be doing in the future we have childish gambino with redbone really enjoy the soulful dark sort of off-kilter in strange direction donald glover has been taking his recent songs in which makes me very psyched to listen to this new record some people are like getting at me on twitter saying oh you fight you finally enjoy childish gambino you finally came around on childish gambino you're finally realizing don't Glover's a genius like do you guys not get that these songs sound radically different from everything he's done up until this point do you not understand that it's like I'm not even listening to the same artist at this point if you told me you honestly if I listened to these tracks and I didn't know who it was I just feel like whatever these are good sort of left-field soul songs who's this artist you wouldn't even need to tell me it's childish gambino I wouldn't even fucking tell us childish gambino which i guess is part of the reason what what makes them so enjoyable ah but uh but yeah I mean it's it's cool and exciting though that it's him it's interesting to see artists take new directions and I support him in that especially since I'm liking this new direction so hell yeah - redbone great track moving on from there Flatbush zombies with song Aries featuring dead cuts this is their first post 3001 oughta see album that they dropped not too long ago that it was pretty on the fence with for a lot of reasons I thought the production was kind of bland but now that they're not putting out a commercial track here sounds like they are sort of back to come through some grimy beats and some not really aggressive verses this track is actually quite dark I would say it's actually another post-election song in a lot of ways because the group is attacking or I guess tackling with issues such as race and politics in America so it seems like they were kind of deeply affected by what was going on politically this past election and had to make a song sort of talking about where our politics and where culture is at and again I would I would say a post-election song and one of the more effective and interesting and emotionally moving post-election songs I've heard over the past week or so we have Shu Shu with the song wandering Shu Shu wonderful post-punk band who just came out with an amazing Twin Peaks covers record which is going to be one of my favorite records of the year have a new album on the way of original material and this song over here has a bit of a left-field synth pop vibe to it that I like a lot it's very sweet but very bitter as well and sort of has that trademark Shu Shu darkness to it despite the fact that it does feel like they're getting a little friendlier getting a little more accessible on this track but of course you know there's that weird side to Shu Shu that always comes out and it's a been amazing sort of seeing these guys really since I was in college and you know even before that they were coming out with records but really since I was in college progressing and a lot of interesting ways and always trying something new always doing something different just keep shushu interesting so shout out to Shu Shu try this track out and finally I want to give a shout out to the band power trip for the song firing squad if you're into some savage just in-your-face brick to your skull metal core like it's got a thrash element to it but then it's got like a hardcore element to it give this thing a shot I wouldn't say it's the most original thing in the world but it's got a lot of blood guts sweat and aggression to it that I think people who are into loud rock will really appreciate and yeah that's it guys those are all the tracks I want to recommend to you and talk about in this video hope you enjoy the songs that are my favorites of the week and definitely try out that poly vinyl compilation if you get a chance and remember if you want to support this segment down there in the description there is a link to our Amazon Associates link or the Amazon Associates link is there anything you buy if you live in the US we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price and um that's all I have to say guys in

Y7cCytQCaAM,here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Metallica record hardwired to self-destruct thrash metal legends Metallica are back with a new record James Hetfield and the gang have delivered 77 minutes of new material on this thing on the standard edition it is a double disc album that actually had some pretty reputable teaser tracks songs like hardwired and Atlas rise I mean tracks that you know they're not exactly ride the lightning but they are some of the best material Metallica has released in years and show that the band is starting to get back in touch with what made them so good in the first place something the band lost sight of during their regrettable reinvention during the load and reload era and then the deterioration of Metallica's appeal continued on Saint anger and Death Magnetic - the worst produced Metallica albums to date the hard wired is is definitely an improvement and one that has been seeing some pretty positive reviews across the board at least positive for Metallica it is pretty trendy to hate on Metallica but I think this album was bound to receive some positive reviews no matter what based simply on the fact that this is not Lulu which unfortunately will most likely go down as one of the most hated albums in rock history not really because of the quality of its content I think the album isn't usually critiqued on that in my opinion I like some elements of Lulu but it was a project that was bound to fail because one the last thing Metallica fans want to hear is some burnt-out rock poet rattling off these sexual and esoteric diatribes and the last thing Lou Reed fans want to hear is the kind of metal that sounds like it should be booming out of the back of a pickup truck just two worlds that never should have collided but somehow the stars aligned and the rest is history so in a way all Metallica had to do here was just not come out with another Lulu but I think they surpassed at least that expectation so in a way all Metallica had to do here was just not come out with another Lulu but I think they surpassed that expectation with a set of songs that throw it back to the good old days and unfortunately I don't mean the 80s good old days of more like the early 90s like Black Album era Metallica very solid but also very commercial the band is once again dishing out these kind of mid paced groovy heavy thrash riffs that are very catchy very anthemic they're also bringing the kind of lyricism that showcase a bit of cynicism when it comes to the human condition Metallica of course is talking about war on this record man's tendency toward violence power and death the song confusion even touches down on PTSD and the mental scars that some soldiers suffer after coming home from war I also like that songs epic harmonious guitar layering quite a bit but that's on the second disc as far as the first disc the start of this album is concerned it is very strong again those teaser cuts I mentioned earlier luma mwah and the song moth into the flame isn't really that bad of a high-octane moment considering that this is the third act of Metallica's career though the song dream no more sort of sounds like a regrettable return to the load ERA with its kind of funky groovy guitar riffs which are topped with some really odd vocal harmonies that sound like they were pulled straight out of the Alice in Chains playbook and the song halo on fire while it's not bad I really liked the tune I really liked the ballad at the core of the song especially how it kicks off it sort of reminds me of one of the darker moments off of the Black Album something I was hoping to hear a return of but quickly the song just kind of transitions into the same kind of mid pace thrash riffs that you can hear throughout much of this record and that's the thing while this album does in a lot of ways feel like a throwback to the Black Album those sort of dark moody ballads where the tunes were just excellent and made for some Metallica's best most memorable tracks just or not here unfortunately which would have been nice because that would have provided a little bit of variety in the track listing here a variety that unfortunately the second disc of this thing does not really bring for sure confusion is great and the very explosive closer spin out the bone is one of the fastest and most intense moments on the record but man unkind here comes revenge and murder one sort of failed to really make their case as essential tracks in the track listing here especially with lyrics like here comes revenge just for you revenge you can't undo revenge it's killing me revenge set me throw and aces wild aces high all the Aces aces till you die and then a my savage brings that same kind of funky groovy thrash guitar riffing that made mid to late 90s Metallica so intolerable you know it's a decent Metallica album again some of the band's best material in years but it is a very bloated record in my opinion a lot of tracks that didn't really need to be here because they were either just deja vu borrowing heavily from Metallica Zolder material or they just felt redundant within the tracklisting itself on this thing if load and reload had been part of a trilogy which this album was completing this record would have been titled overload still though there are elements generally about this record that I can praise and that is that in some ways this record does feel like a bit of a return to form for Metallica the production generally is pretty good the performances are decent there are some highlights in terms of writing there are a couple moments here in the error feels like Metallica is making their compositions a little more dynamic with more guitar layering more vocal layering to make things a little more melodic and harmonious though it's not like they do that so often that it feels like they're really kind of pushing forward and experimenting and really changing their sound or doing something different doing something exciting this is very much like a meat and potatoes kind of Metallica album in many ways and while that may not sound exciting it's at least good to hear Metallica doing themselves justice after so many years I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this record church or a transition have you given this album

U_PyyvgFLLI,hi everyone I would say all 'funny right a no but I'm afraid of someone actually thinking I'm a member of the alright here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new justice album woman French electronic music duo justice they are back with a new record and they are a duo whoo God I was anticipating this record mostly because I love their debut album cross that came out back in 2007 so much sure it has its flaws but I think that album is such a fantastic moment for dance music in the 2000s really a high point in a lot of ways that is an epic record that record has a lot of presence to it it has I don't know it's almost like a religious experience that's why the cross is so goddamn fitting I will do the D ance and the the altar of beats I love this album which is why it hurts so much to hear justice shortchange themselves again on another new album it's been five years since the release of their last record audio Video Disco which was not an album you wanted to let have like some breathing room afterwards because the longer that album just kind of sat out there in the open the longer we just sort of had it sink into our heads that man that that was really let down for numerous reasons I mean not only was the album an unenjoyable change of pace seeing just as sort of incorporating more live instrumentation but sort of failing pathetically to actually drum up a groove that made me want to dance there are a couple cool songs on this thing here and there and in a way it was cool to see justice pay tribute directly to the styles of disco and funk music that they pulled inspiration from on their debut record and I would be lying or at least omitting the truth if I didn't come out and say that in a way woman is certainly an improvement on what justice was attempting to do on audio video disco it at least sounds like there's more live bass lines and drums on this record and maybe as well I'm not entirely sure what's live in what sequence it blends together really well and I think that's what makes the mix of what makes the production of this album slightly better it doesn't sound clunky or stiff it doesn't sound like justices in the middle of a transitional moment they effectively blended these worlds of electronic and analog really well the problem though is that the compositions on this record are so painfully uninspired again justice comes through with a dance record that doesn't make me want to dance at all maybe it would elicit some light head bobbing during like a headphone listening session but that's it the beats on this thing are so flaccid they're so watered down you get a good groove here and there and some of the instrumentals are okay but justice was so much more than a decent instrumental duo back when they originally drop and broke the scene and made everybody want to make electro house this is not that huge epic  bowling ball dropped into a kiddie pool experience that cross was could they still demand that same sort of level of social relevance probably not but at least produce a track that could give me a glimmer of hope that that might be possible in 2016 because they're not even doing that not only do the the beats on this thing the dance grooves barely even I think put a dent in my desire to move my body but the vocal performance is on this thing are horrendous who is singing on this record the singing is so boring and forgettable it might as well not even be there I just feel like I'm listening to all of these half-hearted disco rock songs and a couple of the tracks are oddly experimental and feature these kind of noisy very dissonant and chaotic guitar solos that I don't really think compliment justices sound or vibe at all oh that song love SOS is a total mess it's a love love emergency their tracks on this thing that sound like aerial pink and Toro y Moi collaborating to purposefully create the most bland disco that they could imagine it sort of has that throwback nostalgia quality to it that so many disco inspired albums do but justice don't really make me excited to hear disco music or make me desire that eras return rather they just kind of remind me of why disco eventually fell and why that was a good thing I'm just not really sure what else to say about this record other than that it's just another disappointment from justice again in comparison with their last record there are some slight very slight improvements but I feel like those production and those instrumental improvements are kind of squashed by the fact that this is justices weakest crop of songs to date sure it's like pleasant to listen to like you could have it on in the background but it's not like this experience which again is what was so fantastic about justice to begin with they made dance music that felt like something more than just dance music it was like connecting with dance music on a spiritual level it was like dance music as a religion but even though with this latest record over here we are treated to another cross on the cover the further justice progresses into their discography the more they feel like I don't know not religious dance music producers but more like dance music secularists or agnostics or dance music atheists I don't know I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if

aqiM-PY4MpI,ah hi everyone Papa the Serrano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Bruno Mars record 24 karat magic Bruno Mars famed singer pop singer-songwriter back with his third full-length album of horrible title not that good of an album cover either but this thing kind of threw me for a loop did not anticipate enjoying this as much as I did and I think that's because over the past several years Bruno Mars has learned a pretty important lesson about his career and that is when he has a huge hit it's when it's kind of a bit of a throwback a huge reference point to an older musical act or popular sound like with the song locked out of heaven which was a gigantic nod to the police or with uptown funk with Mark Ronson big electro funk Huey Lewis and the news vibes on that single it seems like all he needs to do is just repeat this throwback formula until his bank account just gains more zeroes in fact I think that's what the title of this album might be in reference to just how much money he thinks he's going to make off of this thing and so far the prediction seems to be true given that the lead single the title track from this thing has well over 100 million hits on YouTube right now and is easily one of the biggest songs of the year the song is so goddamn irresistible fun the only kind of person I can imagine hating 24-karat magic the single is someone who hates hates smiling maybe like the the preacher dad from the Footloose movie no dancing no dancing at all on this track lil Bruno Mars goes full James Brown dude he lays some stank on this beat with some great synth funk leads as well as a kind of Gergely bassline that I loved a lot and also Bruno Mars's vocal delivery on this thing is super bombastic charismatic it's over-the-top it's braggadocious it's got a lot of swagger and Bruno follows suit with a bulk of the songs on this record pulling from that same era in the late 70s and the 80s of R&B and electro funk he even dabbles in a little bit of New Jack Swing on the song finesse which was kind of surprising considering that as one of the 80s many musical dead ends that not many artists today explore even when they're sort of throwing back to that decade this thing overall is a very tight nine tracks it runs just over 30 minutes so Bruno doesn't really leave himself a lot of room for error every song here has to be a smash every song here has to be a banger song perm is amazing I would say it's an even sharper and more vibrant tribute to James Brown with it's funky drumming and hot worn sections and Bruno Mars going even crazier with these yelling shouting verses and the song that's what I like even though this track I think at its core at the songwriting at the balladry at the at the center of this song it has a bit of an old soul but the sounds surrounding this song like the very snappy 808 drums or the kind of punchy but smooth rushes of chords throughout the track very very 2016 also I like the lyrics on this track about spoiling your lover with the finer things in life and of course there are plenty of slow jams to be had in the track listing on this thing as well like what the song calling all my lovelies I like the very steamy nocturnal keys and beat on this track and I think it's really funny toward the end of the cut you get a bit of a skit where Bruno Mars is calling one of his honey's on the phone and he gets the voice mailbox of none other than Halle Berry and then we have the cut Versace on the floor which is the Alpha slow jam on the record God the glistening keys and the slow funky but I don't know kind of tropical beat on this thing has definitely a Michael Jackson vibe to it without a doubt especially with how Bruno is singing over the instrumental a sachet I don't know it's so sexy it's so sensual but not every slow jam on this thing is excellent I mean the song straight up and down as the these moments where Bruno's come-ons do get a little corny even though I do love the line on this thing where he is singing about celebrating this particular woman's booty you know I I celebrate the booty Anthony Fantana celebrates the booty but I think the trashy lyrics and the repetitions of straight but throughout the track is just one of a handful of moments on this thing where I think the new and the old sort of clash in a really tacky way I feel roughly the same way about the song chunky as well and there's not really too much more about the album outside of that you know this thing is enjoyable but of course it has its flaws it gets a little too mellow too fast for my taste I also think that it uses nostalgia as a bit of a crutch to sort of carry the album from start to finish and make the album enjoyable to the average listener like oh they'll they'll remember this sound or maybe they'll sort of be wowed by this different musical sound that they're unfamiliar with because maybe it was before their time or something and a few tracks pale in comparison to one another here and there all that being said I think this is Bruno Mars's best album surprisingly good tunes on this thing and I think it's a pretty tasteful celebration of an era in pop music that I think we as listeners and musicians can still learn quite a bit from there are a few moments on this record where I think Bruno has in fact mastered this style this sound and and at its worst he just kind of merely appreciates it but sort of shows at least a deeper level of appreciation for than a lot of his contemporaries you know this thing is nostalgia but it's not cheap nostalgia it's like really spendy bougie designer nostalgia so just go into this album expecting that I suppose I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this album oh listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please

k0vMdRfwFxY,yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll put it on I'll put it on it's only fair hi everyone 15800 here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new A Tribe Called Quest record we got it from here of what thank you for your service legendary New York rap outfit A Tribe Called Quest are back with their first record in like about 20 years and even though I typically go into comeback albums with a very healthy dose of skepticism there was certainly reason to be excited for a new tribe record not just because they were one of the greatest to ever do it but also with the rise of artists like Kendrick Lamar and chance the rapper tribes very jazzy and thoughtful approach to rap music is relevant now more than ever the group even shouts out J Cole and Joey badass too on the song this generation so it would be interesting to see how the group would translate in 2016 not just sonically but also politically especially with the insane election season that of America just went through there's plenty to comment on q-tip and company would have to address at least some of it and then there's the added shock of five dogs recent passing but not before he recorded a wealth of verses for this very project and tribes remaining members actually lace in a few very tasteful tributes to five dog toward the end of the record which on the song lost somebody actually gets quite emotional now this thing is also a pretty long album it's a double disc and sixty minutes in length there's an impressive feature list on this thing as well people like Busta Rhymes and consequence who go way back with the Tribe Called Quest and then we have newbies like Kendrick Lamar and Anderson pack dudes who are putting in work back in the 2000s like telecoil II as well as Andre 3000 of Outkast Fame and interestingly enough Jack White who provides quite a few guitar lines and solos on this thing too so really no reason to doubt tribe going into this final project and I will just say straight off the bat they do do the production on this thing for the most part is fantastic and follows the very same jazzy funky and loopy formula that a lot of the group's earlier work did some tracks are a little more synth centric like melatonin and kids and conrad tokyo others are a bit more melodic like the song solid wall of sound with its prominent Elton John samples played throughout the track the songs instrumental actually builds up into a solid wall of sound the song is truly deserving of its title this thing mostly sounds like the same old tribe but in the best way possible it might be something the group kind of gets away with because their sound just happens to have aged really well and maintained relevance after all these years but still living up to the quality level of albums like the low-end theory is still no small task instead of reinventing themselves after this 20-year gap tribe essentially proves how relevant and essential their sound is still in 2016 even though in a way this album feels like a conscious passing of the torch to a new generation of artists and fans especially given the title of this record as well as tracks like dis generation and kids where the group shows a level of faith in this young generation that most old heads don't this album is surprisingly dynamic as well with it's really exciting and urgent and sort of politically charged highs like We the People and it's got some pretty sensual lows as well like with the song enough and then there are some surprising spots in between where Tribe Called Quest's are doing what they do incredibly well or experimenting a little bit - like on the song black spasmodic which is a bit of a reggae flip with the instrumental or the song The Killing season which features one of the grime iasts meanest baselines I've heard in a while when Kanye West sung hook comes into the track the song makes a very dreary transition where the lyrics start reflecting on racism and injustice in America the song moving backwards is also sort of obsessed with this idea of America regressing philosophically and politically and the song is elevated with some very passionate soulful vocals from Anderson PAC the topics are pretty on point on the record - from track to track like with the song a space program which features some strong messages of unity and after centrism and then we have the song ego which is like classic tribe in every way shape and form where q-tip is in a very clever way filing through all the ways that ego sort of drives mankind to do crazy things I also think he makes an excellent point on the song kids talking about how the old looked down upon the young even though they were young once too and had their own struggles and stumbles just like this new generation does and the song we the people is sort of like this inclusion anthem that seems to have gained even more relevance now that Trump has won the election and people are now a little more worried about racial and religious injustice in America and tribe even reaches across the aisle on this track to the gay community mentioning them as well interesting since tribe has sort of a checkered past with that when you consider the Georgie Porgie demo that could have been an album track off of the low end theory that I mentioned in my review of that album you know the writing the flows on this thing they're so solid and they're so on point it's like they just don't miss a beat it's like the past 20 years haven't been spent silent there's nothing I could really sort of point out as being missing on this thing because tribe just sort of brings their usual mix of humor satire and reality checks now it's just sort of been updated for one of the most insane years in modern history I think this is just the sensible smart rap album that we needed to sort of wrap up 2016 and just throw it in the trash it's also kind of the musical lifesaver that I think a lot of hip-hop fans needed to sort of keep them afloat as all of the very choppy social waters fold huge waves on top of them again and again and again and they use their experience to sort of bring perspective to not only the art of hip-hop but to the struggles that every young generation needs to go through in order to sort of bring the change that they want to see into the world there's not really a song on this thing that I don't love to some degree sure I think maybe titling the final song the Donald even though that is a direct reference to five dog dawn juice as a little Beatty and also consequence and Busta Rhymes do tend to really overtake the album though given their history with A Tribe Called Quest they are pretty much family and their performances are great their verses are great you can't really hate on the fact that you're hearing these guys so often because they do bring talent to the table this thing is really a stellar album and easily I think the best rap record that 2016 has had to offer it's like the genre just toss this three-pointer out there before the clock ran out and it was just like nothing but net and it's also proof that you can do something new relevant contemporary and refreshing while sticking to hip hop's foundational characteristics it's just a matter of staying creative and not really letting your past define you completely anyway I'm feeling a decent too strong 9 on this album yeah um Tran is good I have a kiss please could I please have a kiss can you acknowledge my existence 
vkVReXIgcFM,"so yeah as you know we're gonna do like a little impromptu episode of the needle drop podcast here my semi dead interview podcast which we're just resurrecting for the sound on sound festival so I appreciate you sound on sound bringing me down here to interview a few great artists today the first of which are a hip hop group that I hope you're familiar with I've reviewed their albums on multiple occasions the great clipping with a period at the end clipping where I can just touch these guys usually I'm just talking about them into a camera with a youtube video and the first time that we get in it outside of the internet when was the the first time that we guy that we met I met you guys shortly after you came out with your first mixtape was that in Palm Springs no play there I first met these guys at South by Southwest after I had interviewed them so I didn't know anything about these guys personally I never met them I just they just had a mixtape midcity that I thought was really good and then I think out of the blue you guys just showed up to this set that this this uh this showcase that I had booked with a friend of mine and they were just like hey can we play and I was like sure we were well I thought it was booked you what happened was young fathers had shown up last-minute and they played yes but you guys still took me off-guard because they came through with this set that was so ear piercing that everybody who is in the warehouse that we were holding it in ran out of the where they like cleared the room just at the warehouse standing in the middle of an empty warehouse so you know they just like pretty much clean my they just pretty much came on like it's clipping bitch and then just all this huge rush of distortion and feedback came pouring through the PA and dahveed it was like darkest in the warehouse but he had his son he had sunglasses on and I don't even know if like they were just so into what they were doing I didn't even know if they noticed that people were running out of the venue with their ears bleeding we didn't we'd had experience with that before so okay so you really came to  up I thought it was like maybe they just no I mean no we actually did actually like the music that we make but like I don't know you know it seemed it was I don't know it wasn't wasn't Mike Eagle also playing like I think if you if you came for like quiet raps and then you you know you think you're they're expecting particularly quiet rap so we've toured with Milo like we flex with Milo super tough but if you came for Milo and instead you got clipping you leave it was a really weird bill like it was all over the place like some loud rock bands played earlier and like Anamanaguchi was supposed to play after but then we had like a backline issues it was a fun time and then I caught you guys later in Palm Springs yeah the first time I had been there and that was a nice show that was a nice little bar that you guys had brought me to and I met I met all of your girlfriends too so I all the missus clippings and they were they were all great and they were very supportive of all that you guys are doing as am I so if if you guys didn't already know they had just dropped a new album called splendor and misery on Sub Pop Records and their second commercial full-length album and I believe correct yeah it's it's a concept album of sorts tell me a little bit about the story and the idea of the narrative of this album as much as you want to say without spoiling the entire thing unless you want to spoil the entire thing go for it well I don't think we actually can spoil the entire thing because it's oblique enough that the three of us don't agree on what the plot is really so no matter who you talk to you might be slightly different I mean we sort of appreciate with the idea that like all versions of the story were true simultaneously and as long as some new decisions spied what each of the three of us sort of thought the plot of the record was and the ideas in the record were like it was okay you know and then listening to it is like the process of being like an archivist or something and finding primary sources and having to put a story together without the whole thing there with just like weird little artifacts so yeah I think as much of the story as we agree on is that we're following the last surviving member of an uprising honest on an intergalactic slave ship and this ship's computer who falls in love with him as they pilot the ship into nothing and one thing that sort of took me off guard or you know you could tell me of this came up independently of all this or if you know it was something that the three of you had sort of stirred up together but back going back to the days of like slave spirituals I wonder if it was kind of inspired by the work that you had recently done on Hamilton you know if that was sort of connected to that in any kind of way yeah we had actually we recorded all I mean all of this album before Hamilton was even a thought we did most of this recording a long time ago and really post Hamilton was just like tweaking and finishing things up but actually I think me and Jonathan had sort of independently of each other become really interested in work songs and spirituals like we were both reading books I was like had sort of picked up a bunch of like compilations of old Prison work songs and chain gang songs and mountain songs and things which there's a lot of overlap yeah and as we started sort of thinking about this this album we knew we wanted to do something about we knew we wanted to do this sort of that for a futurist space thing and as we started thinking about that part of the thing that was exciting was trying to create through-line so what are the what are the the things that we recognized as we start to to create a world that is is so far in the future from where we live what things have been held onto and so that that was really it was about you know kind of having some sort of like cultural muscle memory of work songs or of spirituals also you know mixed in with what we buy recognize right now was like contemporary rap music or whatever these far enough in the future all of these things sort of bleed together and it's all part of the same like slave narrative and the way that you guys sort of incorporated into the record it's pretty stark because some of these work songs are some of what could be considered work songs stylistically are so naked and bare it's like you don't even really kind of touch them up we're talking about just like kind of really just like acapella tracks vocal tracks you know whoa what was the decision or where did the decision come from to sort of just be like you know let's just leave these on here as raw as they can be and just kind of really kind of take people from one century to several centuries back just to you know immediately with what second of a record yeah well we tried to build into them I mean the first one they they the singers appear with like inside of a track and then it's slowly the track peels away to reveal the acapella stuff so we were trying to ease into that and then by the second side who knows if this worked we thought we had earned just letting these singers just be alone for that track and a lot of it is I mean just on an aesthetic level when you have like singers or instrumentalists that good I'm always like well like all right like if you add something are you fighting it are you making it better and you just take away as much as you can and then letting it sort of sit on its own is really but I mean that was only always the intention to let those pieces sort of sit on their own as much as possible you know and also like the character on the album is received like there's so much of stuff on the album it like feels like radio transmissions or like has to do with sort of receiving signals in one way or another and we were trying to kind of blur the line between like well are these being transmitted is he picking this up with some sort of technological equipment or is this like some sort of dream stays some some sort of other kind of like dream mental sort of transmission reception sort of idea to sort of go off of what you were saying about not having sounds and ideas competing musically on the record I mean even the instrumentals themselves are pretty stark a lot of the time you know to the point where it seems like you guys are really trying to immerse the listener into not so much a piece of music but really the sound of the spaceship that the the character who the album is following is living on you know we're did a lot of these sounds come from you know because obviously this I know that you guys sort of take samples from real things or there'd be breaking glass or ball bearings or you know I don't even know half of the things you guys sample it's insane but where did you gather all these sounds for this spaceship that didn't even exist you know what what did you use or sort of what kind of sounds that you grab to sort of create this atmosphere that felt so real on the record it's really to go on a spaceship someone yeah it's mostly synthesizer for the most part but there are recorded sounds but the thing about the recorded sounds is it's much more like I think we were using more like film Foley techniques instead of like field recording stuff because it was so the sounds themselves are so mundane because that they have to represent something else so like like slamming up oven door shut might you know be cut it out of context and it might not sound like an oven it might sound like something that could be on a spaceship so it was these like really sort of everyday objects that we were trying to use that that could sound could represent physical things on a spaceship but that weren't they're not like exciting in themselves they're not like a like am at most record where it's like we shoveled manure onto flowers or something they're whole new record they sample the washing machine at this is about this washing machine where we were trying to disguise actually there's so I think there's an oven in a washing machine totally a washing machine you believer yeah yeah and you end up making a lot of decisions to that like we normally wouldn't make like usually on an album like if we have this field recording that has this really particularly great like metal gate closing or something and we're like oh this is really rhythmically interesting let's cut it into a loop we don't care that you can also hear birds in the background but on this record we had to say well that that puts it in a context that's totally inappropriate for this really sort of stark out of space record so we actually can't use the sound here even though even though the metal itself is the right sound so we were actually like really trying to remove context from the from the field recording so they could have a different context as much as possible the narrative of the record is pretty dense you guys fit in a lot in the 40 or so minute runtime that you guys have on the album are there moments of this story that haven't yet been explored that you guys will go back to later or they're parts of the story that I've sort of gone on the cutting room floor that you'd like to talk about there's not a lot of wrapping that we didn't use but there's like three additional hours of instrumentals one of those say something one of the constraints early on was that we really wanted it to be one piece of vinyl so this was really an exercise in like really trimming it down so it could be to quote yes I think so yeah we could revisit I mean it's the world is interesting and fun I don't it doesn't seem particularly like us to go back and do it another space record but like you know Never Say Never but yeah I think I think there's you know I'm still learning stuff when I listen to it so I think until that stops I probably probably don't need to write more outerspace raps speaking of the opposite of keeping things short enough 40 minutes or so not too long earlier before you guys had come out with that album you dropped that dreams remix on Bandcamp which is about 24 hours long what inspired you to do 24 hour long remix of honestly I'm not even quite sure I'm sure the song dreams is is remixed in that you know that is literally just a that track dream using an algorithm called Paul stretch just stretched to 24 hours to stretch to 24 hours okay so remember that like that Justin Bieber at 4,000 times slower thing that's exactly what we did got it no but at 24 hours got it okay all right well then let's fast-forward people were really disappointed when they're like oh my god did you sit there and play all this for 24 hour we were like we haven't haven't even heard all 24 hours of getting texts from friends it's like our 13 is pretty good it's like a that it is have not heard it because it was a it was sort of a joke about like it being like making sort of intellectual connections between ambient music and the sort of process that the sort of Paul stretch internet like fad and then also there are interesting like DJ Screw and that like what slowing down does to music so wait and we originally talked about it's just like Oh nobody cuz we put out the the remix scene album at the same time with a bunch of remixes from that the first sub pop album and nobody had remixed the song dream which we were all kind of disappointed about because we really liked that you know people talking about it was like oh let's just do our own remix of it and give it a fake name and stick it on the end of this album like really quick and let's just like Paul stretch it to like you know 40 minutes because it's a Van Camp album and there's no like maximum link that's not like it's coming out on CDs so it's like great you can download there's like twelve track album and it's like nine hours long because the last track is eight and a half hours long and I thought that was really funny and then the time just kept growing and then it became its own thing you know tell me a little bit about your opinion of sort of keeping mystery in music because you guys are really forthright you've always been really forthright about out of all the times I've talked to you about your process the things that you do in your music how you make your music but you know but easily you could just sit there and be like oh yeah well we spent so much time on the dream remix and that's why when you listen to our 14 it's it's just so amazing you know it but but instead yours like actually it's this and you know but but the thing is like if you the more in the dark you keep people sometimes the more like I guess they kind of come up with their own narrative as to how it was creative and although sometimes I guess the simplest answers is the truth I think that's also it's partly why we put so many like weird coded messages and like hidden things in the music itself and leave stuff in the music so oblique because our personalities are just such that we're like we're just gonna tell you everything if you ask like we're not we talk a lot and we're not we're not mysterious guys but we try to make the music mysterious I guess yeah I mean like I don't know this is a this kind of stuff as I said I'm always really excited to hear I just talk about like I like seeing the how how how it came to be like how we made the thing so that's how we end up speaking but like I you know the mystery like what one of the things I love about music is like it doesn't matter it doesn't write like I don't know knowing how a thing was made doesn't affect how it makes me feel when I listen to it like that it has zero consequence really it's just oh that's awesome maybe now I have a way to kind of try and repeat this feeling what you actually don't because like you know it's all it's all person-specific and everything so yeah I don't I don't know giving away like learning the secret to how a thing was made has never changed how I reacted to the music and if all you are is like if all we are is just like a set of like of like secrets and tricks that we don't let anybody you know like if anybody who knows all of these techniques and these these tricks could do exactly what we're doing then fine like I guess we're not doing anything interesting you know like it's got to be more than that and the more that more people know all the tricks that can be done the more interesting music will get made quicker and quicker and quicker so I don't I don't really like understand like musicians who won't share their process or like people who claim they only listen to their own music or like I it sort of feeds into this weird cult of genius that I don't understand that I think is really damaging to it's like we're all just sort of people working and we all have ideas and in my experience like not a lot of people actually sort of work in these like grand mysterious ways and so I think it's a good it's important to like sort of shatter that idea after the dream remixed and everything you guys did a not too much earlier before a splendor and misery you dropped that a really sexually charged filthy and raw wriggle EP where I think that you guys really did an amazing job of kind of attributing the harsh noise artists that I know have always kind of influenced the production on your record you know especially that really clear White House sample that you had thrown into into the record you know what was it sort of time for you guys to sort of swing the pendulum back away not not that the album isn't a hip hop album it is but um you know but but swing the album or swing that pendulum more in the direction of like tributing bees annoys artists that have kind of inspired you so much I I wish that that I could I wish we could claim a little more like calculation in that but those are literally like the Regal EP is just the songs we had started for the previous album and hadn't quite finished by the time we had to turn it in God oh they happen to work together in a way that we really enjoy but I don't it wasn't as premeditated as I guess well we'd like it to kind of was it was just premeditated like two years earlier because we had them sort of mostly all half done and kind of all set up and ready to go and then that previous sub pop album came out and we're like oh we have this other AP that we should drop like the same day and new stuff that no one's expecting and they hated that idea and didn't want to do that and then two years what's a marketing clusterfuck yeah yeah our person like no yeah I kind of love it when bands do that yeah the one like super premeditated thing was that we were actually going to release it the week of before and like my like now I have this team of people and they were like you realized the Tonys or that week right could you wait until after the Tonys to put out all these binary gotta care about the Tonys I was the earlier one you didn't have to care about a tonne yeah yeah and so we dropped it the day after that was encased in rubber and now like Tony a bunch of like Broadway fan teenagers and their parents come to our show and I get to say you know really like a fish girl and and that's another thing you know I mean I I didn't interview with you not too long ago where I was asking about Hamilton and just your your whole experience and in that but sort of posts all of that what kind of strange crossover has sort of that created where you know you're you're in this huge Broadway hit show but then you sort of come back to make this really sort of underground experimental hip-hop music that you're sort of potentially exposing like you said these Broadway fans too that wouldn't have found out about it otherwise yeah I think like what's great is that people consume music they say like the people who come to the shows or like the kids who went down like a rabbit hole after Hamilton and like found clipping and we're like oh I really like this like I like this enough so like they are they tend to be really open and excited it's just there's that there is a very different way that people are fans when they're at a when they are like musical theater fans than they are when you're a rap music fan you know saying so like when you should when we show up to a club five hours early for soundcheck and they're like teenagers lined up outside like waiting it's adorable and but you know once we all get in the same room like you realize like actually like you're here because you genuinely like the thing you're not you it it this would be intolerable if you were actually just here to see me in the wild Hamilton is so popular that it has like if it has this many fans that means this many people were exposed to clipping but only this many of those new people actually like us and come to the show so it's still like a wider reach but we still self-selected like this it's kind of the splendor and misery is sort of the perfect record to drop after that kind of exposure because it is a narrative album it was a very theatrical record again in hindsight it all feels so calculated but it's really very it's like was never our intention yeah another thing that you guys had recently participated in was that uh 30 now it's 40 songs for 30 days you know talking about how Donald Trump sucks dicks and everything and tell me a little bit about your participation in that with song fat fingers which I know that you guys used video of that dude sort of like pickaxe radio had nothing to do and we never saw that we saw the first time I mean I was wondering if you had actually sampled the sounds of it or no that's what it implies yes the way they did not do this way knowing what I know about you guys I was like oh that makes sense you know but like okay so the video obviously does it doesn't have any I don't know I mean huh I don't know how much I we should well we were we were asked to contribute to that project knowing very little about it I think we say this in the little blurb that the bill wrote about it but like we basically were like do you want to give us your song knees on the ground that's now what two years old to an app sold for this anti-trump compilation and we said sure I mean we're not big fans of Donald Trump sure that's fine now the biggest fans had just like I guess that's a that's a yeah and and then when that project gotta now is like 30 bands original songs all anti-donald trump songs without we can't be the one band that's like and here's ours and it's a two and a half year old song that you've all heard before but I feel like if we had been asked to write a brand new anti Trump song we would say well I don't have time to do this like yeah so we did that in like 12 hours and it yes and it feels like such a sort of even even as much as we dislike Donald Trump and as terrifying as the whole thing is like it feels like such a sort of childish thing to do is a fun sort of exercise in writing this kind of well but this is what was interesting to me it wasn't even about this was an opportunity what I why I pitched the song the way it ended up is we do our album the first sub pop album every song was sort of conceived as well this is a type of rap song we like here's a Memphis strip club song well let's do that here is a DJ Screw song let's do that like oh let's these are all like loving tributes to certain types of hip-hop that we enjoy like here's our summer you know summertime in the LBC or something like our like SoCal summer track and so what one thing we couldn't ever do is do it this song because there's no first person and diss songs are so personal and also guys like that because anybody we don't have beef with anybody we're not gonna pick on anybody we're not gonna start it artificially but like there is a rich history of diss songs and I don't know about these guys but I follow rap beef like like it's TMZ like I obsess over that and I have my whole life I love that stuff it's so silly to me so like oh this is an opportunity to like enter into all of the dumb we really wish we could be a part of but since it's like about someone who is not a rapper not gonna respond also it's not something like no one's surprised we didn't we don't like Donald Trump if anybody was surprised that anybody a compilation yeah it's like not a radical thing to do it's not like I don't know it doesn't feel like the danger of like like Bush Killa when Paris put that out when I was like 11 and was like oh I can't tell my mom I bought this tape like yeah we just like I think more than a desire to insult Donald Trump it was a strong desire to create like a really childish goofy diss song and it have like a clipping version of that because we went else you're gonna have an opportunity for that so yeah so yeah so the sound that sounds like maybe that the breaking of the sidewalk is actually we just banged on lunch tables cuz we were like this is so like playground and childish so it was like all the sounds are like a slamming dumpsters shut and hitting like metal lunch tables on a school campus yeah it's actually all sounds that we recorded for ideas that didn't quite make it on the sub pop record for doing like schoolyard school yeah we're trying to do like a DJ Quik like sugar free style just beating on tables thing that it never really got around to and to go back to a knees on the ground which obviously almost made it out of the compilation like you said you know even though you're talking about the act of this track being sort of a childish thing you guys are no strangers to making politically charged music or socially aware music you know is that something that you feel like you personally are obligated to do because you know you're sort of aware of these things in the world that you sort of object to you know greatly so you have to make a song about it you have to say something about it or is it a you know something that an artist should be obligated to do or you know need to do because they're sort of like communicating to their fans things that they think are important in the world yeah I don't know I don't know that any of us would prescribe something for another artist but like who you know knees on the ground was because we had to we weren't trying to make that song we didn't want to make that song and it would be all some of that song wasn't still super  relevant but you know that was in an instance where we actually showed up in the studio to make like a club track we were trying to make party music and it was such a bummer because police kept murdering black people that we could make party music so we made a song about that instead and I do think like I think we we struggled with whether we wanted to be like so overt with that type of political message but I don't know I do think like I don't think any art is not political and I do think that like we there are certain elements of just like what we do musically that I find I think is incredibly political like the choice to not use first-person is an incredibly political choice for for for us the sort of attempt to stretch like what you think of as like musically normal I think is just a is also a political decision I mean there's a lot written about like you know rhythms and tuning systems as exports of colonialism and as representations of patriarchy like I don't we don't need to get into a lecture on the head but it's like I do think sort of trying to break these molds or challenging anything that we take for granted as biologically normal or just how things work is like important politically so we like really intentionally like will interchange gender pronouns in almost every song that we do you know saying like if you've heard a clipping sex song like the gender of the protagonist and that song is pretty fluid or at least who they're is pretty fluid that's intentional that's not like an accident you know that that is a way of wearing our politics within like the guise of this thing that is having having no I which is having no central first-person right yeah I mean I've specifically on like that uh that gangster boo track that you guys you had her on which was an amazing feature I remember some people sort of commenting and contacting me telling me like hey that was like such an amazing like active feminism for them to bring her on this song of her to talk so Ron Shelley about sex and I'm just like you know while it is great and I do like that song it's like she's been doing that for a long time for her to get on this I've always immediately like distrustful of a super overtly political political art because I feel like you kind of run into this situation where like when things when you're when you're right you don't have to make something that's necessarily good to still be right and I and I feel like the aesthetic sort of have to guide to guide you still cuz at the unit we're still making songs it's still like music right it's not we're not writing essays necessarily but I've also realized that like to me the most exciting art and the most exciting political art is art that just demonstrates of politics rather than says it right rather than point out what's wrong with the world just make makeup make a song that is the kind of song you wish was commonplace if things weren't wrong in the way that you see them to be wrong right like they make make a song the gender fluidity not a song about how you wish there were songs with gender fluidity in them that's kind of just like the matter of being the change you want to see or just making the kind of music you want to see in the world or making the honesty make a song with your friend who is a queer rapper who raps about sex instead of making a song about how you're totally not gay but I'm not grossed out if gay people get married I swear exactly it's actually probably the most genius way to go about it because the opposite way it just seems preachy even if you do agree with the statements that are sort of being made it seems preachy and then you you get you get audience members that are gonna find themselves a agreeing with you and liking a song without ever sort of noticing the noticing the politics of it and it just starts to become normal you're like oh this is what you know this is what songs are like or this is what movies are like or this is you know it's like there's a one of my favorite stand-up comedians is Stewart Lee and he always says like he doesn't want an audience member who's like Oh Stewart Lee was great yeah but was he funny no but I agreed with him so hard yeah I Clapton and nodded the whole time okay so you know you're talking about a sort of getting away from or being distracted from making party music or songs that feel like party music to you guys because of politics and obviously you guys didn't dabble in that too much on the new record because of the concept but you know I'll just say this you guys have a pretty strained interpretation of what makes for party music you know like you know how exactly do you go about making music that feels and it does I don't disagree that it that it isn't party music how do you get music that sort of has that vibe to it has that feel to it but then ends up so on the fringe on the left side of the dial and is so harsh and kind of abrasive I mean I think we the music that you hear us make is the music we are capable of making together but like we know we're not if a song sounds like an interpretation of like a radio rap song or like a club rap song we're not making fun of it we love that music we only interpret things that we really genuinely like so like we know the form that we're trying to play within and then here are these techniques that are this is the way that we make music and so when we smash those together this is sort of what comes out but I think like you know there's no we've never put a song out that where there was any accident on it ever we sit and argue about every song for hours like there's no jamming there's no like oh look at this thing we stumbled on like that's not how we work like we're like sit and like focus our way through a piece of music you know so like the the sound that you get is this very intentional all of the reference points are things that we sat down and we're like yep that's this is what we're trying to say here that sounds right this yep this is how these words fit into this space like you know and I think our years and years of listening to a harsh - harsher music and to experimental music has sort of trained our ears in our to find those sounds like very aesthetically pleasing I mean I think that's the reason that we were all probably gravitated towards noise in the beginning I we can remember you know the experience of being in like a small room with an incredibly overpowered PA just hearing just wall noises I think incredibly euphoric and to combine that somehow with with dance music is a fun challenge and also have like sort of both read read in the same way yeah I think there's an also what you mentioned that there's like a sort of a misunderstanding I think like I see it in a lot of really young people who like what we all did this the first year you discover like harsh Noise music or any sort of really aggressive music you think its value is in how unbearable it is and as long as you stick with it and stick around you develop an aesthetic in it you develop taste and you are that these you the value of the sounds is in there they're pleasant qualities not like they're actually pleasurable not that you're just disruptive and yeah the guy who beat me up in high school likes this so I don't like that I like this other thing him you know I don't even know that last part came from that just like no that's a I've spent a long time on internet communities who like Noise music and you get people who are like it was always strange to me because it's like I like noise and I like  pop music and I like rap music and it was like my fan my fandom of noise wasn't a reaction formation against getting picked on by normal people yeah I had it was I also like this I knew somebody who hated the band tool because their bully like tool I also know people to hate tool because they don't like their music but you know that's a really nerdy bully songs in seven that's the rhythm I beat you at yes I lost my train of thought now thank you I appreciate that I appreciate that okay so going off of how you know sort of forms of rap music that you guys really enjoy inspire you what you're telling is that there's really only a matter of time before there's some kind of like revision of like Drake one dance you know whitewashed westernized dancehall music sort of turning up and do it in a clipping record somewhere I mean we have to like it and I'm saying you guys love that song I mean it's one of the biggest hits of the year I don't I'm coming three on one dance come on okay I come around I'm saying I have nothing against Drake I have hyperbole but I I don't I actually like i I don't I don't I understand why people like that song whether or not it's for me either it's saying like that dude makes hits and I don't begrudge him for making hits there are no ghost writers right just to get it out in the open no ghost writers and oh clipping ghost writers over does it matter sorry care if it's like if lin-manuel Miranda wrote all my verses would you care nobody really cares if if not Drake I'm not asking you guys to call out Drake right here but you know and not that this would be a call out or anything but yeah aside from Donald Trump a he listen to this podcast he watches my reviews when I talked about views you know he was there like it was big yeah he's good I mean they do care at all so like let's say that it's true it's true I like rappers who rap Drake can rap when he chooses to if there's anybody you guys could beef with other than Donald Trump I'm a high pop right you know who who would it be who would you be with like okay hypothetically like as like a like our PR people arranged it to sell more things like absolutely do this for sales or do we actually hate that give me column a and column B if we have time we're not a rush if there's if there's if there's a friend that you guys could beef with and sort of arrange that whole thing you know oh yeah we who would actually participate in that with us like what friend of ours would like I don't know but also if it's a good enough idea and we say it then like we just I just might be happening it's true okay well then just tell me the one if you could just beef with anybody you know actually angrily I mean honestly if we could beef well no I'm just trying to think like who would actually less more records like if Drake actually did feel offended by something we said and responded in a track we get a lot more views and downloads and listens like not that I'm trying to call out Drake or have any interest in attacking him but like there is a marketing like beef is for marketing so if we're just gonna be crass about it yeah yeah I don't know I'd like actual can't think of an actual artists who I would who I would care to be okay I won't press the issue any who's the softest who like you wouldn't even get your feelings hurt because like by their response like what yeah like and what would be the point then you know like this part of the thing is that in hip-hop it seems like there's this really prominent element of and and not to say that this takes away from the genre at all but you know it I think it sort of it says a lot that in a way Ric Flair is a huge influence on hip-hop with the way that he talked with the way that he's like such a huge animated personality he's showing up all the time now by kids who are like too young to know right I mean like that's fascinating to me I love that he did that same video recently with Waka Flocka Flame because I guess they both kind of are running for president now but having said that in a way you guys completely sidestep that whole you know avoiding sort of talking in the first person and and that sort of thing in your music it seems like that whole element of you know bravado and sort of coming out there and being like this braggadocious you know gorilla chested  talker who's gonna beat the out of you it's like you guys kind of subvert that entirely and isn't hard to continue to avoid that as you move forward or is it just like not a part of the equation you know I mean look at us not really like that's a you know I mean there is something about it just as a rapper like there's something about if you're a rapper and you're still rapping and you're in your 30s like you think you're a really good rapper I think I'm a great rapper thank you I wouldn't do it like that you know but I'm also it is not sort of within the realm of my personality to spend a lot of like comparing myself to other rappers are talking about how I'm better than because I also consume so much rap music and I steal so much from other rappers and I like learning Cadence's and studying what they do like I'm a nerd about this so again like the way we make music is the way that we make music and and the idea of not having first I first pitched the idea that we never use first person because I was like we wanted to make music that was tougher than we are personally and I didn't want to feel like we're play characters yeah or something yeah going back to what you had just said about being at a certain age and continuing to rap because you feel like you know you have the wherewithal to do it you have the talent to continue to do it is there an element of ageism in hip-hop is there a certain age at which no matter how talented are you should just stop I hope I think I don't think we could have reached it yet right I mean like that's the thing like we're now just entering this world where like rap is old enough to have like you know rappers in their 40s who are bored still out there making music who is it still palatable you know I don't know like I remember when American Gangster came out by jay-z and I was like this is like our the first adult contemporary rap album and I love those this is for grown-ass people there's there is no pandering to like 18 year olds on this record he's like I'm an adult I'm gonna talk about grown-up that's it this is who it's for there's no real single these beats like don't really or take it wasn't flashy it was like it was like oh so that that yeah furet we used to talk about that all the time was like oh you can sort of mark this paradigm shift where like that there is now a place for grownup rap music that didn't really exist before and in your opinion as you know people who are obviously participating in the genre do you think rap is kind of on the whole aging gracefully since you know we're kind of on the frontier that's sort of you know being in the position where you know now in hip-hop you have your legacy acts you have your comeback artists you know you have your artists who have been at it for a few decades now and they're on their 12th or 15th record I think certain artists age gracefully I wouldn't represent I wouldn't like paint the whole genre with too wide a brush I think you know I think Juicy J has aged amazingly for example I love like Eileen living yeah I I do love that like the Juicy J 2 Chainz like weird like goofy uncle kind of like perspective that it's so good it's so good I mean and I like that they're like people are coming like I remember it was like not a well-known fact when when plies first like dropped his first big breakout single that guy was like 36 when he got famous it was like I'm glad that that's available to people now right it wasn't like now you wouldn't have to hide it right but at the time like nobody talked about that but yeah it's it's I think it is I mean it ages the way that people age right it's like you know it's got a bunch of old dudes who are like that's not what real pop is like back in my day and then you've got other people who are like the cool uncle who are like trying to figure out what the kids are doing and like interested in it but still like I can actually man I I like was fortunate enough to be in the studio with with Busta Rhymes a little while ago just like hanging out while he played me tracks that he's making and he has some tracks with some like incredible features on the people who I think are like the greatest sort of young rappers out and he bodies them all and it's like you don't bust how whatever you think about Busta Rhymes has relevance like that dude is never gonna let himself get outside on his own song because he's from that era where like rappers made rap songs and he like you know and so like he's on these songs with these people who we think of as so much more relevant and so much more interesting right now and he just like is so outstanding on these trips that's amazing like this is a dude who is has worked on his craft so much that not only can he like do what kids are doing but he can do it better and he can still sound like himself with like the same kind of confidence he's already had he's always had doing I mean obviously there's still a market for that kind of stuff some people still want to hear lyricism people still want to hear like artists who are sort of at that kind of skill level I don't think that's ever going to go away you know especially with you know fans out here like these you know who watch me just talk about lyrics for hours and hours and hours but you know what is your take on this kind of prevailing sentiment that like in order to be a rapper today in order to have a successful record in order to participate in hip-hop that shouldn't sort of be a barrier you know you shouldn't have to sort of like what little yachty said in a recent radio interview have to spit a hot sixteen when you're sort of demanded to do it right there if you wanted to come out with a song that for three minutes all you said was yeah like if it was hype as  and people liked it then that should be the only requirement I totally agree no disagreement with that at all I know I mean I don't I don't know about these guys I don't have any disagreement that like those songs shouldn't exist like I will still always be looking for rappers that rap but like I like I like yachty too yeah listening to yachty we've talked about this right is like an experience of feeling like I'm too old like that was like for me I would I would more just content like the underlying assumption that what yachty or designer or Ozzy vert is doing is not lyrical is what I don't I don't agree with that baseline premise so I don't understand the attack you know I guess the thing is some people sort of see it as like sea hip-hop is like this petri dish and sort of throwing a little yachty in there throwing a little over throwing a designer in there almost poisons the well but the way that I kind of see it is it seems like hip-hop is so much larger of a network in a world for you to just kind of condense it down to well for you to be able to just throw one thing into and it ruins the whole thing what I think what I don't sort of see that comparison is accurate and I don't think you guys do either and what I think is I think is more driving the criticism is not someone sat down and carefully of his whole affectation is came to the conclusion that these are not lyrical enough it's that he his whole affectation is he does not cater to or claim to know the history the way that people think he should and I think if he did no one would question that if he seemed like if he was like oh I can name my favorite  Gang Starr song and rap all the verses from it people would be like oh then whatever cuz it's not like they're having you know there have been not that lyrical MCS for the entire history of hip-hop I mean there have been emcees that make party songs that don't require some really like intricate internal rhyme to be fun so like I don't I think it's more like an attack on what they they perceive as his disrespect and their own impending irrelevance when they see young kids coming up who don't know a biggie verse sort of that pressure to sort of know the history know all the history I mean do you think that's a pressure that's kind of unique to hip-hop because I mean there are a lot of kids who watch my show they're huge fans of Sufjan Stevens but they've never heard of simon and garfunkel record from front to back you know but nobody's jumping down their  throat you know people are too I mean remember whenever Levine mispronounced David Bowie and like that happens all over the place I don't know like anyway like you're you're like beginning in your taste and your history and your appreciation understanding music begins when you haven't heard anything right and so all of the first stuff that you hear feels like the baseline and then as you get older everyone else gets further and further away from that baseline a new sort of new things develop it it feels just like as people get older they they have less of an understanding of what's happening in the world right now it's it's terrifying to think the context that they've created for themselves and I think it's really like I don't know it's it's terrifying to think that you're getting lost in that and so I love it with something like like yadi comes out you're like I don't understand this at all this this is like I you know that I want I want the way like my grandparents reacted to Elvis to happen to me you know and it and I think that's an important thing to keep happening I feel really angry that this isn't music this is garbage and you're all selling your soul to the devil you know and I'm not saying that yadi is Elvis or anything but like but I love I think he's the closest thing we have to them right but I love I love hearing something this like just doesn't feel like it should be possible and doesn't like conform to the rules that I've built for myself based on what I've listened to my whole life I think it's a really exciting experience and so it's hard for me to hate on anything that like gives me that experience you know in that respect once you've kind of heard everything keeping up on whatever young kids are doing the sort of break the rules is really the only kind of way to get that that rushed that excitement back of like well I've never heard this before you know because once you've kind of hit upon all of those sort of popular music landmarks of you know your Velvet Underground's and your David Bowie's and your craft works and all that you know there's really it's it's kind of hard to be surprised anymore but then every once in a while you know it's like a little yadi comes out and it's like I just feel like this shouldn't be popular but it just is anyway you have to let them kind of come to you have to struggle with it you know it sort of comes to sort of come to understand it maybe maybe for us because we're all like all this fun right and that's a lot of you you're just like you heard little yadi for the first time you're like this is good this is what music what music sounds like always you know say like that's the other thing is you know all of this is coming out of communities with a hundred different artists than we haven't heard you know saying like just like we didn't come out of a vacuum like we I would you know we just toured with youth code like that is part of our community you know like um Nirvana was not the only band that sounded like that you know I mean they're great but they weren't the only like it's not create nothing's created in a vacuum in that respect I mean what's your take generally on sort of new artists who come out and pretty much all they have to bring to the table is just nostalgia for something that had happened 20 years ago you know is is it just kind of another thing that we're like if it's popular it's fine or are they kind of like I don't know missing the bigger picture if it's good I don't know like I don't know we don't I don't I was gonna say it yet I'm not offended by it it's it's also not what I'm interested in listening to so it actually I've managed to completely stay out of that like conversation or that like sort of cultural phenomenon too because I actually haven't heard much of it cuz in a lot of way the 90s are back you know you know what if I were doing if I were like working PR for little yadi I would tell him he should go around on every radio show and say his favorite 90s rapper is Malachi from group-home everyone's mind would explode one more question or one more thing I'd like to get you guys to take on before we head out is you know I can't help but ask because I have reviewed your music on numerous occasions and I know you've seen my reviews enough that I'm asking you to sort of praise my reviews but there are a lot of reviewers out there who are a lot less forgiving than me you know especially when it comes to your music forgive us and interest I've had a personal friend of mine and there was a particular publication and excuse me for the you know the very offensive joke here no you know I'll put I'll put it may be a little nicer but he had said to me wow you would think that clipping had killed the the mothers of all the staff writers at this particular publication if just just by looking at the scores that they get on their website I mean it's like in in today's day and age you know do you guys try to keep track of a sort of public reception reviews or reviews maybe not even well that much of a factor in the internet ages it used to be we we are big fans of music in general so of course we read music criticism of other like of every of everything but our own records included and one thing I I will say that I've said about you for years actually that I'm excited about people like you who feel like the sort of future of music journalism they feel like all of a sudden we're following individuals who have specific tastes rather than organizations that have the taste of an organization like if you get reviewed by Rolling Stone or Stereogum or pitchfork or any of these places I I don't I don't feel like the readership is following like particular writers like by and large I mean we do and certainly I know people who do but if you get a review by Anthony Fantana we that there's no there's no corporate interest there's no like there's no like boss in the writers room telling you what score to get where my ghost stories right Quinton Butler but you tell them what score you want to you you know your brand is yourself is the individual and you say well I like Fanta no because I like Fanta knows taste and I think that's a really interesting and positive way for music journalism to move forward as opposed to saying well this lifestyle brand of a website is going to define what music I like and that I mean it just never really means personally is I think it creates a certain level of accountability too because if I say something I really have to stick by it I can't be like hey it's actually like on this website it's just one person's just one writers opinion you know even though it's presented as yeah yeah under the heading of the one so I mean all the comments I get all that you know all the tweets I get all the three am phone calls I get that are like you gave little yeah higher score than blank bass  you yeah you know I got a deal with those but you know it's like it's but if I didn't want to deal with that heat I wouldn't have taken the job on and but you know the perk is that I get to sit down with you guys here and have a conversation about your records and I appreciate you guys coming on and talking with me and sharing everything and just always being chill and always just being so nice so but thank you right back "
WIlpRZLxPYE,Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd what you doin sorry this is a bit different of a format here obviously for this video but I am out of the country right now so when I come back we will be back in the room and everything like that this week up the loads are really going to be pretty scant I'm still out of the country like I said but once I get back I'm coming back with a vengeance of course I'm doing the track Called Quest review getting all those other reviews done that I've been meaning to do have a whole ton of Twitter videos and I want to drop to so you know regularly scheduled programming once I am back in the country but for now while I am in Australia I'm just going to do this favorite tracks video now guys remember if you want to support this segment if you want to do right by this segment hit up the amazon associates link down there in the description anything you buy using that link if you live in the US we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price alright let's get into the best and worst tracks of the week over here let's kick it off with the worse now this past week has been an insane week we all know that but thankfully the music world really went easy on us and really only gave me one song one group that I could sort of classify as being terrible and that is really kind of this new music video and single from the band okely-dokely the song white wine spritzer now this is a Ned Flanders themed metal band that's actually painfully generic and the music is not even slightly interesting I can't even pretend to be interested in this band honestly like the Ned Flanders dress-up thing is kind of funny but once you actually see the band's a very lackluster sense of humor in action the joke gets pretty stale pretty quick sadly so much potential and it's it's just all kind of gone right into the garbage um this kind of reminds me of a lot of those really bad gimmicky hardcore and metalcore bands that came out of the 2000s like there were bands that were like we're a pirate core band and we make hardcore songs about pirates or you know we're a shark core band and we write hardcore songs about sharks pretty much the same thing just Ned Flanders this time I guess and not so much hard or metalcore but yeah that that really is to me the worst track of the week and and really the the only song that I really really did not like listening to this week much of everything else I thought was pretty decent or great there was a new recondite song that wasn't too bad maybe a little too Spacey to be exciting but really not that bad of a track the new XX song on hold wasn't really all that bad either I kind of liked how the vocals were a little bit more upbeat on that cut and how the instrumental uh wasn't really kind of trying to work that whole like strung out very like lifeless pop rock angle you know it seemed like they were doing some interesting electronic production on the track you know maybe Jamie xx is responsible for that not sure but the cool vocal samples and the instrumental there I thought made the xx a little more interesting a little more engaging than they typically are we have modern baseball with a song that maybe might be in vain at this point but it's actually one of the better tracks that had been launched out of that 40 songs over 30 days the the anti-trump songs I thought their track was actually pretty well written and had some great lyrical hooks and you know good good lead vocal melody as well it was a decent track you know uh I don't know again it might seem silly of trying to listen to the song now in light of sort of how the election went down but still a good track and good on modern baseball for dropping one of the classier songs in the mix we have nathan fake with degree lessness featuring per int which was a pretty cool experimental track charlie bliss with the song turd this band or this project has a bit more of like a 90s alternative rock indie rock throwback kind of vibe to it but the tune is so catchy and well written that I couldn't really deny it even though maybe the song is a little too informed with nostalgia for my taste and even the new Flaming Lips track was not that bad definitely not as underwhelming as the castle that they had dropped not too long go though I was hoping for a little bit more I don't know lively ever crescendo on this track still you know I guess the Flaming Lips are still kind of in the midst of this a phase where they are ultra kind of bright and blissful and somewhat droney and Spacey I guess that's just kind of their vibe right now and then there was just a League of really great and entertaining tracks that came out this week we have Clarence clarity with vapid feels are vapid Clarence coming through with another crazy off-the-wall dense insane and very textured piece of pop very futuristic very ahead of the curve Lowe's campesinos with I broke up in a maroon tear open pronouncing that correctly not usually a campesinos fan but this is one of the best Tunes they've ever recorded in my opinion not only is it raw and energetic but the tune is undeniably sharp just a nice piece of kind of punky pop rock for you guys definitely some good power pop give that a listen king gizzard dropped a track from one of their forthcoming records they're going to be dropping five albums in 2017 allegedly and each of these albums is going to be based around a certain concept or experiment this first album I believe is going to have something to do with microtonal tuning and this song is a foray into that um if I wasn't told I wouldn't have guessed that that was the case you know in a lot of ways this sounds like a song that could have made it onto the band's last album but nonetheless I still think it's a solid tune and a decent performance and some good grooves and some cool guitar lines on this thing as our face I'm not going to say too much about this track you know I've reviewed their past two records I liked them a lot and the reason I'm not going to say too much is because when I get back I pretty much going to be having my review for this coming around the corner so I don't want to spoil anything but I do like this track I will say that black lips drop a track in the wake of the election a titled deaf dumb and blind this song according to the band is um anarcho-punk inspired and I will say that a they sort of hold true to that usual black lips vibe while kind of making over references to bands like craft in this song so that was actually pretty interesting the band ovo zombie stomped not affiliated with a Drake or Canada or the Toronto Rapson in any way there's actually some weird experimental like a industrial stuff over here that I've not heard of this group before I heard about them through Stereogum and this is a pretty odd track that you should most definitely check out if you're into that type of music run the jewels with a song called 2100 featuring boots this to me is one of the better tracks to drop in the wake of the election even though the song was recorded well before the results of this election I think this track does a good job of kind of excuse me capsule a ting and and going head to head with the fact that this political season has really been ruled with contention hate fear really coming from both sides and I think run the jewels do a good job of kind of you know just like wrapping that all up and just kind of putting that into song it's not so much a partisan track it's not like hey you should vote this you should vote that as many of you already know a killer Mike was vehemently Pro Bernie Sanders and you know was really pissed off about the way the sort of DNC stole the primary away from him in a lot of ways and there was actually a pretty funny email where it was talked about how he didn't get the message and he sort of ended up turning that do a bit of a merge for himself which I found pretty funny and then I want to give a shout out to the band HM Ltd or Happy Meal limited as they were formerly known they're a really cool band that has a wild like old-school post-punk kind of goth rock sound to them like an 80s UK got sort of style and this song stained is wild it's her key it's jerky it's uh it's very fringe it's very eccentric and I'm liking what the band is doing on this track and I'm sort of looking forward to where they're going with this sound childish gambino me and your mama want to give a shout out to them give a shout out to them I was looking at something else so bit of a Freudian slip there I want to give a shout out to childish gambino as you may know I already said on Twitter that I thought this track was the shit and I'm really happy with what he did on this song this reminds me of like a Anderson Pak or one of the many artists over the past couple of years who have kind of been bringing this old-school soul sound back maybe in a way this will be Gambino's departure from rap on this record a little bit I don't know because on iTunes the whole album is like referenced as being R&B and soul if in fact that ends up happening it'll be pretty interesting I don't know I'm just I guess looking forward to seeing how this whole uh Gambino record plays out I think it's an exciting song you know the background vocals the buzzing bass or guitar whatever it is and Donald Glover singing voice on this thing are all really intense heavy really rough and are really raw you know they're a lot of great things going for this track it's not like an amazing single but it is the first track on the record and I think it does I mean I think I think it really makes the album's work cut out for itself because it's such a huge amazing presentation of emotion and music that really kind of has my mouth watering because I'm like damn what's going to happen next it's going to happen after this shit so I think it's a really good starter track I think it's a really good intro track and it's got me looking forward to what he's doing Hudson Mohawke is a pretty good song out called play and go which I believe is a part of an upcoming soundtrack that you guys can find out about if you click on the link about it down there and I want to give a shout out to nails and full of hell because they have a new split out that you guys should listen to if you're a fan of either band or just kind of more of an extreme music head and I also want to give a shout out to Marilyn Manson who has a new song and music video on the way which I believe is a Donald Trump inspired or anti Donald Trump whatever you want to say the song say 10 there is a preview out for right now the full music video the full song is not out right now but what he has pasted so far on the internet from it seems pretty interesting and that's going to be it guys again all of that stuff I talked about want to make sure I didn't miss anything yep yep yep yep yep all that stuff that I talked about is down there in the description and that has been this track roundup for this week guys okay you're the best again if you want to support this segment hit up that Amazon Associates link down there in the description anything you get on there if you live in the u.s. we get kicked back from it and I will be back in the u.s. at the end of this week okay um so you

so we got I got a lot of work cut out for myself once I get back so I'm ready all right I'll see you guys soon forever 
JN5QgkI0RpM,oh hi everyone don't think channa here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new marching Church record telling it like it is this is the second full-length album from a Danish supergroup of sorts marching church featuring members of our lower sects Jerome contour and choir of young believers some pretty active acts in the underground of the Danish rock world but because they're fronted by Elias bender Ronan felt of Ice Age Fame a lot of people consider them to be an Ice Age side-project though that is not entirely true I think it's even harder to categorize them as that on this latest project over here because I think marching Church is really sort of coming into its own on this one a little bit their last record this world is not enough I liked quite a few tracks on it though it was far from a perfect album stylistically it was kind of disjointed the songwriting was a little lackluster as well as a lot of the tracks sort of seemed to be feeding off of these somewhat improvised jams that the band had come up with they would hit upon an idea and then just sort of repeat it until it kind of fizzled out after a while though telling it like it is structurally is very much the same it feels a bit more focused the production's a little better the performances are a little better the writing seems to have a little bit more to it as well though you could still pretty much catch aliases very loose Nick Cave wild man swagger all over this record - it's still very much the same jazzy post-punk II experimental rock vibe but it just sounds like marching Church has their together a little bit more some of the tracks here fizzle out occasionally but I think the jams generally are a bit more compelling and feature a little more structure a couple more phases some more I don't know eventful moments I think the instrumental and the stylistic variety on this album has increased - like on the song heart of life which sort of has the country-ish twang that sort of made no roofs die off Ice Ages last record so good or the song 2016 which is very much deserving of its title as the track mostly consists of these very driving tents post-punk rhythms and guitars really just like get me going insane I love the very dreary piano rock on the song information the song has some incredibly weird and unsettling lyrical refrains as well and the song let it come down which opens the album up is this really dramatic dark folk music that is elevated with these chilling chorus vocals and some really beautiful string sections too I could list what each track here is doing each track has a different vibe a different sound and that's a good thing it definitely makes for a better flow on this album this time around especially since musically marching Church seems to pull off each style that they dabble in on this record pretty well and apply their very dark loose sort of experimental and and wild style to it even the very Spacey groovy low-key rock instrumental on Achilles heel which features these melodicas that have a I don't know kind of very dubby echoey effect on them and there are some surprises in the tracklist too like on the song lion's den I did not see the falsetto vocals on this track coming at all and hopefully they turn up on an ice age record soon too because they were pulled off pretty well here this record is animalistic it's passionate it's got an old soul to it but the body of this thing is fueled with new blood and it's spilling in every direction on this album the issue for me is that occasionally all of this raw and groovy piss and vinegar is really only being used to fuel some okay songs again the writing is not that incredible on this record and I think it partially has to do with the way the songwriting process in marching Church works they obviously want these tracks to be very linear very in the moment and another thing that I think works against this album is that some of the tracks sort of sound like Ice Age redos or ideas that could have been Ice Age songs but just sort of morphed into these improvisation 's instead the stuff that is outside of Ice Ages purview on this record again really only works because the performances are so good and they're so electrifying a lot of the time and that's I think mostly the the appeal of marching Church they play more with their hearts than they do their heads and even if I don't find a lot of what is on this record to be like stunningly written or incredibly memorable I do have to admit the album is on I do get pretty wrapped up in the emotional web the band has weaved on this one I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing church or church or transition and that is the video that is the review here I hope you have given this album a listen and let me know what you think of it down in the comments all sorts of links next to my head subscription videos and that's it guys I appreciate you watching hope you're doing well and I'll I'll see you again soon 
vfMP52k1Dv4,hey everyone so thin a dumb tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're gonna do a review here of the new kero kero bonito record the neato generation these guys are UK pop trio that have been dropping singles and they have a mixtape out they've been active for a few years now but they have somehow just flown under my radar which makes me sad but I guess now that I'm now hearing of them because of this new commercial full-length debut record that their music is just a nice pleasant surprise to me because I'm coming into this album with fresh ears having not even heard the teaser singles from it and for a pop record this thing is all over the map we have songs on here that feel like they pull influence from you know your average top 40 hit some club friendly trap music like tonight or some very bouncy UK bass in the vein of disclosure there's a huge j-pop influence on this thing especially considering the bilingual lyrics both English and Japanese on this record you know if you if you like yourself some really cute Japanese pop artists like Kyary Pamyu Pamyu I think you're gonna find something to love on this record also hip hop music and in the early releases of mi a whose music was really just hard-hitting but also had a lot of swagger and charisma was a little tongue-in-cheek and playful also video game music from the late 90s and early 2000s their instrumentals on this thing the sound like they could have worked as the Start screen to some kind of Japanese racing game with cute anime women and bathing suits and there's actually one track on this thing that samples sound from Mario Kart 64 V song graduation and and then there's tunes on this thing that remind me of like synthesizer laced tongue-in-cheek pop music from web series such as like food party or don't hug me i'm scared specifically it's song try me where sara is sort of listing off the things that she's very talented at whether it be dancing or planning a party with you or a business the song fishbowl even dabbles in like a little bit of fun sunny beach pop - there's a lot going on through all these tracks but it's all kind of fit under this umbrella of the trios very cute demeanor there of humor their sugary melodies they're kind of quirky synthesizers but probably the most important ingredient are these very charming lovable songs that they draw up like the song wake up which kicks the album off which is this playful punchy banger about waking up which kicks off with an alarm clock ringing it has a bustling beat with lots of bass some bright horn samples that hit throughout the chorus Sara's singing throughout the track about having things to do today not wanting to wake up hitting the snooze button it's like I've suddenly woken up on the set of some kind of like J pop hip-hop infused pee-wee's Playhouse the song heard a song is about hearing a song on the radio but only for a moment and you don't know who actually made the song and the melodies just stuck in your head and sort of driving you insane because you can't find out who the artist is and you're wondering if you even made it up and again this is another track that's like loaded with sound effects to kind of help tell the story that Sarah is singing about on the song as she sort of stops her car to hear the song and her tires screech on the road later she's asking her two other bandmates Gus and Jamie whether they've heard the song and they can't help her the song's graduation and hey parents are sort of these really endearing tributes to growing up and becoming an adult and moving on to I don't know this post college stage where you have to take care of yourself tracks like this are especially interesting because they kind of address directly how kero kero Benito straddles this border between adulthood and childhood there are obviously some adult themes and grown-up issues on this record but much of the album sort of sounds like a kid could have written her or a kid would enjoy it the song break is an incredibly adorable track about taking a break slowing things down taking it easy knowing when to just kind of pump the brakes a little bit and realize that you've had enough or you're doing a little too much there's a funny part in the song where Sarah's sort of calls or two other band members just say hey guys I'm not doing anything today and the chorus on here sort of has I don't know a bit of a nugget of wisdom on here singing about how it's really hard to relax when you have something to do pretty much every track comes through with a solid but quirky and colorful instrumental that's very kind of silly and off-the-wall a pretty focused song topic which is executed with just a deadly amount of cuteness like just imagine a pink Guzzi that shoots out unicorn sparkles rapid-fire song trampoline features this punchy house beat with loads of lyrics about being on a trampoline floating through the sky feeling alone but jumping with others as well doing twists and flips it's so enjoyably blissful so happy and so infectious and that's just kind of this album as a whole this is some real like good candy coated pop music like candy coated pop music you could actually like sink your teeth into I don't feel like tossing it away after I'm done listening to it in fact I just have to go back to it again and again and again and it brings some seriously good vibes to it's like very happy it's very upbeat and not in a way where it's sickening or just too much at least not for me anyway I will say maybe the album's Achilles heel is that there are a few tracks where the vocals are kind of faint and don't really sound that interesting and I will say that the trio style is slightly gimmicky it's not gonna appeal to everybody but I think kerokero Benito has a lot of great things going for them a lot of style a lot of Flair some good tunes I find their music to be very imaginative and I'm looking forward to whatever they do in the future after this thing I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this record transition and that is the video that is the review here I hope you have given this album a listen and let me know what you think of it down in the comments all sorts of links next to my head subscription videos and that's it guys I appreciate you watching I hope you're doing well and I'll I'll see you again soon 
c05iUg0Xj7Q,this tuflow album is not good tuflow is a Swedish pop singer whose new singles from this latest album over here I've been keeping track of I'm not completely sure why I was seeing her music posted everywhere and just got a little curious and thought okay what's everybody checking out what's everybody talking about what's everybody hyping up over here but cool girl influence true disaster in my opinion three of the blandest pop singles of the year so I wasn't really sure what was going to be so great about this album and now that it's out here it's it's really one of the most wash rinse repeat boring like nothing interesting nothing original nothing even memorable going on on a single track here and the things that do stick out as memorable are like funny for example on the title track here and I didn't think she would go in this direction I didn't think anybody would be um clueless enough to go in this direction but when I see the title lady would the part of my head that's in the gutter thinks somebody is saying like Lady boner you know like oh I'm a woman and I'm turned on so I have lady wood but I actually thought when I heard the song I was gonna hear some kind of metaphor for something or here lady would kind of turn in a different way but no that's literally what she means she is using the phrase lady wood in a sexy way over this EDM instrumental talking about this person who she's interested in giving her lady hood she's seriously singing about having lady wood I don't know if there's a less sexy way to reference sex s Nerf ever she and you know I'm not saying people should or shouldn't say a certain phrase you know I think saying a lady wood or lady boner completely fine if you're is just using in conversation and maybe you're trying to be a little funny or you're using ironically but like seriously trying to come through and like tell some guy who you're into like yeah you give me some real lady wood hahaha listen ladies I know men are sort of depicted as you know these fuck machines who just have sex on the mind all the time but you can weird a guy out and telling him you have lady wood is one of those ways The Wiz Kalifa feature on influence was cringy as hell especially the moment where he's talking about him and tuflow oh wow you guys are cool together the song vibes is like this acoustic cut that comes out of nowhere that is just as forgettable as every other song on here there's just nothing about this record this even faintly original it's just so plain it's just so a uninvent hrus and not only are the vocals on this thing just dime-a-dozen not only are the instrumentals on this thing dime-a-dozen but the lyrics are really something to behold i mean of course you can't expect that from somebody singing about their lady wood but take the song imaginary friend for example really the lyrics on this track stand out to me as being a really really worthy of a Nobel Prize probably 3040 years down the road Bob Dylan people said you're not a superstar can't jump that far you know better got my armor on the super glue can power through yeah whatever yeah whatever I concur imaginary friend stay with me till the end keeping me dreaming imaginary friend stay with me till the end now over over again uh this is on uh this is on Universal apparently you can walk right into Universal and they're just handing out record contracts they're just fucking giving them away they're actually like on a pedestal as you walk through the door and all you gotta do is sign the bottom and you're in Swedish pop has taken a nosedive since ABBA I'll say that much Sweden you guys have to have better than this I mean come on you know I can appreciate that like on a song such as cool girl she at least has a topic or a concept in mind that comes through clearly in the lyrics like she's not trying to put this label on this relationship that she has with this guy maybe is not to scare him away or just to kind of keep things fun and vibrant and you know spontaneous but still it doesn't change the fact that musically and vocally there's really nothing special about this record it's like you know a basic cable package it's like a slice of bread that was just so ever lightly toasted with no butter on it no nothing or you know like one of those knockoff handbags that you buy down in Chinatown you know it's not a something that you like for what it is you like it more for what it resembles it's just really odd because I haven't heard an artist in a while who has this hard tried to fade so seamlessly into the modern pop landscape that scanning the horizon you wouldn't even notice her because this album is just like literally another face in the crowd I'm not really sure if I have anything else to say about this album it's just so forgettable it's just so plain yeah it's a it's not good position and that is the video that is the review here I hope you have given this album a listen and let me know what you think of it down in the comments all sorts of links next to my head subscription videos and that's it guys I appreciate you watching hope you're doing well and I'll I'll see you again soon 
7X6qA1k3W7Q,hi everyone WikiLeaks here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Swain album the long dark blue Swain are a Netherlands punk band who I've been following since they were known by another name this routine is hell their last record howl was fantastic loved this album a really heavy punchy hardcore punk record are produced by the one and only / blue of converge Fame had these fantastic heavy riffs catchy hooks cutting biting satirical smart lyrics this LP really grew on me the more that I listened to it it was one of my favorites of the year so I was a little heartbroken when I came to learn that the band had changed their name and that this name change would come with a sound change a sound change that we got a taste of when the band had dropped this heavy dancing EP last year and I wasn't sure if I would continue to be a fan of the band's music because the connections that they were drawing between the hardcore they were known for and alternative rock and grunge music seemed kind of sketchy but the blend of these sounds is way more seamless and actually complimentary on this new album over here the band still pulls off primal punk rock really well and the way that it comes together with these moody depressing slacker rock ballads is great it almost makes too much sense because the depressing dismal vibe of these grunge songs has a sort of aggressive fed-up conclusion with the more Punk end of this record and it's just nice to hear a rock album with a range of emotions and and styles now as this routine is held the band had already proven that they could write a catchy hook that they could write memorable lyrics so now with this new album under the name Swain they are applying that talent to I think a more accessible style of rock which results in these grimy and sad and mad anthems that hopefully translate to a new and and maybe a larger audience and there are tons of highlights on this thing there's so many tracks that haven't pretty head over heels for the song kiss me hard which kicks off this very familiar descending chord progression which eventually develops into one of the best rock hooks I've heard this year when you gives me well you kiss me ah top with these wailing guitars the vocals are a mix of passion and rage and lust thus on half awake half asleep thematically seems to call back to the closing track I'm asleep from the band's album howl one of my favorite cuts off of that LP and a lot of the same lyrical ideas pop up about chasing your dreams but also kind of giving up on life hitting dead ends the lyrics seem tell this story about taking a scorched-earth approach to how you of your life it's almost like hitting the reset button on life which almost might be a metaphor or a story for how the band has kind of treated itself over this transition from this routine as hell to swing there's still elements of this routine has held that that hang with the band on this record whether it be in the drums or the kind of sludgy heavy bass lines and punk rock riffs or the sinister lead guitars and screamed vocals but specifically on the song half awake half asleep the harmonized male vocals on this track are not only entirely new but very catchy the song punk rock messed you up kid is almost an admission by the band itself talking about all these things that it sounds like other people might be telling them mesh them or made them dysfunctional human beings although the chorus tells a different story it's a story of a acceptance whether they're accepting these things messing them up and they're being okay with a life path they've chosen or they're just kind of brushing all of these claims off I'm not entirely sure and the song never clean my room is maybe my favorite track on the entire record amazing ballad and it's not this like bratty annoying like mom and dad it's actually a really soul-crushing song and a moment of clarity when you kind of realize how much of a failure of a human being you are and instead of cleaning your room or fixing your life the room is really just a metaphor the dirty room that is instead of fixing your life you just move somewhere else you just move to another room as the lyric state save yourself the trouble you can count on me to split I'll never clean my room I'll just move when I get sick of it rather than fixing what's wrong you're just kind of like yeah it's a painfully sad song and I think one of the few instances in the modern age where a Nirvana influence is channeled with an incredible amount of taste emotional power and in relevancy I feel like I'm just listening to a great song not some band just like being like hey we're gonna do a nineties thing guys the band pushes the boundaries of despondency on deeper cuts like it's hard to make friends which is a very sparse dissonant track consisting mostly of these very minimal guitars and and crushed vocals the song you're not special is almost as quiet but just as sad and the song hoping for it feels like the most hopeless song on the entire album the song is loaded with this pent-up anger about being stuck in a rut I mean just look at the lyrics here it's nothing but feeling like all of your efforts are adding up to nothing literally shit while the lyrics are pretty basic I think the performance on this track though which is pretty aggressive enhances those feelings of life's walls slowly closing in on you the band's rage continues on the song faze me which actually sounds like it could have fit pretty snugly into how the instrumental is basically this really heavy wild unruly punk rock and of course the lyrics are smart as hell and asked some really interesting questions about I don't know the dichotomy of many different things it's kind of like hey what's this one thing if you don't have this what's this other thing if you don't have that what's being an adult without childhood what's money if you're always bored what's a band if you're not impressed good question there and I love the hook on this thing it's just all about challenging yourself pushing yourself getting yourself to think and act in different ways just for experiences sake just to keep life spicy and the song secrets inside which features this kind of punchy funky drumbeat and these kind of shouted vocals that that aren't I don't know that they're almost talked they're almost wrapped in a way the slow buzzing guitar chords that are really kind of dreary remind me of like Pinkerton era Weezer there's a lot of angst on this track and insecurities having to do with one's physical appearance as well there's definitely a Rivers Cuomo vibe on this cut and I'm blown away by the lyrics on seeing a good man in a bad mood which features a series of colors that are supposed to correlate with a couple of different situations and moods on the track blue green gold a killer hook on this track ties it all together as well which is so good that the blatant Nirvana worship isn't even really a factor for me toward the end of the record the band hits me with this set of bars and the lyrics that I think sums up the anxiety the root of the anxiety of this record pretty nicely obsessed with time I consume regret I mostly sleep and remain beset by the truth its death like a cigarette slowly burning fading burning fading burning fading the band always seems the center around time running out life kind of slowly crumbling my mortality my existence ah now the closing cut on this thing was a sort of underwhelming moment for me musically its kind of middle-of-the-road and lackluster I will say that the lyrics though do seem to wrap things up pretty nicely I guess I was hoping for some kind of compositional climax on this thing but this track doesn't even really work as an anti-climax I guess the one compliment I can give the track is that the opener just busts in pretty seamlessly if you have this thing on a loop so it's definitely encouragement to listen to the album again which I want to do and maybe that has something to do with the endless cycle of feeling trapped self-destruction and reinvention that the band seems to be singing about in a way on this record I'm not sure I'm just spitballing here still though this is a pretty awesome rock record and I think one of the best rock records I have heard this year and the band has unquestionably topped how I think and blown away all of the trihard 90s revivalists who have been giving me a migraine over the past couple of years I'm feeling a strong atul eight nine on this album Treacher transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and feel free to hit the comments and say something nice about this swing album hope you guys are doing well all sorts of links next to my head subscribe

YBDMukNKBKg,hi everyone fouseytube here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand new worm rot album voices one of the most savage bands in grind are back with a new full-length album following up their 2011 record dirge which was about as critically acclaimed as a modern grind record gets I enjoyed it myself the hard-hitting riffs the incredible speed the brittle ear grating recording and some of the writing on this thing was pretty catchy for a grindcore record anyway so of course I've been looking forward to new material from these guys and also curious as to what has taken the band so long to drum up 26 minutes of new album music worm rock doesn't just bring new songs on this album they bring some new sounds too which is actually a good thing I mean I thought that their next record could use a little bit of a changeup and some of the best bands in grind have played with music outside of the grind Oh sphere showing versatility beyond the genre and worm ray is doing that too but in a way where they're not softening the impact of this album the band seems to work in more harmonious chord progressions into this record that seem like they're pulled straight out of the post-hardcore playbook or sometimes even the black metal playbook and of course the vocals and the drums they pair with this still had very much a grind vibe the blast beats the doubled-up bring very gruesome screams from the front to the back of this record and with melody and harmony playing a slightly larger role on voices it only makes worm rot catch here which again still feels like a pretty weird word to apply to a grindcore record but somehow in the case of worm rot it works even with most of the album feeling like a chaotic blur I think whether or not what we're wrought does sticks with you will depend on how much you're keeping up with worm rot because it really is a challenge to pay attention to and eat up every detail of the band flashes by your face on these songs like the really sinister chord progression that runs through most of hollow roots or the track oblivious mess which starts off with this really Spacey guitar intro really eases you in to what eventually ends up being this blast of guitars and drums that had this really bright tone to them reminds me kind of like that liturgy record Aesthetica the song shallow standards has a similar guitar tone on it too now eventually the band breaks these guitars down into this flurry of speed changes and riffs and drum beats nothing lasts for all that long they're constantly switching ideas in an out everything's just moving at a pace that makes my head spin and throughout the whole thing warm rod stays tight unbelievably tight and precise there's some good head banging mosh friendly riffs and the songs have fallen into disuse and fake morale machine at the end of the song forced siege there's a pretty cool breakdown where the band gets slower and slower and heavier and the cuts on this thing where the band makes a song that's like miraculously longer than two minutes are not that bad either the issue is despite where I'm not doing their best to incorporate some new sounds incorporate a little bit more melody and make a record that is a little more dynamic there's still a lot of tracks on this record that come off is just like meat and potatoes grind nothing really to write home about unfortunately you know they certainly do the genre justice they work the blueprint really well with some impressive skill and some production on this record that is noticeably improved worm rot is doing grind more of a service than some bands out there who use the genre just as an opportunity to show off their technical skill but there is a daunting predictability to a worm rot does on this album that makes it kind of hard to be enthusiastic about it for its full 26 minute length which feels almost too long in a way despite the fact that there are a lot of great grind and grind related albums that exceed that run time just this album specifically I don't think varies up its sound and its stylings quite enough to justify the amount of tracks and the amount of minutes it's a lot at itself maybe if the band boiled this thing down to its most essential and most memorable parts we'd be talking about another review here but but but as is it's still a pretty good grind record and I would most definitely recommend it to anybody who is into that style of music and are looking for a new album in the genre in 2016 that has some intense high-energy aggressive performances a good recording and a solid attempt at bringing some other sounds bringing some other ideas into the grindcore fold I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this warm rock record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just look at angry comment in the comments if you're pissed off all sorts of links next to my head other videos trypsin website and take a deep breath

rnxn1gLrYDk,hey everyone anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track round where I tell you guys what I feel musically made for the best tracks this past week the worst tracks this past week and everything in the middle if you want to support this segment hit up our amazon associates link down there in the description if you click on it and you live in the US anything you buy off Amazon we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price and that's it it's convenient it's easy just use it to buy some stuff you were gonna buy anyway cool cool alright let's get into these songs we're gonna kick it off at the worst tracks of the week coming up first here we have the band hey baby whoo I was recommended by a few periodicals a few music periodicals online publications this past week and this song is like pretty much everything bad about 90s revivalism right now just not good writing on this track not a very good performance either the music video is absolutely cringe-worthy and the vocals are pretty obnoxious as well it's it's like just a very cursory understanding of what made so many 90s acts like Nirvana and whole for example so good just it's it's kind of like they're playing a really bad version of cover band on on this track but instead of covering a specific group there they're just kind of blandly covering just kind of a blanket 90s rock statement it's a pretty excruciating but not more excruciating than the new future track which features Drake the song used to this which is just such a disgustingly effortless cut on both of their parts that it's um I don't know really leaked really reached a new level of disappointing in my opinion it's like Drake and future know that as long as they're on the same track together they really don't have to do anything they can just like lazily coast on by and just give us the most phoned-in track imaginable and people just be like hey it's a Drake a future track hey so you know just toss that mess in the trash and finally Leonard Dunham with a sensual pantsuit anthem this is garbage it's a pro Hillary rap song where if you can stomach it miss dunham dances around in a bikini and for whatever reason Charlemagne the gods signed on to this hopefully he got a big fat check not only is this not funny not only is it badly reasoned not only it is in bad taste not only will it probably hurt Hillary's chances of winning more than it will help not only is it cringy but it's um I don't know that's really all there is to it it's that's all the things that there is to say about I could really go on forever listing things that are horrible about this track whether it be her voice her rapping her lyrics which she's not a very good writer I don't know why people give her any credit as a writer like oh she's this great new writer in that in television and in the industry yeah these lyrics are trash um I think this if this is proof of anything it's proof that if Trump wins the musical landscape for the next four years will be garbage because songs like this are going to get a pass every month because everybody in their mom is going to want to step up to bat to drop an anti-trump song because hating Trump is is popular and it doesn't really matter the quality of the song the quality of the person in this case a dumpster fire who is sort of at the forefront of the song none of that really matters as long as it's an anti-trump song that's all it's going to matter also the new latigo song is is certainly an example of that as well so having said this maybe consider just voting Hillary for the sake of music for the future of music because even if we go through economic hell and you know it's it's just politics as usual at least we're not going to get more sensual pantsuit anthems and I don't know how many more of these I can withstand without wanting to kill myself I mean recently a Miss Dunham had put out a track or put out this short little video or retweeted a video on her Twitter account about the extinction of white men and yeah maybe this is how she's going to do it she's going to continually put out tracks like this until people like myself just drink bleach until we just pass out and are just no longer with the living because with another sensual pantsuit anthem coming out every month potentially if Trump wins office it's just not going to be worth it to live I don't I don't know if our country kena is is strong enough to to withstand another blow like this song because the song does fucking blow worst track of the week with that without a doubt obviously moving on from there the songs that I was just kind of indifferent toward but are definitely worth your time worth checking out sting has a new track out titled petrol head which I don't think there are many sting fans in my audience so you should most definitely listen to the goddamn police if you haven't already I mean their first several records are great and this new song over here isn't too bad either i mean stings voice sounds great on the cut he's passionate he's fiery the guitars and the bass on this thing are really driving their really peppy they're really energetic it's not one of these songs that you typically expect from a rocker of stings a jazz being like super laid back and not really that memorable this is like a very tense track you know has a seriously a kinetic energy to it that I like a lot Neil Young has a track out called peace trail which is kind of a very stone lazy laid-back folk rock tune which is just sort of okay it's pretty forgettable but are his background vocals or do they have some auto-tune on them on this track I couldn't quite tell they sounded weird that definitely stuck out to me sort of soured the track for me in all honesty moving on from there Kevin abstract with the song yellow which the other song I put out this past week I did like a lot more but this track to me kind of felt like a very sunny almost indie pop influence cut like almost as if he was listening to a little bit of Passion Pit didn't really care for it too much but certainly a new avenue for him and a pretty cool attempt at doing something sort of sugary and sweet but of course you know the lyrics don't necessarily match the musical flavor of the track of course and then we have gucci mane with floor seats featuring quavo which is pretty forgettable gucci mane has another project on the way it's like third project since he's come out of prison and for sure it's going to be just as bland as like October we have common with pyramids the new common record I'm looking forward to our viewing that even though this track didn't seem to me to be one of his most memorable it's certainly you know got a great beat too it has some decent bars on it and a good vocal performance as well alright moving on to the best tracks of the week we are flying through this list who we have opened mike eagle who recently dis contributed a song to that forty songs in 30 days anti-trump songs and i'm not really sure what this song has to do with trump other than that his face is sort of pasted on the the YouTube video for it I mean I guess you could relate it to you know how he sort of uh I don't know handles his exes and handles his relationships sort of like in the way Mike eagle is implying with the title and its inclusion in this list but you could totally subtract the song outside of the context of this Trump compilation and its really its own song and it's a really hilarious track again about how to be super Petty to your ex and the way that Mike eagle goes through all the ways that you can be petty toward your ex are actually pretty clever pretty hilarious it's track I actually wish think I actually wish could have made out of dark comedy it just seems so fitting Fox Arjun with Follow the Leader Fox ijen these two new tracks are so amazing I'm so glad that they're back I'm so glad they're that they're coming back into the fold and some great production some great backing instrumentation and some good songs that are actually memorable and well-written the music video on this thing is a little silly but I love the horn sections on this track I love the sort of old soul of the lead vocals on this cut these guys really embody just like what was so great about the stones and and the kinks but like I don't in a way that's tasteful and it's a way the in in a way that's actually exciting to me so on I don't I just I can't wait to hear this new record from them just super psyched Bruno Mars with Versace on the floor I will just say in a nutshell this song sounds like good sex in the 80s huge Michael Jackson influence on this cut and I don't know it's it's got a bit of a synth era sort of a cent funk era like R&B flavor to it it's cool it's a slow jam it's easy on the ears it's passionate we just need to get Bruno Mars to stop wearing that hat that a sort of white 24 in Roman numerals hat because it's it's ugly as hell and it looks like a make America great again cap but it just has 24 on it like we'll just just get rid of it moving on from there Chemical Brothers have new solid track out titled chemical which has a great beat to it very driving though it does sound a little dated I think it's good single and moving on from there the other song that Kevin abstract dropped this past week the track miserable America which is actually really funky really groovy kind of low-key and has a great bass line to it and this track is actually really telling in terms of like his sexuality his relationships is sort of a emotional status when it comes to his boyfriend I don't know if he had a particular boyfriend in mind or if this is just kind of a a general feeling that he has about a story in his head that he's made up I'm not entirely sure but it's actually a pretty compelling track and I think one of the most personal and telling and I don't almost like diary like tracks that I've ever heard from Kevin abstract it's going to be interesting to sort of see him on his a new record if he drops more stuff like this on that album because if so it's a could shape up to be a one of the more exciting albums of I don't know this year or next year I'm not exactly sure when he's dropping it please put something on the screen if there is a date or some kind of a ballpark timeframe as to when that album is going to drop appreciate it alright a couple more left miraculously miraculously Big Sean has dropped two tracks this past week that I thought were good the song bounced back and no more interviews the song no more interviews I thought was a pretty smart and interesting track a Big Sean kind of responding to the whole Kid Cudi drama I'm not exactly sure how he was implicated in that did Cuddy mention him if he did I forget I'm sorry but even if he didn't it sort of seemed like a really smart response to the whole thing because a lot of what he's saying sort of came down to look dude the business is hectic we're all busy we're all doing our own thing if you felt some kind of way or like hey you know these guys don't care about any more you could have called me you could have contacted me you didn't really to take it to Twitter and be all dramatic Big Sean sort of you know plays like the really smart let's cool things down kind of dude and sort of gives his own perspective like you know I'm sort of doing my own thing I'm not like trying to take anything away from you you know and if I could do anything for you just let me know seemed like kind of a smarter response than what Drake had brought to the table and everybody sort of jumped down his throat for kind of making fun of Cuddy while he was in rehab in sort of that disc that he had dropped from some of those cuts that are going to be on his latest record but uh yeah I'm really like in that track I thought Big Sean's rapping was impassioned and actually like really engaging on that cut and he actually likes strung together a really solid narrative and point on the track and then with the track bounce back this song all about him taking an L but like coming back and he really actually fucking does it on the song because this is one of the better tracks I think he's ever dropped solid versus solid flows really great hook on this cut and it's also low-key and just like chill and laid-back but it's got kind of like a a mean vibe to it like it's really tough um I love what he's doing on this on this cut and I'm not I can't quite put a finger on what I think has changed but I mean these two new songs over here it's it's got me like kind of curious like what what's picture I'm gonna do next because up until this point I haven't really enjoyed much of anything that he's done and these two tracks have really wrought have really wowed me I came into these songs thinking okay these will be on the worst tracks list right you know I need to put some more tracks in the worst track section these will be in the worst drag section and then I gave my listen I was like fun foot foot let blew the fluid this is good so I don't know man the the 2016 just will not let up 2016 is full of fucking surprises you know pretty soon just like anvils will start falling from the fucking sky I'm pretty sure and that we're going to end it off with the new Metallica track Atlas rise which is I don't know just like the last Metallica song that it come out from their latest record recently it just kind of sounds like Metallica doing Metallica in a very solid way they're just returning to form a little bit and they're put now to a good tune it's not anything altogether new but it's actually kind of enjoyable and I loved the music video on this track it's like you're watching a bunch of chilled dad's like shoot the shit for a day at Guitar Center or something and you're just like all these clips of James Hetfield like you know just like working on a guitar riff sitting on a stool and you know of course like Lars Ulrich is like at the pep at the drums fucking up and he's like got headphones on and a headband over the headphones looking like a total dork but I like the way that Metallica is just coming off like I don't know so like I guess regular and human on this cut not really a light we often see Metallica in but I guess it sort of works in this context but yeah I don't really think it adds too much to the song though you know because the song is a pretty like badass tune and doesn't exactly you know it's it's not about what they're doing in the studio right there but still I think it's I think it's a cool little video I think it's a cool song and it's got me looking forward to the new record and I think that's it guys those are all the songs that I wanted a reference to you guys those are all the songs that I want you guys to check out all the best tracks the tracks that I thought were just okay the worst tracks spare yourself don't listen to that Leonard Dunham song just just do yourself a favor and we're going to leave it at that again hit that Amazon Associates link if you want to support the segment it's down there in the description along with all of these songs they are all linked in referenced down there too okay you guys are the best forever 
4fAp8r5y3Fo,hey everybody Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the most arduous segment on this YouTube channel the why you know review although in this episode is going to be a little less arduous actually not not very arduous at all I feel like I'm cheating the system on my Twitter account at the needle drop I've been dropping over the past month or so a series of very short videos that are pretty much my views on a myriad of different albums and EPS and mixtapes and songs and I thought since people are really enjoying these videos on Twitter and many of them have gotten quite a bit of action quite a bit of attention that I could just kind of come together with a compilation of these videos since many of the tracks and albums that I was reviewing I was going to probably talk about in the next y-you know review anyway people enjoyed them over there I see no reason why people wouldn't enjoy them here and pretty much everything I'm saying in these short videos is what I would say in this video had I just kind of repeated myself over again so without further ado let's get into the collection of a little vids ba-bam could someone go to jail for this Pixies album I mean I know technically nothing illegal happen but it's serious injustice has occurred that has to be enough Hey this is their best album no no actually it's their worst but on this Kings of Leon three two one why does their track on this thing where it sounds like you're ripping up an honest-to-god rip it off Interpol I know you don't just rap and I don't mind when you say but tell me why this track sounds like a boring hotline bling' hi and welcome to the music news we're gonna give you all the meats for the music top story at 11 actionable combi noises ah ah ah that's actually not that bad later in the hour a new study shows that the casualties never had a good record you mean to tell me we have a death metal animal that blends in elements of punk and has heavy production and awesome riffs there's no joke here there's literally no joke this is just an entertaining album yes yes by Jove I think I've got it this Plus this Plus this Plus this minus that equals this the equation the formula ah you could like this album or you can hate this album regardless I think this is the most ambitious and maybe the best thing the band is dropped in this style thus far however do we have to call this thing progressive rock I mean copying bands forty years ago literally not progressive good evening everyone and thank you for watching the music news where we give you all the music with the news a new taste test shows that the new Joe Joe album has none taste taste like nothing bored laughs I don't want me to say about this one I've said everything I think I think I need to say with the last review this is this record over here not any better well he's already on his second post prison project wanna do ver quality it's the gucci mane way this is their worst album no it's their best album of a but but seriously of would what happened with this one like six years later and we're getting a bunch of bland forgettable synth pop and half-hearted new order worship I'm good I mean it's okay you could use something though that's what I needed a distraction yeah do you like ambient music do you like sleeping do you like open spaces do you d like feeling lonely do you like drones do you like streaming music do you like Brian Eno do you like band camp hey yo yo what up my dude listen this new Eminem song over here I swear I swear on my new Tim's this new Eminem song has got applause bars bigoted bars but Bob barbers I told you what I tell you think of something nice to say think of something nice to say think of something nice to say or the TDE fanboys will unsubscribe well it's not the most formless pile of junk I've heard this year the complete lack of coherent songs and totally directionless everything is most likely a metaphor for the fuckit I've never really been a big Phantogram fan but I think they came through with their biggest darkest and most epic record yet with this one the production is gigantic on this thing it's rich and the vocal performances feel more impassioned than usual - it's definitely not so so in detoxing out of the bands and dropping on their previous records I think it's on another level even though it may disappoint some of the fans of the more pop centric material a that was a real review we use some rare reviews on here we do some real reviews that are short for real so I was pretty hesitant going into this record I I wasn't looking forward to listening to this record but when I actually heard the thing I guess thought I was actually gonna listen to this are you kidding me come on so yeah so much more potential actually came out of it is that if you work at records it up but just stop pushing the envelope together I think the vocals and songwriting on this thing leave a little to be desired but this is still one of the more admirable chamber pop releases of the year if you love your music sounding lovely and lavish and pretty and gentle then give this thing a shot don't want to slip by it do you like your albums to sound like an action sci-fi thriller cyberpunk movie soundtrack from the 80s have I got the album for you there's some good lines on this thing some great flows or performances the beat is okay I'm not gonna say they're outdoing themselves on this track I don't think they are but you can run the jewels on an okay days better than in your favor at today the singles not bad some of the bars are decent drake comes through some good one-liners the beat is laid-back it's trapped flavored 21 savages performance on this cut is actually more lively than he usually is even though it sort of sound like drake is kind of ripping off his style on this track overall yeah I wish we heard more of this Drake on views but um this slide really really [Music] it's okay it's okay it's alright you will hate this EP you'll hate it but if we judge it by the quality standards typical of SLAM death metal and porno grind it's pretty decent now ladies and gentlemen you're gonna want to see this our top seller this hour the brand-new Maybach Music Group priorities 5 mixtape this is a handcrafted artisan mix tape featuring artists like Rick Ross make Mill wale and the revolutionary thing about this mixtape is it places all of these songs into one condensed folder making it very easy when you're done listening you places straight can you do recycle games if you've enjoyed anything these guys have done in the past you're gonna want to check out this new EP over here even if there's nothing like a revolutionary about it nothing altogether new I think TCR total control racing is a fitting title for this thing because it is kind of like sleeper mods have set themselves on a track and they're speeding through it as fast as possible you know you have the loop beats on this thing you have the dense aggressive spoken word on this thing there a few standout tracks on this unit on this EP that are too bad sleeper mods continuing to do what they do well and there's really no reason to complain about that hell yeah this is a good riff raff project this is exactly the kind of tape the kind of project I want to hear from Rick Rath it's not gussied up it's not over produced songs are all kind of wild and out of control shirts a little dirty it's a little unmastered there are a few terrible country songs here and there but he's not overly worried about what he's saying and as a result his bars are really funny strong tons of jokes out there and sometimes the point or the punch line he's trying to make makes no fucking sense at all which is funny in a different kind of way this is a good tape good tape Anthony Fantino is a cut boy a 30 year old me is avoiding this band like the play but 15 year old me is seeing them on the second stage Ozzfest and singing all of the words and taking you out in the pit bitch I really wanna like this album really wanna like this album really wanna like this album but it has a swathe oh the lyrics are so thoughtful a lot of the time they're really moving you can tell the Kate Tempest comes at hip-hop from the angle of a spoken word artist a pure poet but the production on this thing is so colorless nowhere near as vibrant as it was on her last record it sounds like it was recorded on a potato I think her work is more enthralling and more interesting from a lyrical angle I just didn't really get the instrumental on this LP hopefully she hits both nails on the head with your next project but you know if you're looking for some very intriguing and uh progressive and a very cerebral hip-hop music then look no further than this record give it a shot okay if you're looking for some left-field go for something interesting it is on Lex record so you know they have quite a reputation when it comes to you know good underground hip-hop so if all those things kind of pique your interest give this thing a listen whoa it's like the 60s all over again but somehow I bless let less interesting this time around it's nothing all that new or refreshing or interesting but you could brace up to it you bitch I'm not trying to ruin this album for anybody because there are some decent tunes on here but the way that Leonard Cohen's deep bassy rasp penetrates my ear canals this album is basically a an acappella away from just being ASMR hey guys it's filler the mixtape I feel like I'm eating a bowl of Sour Patch Kids doused in corn syrup this mixtape is just too much of one single thing it's too much booming trap beats it's too much of Meek Mill yelling in your face it's too much of uninteresting features that don't really bring too much to the table there's like not even a standout single from this thing it's just too much soul list rap too much emotionless like we didn't even really plan this out too far track I'm not even really a fan of these guys and even I could admit this is the best thing they've done in years like almost flashy boy this is a pretty upbeat for a Shen song like the instrumentation is really peppy and I like the way that the piano kind of emphasizes the upbeat of the track and the weird thing is is that it's not even putting news this new EP from Tony Malina isn't bad it's still the kind of short song format that you might remember from his last record distant dismissed which I liked a lot but this is not sort of the low five Punk woe is me breakup album that that album was this has no electric guitars on it from what I can hear aside from the last track it's very acoustic lots of pianos on this thing he's sort of wearing those I don't know sixties pop and folk influences on his sleeve that there were subtle notes of on that record it's kind of like he's just stripping things back a little bit and saying hey you know I can make a dynamic record that's not this whole low five thing I think he succeeded at it but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to somebody who is brand-new to Tony because I think these songs don't necessarily make all that much sense in the very short song format that he does on this particular EP because the tracks don't really seem to reinforce one another in the way that they did on dissed and dismissed also what I think is kind of funny is that this is an EP and it's about ten minutes long meanwhile dissing dismissed is the album and that's like 11 minutes long also there's a two minute and thirty second track on this thing Tony don't go progressive rock on ass dude don't go progressive rock I await the sweet release of death and that has been the y-you know review everybody

IPpyyq6RCXs,drive the knee durango here the internet's busiest music nerd and now that october has come and gone it's time to get into what have been my musical highlights of that month albums that i am recommending to you great albums of october hopefully none of these records slip through the cracks for you but if they did do give them the time do check them out they are all linked down there in the description box links to songs that you can listen to links to reviews from these records and that's it guys let's get into the lists here first i want to give a shout out to the new Conor Oberst album ruminations this is one of the best records this singer-songwriter has dropped in a while including bright eyes albums in my opinion on this record he really strips it back instrumentally to guitar harmonica piano vocals it's very funky it's very rootsy and the lyrics to these songs are painful and autobiographical and they are cutting apparently Connor had just come away from a pretty serious diagnosis of a cyst in his brain shortly before recording this record and some of what is on this year some of the material is inspired by that but even the stuff that isn't inspired by that is actually pretty incredible like the song you all loved him once which is a track all about celebrity putting people up on a pedestal but then eventually the public distrusting these people tearing them down ripping them apart not only is this album about Connors personal life but there are a lot of tracks on here reflecting on Fame as well so it's it's a pretty interesting moment in Connors career not only because of the musical change of pace but also because it's kind of given him this opportunity to retrospectively look back on the past 10 or 15 years that he's been in the limelight making music and you know really kind of put that into a new perspective we have the band crying with the record beyond the fleeting gales this is one of the most versatile insane off-the-wall catchy melodic and fun rock records I have heard this year these guys are showing an incredible amount of promise on their debut album over here there are so many different styles of rock and pop flowing throughout this thing whether it be progressive rock or like a little bit of ball and influence here and there indie rock it's kind of lo-fi and noisy as well I mean it's set it sort of sounds like deer hoof to me at points and also kind of sounds like a Japanese pop or Japanese rock to me at points there are so many things flowing throughout this record it's hard to keep track of it all but the band's guitar work the band's lead vocalist of the Bands production style all kind of keeps it pulled together in this nice tight little bow so nothing feels to outside of the purview of the band it really is their aesthetic that I think makes this whole record come together despite it being so varied the songs are all pretty straightforward into the point and short but they are densely packed with amazing guitar melodies and intricate drum fills and some syncopated guitars and drums the band is constantly changing and introducing new ideas but their vocalist who is usually very calm and breezy and easygoing kind of brings a bit of a twee vibe to the album she kind of brings this smoothness to the instrumentals that I think is very very necessary because if she was just as hectic and as crazy as everything else in the instrumental then it would just really be a trip to listen to their pop accessibility wouldn't quite be there so I'm enjoying this record a lot I hope you give it a shot I do think it's one of the better catchy or more fun rock records of the year then I have to give a shout-out to the new Jeff Rosen stock album worried this is a semi conceptual new pop punk album from mr. Jeff Rossen stock of Baum the music industry Fame these whole second half of it features these very short songs that all segue into one another and feature a myriad of opinions from Jeff on the economy and poverty and the socio-political climate in America today the first half of the record features mostly these standalone tracks that are well written too they feature Jeff's usual yell P vocals his sharp cutting self-deprecating lyrics that are pretty smart pretty funny another fun rock record from you this year but the the lyrics bring a very dark tone a lot of the time so don't let it depress here nothing another record that I like this past month that also took a political angle on things was Solange's new record a seat at the table not that it's apparent from the surface level of the music either it's a very kind of breezy soft jazzy neo soul record that's very melodic it's very sweet on the ears it's very pleasant but when you actually dive into a salon Drew's singing on this record you can tell she's very concerned with issues like police brutality in America and identity politics and whether you agree or disagree it's very well-put-together album musically and lyrically I think it could have been sonically bolder a little less faint but I still enjoyed it quite a bit and finally the new Regina Spektor album remember us to life a really great piano pop piano rock record over here are some elements of chamber pot mix in there as well huge ladder string sections all over this record Regina's performances of course are fantastic as usual her lyrics are poetic and telling some sharp satire on some of these tracks too of course there are a lot of love songs moments like the visit that are absolutely heartwarming feel like a warm embrace I think this is one of her best records in years unfortunately some people have been kind of on the fence with it I sort of understand why it doesn't feel that much different than her past couple of Records which have just nearly been okay but I swear to you the songwriting is better the performances are great it really kind of feels like for whatever reason she's really been invigorated and she has come out with a stunner on this one I think it's a stunner I think there's a not dud in the tracklist even the bonus tracks on this thing are fire so if you can get a hold of the deluxe version please do the Tori Amos fans the Fiona Apple fans no excuse gotta give this thing a shot and that's it guys I hope you are doing well and I hope you have a good night's sleep tonight no really give all these albums a shot hope you get some good recommendations out of all of them and you're the best transition you should give these albums a listen and you should love them or you should hate them and tell me what you agree them you're the best you're the best what should i Hervieux next hit like if you like and please subscribe because there are all sorts of links next to my head other videos subscription and website so you know hit hit one of those and hit hit hit yourself a nice veggie smoothie or something forever 
-1xtW1YAfUo,it's so itchy leg tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ASAP mob mixtape the cozy tapes vol 1 friends new york's ASAP mob they're back with a new collection of tracks also one that implies with its title that there's another volume of cozy tapes on the way at some point this mixtape is making the rounds it's pretty hype and get a lot of requests for it but still i didn't really know what to think going into this one while I really did like one of the teaser tracks from this thing the ASAP Rocky Tyla creator playboy cardi young gleesh Posse cut telephone calls at the end of the tape a song that I thought was kind of messy not really all that solidly put together but still it was kind of like this slugfest of a track and really energetic and raw and exciting but still I can't base my expectations of this whole thing off of that one single track because the talent gap between the most popular and the least popular members of the ASAP mob is pretty large and given that this is a collective tape I have to expect that we're going to hear some mediocre performances from some of the more mediocre members of the group also rocky and Ferg's latest records were their worst yet and if rocky inferred are the best of what a set mod has to offer and they're putting out incredibly mediocre music what hopes does this tape have of being great also the last ASAP mob tape was awful and all the non-album singles that built us up to this point like hella hoes and escape and traumatic have all been long forgotten at this point they had really no shelf life or staying power at all now I am happy to say there's nothing shockingly horrible about the music on this tape there are a few tracks on here that I thought were a little bland because the production was super cloudy and Atmospheric and the vibe was really kind of comatose and drugged out like way high put that on my set and the song Batchelor to a song where little yadi actually drops one of his least appropriate features I've ever heard on any project ever he just really doesn't fit into the vibe of the song at all with his goofy voice and those sort of vocal it's on it which usually I enjoy it's just got to be the right context is all sort of like a sprite commercial that context perfect context but the rest of this tape is pretty raw and energetic Bangor instrumentals these lightning in a bottle performances one verse after another sometimes you're getting a hook sometimes not so much ASAP mob do sound cozy on this tape they are casual on this tape they are just sauntering into these instrumentals doing whatever they want and just letting the chips fall where they may it doesn't sound over written or over planned or anything like that it just sounds like Bam Bam Bam this is what we're doing BAM we're not really thinking too hard about it some artists can do that and come out with an amazing project because they just have so much raw talent there they're using it in every direction the new Anderson PAC and knowledge record is certainly an example of that very good album sounded super off-the-cuff but still came through with great performances and some decent songs not as much the case with the ASAP mob though while a bulk of what is on this tape is very listenable there's just very little on this project that comes across as memorable or special really essential even the highlights on this thing I'm not really dying to go back to like the song nasties world featuring ASAP nast and onyx together they bring quite a bit of chemistry though the song does sound pretty dated it's just like a hollow shell of what was so good about the 90s crazy brazii has a pretty catchy hook and the verses all kind of crash into one another like a violent traffic jam yeah it's messy but kind of exciting like telephone calls of course I still enjoy telephone calls within the context of the tape it's a pretty exciting closure because it is the most hyped track on the entire project and while it was kind of cool to hear rocky and Skepta on the same track why was skeptic on the song Londontown wouldn't have that just made sense while there are moments on this thing that I think are pretty decent I feel like I'm just kind of eating around the things that I don't like just to get to what I do like on this tape because of bulk of the verses on this thing and a bulk of the instrumentals really just kind of breeze by without doing anything all that attention-grabbing it's certainly an improvement on the last ASAP mob tape but the most hype thing about this project was the feature list and while I did go into this with high hopes thinking wow there could be some cool collaborations on this thing the music that was actually delivered is pretty run-of-the-mill maybe if this had been Lords never worried we would have been talking you know a different opinion here there would have been more cause for celebration because it would have been a more solid debut project at that point I think this project would have sounded a little more fresh and that's another thing ASAP mob no longer comes across like the cutting edge crew that they were when they originally broke out sadly I think they've done very little with their spotlight in the collective sense there's just really nothing to write home about with this tape I wish I had more nice things to say but I'm having a hard time finding things to be excited about with cozy tapes you know I guess you can be cozy with it you can just kind of lay down chill out and it's on it's it's okay you know it's not going to make you jump out of bed and make you say wow that's terrible even wow that was a bar you're just going to kind of lay there and just be sort of cozy I'm feeling a light a decent 5 on this thing transition have you given this mixtape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

sKTSgxz-aKg,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Korn album the serenity of suffering corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn what can be said now about the California new metal industrial metal alternative metal outfit that has not been said already especially after embarrassingly bad releases like the Skrillex collaboration on the path of totality or see you on the other side and what even is corn 3 was there a trilogy going on that I just like was wasn't aware of this whole time my feelings on the band have ranged from utter disgust to complete fandom back in the day when I was really into the band in high school but then slowly over time becoming more disillusioned with new metal and the band's increasingly mediocre discography but even though I still really can't listen to a lot of corns early discography without wondering what the hell I was thinking I tried my best at giving this album a listen and coming at it with a semi objective opinion I think I can say without having to second-guess myself in any significant way down the road that the serenity of suffering is one of corns better records one of their best records in a while it doesn't seem completely out of touch with what made the band popular in the first place like a lot of their to thousands output was instrumentally corn brings plenty of crunchy slap bass lines on here booming heavy distorted guitar chords that of course some of them are are complemented with these eerie little three to six note guitar melodies that hang in the atmosphere the verses and sound really creepy corn has been recycling these and on every single album since like follow the leader Jonathan Davis's growls are still pretty monstrous of course he he does his little you know new metal scatting that you have probably heard on many a corn album thus far I'm sure there are a few risks the band takes that I think go a little awry like when a dance beat kind of pops up in the background or one moment where Jonathan Davis was like harmonizing a little bit with his voice and was not sounding good but outside of that I think this has been one of corns most solid releases since issues it's not like a high point in their discography or anything but it's certainly more tolerable than a bulk of what has been dropped by the band in the past 10 years and maybe this record is even a conscious effort to do that given the cover art over here which I still not have made complete heads or tails of I mean what is this is that the issues doll in this kid's hand and is it dead is that why I see its ribcage is it a ghost is that why there's an ominous glow around it and why is this ominous glow surrounding the person holding the doll as well is that person bed is this the ghost of a corn fan is this a symbol for corns once thriving fanbase that is now to win dueling with every new album that disappoints again and again and again and again on this album I'm imagining corn going on the Scooby Doo style adventure through an abandoned carnival with a weird giraffe riding a rhino on the merry-go-round and they're using their best album in years to resurrect their dead fan base only for the whole adventure to end with this kid and a blue hoodie like waving goodbye to them like oh I think corn has a decent set of songs on their hands here but I can't ignore the fact that in a lot of ways I think I've grown out of what the band is providing sonically musically lyrically and pretty much every track on here has a little something that makes me just scream internally like the record scratching on intro track insane you know of course you're getting that over those huge booming all metal riffs record scratching also turns up on the song next in line but that track has some really odd verses with these skipping snare drums and these very quickly strung guitars that make kind of a droning sound it's maybe one of the most experimental things I've big corn is done on a track but it didn't exactly turn out all that well I don't think then we have Corey Taylor of Slipknot doing a guest vocal on the song a different world one moment his voice even reminds me of David dreamy and I've disturbed for some reason and it's it's really again not a high point for me the song take me is weirdly funky for some reason the the the beat in the background like with the hi-hat playing off the bass drum it's I don't know I just don't want to hear corn sound and too funky the weird robot vocal effects on everything falls apart are not really that aesthetically pleasing either and the refrain at the very end of the the track there is nothing in my heart there is nothing in my head there is nothing in my head there is nothing yeah I wanted to skip that part pretty bad and the angsty tortured guitar and vocal intro so bear so skeletal on the intro of the song the hating there are a lot of tasteless ideas on this thing but - corns credit this is probably how the world sounds to somebody who's crazy or has like I don't know some severely damaged emotions that they just can't seem to work out you may not personally identify with the band's downward spiral of pain and sadness that they display on pretty much every record but I think on this one they do a pretty effective job of conveying it and I was able to find a couple of songs on this thing that I thought were acceptable you know a nothing I really loved from front to back nothing I was crazy head over heels for but it's pretty far from the worst thing that they've ever dropped and at this point maybe that's all we can really hope for I'm feeling a strong for to a like 5 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best watch a tire of you next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just

nFcjQdL27lo,hi everyone Noah the new plan Hannah oh you're the internet's busiest music nerd and in this video I'm going to in a very rambly way be talking about this project over here 30 days 30 songs calm and just kind of give a bit of an overview and a general opinion on political music on the whole just to give a baseline here typically politically-charged music socially aware music I really enjoy some of my favourite artists take that angle in their music you know Kendrick Lamar with to pimp a butterfly going back to artists like Public Enemy or Phil Ochs and Bob Dylan or even like Rage Against the Machine there's a lot of examples and my discography Dead Kennedys of bands who I'm just head over heels for who makes satire in their music make political statements in their music that critique the world at large critique our political system in the West so I was pretty intrigued when I came across this project over here which is 30 days and 30 songs of anti-trump songs that were either written about Trump or recorded sort of for this collection of tracks this series has gained so much popularity I guess that it has been up from 30 to 40 songs now now now now we have 40 songs from a myriad of different artists here's the full list whoa well or at least the list of people thus far whoa whoa that's a lot of people and going into these tracks I expected to hear some bad songs because of course there are a ton of bad political songs out there the last time we had a political punching bag that was this easy for musicians and for the left to throw shots at it was when George W Bush had just got elected and we had all those anti Bush music compilations come out some of those tracks were notoriously bad as well so I'm really not expecting you know clear skies and birds chirping in every direction on this collection of songs over here for a trump free America partially because Trump is so shitty as I recently said in my favorite tracks video that when you sort of throw shots at him some of his is bound to splash back at you because at this point there's not really anything that could be said about Trump that hasn't already been set when we look back on hardcore punk bands and hardcore politically charged hip-hop artists and some of the folk music artists of the 60s making politically charged music a lot of the time the sentiments in these songs were not necessarily mainstream sentiments they were speaking truth to power however the the the the opinion that Trump is a dick and a total moron and completely unelectable that is very much a mainstream opinion I mean sure he has his people who are willing to vote for him sure he has his fans and his followers but there's really no shortage of Trump haters out there so when you make an anti Trump song how to do it in such a way where you don't come across as just a cliche you're not just simply another face in the chorus of people who are saying hey Trump's an idiot Trump's a racist Trump's a misogynist Trump is anti-immigration Trump hates this Trump hates that Trump 'once your babies to die many of these statements I either agree with or I see why people would feel that way however just saying that Trump is an idiot and Trump is trash I feel like is only acknowledging a sliver a portion a fraction of what is making our current political system and specifically this election so shitty right now this election more than any election in the past I think from what I understand of presidential history and all the elections that I paid attention to and participated in this election more than any election has really been the choice of the lesser of two evils a friend of mine the other day had posted a meme on the internet that actually made like a solid point to me that electing Trump would be an endorsement of everything that's wrong with our culture while endorsing Hillary and voting for Hillary would be a vote for everything that's wrong with our politics all the corporate interests the lack of transparency the lies the hawkish foreign policy being in bed with Wall Street and of course in pretty much every song that I've heard in this list thus far there's there's no room for that nuance there's no room for that discussion of hey listen while Trump sucks there's really something wrong with the system in general that for whatever reason these are our choices now there are some songs in this list that I actually think are pretty good Death Cab for Cutie with a million dollar loan I think that's one of their better tracks in a while I actually thought it was a really catchy hook on this cut the music video was pretty funny too with this silhouette of this trumpet looking figure waving his arms and yelling and then basically making fun of the fact that to get his life started to get his businesses started he needed that million dollar loan he's essentially born with a silver spoon I don't really have too much to say about a lot of the live tracks that have made their way into the list over here the LV track was absolutely boring the lijinsky track was so bad it is not even worthy of the hilariously i grabbing title of donald trump makes me want to smoke crack then we have these two mobi songs on here which in my opinion are absolutely shameful probably the two worst songs in the list thus far the track Trump is on your side is this full cut with a lot of acoustic guitar and just basic straightforward singing kind of deadpan and monotone as I guess to just deliver the message of the song and the track is disgustingly patronizing in my opinion toward blue-collar workers and voters who have maybe been recently laid off from their factory job or something because it was shipped across the ocean to another country a group of people that like it or not Trump has done his best to try to appeal to them and make promises to these people Hillary this demographic has not really been her focus and unfortunately with the lyrics of the song Moby really talks down to these people in a nasty way I mean sure he has a point with the fact that maybe at the end of the day Trump really doesn't have your interests in mind I mean how is this billionaire really going to relate to you and care about your problems but you could argue that Hillary is just as out of touch with that same class of people and sure while I don't agree that Trump is the best choice here you're essentially asking this group of people to vote for the one whose husband voted for the international trade deal that sent a lot of their jobs down to Mexico read the room dude Moby would just rather not you know fill you in on all of the dirty details so it's just easier to agree with the drivel that he's essentially written in the lyrics here and then the moby and the void pacific choir over here with the song little failure i mean i i've said that some political song specifically that Nuala tigre song are just like bad political talking points worked into like this synth punk song but this song is literally talking points because it's just literally talking over this bad electronic crummy instrumental that gets really old really fast that was one moment where I hope that you know I hope Moby and maybe some of the other people here are getting a nice check for these fifty songs one of my favorite cuts in the track listing here was this Vinnie Paz song which was heavily inspired by the writings of Howard Zinn a writer who I think has a pretty interesting take on American history if you don't sort of have a leftist perspective on America or you know history in general you might not always agree with his thoughts and his views on things but I think he's definitely worth reading I think he does an amazing job of illustrating that America doesn't always function in a way that's fair and then he does a great job of putting this into song the track I think it's genius kind of lies in the fact that it's not just this Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump kind of song you know it's this general overview of America's social and political malfunctions starting off with the end justices of World War two and moving down the timeline from there the yaesu Sun Kil moon cut on here is very wordy and entertaining in a sense while I'm not completely head over heels for it I think marks little rants throughout this track especially the one moment where he's like this is coming from my heart if you don't like what I'm saying you go listen to bye bye miss American Pie there's that and many more amazing other spots in the song and of course like a section of it about Trump this song and I guess some other songs on here feel like they're just merely referencing Trump here and there there so much like totally about Trump or they weren't maybe written for this compilation I'm not entirely sure I can't totally say I know with those Bush compilations for example there were some tracks that pre-existed that compilation or were only maybe like loosely affiliated with sort of the bush theme of that compilation so I'm kind of getting a similar vibe here with these 3040 new songs the Jim James saw on here was pretty underwhelming and then the Jim James and Andrew birdsong deeper into the list I was pretty underwhelming to the clipping song um I actually liked I thought it was pretty good you know I wasn't amazed by it there were some points where I thought the the lyrics were maybe a little too forgiving toward Hillary but you know I agree with a lot of the sentiments about Trump in the track I think instrumentally it's pretty well constructed I also thought that sort of moment where they say she will not lose and the way that each one of those words sort of follows with a line that kicks off with that word was actually pretty smart creative way to structure a rap verse I guess my issue with a lot of these tracks at the end of the day is that when I listen to a song that tries to come through the political message or an idea or something um what's important to me is the truth of the message and a lot of these tracks to me only get to a portion of the truth sure like Trump is you know that's just the easiest statement to make that's just the simplest most plainest  day statement you can make Trump's flaws are really plain as day and even people who are voting for him and who are fans of him acknowledge that those flaws are there and are constantly trying to reason them by saying oh you know that was just locker room talk when he said oh grab by the oh he actually meant this oh he actually meant that oh he actually he didn't mean to disrespect POWs he's just such an odd character it would really be an international embarrassment in a lot of ways but the opposing choice of politics as usual isn't is it necessarily an exciting option especially when politics as usual is what so many people especially Bernie Sanders supporters have had so much unrest and much anger about anger over in the past year now one of the worst things about this website has really nothing to do with the songs at all but once you go deeper into the site you click on one of these songs you actually see like this uh this little column over here with some messages displayed for you to read saying hey if you're this kind of person read this if you're a feminist you can't get behind Hillary read that if you're a Bernie Sanders supporter who doesn't really care for Hillary read this other thing and each one of these pages reveals a horribly under written paragraph of text each of which takes this really patronizing tone like wow I've really clicked on this just to be talked down to like I'm like I'm a total  moron Bernie Sanders is no longer running for president no he has thrown his support to Hillary Clinton and he is actively campaigning for her if Bernie supporters vote for Hillary Clinton Trump will be unable to win if they don't vote they will assist in electing Donald Trump a billionaire who has not paid taxes in in 20 years yes as have many of Hillary's donors - what what choice paragraph here completely ignores the fact that Bernie Sanders supporters have voted for Bernie and supported Bernie based upon policies that he supported that they liked that appealed to them they didn't just vote for Bernie because they just thought he was a cool old Jewish guy they liked what he stood for what he stood for is not what Hillary stands for so Bernie supporters are not happy and I don't think talking to them like their children is not necessarily the way to win them over nor is it the way to talk to Obama supporters or people who care about transparency in government this is a good one Trump's campaign has exhibited a historic lack of transparency he is the first candidate ever to release his tax returns and has repeatedly lied about his reason for not doing so Trump claims that he cannot release his returns because he was being audited but the IRS Commissioner has duh duh-de-duh like all right hasn't Hillary shown a historical lack of transparency as well I can't recall election recently where there's been so much hubbub over a candidate's emails personally I'm tired of the damn emails as well but the thing is if there's classified information there and it's potentially leaking the places it shouldn't be that's kind of like you know breaking the law and I don't know if you're vying for the highest office in all the land I think you should be able to follow the rules you know some some simple rules I think it's pretty basic requirement honestly and on top of that I feel like the media and the public in general has just barely scratched the surface of this issue of hey look at all these foreign governments that have given the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars does that in any way impact the way the Hillary runs the the the State Department all the ridiculous things that have come out as a result of the Podesta emails I mean I for one have read a lot of them and I don't really think there are too many smoking guns there but the fact that Hillary and her camp talks so callously about the American people and sort of filing them into the election booths based on demographics and this and that on election day it's likely kind of CSS cattle just be herded into the direction that they want us to be herded into and that's a little disheartening I especially love that a killer Mike sort of turned that one email in relation to him into a piece of merch he earned that he deserved that make your money dude make your money all that being said this collection of tracks thus far has been pretty shaky and I anticipate the rest of them to be pretty shaky as well I I don't anticipate that they're going to be too many more amazing songs and then these 40 tracks because a great deal of them thus far again are pretty crummy musically and lyrically and only get to a part of the truth of what's going on this election season and still even with all these songs the best anti Donald Trump song recorded is really why jeez  Donald Trump and honestly I think it's really the only song that needed to be recorded as an anti Donald Trump song because really every other song has fallen short of that track in a significant way in my opinion leave it to YG dude you know you figured one of these conscious rappers would have come out first with with a donald trump song that hit it big on the internet but yg was doing it first dude and no I don't want to hear the anti Donald Trump song you came out with on your soundcloud the day that he announced that he was running I'm sorry I'm gonna leave it here on on that note thank you for watching my rambling thoughts about the the election political music these songs specifically and um Terp de derp derp derp derp derp transition have you given any of these anti Trump songs a listen did you love them in did you hate them and good luck to everybody out there on November 8th I hope everyone goes out there and votes don't just sit back find out the candidate that you feel represents you the best you feel you agree with the most and vote for that person put in the effort and vote for that person um yeah that's it guys I hope you have a good one forever 
WDgcVRzRpK4,[Music] [Applause] hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd of the needle drop today teaming up with Skype for a new series called on track with the needle drop an interview series where our first guest is going to be the legendary Alice Cooper come on you guys get up on your feet welcome to madman of rock it is Alice [Applause] sign in please [Applause] give a round of applause [Applause] we're gonna give the needle drop on here mr. Alice Cooper the needle drop what up dude how you doing man I'm doing great I'm excited it's not every day you get to speak with Alice Cooper well I do every day does that get boring for you or do you just make up new versions of yourself in your head - talk to you later down the road no you know the funny the great thing about being Alice Cooper's they don't have to be Alice Cooper all the time when you when you get to play this character every night during the day I'll get up in the morning and play golf go to the movies do whatever I want to do and then that night I get to be this villain onstage is sort of Vaud villain and I look forward to it before I get deep in any questions that I have for you and I do have some questions there are a few guest callers that we are doing a little question with in this interview une kit from Moscow we have a question coming all the way from Moscow and we have su from Jersey who's on as well yeah hi Alice it's real honor to speak with you I've been a fan since I was a kid in the 70s watching you on Don Kirshner's rock concert and I recently was out in Arizona visiting some family and I went to your thrips your thrift store and I got really interested in all the charitable work that you're doing and I was wondering if you could tell us more about that well Solid Rock foundation is something that we've been doing and my wife and I've been doing for over 20 years now and I was I was standing downtown in Phoenix and I was watching a drug deal go down right to kids 16 17 years old and I was going I'll bet you that kid doesn't know he could be the best guitar player in town and that other kid might be the best drummer only they've never had the chance to even start that they probably grew up into that life into the gang life you know I said why don't we build a place where they can come in and learn guitar bass drums whatever dance singing whatever for free and instead of getting by down into the gang life which is gonna generally be dead or in jail here's a whole alternative to them and it's a it's a Christian nonprofit organization we've been doing it for twenty years and we get a hundred kids a day in there for us it's really really fulfilling to see some of these kids end up in bands not in jail we have a question again coming all the way from Moscow oh we have une kit and Victoria here and they have a pretty dense question they want to ask hi Alice huge I'm actually from India I'm currently staying in Moscow so the classic Alice Cooper lineup including yourselves the late Glenn Buxton and then it's done away where art students and you were definitely inspired by abidor valley and other several artists for me it's very interesting to see that it is in in a way that influenced your stage aesthetics and your ideas so how important do you think is this merging of Arts and aesthetics with music especially rock'n'roll and metal music yeah I think that you know the fact that we that we were art majors and ended up getting to work with Salvador Dali on on some things the idea of bringing art to rock and roll was just natural the music was all were already there I would go to see the WHO or I would go to see Pink Floyd or any of these bands and they were old friends of ours you know and the only thing that was missing was the lyrics coming to life and that's where I felt that that's where I belonged if you're gonna say welcome to my nightmare don't just say it give him the nightmare you know you know I mean that was really the idea Salvador Dali came to see the show and he looked at it and he goes to surrealism you know it's it's an extension of me of course everything was about Dali he was great you know Groucho Marx caught saw the show and said it's vaudeville so any everybody that saw the show had a different version of what it was but what it was was different from anything else that was out there before we go on I want to thank our guests une kit Victoria and sue for coming on asking their questions we're doing depart from them right now so thanks guys thanks for being on I only ask this question because it's right around the corner can you please tell us what what a typical Halloween is in the Cooper household you know however many animals are sacrificed how many candles are lit the thing that makes the Alice Cooper house so weird is that how straight we are and yet everybody in my household is fairly insane nobody ever comes to our house at Halloween which is interfere I think they're afraid of my mom oh my mom is like you know she's 91 and she's probably right now cleaning the garage or painting the house or something you know toughest old bird on the planet one of the strangest Halloween's ever went to was before I was married I took Linda Blair to see the Exorcist Linda Blair had to the movie had just come out and we went to see The Exorcist in Los Angeles and we're sitting there you know and every this was the time when the Exorcist was so scared people were throwing up and passing out and it was really truly still probably the scariest movie of all time and the guy in front of us is talking and I tap him on the shoulder you know and he turns around he goes oh my gosh Alice Cooper and then he looks at her he goes oh it's Regan you know I see can you spin your head around just once just please just spin your head around a pea soup all over this guy but that was uh that was really fun to go to see The Exorcist with Linda Blair she's going oh this part is so funny maybe before I sort of get out of this interview portion of the talk that we're having here maybe grace us with one of the most wild war stories that you can tell us from from back in the day from your days on the road the very first time we finally got a gig was if the whiskey a go go and every band from every city is trying to get that gig to get into the whiskey agogo because the doors are the headliners there you know and so finally we get we tried and there it says Alice Cooper and I went who's Led Zeppelin nobody had ever heard of Led Zeppelin they were a brand-new band you know and no they had never heard of us and when we got there you know they showed up and I looked at Jimmy Page and I went that guy was in The Yardbirds I said we opened for you and we opened for them and then the next night they said no we open for you so it was like a nice trade off we go we stayed friends ever since that the very next night we go to play a club called the cheetah Club and it says Alice Cooper who's Pink Floyd you know some guy named Pink Floyd's he must dress all in pink and his name is Floyd the barber or something I don't know and we ended up being of course best friends they ran out of money and moved in with us so now you've got Alice Cooper and Pink Floyd living in a house in Venice and Syd Barrett is so out of his mind I'd wake you up in the morning I'd get we walk into the kitchen and he'd be sitting there and there'd be a box of cornflakes there and he'd be going I guess the cornflakes were dancing for him or something you know you know and I'd say how you doing Syd he go great look at this I go what it's a corn flakes box you know I mean he was fairly sober yes no killer guitar player we've got a fan art contest going on right now and you're gonna be picking the winner it is your head sort of depicted in the midst of a golf ball you know I always like us you're crossed I always said if I ever got on the PGA I would go full Alice if I was playing Tiger Woods and I was at full Alice you know and I could shoot 67 every day I would be full Alice out there this one's a little more morbid and dark we have you depicted in a diamond your your like an undead character your ribs are showing that actually looks like me okay that's that's great and this is this final one over here is a more of a logo type we have a skull over here with your name on it your name right below it number two is that that person's Got Talent that's that's really well done because you're playing the black against white you're playing the negative against the positive there your art has won Alice's hand chosen your art amazing thank you good news is it on it would uh well you don't know what comes with it would you like to uh throw a question at Alice about his album Artur his artistic aesthetic or anything like that what colors did you think for the t-shirt it just like black and white you know there was a play on Broadway Dracula on Broadway and what they did was a very smart thing everything was black and white except one little thing of red that could use one small something of blood you know or read somewhere basic right thanks for coming on yes thank you Mike alright again my guest has been Alice Cooper it's been great talking you man thank you thank you so much [Applause] I don't know how Skype works but I love it because I can stay in touch with my family when you were on the road as much as we are things like Skype are really important the outward is great the daddy is really good I mean he's technically really really good [Music] but the show began I've been ready thanks guys left studio for the rad teacher you've been watching the needle drop on track with Alice Cooper happy Halloween you freaks [Music] 
EvIq0DvErTU,hey everyone with the you want to know here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where we get into the best and the worst tracks of the week as well as some of the songs that I just thought were kind of underwhelming that's all and before we kick this segment off as usual I want to mention to you guys that if you want to support this segment hit up our amazon associates link down there in the description anything you buy on Amazon if you live in the u.s. we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price and yeah yeah that's that's all let's get into like we do the worst tracks of the week first this this past week blessed us with some pretty awful tracks like I I barely I barely even want to get into it some of them were so shameful and so disappointing to be quite honest but hey you know it's it's it's what we do here every week I have to mention a Drake with his new track fake love easily one of the most entertaining scratch that on entertaining tracks I'd heard this week sounds like a boring hotline bling' just like I said in this video over here I know you don't just rap and I don't mind when you sing but tell me why this track sounds like a boring hotline bling' we also have a new track from Charli XCX called the after party with little yachty Charli XCX I really loved that EP that she came out with recently working with people the good people over at PC music I was really quirky it was really on the fringe it was really catchy it was futuristic it was pop it was insane it was off the wall but now she has gone to this plain annoying bubblegum sound with this new track over here the little yachty verse of course doesn't really bring too much to the table I don't really care for yachties features a lot of the time as much as I do kind of his song so though I did really love him on that that DRAM track broccoli but I digress this track uh turley boring in my opinion and just really obnoxious there's not really too much else to say about it moving on from there we have two tracks from Pussy Riot the Russian activists and music group came out with two tracks this past week one of which is this kind of weird electronic Russian rap song that's very abstract and very obnoxious and then something for people over in the the good old US of A a anti-trump song called make America great again which is really a overstated satire in a lot of ways she's the the woman featured in the video Nadya Tolokonnikova she's trying to get into the country but they're they're branding her all over her body on numerous occasions because she is a foreigner because she's not not thin enough or not sexy enough though hypocritically the track in numerous or the music video in numerous shots uses sex and her body to sell its political message like you're obviously bringing in the most attractive member of Pussy Riot to do these songs to sort of you know give us this titillating sort of visual to go along with these tracks but these is annoying as they are not even the worst tracks of the week that has to go to our good friends over at she and him they have a new track called happy holiday God why are they doing another Christmas album this is so shamefully bad of a rendition of this track the instrumentation in the background is virtually non-existent a lot of the time and Zooey Deschanel's lead vocals on this cut are just really off and lazy it just sounds like they're not even trying anymore this is just the most underwhelming and unfettered version of this song I've ever heard I've never heard a holiday song make me less excited for the holidays than this horrific rendition of this track you know if you like your holiday music boring because you're you're too alternative to just listen to the classics you're too alternative listen to the the same stuff that everybody else is listening to pump through the speakers in every box store in America you're too alternative for that shit you gotta listen to some she and him just pack away that CD in your NPR tote bag and bring it to the Christmas party you've been invited to you'll get kicked right out I'm sorry for all the cuts guys I can't keep my shit together today but we're gonna blast through all these next tracks I apologize alright here are the songs that sort of underwhelmed me this week I was kind of indifferent toward them but still they're worth checking out if you're into these artists I got to give a shout out to the band uniform for the song symptom of the universe this is kind of a noise industrial punk rock a bit of a black metal vibe on this track too it's really noisy it's really aggressive if you like your music hard-hitting and abrasive and animalistic give this thing a shot it's kind of cultish it's very dark so shout out to that band on that new cut over there might be scoping out their new record we have abs soul with the song Braille featuring boss which the hook on this track is all about how hey everything's been done before everything's been said nothing's original which in a sense I agree with that but it kind of seems like right from the get-go they're just like hey we're not gonna do anything original here just just telling you that just letting you know so don't expect anything original we're telling you that nothing can even be original you know I think you should at least strive for originality in a sense you know even if you don't perfectly achieve it because you know something that is perfectly original a wholly original it might not necessarily be good you know so still I think striving for it is not really a bad goal they seem to kind of reject it right from the out right and the result is really another one of ABS Souls least interesting songs like there's not really too much going on on this track sadly moving on from there we have Drake with sneakin featuring 21 savage this is one of the better singles the Drake had dropped over the past week and even though it does kind of blatantly rip off 21 savages sound in a lot of ways Drake does come through with some decent one-liners and I actually wish we heard more of this Drake on views to be honest then I want to finally reference in this section the new clipping song fat fingers which is one of 40 songs over the course of 30 days that are all for an anti Trump or Trump Free America a project of songs that are all you know fuck drum type songs that I'm going to be talking about in sort of a standalone video in the coming days though this track some people been contacting me saying Anthony have you heard this clipping track it's really cringey I don't think it's that cringey I think I think sonically it sounds just as quality as any other clipping song and I think that the track is maybe a little too generous toward the Clinton camp you know but pretty much everything David says about Trump being the shithead that he is is true so I mean I don't really think it's a bad track performance wise and musically I think it's good you know I mean if you're the type of person who sort of avoids politics and their music outright maybe then you won't really get into this I think that's kind of especially true for people this election season because Trump is just so shitty that when you try to attack him the some of the shit is gonna splash on you and kind of make you shitty as a result because sort of attacking him has become so cliche and so easy at this point like all of his flaws and all of his ridiculousness are just kind of like all out there in the open for everyone to see and again sort of like you know outrightly criticizing it in a way as blatantly as the song does can kind of seem easy but you know I think it's a well-put-together track you know I think it's technically and excuse me I think it's technically sound and I think it's an intricate song you know it doesn't sound like clipping just half-ass this track you may not fully agree with it you may feel like you know it doesn't give equal time to both sides or whatever but still I think it's a decent track now moving on to my favorite tracks of the week I know one more track that I thought was just okay the new yg song a one time coming which is another track from the West Coast rapper which sort of deals in the whole issue of police brutality fallen victims of police violence this track it's okay it's a little underwhelming I'm glad that he's going in on this topic again but I think he had attacked it so much better on his latest record which if the song is good for anything it should be a reminder to try out YG's latest album very good album when I favorite hip records of the year and to the closure of that album as far as a police-brutality song is absolutely fuckin fire so you know give this track a shot and go on to that latest record of his if you haven't given it a shot already and on to my favorite tracks of the week we just have a couple over here I want to give a shout-out to Joanna Newsom on make hay which was a track or a non-album track that had been released in celebration of the one-year anniversary of her latest album diver's so if you like diverge you're gonna dig this track it's a bit of a leftover from the record it's pretty good moving on from there we have run the jewels with talk to me not a song where I think run the jewels are kind of outdoing themselves but a good hardcore hip-hop song pretty much everything that's great about run the jewels moving let me turn down this there we go everything great about run the jewels sort of copied and pasted onto a new cut so nothing nothing wrong with that we have let's see the last Shadow Puppets with a great Leonard Cohen cover is this what you wanted the string sections on this track are great and also the vocal performance is pretty dramatic as well The Last Shadow Puppets their latest record I thought was pretty underwhelming and uninteresting honestly but they came through with this cover and it's it's stellar it's a great cover so I mean I think Leonard Cohen fans have a lot to celebrate this year between this cover and the loo Leonard Cohen album which i think is okay I'm not crazy about it not really sure if I'm going to do a full length review of it or anything like that but uh yeah whatever and I think we're gonna finish it off with this ASAP rocky song telephone calls with Tyra the creator people like playboy cardi and young grease and apparently this is going to be featured on a new mixtape that is just around the corner now I got to turn up this thing again thank now this track is crazy it's off the fucking wall like the beat is nuts and the verses on this thing it's almost unpredictable it's like a slugfest between rocky and cardi and gleesh and tyler like the Playboy cardi sort of comes out of nowhere at the beginning Tyler's verse just like really goes on very long ASAP is all over the track the the beat has moments where it just kind of stops for like a little bit like this song has no real likes traditional structure to it but I like it a lot it's totally off the fucking wall it's like a total slugfest and the the flow is really weird too if ASAP rocky experiments like this on the rest of this mixtape and bring some good features and some crazy hard-hitting instrumentals this could be a fantastic tape from the ASAP mob that we're looking forward to over here I mean because we also have to take into account that it is the ASAP mob so you're gonna be bringing in all these other voices especially all these other rappers in the mob that are not really as good to listen to it or do here as ASAP rocky or ASAP ferg we're probably gonna be talking about some lackluster tracks in the track listing but this song is quality in my opinion this is this is a great track this is a hot track so I I really have no reason not to look forward to the tape right now but we'll see and those are essentially my favorite least favorite in the sort of underwhelming or indifferent tracks of the week cool cool alright again hit up that Amazon Associates link if you want to support this segment and check out all these tracks all of them been linked down there in the description so if you want to hear any of them even the ones that I didn't like and yeah guys that's all thanks for watching appreciate it forever 
bv_MI60ZMUQ,hi everyone Ruthven eat dog tan oh here the internets Road doggy Assad and it's time for a review of the new DRAM album big baby DRAM singer/rapper hitmaker DRAM finally coming through with his full-length commercial debut album right after having dropped some of the hottest tracks of the past couple years namely his breakout song cha cha cha cha after which I thought DRAM would quickly just become an irrelevant one-hit wonder now don't get me wrong I do like cha cha but it's kind of a gimmicky song there's like not really much to the verses of this track you know it's really all about the hook and the beat to this thing which I'm not discounting you know Drake most definitely ripped this song off in order to make one of the biggest hits of his career how I'm bling but now that I've been hearing the the singles from this record like cash machine and broccoli and cute DRAM is starting to convince me that there is a world beyond cha cha a world that's full of fun playful blends of trap and pop and R&B top with these vocals that seem to get more eccentric with each new hit now drams vocals were a little off-putting at first for me but I have kind of come to love his voice it's strange but it has like a real pop appeal to it his lead vocals have a very yell piece somewhat nasal tone but he can play it super smooth if he wants to which he always does when he's doing his own background vocals which come off very velvety nimble stacked a mile high and really well arranged like on the intro track here get it myself which is an awesome intro loaded with these rushes of vocal harmonies that are really invigorating this track is kind of like a sunrise on a new morning and in the middle of the Sun is drams big goofy face smiling like in some kind of weird alternate rap Teletubby universe and the beat on this track is produced by none other than mr. Donny Trump is so of course there's some jazzy undertones to it then we get the song misunderstood with young thug how can the first track of an album be so good the first full song of an album be so good incredible instrumental on this track opening up with these tense piano chords that build up into this awesome ocean of bass and synthesizers it sounds like something out of a blaxploitation film loaded with police shootouts and car explosions drams voice cuts through the instrumental chaos like a knife through butter and he sounds like he's he's mysterious like he's on the run and young thug is his partner in crime the album's smooth this out on the song not to sell OU AB which sounds like this fusion of 90's pop rappin 90s R&B both of which DRAM seems to perform pull off very well on the opening verse here he sounds like a modern-day Bismarck he rapping about his heart being broken lamenting about I guess what could have been with this girl or girls who sort of seemed to fawn over and because he's famous but there's sin for the fame they're just as much into the people who are headlining his shows that he's playing or sort of playing at the shows that he's playing at but he reminds this woman are these women on the hook that if they want to know him if they're interested in him they know where he's at they know where he's been trying to stack his dividends now when it comes to the song Wi-Fi I wasn't really liking this track at first I just really wasn't sure how to take it it is a buttery smooth slow jam that moves as slow as molasses and features the the great Erykah Badu all of which sounds fine on the surface but they are literally singing about Wi-Fi which I know it's just a metaphor for the love connection between DRAM and Erica on this track but it's still kind of preposterous even if Erica's last project was like all about cell phones but the more I listened to it the more I listened to this instrumental the more I listened to these vocal performances the song is sexy as and in the end I think the eccentric lyrical angle of the track only helps the song and helps the album out too it would be kind of disappointing if DRAM came through and just I don't know put together a plain love song with nothing really interesting about it I guess in the end I think the lyrical angle of the track only helps to enhance the eccentricity of the track and the album itself and then with the song as cash machine broccoli and cute the album hits a stride you have three of the best singles of the year regardless of genre all on the same album all back-to-back I love the rich choppy piano samples on cash machine which you said was a raycharles sampler right holy I will herself oh okay there you go I also love the very colorful cash machine samples that are played throughout the track DRAM singing about how this cash machine talks to him and the verses on the track are very funny and playful of course it's all about having money but it's not this hey I'm richer than you kind of song and you should look up to me it's really about you know anybody having money in their pockets you can have fun spending a little money in your pocket to this track whether you have twenty thousand dollars in your pocket or twenty dollars now broccoli there smoking on some broccoli on this track we all know what that means but outside of that does this song mean anything I mean not not really I wouldn't even say it's it's even all that tasteful especially with this line over here but I do like the little woodwind or recorder leads on this track they're really playful and melodic and the track does bring this joyful sense of bliss that I enjoyed hearing so much on yachties breakout mixtape little boat and little yadi amazing feature for this track him and RAM are really made to collaborate with each other and I would actually like to hear them on the same track more in the future and the song cute I'm not gonna go too deep into it I'll just say girl you like throw this on a mixtape pass it along it's in the bag now the album unfortunately takes a bit of a nosedive at this point the track out of sight is this really unfortunate hip house track that does not go over too well drams very faint lead vocals and clunky hooks don't work that well into the groove of the beat the instrumental itself is fine though it's not as original or as fun as many of the other cuts on the record and DRAM fails to kind of regain his footing on the following two tracks changed my number which is really patience testing and the Spacey instrumental doesn't really seem to support his over-the-top vocals on this cut all that well either and then with password he's singing about his girl hacking into his phone catching him being unfaithful he's kicking himself for leaving his phone out for making his password his name again it's another fun and an interesting song concept definitely reflective of love in the information age and the technology age but it's not one of the better crafted songs on the album the song 100% by comparison is much more solid of a cut has a sturdy hook that anchors the entire track down with some interesting lyrical turns of phrase where dream is singing about how he is all of this person this person is all of him together they complete each other they make 100 percent and yeah it's a cornea it's a cliched sentiment but it's a good tune on the song sweet virginia breeze DRAM plays it kind of cool and subtle with a classy vintage instrumental he does a bit of an old-school soul thing on the track that's not too bad it's cool he's versatile enough to pull this off though this song to me is maybe a little bit of a cop-out it's like the most mellow track on the entire record it's the biggest change of pace musically on the entire record so of course they just kind of toss that at the end just to make you kind of get ready for the album to be over and there you go guys that is this dream album from front to back pretty much lots of highlights lots of great tracks lots of good performances some good Tunes some of the best singles of the year but it is a debut album and it does have some of the inexperience that debut albums tend to be daunted by even from here to ChaCha there's been a great amount of progression so it's gonna be interesting to see how many more hits how much more solid of a project he can drop a year from now because he's just got so many things working for him he's a great singer he can rap he can write some decent lyrics too he's good on a hook he has a great year four beats a big personality and his songs tend to be really fun and have a strong pop sensibility so while this record does have its flaws I'm really looking forward to seeing what DRAM does in the future I'm feeling a strong seven on this record treacherous or transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you the best what should i review next

kAOw5dpeaus,hi everyone Anthony Fantana is a cut boy here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Conor Oberst record ruminations famed singer songwriter Conor Oberst is back with a brand new record if you were emo as in the 2000s most likely you enjoyed some of Conor's music with bright eyes like fevers and mirrors and lifted and I'm wide awake it's morning I'm not going to go too deep into why but around that whole Cassadaga era of the the bright eyes discography they kind of lose me the songs feel watered-down and the production is less dynamic the instrumentation is less interesting and unfortunately Conor Oberst 2014 solo record upside-down Mountain didn't exactly provide an oasis from that and come to think of it I didn't really like his attempt at bringing deysa Paris Ito's back from the dead either so honestly I don't know why I tried this album out I wasn't really expecting all that much from Conor Oberst at this point in his career because he had put out so many albums that I didn't care for at all but I'm glad I did give this thing a shot because I was pleasantly surprised on this album Conor goes back to the basics with acoustic guitar piano harmonica and vocals this thing has the instrumental tone of a folk record from the 60s and he is standing simply on the quality of his songs on this album no bells no whistles really no margin for error either and since Oberst is an established lyricist and an accomplished songwriter of course there are highlights on this thing some of them make pretty sharp poignant satirical observations about the world at large others are really personal autobiographical and almost painful to listen to because of how sad they are the song a little uncanny is this very funky ballad that touches down on a series of historical figures talking about what they accomplished or how they affected the world in their lifetime is uncanny talking about Jane Fonda and talking about Ronald Reagan as well saying that his policies drove Conor to read all these Russian writers Russian authors I imagine for kind of a leftist perspective on the world and I love the third verse on the track where he says he misses Robin Williams he misses sylvia plath he misses Christopher Hitchens and I agree he sounds particularly earnest at this point in the track and I just love how this is conveyed over these really raw intimate performances all of which sound like one take it doesn't really sound like there are any overdubs on this thing I imagine the whole recording process is encapsulated in the photo on the front cover Conor they're sitting at the piano microphone in front of his face harmonica latched right there close to his mouth the chilling song next-of-kin is a very dreary ballad where Connor is singing about having to notify someone of his dead lover then we get a really dreary depiction of his life afterwards and later in the song Connor reflects on moments where he's met Patti Smith and Lou Reed and how that didn't really change him and that he's lost his innocence through Fame he talks about spreading his anger this anger that he gained as he rose to popularity like Agent Orange orange green on this track and many others here he acknowledges that the spotlight has changed him and not necessarily for the better something I think he also references on the track gossamer-thin I assume this track is semi autobiographical as he is singing about this drug addiction that he seemed to be going through at one point in his life the bohemian lifestyle that he was living and the entourage of free spirits who were following him around and fawning over every word that he'd say one of whom it seems he had an ongoing affair with in the lyrics and if this track is an autobiographical the song counting sheep definitely is as Connor references having recently been diagnosed with a cyst in his brain talking about trying to be easy not wanting to be needy not wanting to be greedy I assume he is fearing that moment in his life where he's going to be so weak that he can't help himself he's gonna need to depend on he's gonna need other people to do things for him he goes deeper into his health and the final verses he's singing about his blood pressure and the alkaline produce that he has sitting in his fridge or in his pantry or whatever this track I love because of such a lyrically telling moment at such an interesting moment on the record even if the song doesn't display the usual finesse that Connor brings to the guitar every track has a vivid and detailed lyrical angle I could go into each story on each song but I don't want to spoil every single one of them and as far as the sound of the record it's all pretty uniform those guitars those pianos the harmonica the singing he doesn't really veer outside of that and I think this album in some ways is the the better for it it's nice to hear an album that sticks to its guns and is so well crafted that it doesn't get old it doesn't get boring it doesn't get stale and that's just really a testament to Connors talents that he can strip things back so far that there's still great things to listen to that there's still an appeal to what he does even when he's breaking it down to the basics sure you know it's nothing altogether new it doesn't exactly take any risks and it's over simplicity you know you could easily compare what he's doing here to Bob Dylan or even Elliott Smith but those comparisons only go so far because Connor has a voice of his own he has a storytelling style of his own and these stories on this record specifically are all his own as well I will say this album does live up to its title ruminations to the point where maybe Connor sorrow becomes a little bit of a bitter pill to swallow especially at the middle point of the record but the songs get especially dreary but if you've enjoyed his music in the past you should probably go into this record expecting that dreariness expecting that sorrow anyway really enjoying this record feeling a strong seven to a late eight on this thing Treach for transition have you given this album

zebg8WhUU3Y,hi everyone law and order SVU here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Lady Gaga record Joanne what of pop music's most eccentric and bold personalities miss Lady Gaga is back with her fifth full-length album one of the shears most highly anticipated records and for good reason there were some very good singles teasing to the release of this record and this album was shaping up to be a pretty big change of pace for Gaga I mean just looking at her collaborators on this record many of them but a few of them being Josh Tillman of father John misty Fame Josh Homme II of Queens of the Stone Age Kevin Parker also Sean Lennon was on this thing one of the Higham sisters so going into this record I could expect some rock songs at least expect some folk songs plus with Mark Ronson having a hand in the production on every single track of this record that opens up avenues to a ton of other things vintage styles of pop and soul music so as a result of bringing all these people on Joanne is most definitely Gaga's most strict back and instrumentally I guess sort of rootsy album yet this album is most definitely an attempt at Gaga reinventing herself as this singer-songwriter type mostly in image and sort of in practice which is not a bad direction to move in I like the sound I like the sound that she is shooting for my issue is is that sometimes it feels like she's not fully committed to the sound she's not fully committed to the change because sometimes these alterations just feel sort of surface-level like the intro track which sounds like any number of Gaga songs that she had released previously but with kind of a root seer introduction and especially the songs AO and John Wayne which sure they have guitars acoustic drums horns hanging in the background some background vocals as well but oh this instrumentation is produced in such a squeaky-clean tight regimented way that the wild and in loose vibe of a rock song of a soul song is really just law in the process making these tracks just like you know a shade more dangerous than like a meghan trainor song or like a less risky Amy Winehouse which is a shame because there are other tracks that incorporate a wealth of background instrumentation but they don't come off as stiff of the song sinner's prayer most definitely an example and a highlight for me in the tracklist though I'm still not quite sure what to think of Gaga's attempt at making a reggae song with just a dash of Ace of Base mixed in there on the song dancing in circles a song that is paired with a set of lyrics that are so obviously about masturbating nothing worse than like painfully obvious symbolism so obvious that your symbols don't even symbolize like you might as well just be singing about what you're singing about though still you know you got to give the song some credit because who doesn't like to rub one out the tracks I prefer on the record tend to be the simpler ones the more stripped back ones especially the title track on the record which I believe is in tribute to her late aunt who I suppose this entire album since it's titled after that track is in dedication to her I don't think Gaga quite pulls off the weary vocals that she's attempting on this track but this is still one of the better ballads on the record these singing on the chorus gets pretty powerful and emotional as Gaga is singing out to her aunt beckoning for her to come back saw a million reasons is another highlight it's got a bit of a country rock vibe to it with some gentle acoustic guitars and pianos down the road some strings and background vocals kind of fill the song out make it sound really grand and full but it's the simple opening that grabs my attention moves me the most and Lady gaga even though she plays it pretty reserved for much of this track she still sounds really great she doesn't need to be overdoing it all the time to emotionally sell a track and I like the folksy lyrical structure of the track too it really makes the million reasons refrain get stuck in my head and come to mama is another highlight for me - with its very jaunty beat and it's glitzy glamorous horns I mean it's a very glam E track the David Bowie influence is so thick you could just cut it with a knife there's some Motown flavor background vocals in there and I like the lyrical tone of the track - with Gaga singing about the apocalypse and unities if we don't figure this out there will be no tomorrow singing about this lack of love for our fellow man singing about how we're fighting over ideas which is maybe a lyric I don't fully agree with I guess what's important is the context of what she's trying to say they're fighting in terms of killing each other over ideas that I disagree with but also just kind of disagreeing having arguments I mean that's that's natural that's good that's discourse some ideas are shitty and should be argued against two points specifically at this lyric I mean you know I like rainbows as much as the next guy but scientists are actually pretty cool and I also like the song hey girl - featuring Florence Welch gaga and Florence really push each other to give their biggest and most dramatic vocal performances that they can on this track and lyrically it's a collaboration as well because they're they're singing about sisterhood they're singing about women supporting each other being there for one another instead of being at each other's throats or seeing each other as competition though I do have to say this track in a lot of ways is kinda Gaga melodically tracing over Elton John's Bennie and the Jets she does come to a very different musical conclusion on the chorus though you know even though the intro in the beginning and the verse is like damn that's that's that's an Elton John song I actually don't mind it you know it's just a really obvious point of reference that's all and then with the somber closer angel down Lady Gaga sort of takes a similar lyrical tone - come to mama but the the lyrics the vocals are way darker and the instrumentation is way dreary er as well Gaga seems to pull inspiration like a lot of artists have over the past few years from the recent string of police brutality stories that have been pasted all over the news and she angrily sings on the chorus asking for Gaga song it's it's pretty heavy it's pretty serious and I don't know it's gonna be interesting to see how Gaga fans take her going in that direction personally I like it I think it's a good direction my issue sometimes is though I don't think it goes deep enough this album isn't the full metamorphosis or the complete evolution that I was hoping for a lot of the time Gaga seems to be toying with country and full and music like they're just an outfit to be put on and worn at the red carpet and then just discarded when they're out of style and that is shown in the number of lyrical shortcomings on the record for somebody who's trying to work the singer-songwriter angle Lady Gaga doesn't exactly come off as a wordsmith she's not writing the kind of lyrics that you know get you a Nobel Prize or anything Bob Dylan which is something that she could easily get away with on her previous records because they're their pop songs nobody's paying that much attention to the lyrics but she's playing to a certain kind of crowd here she's playing with a certain kind of music here that emphasizes that she's given herself some big lyrical shoes to fill and she doesn't always do it still though I thought this was a pretty decent record I thought it was a sort of good record if I squinted at it hard enough I might even say it's it's a pretty good record even if I didn't end up loving and it was interesting to see Gaga move in this direction and like I said there were at least a handful of tracks that I thought were great I'm feeling a decent strong six on Joanne transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments all sorts of links next to my head videos subscription website click on one of them I'll see you later guys forever 
-0rkRvKZAcM,haha hi everyone banned any banned Tanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new game album 1992 compton rapper the game striking while the iron is hot on this new record over here quickly following up his double sequel album - his big breakout album the documentary of the documentary - and the documentary 2.5 the latter of those - I loved thought was fantastic both of these records struck me as being way more ambitious than a lot of the games recent output some of his best music in years so I had no reason not to look forward to this new project over here especially since given the title it seemed like the game might be putting together some kind of conceptual throwback the early 90s in California there was really a lot to look back on socially and musically whether it be the LA riots the OJ trial gangster rap dr. Dre Snoop Dogg Ice Cube we're all coming out with career-defining records soup dogs doggy style artwork actually seems to be a point of reference for the artwork on this album - and the game does touch down on some of this stuff especially on the opening cut where he is literally rapping in vivid detail about looting and rioting and violence as a result of the infamous Rodney King court ruling it's over a pretty sparse beat with some Marvin Gaye samples peppered in there it's very dreary it's very spacious I would say it definitely sets the tone for the record and puts a spotlight puts an emphasis on games lyrics so it's great that he's delivering a retrospective on this but I also guessed that going into this record we would hear some personal stories as well since we're essentially going back to games childhood on this record and game actually goes too far beyond 1992 on the next track to tell a story about when he was born making reference to various points in his life where blood was a key factor than sort of relating that to his joining of the Bloods all told over there's grimy beat with kind of an old-school flavor some record scratches worked in there as well but it has this modern punch to it so far this album is delivering what I wanted from a trip back to the past that feels refreshing and hard-hitting especially on Bobtown which is this banger of a track with these blurting horn samples game comes through with this vocal delivery that reminds me of Ice Cube a lot although the most obvious influence on this tract is a very prominent do see sample that is placed throughout the song but then the quality of the album takes a nosedive as game puts more of an emphasis on the nostalgia of these tracks than he does the quality of the songs that he's putting together like on the song orange juice which is really just an interlude and the only stunning thing or attention-grabbing thing about this song is that he's essentially rapping over the instrumental to the message from Grandmaster Flash seems like this track only exists to make that one musical reference that everybody is going to know and it seems like a lot of other tracks as well only exists to sort of lazily and very blatantly work a popular song sample from this era of music into the song like however do you want it which has a pretty prominent sample of soul to souls back to life and it's like this sample is the only notable thing about the beat as the rest of the instrumental is pretty skeletal and simple the laziest sample on the record has to be on I grew up on wu-tang though which kicks off with several dry bars from Raekwon's opening verse to cream and and that's it like we've all heard this verse millions of times what it adds to this song I don't know you didn't remix it or change it in any kind of way it's just literally kicking the song off and what's odd is that this track is actually one of the most underwhelming songs on the entire record if you grew up on wu-tang wouldn't you want to capture the I don't know the wild off-the-wall sort of aggression that Wu Tang brought to the table that made them such an exciting group instead game sort of waxes poetic on a bunch of nostalgic things on his past a little of which he actually has anything to do with Wu Tang also was the group even at their peak of relevance in 1992 and I mean if this is about your early life in 1992 I mean aren't there more I don't know pertinent musical references that could be made I mean again going back to dr. Dre had just come out with the chronic and you know the game has made plenty of dr. Dre references over the course of his career Dre essentially helped put him on but I just bring up this complaint because for an album named 1992 it doesn't really seem to have a strong sense of place or time it's all over the place really all it really does have is this kind of vague sense of nostalgia that game is constantly trying to shove the audience is through with no real end or point to doing so in sight but aside from that what's really maybe this album's biggest crime is that game ruins the momentum of the record so early on in the tracklist really from the fourth track up until the the corny pop rap R&B infused ballad baby you this this whole chunk this whole middle chunk of the record is kind of a barren wasteland there are some personal stories that I admire game for putting together putting to tape these moments again seem to have little to do with the the the build-up of the intro and the title and the cover all of which point toward a concept that game doesn't really fulfill the song the soundtrack is another cut that stands out as not really fitting into the sonic the musical vibe but the instrumental is like a flip of a clams casino beat kind of instrumental vibe that I've never wanted to hear game on top of and it really does not work especially with this deep voice tough talk and the song young uh don't you were saying any friends is actually a pretty heartbreaking story about a kid that game had grown up with it seems in the tale that he tells his mother sort of moves him into their house and starts taking care of him because uh this kid's mom was a fiend and he ends up being separated from gamer they become enemies mortal enemies because they sort of join separate gangs and just kind of tears the friendship apart and the closing track ninety two bars definitely brings back the aggression so the album at least and the strong but a lot of the instrumentals a lot of the tracks here just kind of awkward they're painfully mellow and this album in a lot of ways reminds me of Jesus peace which came out a few years ago an album that similarly had a concept had sort of a central idea to it or at least tried to but when you actually listen to the entire record you find that there are so many songs in the tracklist they don't really thread together thematically because a lot of what is on this album only deals or is related to the whole idea of 1992 in a very cursory way it's kind of disappointing because I think this album had the potential to be like another good kid maad city or be like the new yg album in a way I mean to go back to Kendrick that album had so much to say had so much going on in it and it was essentially just a day in the life of Kendrick Lamar game is essentially given himself an entire year to work with on this record and yet he comes up with less to talk about and constantly veers outside of the timeline that the album's title puts us in and even if this album wasn't going to be that it could have at least been a successful in a tasteful throwback because I at least trust game to effectively take us back to that time because he had more experience within that time to kind of make it come alive for a new audience but that doesn't even really happen either at least not for more than a couple tracks this album is at least listenable there were only a handful of tracks that just could not stand and had to just completely avoid outright but a really a lost opportunity unfortunately I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry though you can leave an angry comment in the comments if you like all sorts of links next to my head other videos subscription YouTube and when you subscribe make sure you hit that notification button so you get notified forever 
AgKvvSumNmc,hey yo what up everybody Antron Phan Tuan here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for our weekly track roundup we are going into the best and worst tracks of the week as well as the song as I was just kind of indifferent toward men but as usual let us begin with the worst tracks of the week actually no I have to say before we start if you want to support this segment hit up the amazon associates link down there in the description box if you live in the u.s. anything you buy on amazon we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price it's a no brainer guys it's a no brainer christmas is coming up do some Christmas shopping for Christ's sake anyway also I do want to give a couple shoutouts over here before we get into the worst tracks I want to give a shout out to the new trash talk EP there's a link down there in the description to that it's free it's downloadable oh and get a shet I want to give a shout out to Kate Bush who has a new live album on the way link down there in the description to a more info on that and a performance from that and also a shout out to the new insane one Oh tricks point never video featuring Val Kilmer if you loved the last one at Rick's point never record you will like this video it is pretty surreal and unsettling unsettling and Val Kilmer's performance if you could call it a performance is is pretty heart-wrenching for as simple as it is you know it's like he has this real sense of dread on his face that's um pretty I don't know affecting pretty emotionally impactful I guess I will say all right moving on to what I felt were the worst tracks of the week Oh God and there's there's really just a handful of them you know there weren't too many tracks that I thought were like the worst of the worst of the worst this week but um I guess I would say the worst mnestheus is really condensed into what I feel is the worst the worst track of the week I have to give a shout-out to DRAM with the song Wi-Fi featuring Erykah Badu DRAM I loved all the singles from his forthcoming record so far I'm not going to go too into detail with this track but I will say that so trying to sing on a more conventional like neo-soul arm retune his voice is really kind of too goofy for that and this track goes over like a Led Zeppelin because of it then we have Isaiah Rashad and goldlink with the song untitled which is pretty much the most underwhelming song from each of these guys like they sound so boring and comatose from the beginning to the end of the track it's barely even worth listening to but finally the worst track of the week without question the worst track of the week is the new latigo song I'm with her yes Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill Fame with her little kind of side projects in punk trio that have not put out a single in 10 years mind you have come back out of the woodwork to release a pro-hillary anthem with terrible vocals shitty talking point lyrics it's actually pretty sad to see people who were legitimate figures in the punk movement coming back once again to come out with music where they're essentially sucking the dick of the political class like and and really desperately to like you know like as if they're performing for a porn scene you know it's not even just like some casual dick sucking you know it's like some real like over-the-top Hillary political class like we don't even care that you drone bomb innocent people in other countries dick sucking so um congratulations to leti gur for sucking all that dick on this song it's all I got to say and pitchfork miraculously this is this videos on the pitchfork channel have shut down likes and and comments because hey they don't want you guys to see the cringe because believe me there is a tidal wave of fucking cringe in this video between the the bad tone-deaf singing between the the weird dancing throughout the video it's like [Music] Kathleen I don't know dressed up just to dance in her own backyard for this video your husband is a Beastie Boy you don't have to do this shit yeah I don't know that the leti grrah should have way more dignity to do a video like this you know if we're going to vote for Hillary if we have to vote for Hillary can't at least do it in the way that we're supposed to with you know our heads down and in the midst of a fit of depression because a bulk of our politics presidential politics for the past several decades have been just being batted around between the Bush family the Clinton family the Bush family the Clinton family with like in Obama they're you know like an Obama combo breaker in there but now that he's gone it's just right back to the same old bullshit but whatever that that was my rant that was my political rant moving on because those are the worst tracks of the week that one being the worst disappointing on so many levels let's get into the songs I was just kind of you know indifferent toward but are most definitely worth mentioning justice has a new singled out called alakazam which I'm not entirely sure how to feel about it because the mix of the song on YouTube is mixed with what sounds like the live mix from their live show that the video was shot at and it sounds like crap but but the groove seems cool and you know it seems like there's there's a great beat there it seems like there's a good progression to the song but I'm not really going to be able to tell until I actually hear a legitimately clean mix of this track whether or not I love it but you know it is worth taking note of from there Eminem with campaign speech didn't hate this track didn't love this track as usual with mm I admire the detailed lyricism I admire some of the one-liners in there I admire his sense of humor I admire that he was really ambitious with this track I admire that you know he really kind of went in on Trump on this track a little bit here's here's an example of a track that has political you know uh overtones to it but is it isn't like blainley trying to suck anyone's dick you know isn't like please political class like Ram me Ram me as hard as as you possibly can yes yes it's you know it doesn't go down that road but the beat is basically non-existent you know this is kind of like a an almost acapella freestyle which not really something I want to replay from mmm certainly worth one listen but you know nothing I'm going to be playing over and over and over and you know of course there are some cringy lines which are to be expected with mmm at this point but again if you are rap fan it is worth at least one listen whether you're legitimately enjoying Marshalls you know lyricism or whether or not you're having a giggle at it either that's fine too alright moving on from there Dieruff has a new single out risk-free is one of the tracks from it it's a decent track The Flaming Lips with the castle kind of a bland song from The Flaming Lips though I do like some of the pretty dreamy psychedelic melodies work into the track and some of the lyrics are pretty surreal videos absolutely annoying don't don't watch the video just put the song on in the background and enjoy whatever you can please and from there we have Joey badass with front-and-center Joey badass unfortunately I don't know just just not really uh playing to his strengths on this song excuse me and trying to I don't know come together with like a pop rap track that's kind of feel good and really raunchy and trying to be sexy and it's just sort of awkward you know it's just kind of off it doesn't really kind of have that grimy feel that he does so well I actually liked his last single where you know he was kind of doing a pop rap trap flavor on that track on that song and that didn't go over too bad but this one it was a little more awkward just not as memorable and those are the tracks I was met on aside from the new Lady Gaga track AO which I did talk about that on my Twitter page because I am doing these short little reviews on there now which you can catch me uploading several of those a day and you know please do follow me on Twitter at the needle drop if you haven't already and you can catch that review and more but I'm not going to go into too much detail here because my review of Joanne is right around the corner so don't want to spoil too much of that now let's get to what I felt were the favorite tracks the week best tracks of the week injury reserve my boys an injury reserved back with a new video and a single all this money genius video concept not going to spoil it but do check the video out and in absolute banger on this track it's all oh yes money I love the fucking hook on this track and the verses of course are witty they're tongue-in-cheek they're funny they're playful and they just have a lot going for them these guys have the most personality of any group in the underground right now and it is a fucking shame they do not have more hype than they do I know vic mensa has recently like endorsed them good on vic mensa for that you have some taste my dude Thank You Vic Mensa but more rappers need to come out realize these guys have some good fucking shit going on and if you hop on some other shit you're gonna sound good too because their shit sounds good okay alright so check out this song check out the singles that they have released so far from this forthcoming project titled floss and get fuckin hype for please moving on from their Action Bronson with do-rag verses head band one of actions better singles in a long time funny video with big body bests and there's not a whole lot to this instrumental but it doesn't need anything because actions verses on this track his one-liners are so on point that almost every bar there's a reason to laugh at every bar and there's so many reasons to replay this thing like he's pretty much about as funny as riff raff is when refracted when rick written that when riff raff is at his peak of hilarity like he's fucking on on this track so congrats to Action Bronson for this track over here if there were more cuts like this I'm mr. wonderful mr. wonderful what an amazing fucking record just saying but do-rag versus headband great track moving on from there artificial pleasure I'll make it worth your while group that I have not heard of yet first song I've heard from these guys and this is a really great fun dancey post-punk track it's kind of a throwback it's got a disco vibe to it you know way darker way more menacing like many of those post-punk bands back in the day did and I don't like like public image limited for example with their second record but this is uh it's it's got kind of that modern clarity and punch that you know anything with new production does so uh you know it's kind of like a slightly new spin on an old sound it's not bad it's got a groove to it give it a listen it's got a lot of energy it's got a lot of oomph and I like that in my music all right common with home featuring below common coming through with a you know another thoughtful conscious hip-hop track I'm anticipating his new record not exactly sure when I'll be able to get to it because I think I'm out of the country when it comes out or I think I might be a little busy around that time but we'll get reviewed eventually and this track has me looking forward to it a Rick Ross with the song freaky ho featuring two short Juicy J Big KRIT is on the hook and this is the raunchiest nastiest fucking rap song I've heard in a long time and it's the better for it if you want to hear a rap single that is just like the nastiest most explicit sex that you know you're going to hear in like 2016 including like I think Juicy J says like this girl takes like swallows his banana like a monkey or takes it up the butt like a monkey I can't remember maybe I'm thinking of the amazing atheist sorry TJ I'm probably thinking of you but anyway hilariously raunchy rap track here if you know you want to hear some lowdown dirty penis going into vagina type stuff give this thing a shot and we're gonna end it off with ASAP ferg did not like his latest record as a lot of you guys know but he has a remix of the song new level which was one of the better tracks on the record over here featuring ASAP rocky future in little Uzi vert who I don't really care for a little easy a lot of the time but even his performance on the track isn't that bad and you know it's a good opportunity to kind of recycle a good banger from his record so whatever and those are the best and worst tracks of the week in my opinion guys enjoy all these tracks that I liked the mat tracks I hope you liked them as well you know if you're into some of that stuff more than me and you know give that latigo song listen for a good laugh guys and you know total disappointment in the Sham that you know and essentially just merely a fashion statement that punk has become over the years and you're the best appreciate you guys

E6WtycT5NQ8,hi everyone booth any by a Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Dillinger Escape Plan record dissociation dis dis wash bird this is the latest and final album apparently from one of metals most technical and intense bands there was a rumor that Dillinger was going to be dropping a record this year but fans did not expect that that release date would come with the news that this was going to be their last LP which is kind of surprising because it's not like the band has been at a low point right now I really loved their last album and I would be hard-pressed to pick what is their worst record among the four previous to that album maybe the band wanted to call it quits because they're crazy tensions keeping them from moving forward or they wanted to call it quits before the well ran dry and they started putting out mediocre records I don't know regardless The Dillinger Escape Plan goes down swinging on this album but I do think they use this record as an opportunity to have a little fun and indulge in a little bit of hero worship here and there there are some moments where they verge off into some really epic and grand progressive metal and there are lots of passages on this thing that feature these soaring alt metal vocals that sound a lot like the Deftones also all over this thing the band favors this brittle harsh distortion that just intensifies as the screams and the drums and the guitars just layer on top of each other sounds very much like a converge album and then there are the sudden instrumental shifts all over this record where all of a sudden the band is playing a little jazz or something like that definitely pulling from that mr. bungle playbook and I think there's a quite a bit of a Mike Patton vibe all over this album and then completely out of left field the band on the song fugue pulls together this blend of IDM as some jungle or drum and bass with live instrumentation mixed in there - it sounds like a mix of effects twin and square pusher of course with like a little bit of a metal twist and the song surrogate suddenly drifts into this ambient sound scape that doesn't last too long but still it is there and the band uses that as an opportunity to introduce some dreary er guitar passages and angsty vocals meanwhile the bits of spoken word on wanting not so much as to sound a little emo I'm not attributing that to any band in particular maybe even really the genre they just sow TiVo's fuck this is easily the dillinger escape plans most versatile album to date not only is the band as in the red as ever on this album but they are really just throwing all caution to the wind and toss and all the shit they can at the wall just kind of seeing what sticks it's almost like they had a musical bucket list to go into this record of everything they ever wanted to do on an album and they find a way to work it in but much of the album does sound like The Dillinger Escape Plan as usual the busy and intense math metal rhythms and riffs which often syncopate into these really intense grooves play that insanely fast speeds really abrasive sound creative guitar work crazy chord progressions shrill screams coming from greg which balance out really well with his more cleanly sung vocals the performance is on this thing especially vocally our animalistic is hell the band has this amazing talent for pulling together a metal recording that sounds like it has a real human touch it sounds organic but everything is so technical so flashy everything is executed with deadly precision and The Dillinger Escape Plan put enough of their usual sound on this album so that all of these randoms sort of unexpected ideas that they incorporate into this album they all tie together really nicely because if they didn't at least stick to their guns a little bit on this record I imagine this album could have just come off like a pile of mush like really directionless incoherent it almost does border on that sometimes especially on feud which as talented as the band had to be to pull that track together as versal as the band had to be to pull that track together it does not match aesthetically sonically emotionally anything with the rest of the album I will say Manufacturing discontent while it is a decent track it doesn't contain a lot of the creative twists and turns and surprises that a majority of the album does so that was kind of a bit of a dud for me I kind of feel the same way about the song apologies not included but on the final two tracks the band does try to alter the flow of the record alter the mood of the record a little bit and give us some more dreary low-key cuts to kind of end this album off on a sad note and I appreciate that even if there are some moments on nothing to forget that sound you know a little bit too much like Deftones worship to my ears still though the closer the most low-key cut on the album features these dramatic string sections this song has a refrain that no Dillinger Escape Plan fan is going to forget anytime soon finding a way to die alone finding a way to die alone also the previous track made reference to please let me be by myself I'm not exactly sure if these refrains are sort of in reference to the band's demise itself is some kind of metaphor not sure but given the context that we're dealing with here it makes sense I can't really come to any other conclusion that the band is at least trying to be a little meta at this point as they are bowing out overall I think this is a good record I think it's an admirable swan song I'm not as crazy about it as I am some previous albums of theirs because there are moments where I think their experiments do go a little awry and don't sound that fantastic as well as moments where it really does sound like they're beating a horse a little bit they're treading a little bit of water still the recording is great majority of the songs on this thing are great majority of the experiments on this thing go over well I think fans are going to like this thing and I think they're going to see it as an admirable finish too and hopefully even though The Dillinger Escape Plan is done these guys go on to be involved in some other projects that are equally as interesting are IP you know these guys had a great run all the admiration in the world and Godspeed I guess I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition you given this out but listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and um please don't cry instead leave an angry comment in the comment section all sorts of links next to my head subscribe other videos website you're the best Dillinger Escape Plan forever 
-hnhEGWxbOY,hi everyone Natha nee close tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new crying album fleeting the this album cover these guys are a purchase New York trio making their full-length debut on run for cover records last time I heard these guys it was on their get old second wind compilation that had dropped on the same label which was a little rough around the edges but the band had brought together an interesting blend of rock and pop styles and topped it with these chiptune flavored synthesizers that were pretty surprising now sadly on this new record over here they seem to have dropped those particular synth patches so anybody who is hardcore into these guys for maybe in a very cursory way having something to do with chiptune music you might be a little disappointed but in my opinion the band is sounding more diverse than ever and better than ever - on this LP there are elements of power pop on this record and very sweet melodic twee every once in a while some very intense and intricate and very technical rhythm guitars and heroic guitar solos pop into sort of color things shake things up experimental indie outfits like dear Huff seem to be a strong point of reference groups that they're odd they have sort of a weird streak to them and they're obviously an underground band with kind of a loaf i recording finish but they're very good strong muscular players with a ton of talent I think Japanese rock and pop is a reference point for these guys as well as the song origin sounds like the type of rock tune that you could hear sound tracking the intro of a really popular anime series where all the characters are running at top speed to a particular point as the credits roll in flash on the screen so again the production on this thing kind of lo-fi rough around the edges but the performances monstrously tight and impressive and on top of it the writing on these tracks is super detailed the band manages to pull off sounding endearingly amateurish and righteously virtuous at the same time like the syncopated drums and guitars that blast the album open on the opening track which give way to some solid versus accented by these really fast synth arpeggios there's just so much going on instrumentally for a band of this sound and they're super dynamic too like the way the band pulls off sounding cute and dreamy at the intro song will in the wash and then eventually turns full prog pop for a flash with impressive drum fills and layered vocals exploding into this brittle sort of lo-fi orgasm and over the bridge there's an awesome dueling guitar and since solo that sounds like something off of a Boston record the mood on these songs is super infectious too like so joyous so uplifting I mean the band is named crying crying tears of joy dude there's so much going on in these tracks but what really pulls a lot of these songs together the glue that holds them together in a lot of ways our Eliza Santos's vocals they're not as flashy as everything else sure and if you catch them live you might hear her singing off-key or just with the very odd inflection her vocals are modest to say the least but her very pretty easygoing melodies make sense of the instrumental mayhem swirling around her at a hundred miles an hour if her singing was as wild and as eccentric as everything else in the mix making heads or tails of crying's music would be kind of difficult and they're sharp pop appeal would go straight down the drain I do wish though that she didn't sound as emotionally flat as she does sometimes and that the chaotic mix on this record favored her voice a little bit more still as is I think the mix on this thing does get crying's musical points across at the midpoint on the record the band shows that they could effectively play it off very smooth and blissful without turning bland in the process on the song well and spring the song features all these beautiful wintery guitars and synthesizers the track children of the wind tour the back end of the record is a very beautiful ballad too but a majority of the second half of this record it's progressive power pop barnburners with tons of great guitar work like on the track revived or a sudden boost the song there was a door as one of the oddest tracks and the track listing features this funky Jackson 5 inspired intro eventually a jump the up riff which is complemented with these innocent arpeggios and Eliza sounding like she is rapping on the track a little bit again with her a very low level of emotion but are all the same rapping and what sounds like DJ cuts have made their way here and there in the track sort of bringing the band in and out of certain sections of the song or sort of accenting things a little bit every bar so and somehow this wild mix of pop and indie and synth music and even rap don't come together into this super corny cringy pile of crap now I should probably mention the band manages to pack all of these ideas into just 35 minutes and 10 tracks they're really not wearing on anybody's patience here and each song on this thing is so dense that you're going to want to listen to this record over and over and over just eat up every little detail I love albums that are hard-hitting and they're straightforward but they're also like an onion you know you can really just listen to them again and again and again and peel back another layer continuously I am really enjoying this record a lot these guys are easily one of the most versatile bands I've heard this year one of the best debut records I've heard this year and I think these guys have a lot of potential to in the future if they were to just clean up their sound a little bit more without compromising the rawness and that great performance that great tight in the moment performance style that they're bringing to the table not as many brittle guitars vocals that are a little more bright less shy are pumped up in the mix just a bit more I think all of these things could make a night-and-day difference for crying's next album and they aren't even huge changes and even right now as is crying has a lot going for them I highly recommend this album especially with the epic closure on this thing that I will not go into detail with because I don't want to spoil it for you guys try it out give it a listen I'm feeling a light decent 8 on this record transition have you given the sound boom a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the

wqBQhv6OUMg,hi everyone your local crack dealer 2016 here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new jeff rosen stock album worried pop punk prince formerly the frontman of bomb the music industry mr. jeff rosen stock coming through with a new record following up his impressive 2015 album we cool which was not just a catchy fun album of rock songs and punk rock songs it was an emotional roller coaster of self-deprecation diving into the everyday struggles of maladjusted Millennials who are high on drugs and low on opportunities it may be a little self-centered at times but on this record Jeff effectively turned into himself to express some universal truths that I think a lot of young people can relate to despite him being even four years older than me and and I'm barely a millennial and once again I worry Jeff is kind of dealing with his perpetual immaturity right on the opening track here he laments about his his loved ones and his friends getting older and moving places and and getting married and starting a family he sings about it as if he's like with puppy-dog eyes walking down Main Street shopping and then he just looks through the storefront window and he's like I'll never afford that oh never ever I can't get it out us back to 20 and it's not a problem it was just an analogy but okay um where was I but this isn't all about Jeff's woes about a you know sort of being a non-functional adults this album he also sort of searches outside of himself and turns his sights on the social chaos America has found itself in the middle of in this election year the song to be a ghost kicks off with these acoustic guitars and Jeff's singing about the unrest he sees in this new generation kind of being squandered on social media but then eventually their anger is sort of awoken as they realize they're tired of being out in the cold and how they're going to burn those in their homes and I think toward the beginning of the track there's a blatant reference to a lot of the police brutality that's been displayed in the news over the past few years and the Rainbows is this really rowdy piece of ska punk that i think is about a being evicted and just living broke I mean it's not really that long or that densely lyrical of a song and the thing is that this track and many other cuts in the second half of this album are all like these little vignettes that segue into one another really seamlessly and in a way all these tracks come together and tell a complete story or at least give a full picture of Jeff's thoughts and opinions on the economy the rich and our political class in America taking advantage of the poor the song bang on the door is like another extension of this tract where Jeff is sort of paranoid of this eviction I think as he sings about the neighborhood he lives in judging him for sleeping Lee and coming home drunk late at night this story continues on to the track planet luxury where Jeff is singing about the cycle of poverty materialism luxury and desire that a lot of the poorest Americans find themselves locked in just take a look at these lyrics right here they're actually a quite soul-crushing and the song hellhole is a dramatic moment in what is essentially this punk rock opus with numerous phases to it the song has a gentle opening that eventually leads to this powerful climax both lyrical and musical as Jeff is shouting at the top of his lungs we don't wanna live inside aho now there are moments where Jeff veers off from these topics like on the track while you're alive which is a song where you sings about wanting to tell someone who cares about wanting to tell someone who matters that they matter that he loves them while they're still around because it's his opinion that if people feel least wanted and least important while they're still alive but hey everybody loves you when when you're dead and toward the end of the track Jeff kind of gives us the philosophy of the title here singing that love is worried love is being concerned love is caring about somebody you worry because you're concerned you worry because you care and the Xplosive clothes are perfect sound whatever is exactly about how perfection is such a futile pursuit because perfection hey it takes too long so say the lyrics or rather perfect take so long because it doesn't exist what I love about a lot of these short tracks as Jeff comes through with not only catchy music but one liners on every single song he's making a great point on every single track here he really thought of what he wanted to say and then thought of the best way to phrase it so that he could condense it down and just a couple lines and just make an immense impact on the listener in the first half the record a lot of the tracks are a little more standalone they're not like in this series of very quick seamless cuts like the song I did something weird last night where Jeff in a story seems to make out with this girl and then he's worried the next day about her regretting it or not wanting to have anything to do with him or thinking he's weird and the song waved goodnight to me which I was sort of on the fence with when I first heard it sounds way better in the context of this record really fun song that sort of same self-deprecating humor coming through in the lyrics again some very fun guitar leads on this track as well a cool guitar solo it's just a really fun Punk song you know it's it's it's fun but it's got this element of a I don't know self-destruction to it that kind of is just lined into the seems so subtly that you don't necessarily have to eat into it but once you do you're Lagoo this is like kind of dark but it's kind of fun now the sound of this album I like it it's not quite as cleanly produced or as decked out as we coul was which I did think was pristine to a fault at some points kind of Bumi and over compressed as well occasionally still though on worry there are occasionally some nice touches of keys and horns and acoustic guitars and big gang background vocals little vocal harmony here and there and some glockenspiel too kind of twinkling along with some of the lead melodies hanging in the background sounded kind of silly the punk rock guitars and drums on the same sound pretty good though they are a little muddy they aren't quite as punchy I think they bleed into one another a little bit which has its pros and has its cons I mean the recording on this thing feels very live and in the moment like all these seamless tracks that I'm talking about on the record it feels almost as if the band sort of played that all in one go which is pretty exciting it's like sounding like you're at a Jeff Rosenstock show or something the con is that things are a little messy here and there like on the song I did something weird where it feels like he can barely keep up with the words that he's written for himself because he's singing as such fast speed and in such a I don't know a weird flow still though I think that amateurish nosov Jeff's voice is part of his appeal though it is certainly an acquired taste his singing is somewhat off-key occasionally very yell P but you can't deny that he really sells these tracks he gives them a lot of passion gives them a lot of emotion and the vocal melodies he writes are pretty good even if he can't sing them perfectly the only track that sort of stuck out to me as being weak was maybe a blast damaged days which had these very dreary underwhelming 90s alternative rock passages that I don't think Jeff really did too much justice but overall I think Jeff did it again on this album he did it once again in some respects I think the Salim is even more ambitious than we cool even if it is sonically a little Messier because not only do I like that the lyrics are a little more diverse topically but I think the band creatively and all these short songs together really nicely and in the lyrics I think Jeff effectively painted a very vivid picture of the cracks in the American dream that all too many people slipped through it's a rock album that is simultaneously fun angry socially aware sharply written undeniably smart at some points I would say and I think Jeff continues to be a very vibrant and interesting musical personality on this record - I'm feeling a decent of strong eight on this album tritscher church or transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next

uw4Ikdcjpgg,ah hi everyone Ethan emo tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new uh you know the new self-titled American football album this is the second full-length album from emo legends American football a band whose lone album which was released back in 1999 shaped up to be one of the most influential for the genre American football has never been one of the most famous emo bands out there they never quite hit the mainstream like groups such as save the day or Jimmy Eat World did but they did make some incredible music in the short amount of time that they were around which is why I was looking forward to this album I had actually caught them live after they reunited not too long after and the show was pretty good too so no reason to worry I say that but I'm also a big proponent of the idea that you either use it or you lose it and not to say that American football has been entirely inactive in between these two records Mike Kinsella frontman my Kinsella has released his share of solo albums in the interim but rebooting a band that had its creative peek back in 1999 is a lot like rebooting a computer that was the top of the line back in 1999 it's going to be slow going and could use some serious updating as well hence why comeback records can be so hit or miss and I think this new record over here lands on the miss side of that fence while I do like American footballs debut this album in in my eyes anyway proves that it was kind of a flash in the pan because American football have returned on this record only to sound like some no named easy listening soft rock band with twinkly guitars and forgettable songs and sure American football they never really had an aggressive streak in their music but their hypnotic and beautiful songs were always punctuated with some strong percussion we're usually pretty tight and nimble and detail-oriented like the band could certainly go aggressive that they wanted to and occasionally they would give you a taste of that power but they would always play a reserved and subtle which helped the song shine really brightly and still the band's record and their performances came off very raw and intimate but lb2 unfortunately is just a shell of its predecessor it has elements of the debut which is to be expected I mean the they were there when they were recording it so of course there are some aspects of it they're able to recreate here pretty nicely but things are off just enough to where it really derails the album and I'm not looking for American football to just literally repeat their debut record despite the fact that this is another self-titled album and I imagine the photo here features the house featured in the first album's cover it's just that the vibe is super different and that might have something to do with Mike having evolved as a songwriter for years outside of the context of American football and now trying to come back to the band and write songs in the same style but also kind of not what I do know is that the serene guitars and the easygoing grooves and the very clean recording come together into this noxious mix that sounds like a Coldplay album more than it does an American football album and that clear potent feeling of sadness from the last record has been replaced with just complacency there's very little on this record that feels worth getting emotionally invested in when the band picks up the pace a little bit the album is somewhat entertaining like on the track desire gets in the way which has some of the sharpest guitar leads on the entire record and the song I need a drink has this enjoyably woozy kind of groove to it that sort of trips over itself every few bars or so and the way the track builds into these tents but gentle rhythm guitars and the second half is pretty nice too it was a stroke of genius that reminded me of some of the great songwriting ideas from the band's first record you know it's not a complete and total fall from grace it seems like the band does their best to try to rekindle that flame and I think some fans are gonna see this album as an acceptable as an admirable return but let's not pretend that the band came back better than ever this thing fell so short of expectations and so much so to the point where I'm not holding my breath for another record if there even is one I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this one Tran given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry though you can't leave an angry comment in the comment section all sorts of links next to my head videos subscribe official website and that's it guys I hope you're doing good forever 
GX_PJ3lFjzc,hi everyone Bethany camp TM here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another episode of our every once in a while segment a kid good the game from Bad Camp where I go through a series of band camp albums that tickled by fancy some of the weirdest and strangest and most eye widening albums the upload it yourself platform has to offer we are going to start off this episode with a bit of a retraction of sorts not a one for this channel though one for my second channel where I regularly review memes and recently in a video I had reviewed a meme known as the nut shack a really horrible cancerous meme don't pay attention to it ignore it completely but in my reviewing of this meme and keep in mind these reviews are satirical they're not really supposed to be that informational but I digress I did not mention the good people over at the siva gunnar youtube channel which is a youtube channel that is a play a bit of a parody on the silva gunnar youtube channel where you can find authentic quality rips of video game music this however is a channel that looks like that channel in in every way shape and form you know aesthetically visually however you want to call it but sort of the twist here is that siva gunnar their authentic high quality audio rips of video game music from multiple platforms and multiple consoles over the years are actually like parody remixes of pieces of video game music usually incorporating like chunks of Soulja Boy songs or like The Flintstones theme that's pretty insane and I actually enjoy listening to a lot of them for a good laugh and I actually think it's pretty creative that and and you know believe me it's it's not like a you go to click on a Zelda song you're like oh this isn't a Zelda song because of immediately just sounds like some other crap what's so funny is that for the first like 10 or 30 seconds or so it sounds exactly like the music you're going to hear this sounds exactly music you want to hear but then all of a sudden like the Flintstones theme has work perfect within the chord progression of whatever song you wanted to you in you're like wow not only does this work but I'm not listening to what I want and I feel like I'm going insane there's also a great rip on that YouTube channel where it's The Simpsons theme worked into the the Mega Man 2 repulsion it's actually pretty powerful now these guys they're not just on YouTube fortunately their YouTube channel is now defunct they're not sort of putting out content anymore on that YouTube channel from what I understand but they look nice where a lot of this stuff that was on their YouTube channel and I imagine stuff that wasn't on there has sort of matriculated over on the band camp platform how could they not be on Bandcamp and upload some of this pure gold I want to recommend to you guys this five nights at Freddy's original soundtrack which of course is not the five nights at Freddy's original soundtrack at all featuring many things that are not the five nights at Freddy's original soundtrack one thing that stuck out to me the most and is absolutely hilarious is like this a 8-bit NES quality remix of the nut shack theme actually quite a few variations of the nut shakthi - I missed it so I do want to recommend that but I also want to recommend this PC master Epps album that they have on their Bandcamp page which is pretty extensive in its coverage of a lot of the stuff you hear featured on this YouTube channel a lot of the stuff that is known as sort of a Siva gunner sort of sound to see we got our joke a see we're going to rip there's 150 tracks on this thing it's absolutely nuts I had no idea what's going on no idea what's going on Simpsons rage [Music] okay you hear you hear how it's working okay you're listening to something else you think you're hearing a chunk of video game music and then all of a sudden The Simpsons theme starts working it it's really nice it's really weird it's really nerdy I have no idea how this became a thing on the Internet to the point where there's such an incredibly large amount of participation in the gag that these have go that they got that these guys have going it's absolutely amazing and finally on this same Bandcamp page I want to recommend the album oh I smoke weed I'm Bob Dylan which is an amazing set of covers and other songs original tracks I think and covers of tracks that have nothing to do with Bob Dylan performed by a pinkie Oates one member of give a sun-earth Gil Vicente Siva gunner however you want to say it and on these tracks he is doing this really um I don't know let's say it's let's say it's an impression of Bob Dylan that isn't exactly worthy of a man who just just won a Nobel Prize let's just put it that way I personally love this cover of the I play pokemon go song that's that's that's become a huge meme on the internet that's one of my favorites this is Miss Bob Dylan Wow when did he find the time to to record this this one says the Flintstones theme I'm morbidly curious that's pretty hot B though I will say it's a hot beat check out that give a center link it's down there in the description you could check out their Bandcamp listen to those albums let's move on to UM 21 layers with the album blurry Shrek over here this is a very very special album on Bandcamp it is a mashup album which you can see from the cover over here is a picture the front cover to a 20-pot twenty one pilots blurry face but there are some Shrek faces in there and of course the reason for that is is I think every single track on this record is is mixed with a Smash Mouth all-star [Music] that's good because I hate that twenty one pilots song so I'm glad that they did that the judge is Shrek is the title of this next track great wonderful relatively straightforward concept over here guys there's there's really no uh uh there's no there's no hiding exactly what the band is is or the artist is trying to do here artist that's not in tune or tempo but they don't seem to care why why Wow so yeah there you go blurry Shrek really no need to explain it any further than that uh brought to us by the the 21 layers people or cabs CA BZ on Bandcamp that link is down there in the description if you want to drive yourself insane this next one is from Canada Montreal Canada they go by the name of I want to say this correctly the Alec clan also m-- the prayers a coon ears is the name of the record I'm not even going to pretend to know how to pronounce it and these guys were actually pretty eclectic and reputable and cool a bilingual hip-hop outfit not only are their instrumentals pretty um pretty intricate and smooth and jazzy and sweet to the ear and classy but to the English French sort of dynamic of the lyrics on these songs actually come together really well it's cool to sort of hear some decent bilingual hip-hop coming out especially of Canada of all places let's give a one track a shot see you know not every album on this thing is a meme not every album on this thing is like a you know like a band camp just pooping in your ear pooping in your ears not every album on the segment is like that it's dark it's Moody foody start fire that was the fifth track on this album over here in case you're curious this one humble french-canadians okay so I will say my bad I have listened to a few tracks off of this I thought this is like more of a jazzy thing not that's a bad thing I thought there's more of a jazz rap thing or maybe there's a track on here that sort of slipped my memory that is more in that vibe but these sort of seem to have like you know more of a track banger sort of a vibe to it we're just totally fine like the tracks I'm hearing right now are really fun it's grimy it's nocturnal it's French but I don't know what else to say guys it's it seems like a pretty good record and the the cover is actually pretty cool to imagine sort of features all the members of the group over here seems like a pretty diverse smattering of Bros all coming together to make this bilingual hip hop over here god damn that B was fire a fucking beat was fire on fifth track Drake get these guys on a record fuck moving on this next project goes by the name of nutritious variety for your for your amphibian pet this is one of those fun projects on a band camp that the name of the album give thanks to the Lord for he is good nice religious title who doesn't like that this album over here it's it's like one of those records you find on on band camper it's like the entire internet just projectile-vomited into this spot their samples of me on here there are samples of a variety different things on here and some of its like some crazy electronic stuff some of its like some crazy loud distorted guitar stuff I'm really not sure what to make of a lot of it it's a quite jarring confusing and strange I guess is how well how I'll put it got this break me here not a break beat but bustling beat some weird gurgles sit what was that I don't know [Music] yes I just again I don't I don't know this next track is called what was any of that we don't know we'll never know this next track is called turtle sex power violence keep in mind every single song on this thing with the exception of just a few tracks is one minute and nine seconds yes one minute and nine seconds very specific but there you go is the fact that is one minute in nine seconds that's 69 seconds is that is that like a sex thing that a sexual reference is is this dirty this this next song is called donkey dad 666 it's a hit [Music] Smash Mouth entire internet just throwing up into one place that's essentially what this is um and hey you know print god bless it god bless it that's all I got to say next this band on wharf cat records the good people of worth cat records check them out the band's name is macula dog and the album is titled why do you look like your dog now these guys have some pretty interesting tags over here and you know very a very in-depth description they are a four-person electronic duo a four-person electronic duo a duo for people making music that is just as much pop as the performers are human yeah it's unclear it certainly is guys but it says experimental noise rock and roll and one name in the tag is a Devo and I do love me some Devo these guys certainly do seem to know how to dress quite well in the our front cover over here I do like a band that puts in effort comes up with a crazy costume that's usually pretty fun and this music over here is definitely experimental it does have elements of Devo it is kind of herky-jerky and nerdy it is quite synthetic as well but it III don't I really don't know what else to say about it beyond that it is an odd record and I will just sort of let the song new boys club kind of speak for itself [Music] [Music] it reminds me of it reminds me of if Devo tried to make a record with black dice or something like that like the since and the tones are all like really watery and smudgy and kooky and colorful and psychedelic kaleidoscopic and weird there are some vocals worked in there but they're kind of just as smudgy as everything else and the grooves the beats are really odd man this track is titled anvils of love [Music] it as you can hear it is quite strange and overwhelming I like that about it it makes it cool it makes it fun it makes it intriguing maybe it's like a little tube kooky for my tastes personally but it is pretty wild you know it is pretty wild these guys definitely are off-the-wall and it does make me want to listen to it a little more later when I'm you know not shooting this video in or anything or you know not like kind of giving it a first taste so that I can kind of have a more raw reaction for this video over here and finally I want to end off with a armor by trial of the golden witch which is a little sort of like bedroom wrap project a masterminded or at least partially masterminded by our good friend digi bro who is a fellow youtuber who I've had on my podcast which is a not doing too well it's on life-support and he reviews the a man a the a man died on his YouTube channel he reviews the a man a Chinese cartoons as they call and although as they call them the MA and he has this edgy little like rap project over here with like growly vocals and weird beats and it's a quite strange trooping then you can't protect it I don't believe a thing you said bitching on my head ditching contemplate shit don't mention politics oh love it yeah thank you dizzy bro thank you dude you're you're dropping some you're dropping some hot some hot bars there so your your your come through with some serious swagger that I'm curious about the fifth track over here which is titled I'm not gonna say hey let's just give it a shot hey coming through with his uh Danny Brown flow here anything a little bit take away the kids um okay uh it's obviously in some respects it's uh like the angriest nerd rap I've ever heard it's like it's it's a particular kind of cringe it's like you know it's like a spicy cringe you know it's not just like a boring bland it's not your average cringe you know it's it's super spicy and it's almost like conscious of its cringing us in a way that that certainly works against it but it's so admirably energetic and raw I can't help but be pulled in by it a little bit and want to listen to it more because it just seems so fucking wild and off-the-wall that I'm curious as to where it's going to go next so so it has that going for it which i think is a lot that's a lot to have going for it and dizzy bro gotta gotta give the guy credit he see he seems to have flow he seems to have afloat you know who knows his way around the beat while you're not pursuing it I've had some privileges through seeing all these kids ain't shit but I built this all in a table a box of straps of a cup top bat-burgers lighter you can stop the generator bananers it's a mercy you ain't makin faces out of all these okay okay all right like I just said he has a flow you know you can't deny the dude's flow he's flowing better than like most amateur rappers who hit me up on Twitter hey man you a human mixtape maybe the big K definitely flowing way better than those dudes that's that's good to be it for this insane episode of uh it

mef_vPjiRU4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new no worries album yes loud no worries is a collaborative duo featuring singer-songwriter Anderson Pak and producer knowledge who had a pretty decent EP come out lately late last year like just on the border of 2016 which was a pretty cool blend of hip hop and soul although there weren't that many tracks on this thing and they felt kind of rough and loose in structure so that they didn't really add up too much for me other than just like a very sweet Pleasant vibe but now that the whole record is out I think the collaboration has proven itself to be pretty fruitful what about us Anthony is our collaboration fruity info first let me start by saying that Stones Throw Records perfect label for this album not only because of knowledge is very jazzy textured production I know he's dropped music on the label before but the thing is that sound it really was within the wheelhouse of this label you can tell that his music directly descends from artists like mad lib and J Dilla almost to a fault though because his last record in my opinion really Wirtz influences on its sleeve but teaming up with Anderson PAC on this thing they really create a vibe sound all their own now Anderson PAC I really liked his last album I wasn't crazy for it wasn't head over heels for it I thought it was a little overly long and and his versatility almost worked against him to the point where he was doing so many things on this record he just couldn't focus or concentrate on one single idea for too long yes allowed however comes off way more focused and cohesive and sexy God is it sexy and raunchy and melodic and hypnotic although a lot of the tracks on this thing they follow a pretty loose structure they almost feel like extended odds and ends in a way or just short musical moments that have been looped and stretched out to the point where they feel like full songs or maybe half songs which is why as an EP these tracks didn't really make too much sense to me but as an album even though a lot of the tracks on this thing don't really have strong endings or all that much structure to them they do still reinforce one another's vibe pretty well the sensuality adds up the charisma adds up the swagger adds up in a way this thing is like neo Souls answer to mad villainy there are loads of weird obscure vocal snippets throughout this thing which are used to set the tone of a track or enhance the narrative or even just be funny like on intro cut on this thing or on the closer you which involves a weird long story which at one point features flammable piss for real flame flammable piss a lot of the beats on this thing are pretty simple it's a lot of repetitive jazzy soulful loops not a whole lot of change ups but I guess this does leave space very open space for Anderson PAC to deliver these incredible vocal performances whether it be some very funny or just entertaining spoken word some silky vocal harmonies and of course that fiery raspy passionate lead vocal that you probably already know by now given his past features given his past records and there are lots of highlights in the tracklist the song swayed and linked up even though these tracks precede the release of this album they fit snugly within the tracklist and they still sound great song wings is this low-key alluring ballad where Anderson hangs in his lower register quite a bit and while the music is sweet the lyrics are pretty salty pretty bitter one moment where he's like demanding that this girl get her together another moment on this record where he is singing about how this girl she's a nasty girl and if he didn't tell her someone else would have let's just say the lyrics on this thing feel like they come from an era of soul where a James Brown's it's a man's man's man's world was popular but way nastier and meaner and actually sexier too so much though that it almost doesn't feel right listening to this thing and just not having sex while it's on especially when songs like best one are on which is specifically about a relationship where these two are loving and they're like what they have together is just going to completely dissolve into thin air tomorrow the smooth 80s R&B groove of the song scared money the hypnotic groove and hook on just lack this is a fantastic highlight to the intro on the song get bigger is amazing as well listen there are a lot of moments on this album that I think are really good but at the end of the day they're kinda just moments nothing really feels as developed as it could be as finely tuned as it could be these highlight tracks kind of stand shoulder to shoulder with filler cuts in the track lifting - they really don't feel that much different in terms of the way they're structured the only way I'm able to really decipher that they're filler cuts is that Andersson delivers a less interesting vocal performance on the record or the song is mostly dominated by a vocal snippet or a sample of some sort like on Cutlass or khadija or can't stop the writing on this thing is just kind of basic but I will say that doesn't necessarily ruin the entire album because knowledge and Andersen have so much raw talent together in this collaboration that they can fuel an album just on this idea of capturing lightning in a bottle even though in a lot of ways this album feels like a free-flowing collaboration with no limitations they came through with more highlights than lowlights I just wish the two of them had incorporated a bit more structure into these tracks and cut the tracklist down to the best songs instead of giving us just $19 aft s-- feeling a light - decent seven on this record transition what did you think of this no worries album did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best one should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry but feel free to leave a comment lots of stuff next to my head video subscribe website click on it hope you're well stay hydrated bye [Music] 
vGVz09KdsAA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly track roundup the best and worst tracks of the week where I make a series of suggestions and uh suggestions to try out record suggestions to avoid new records singles that have come out over the past week they are all linked down there in the description along with at the top of the description our Amazon Associates link if you live in the US and you click on that link anything you buy on Amazon we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price supports the segment all right guys let's get into the worst tracks of the week as usual we have a couple worst tracks of the week over here I have to give it to the new tough low track true disaster not the worst track of the week but but but but but definitely one of the worst tracks of the week Tablo continues to drop these painfully generic top 40 pop songs I have no clue how these tracks continue to get a pass there's nothing interesting or special about them moving on from there maroon 5 with don't want to know maroon 5 comes out with a boring radio single with a super low-key vocal performance as well as instrumental doesn't even sound like a band at this point just sounds like Adam Levine and a producer working on this track and the worst thing about this cut is that Kendrick Lamar has this awful bland uninteresting feature on the track Kendrick you make some of the best hip-hop records in the game right now you don't need to be on a crummy boring maroon 5 song does not do anything to enhance your career nobody who's a marine 5 fan wants to hear to pimp a butterfly I'm sorry dude just like just don't moving on from there maybe this isn't one of the worst tracks of the week I mean it's certainly not pleasant to the ear but it is funny I have to give it to him that the Tim Heidecker for his his new Bob Dylan parody song talking Nobel Prize because Bob Dylan was just like given the Nobel Prize for Literature or whatever because his lyrics are quite incredible but still Tim sort of makes some funny lyrical observations about I don't know maybe not how Bob Dylan feels now but probably how he would feel back in the day Bob Dylan probably you know back in the sixties or the 70s would have most likely had the attitude like screw the new bill prize I don't want that prize you know he would have been like you know I don't want the prizes establishment and so on and so forth so Tim very much things from that perspective it's not exactly an enjoyable listen because Tim's a Bob Dylan impersonation really really could kind of use some work but this is a one of at least a couple Bob Dylan impression songs that he's come out with that uh they're pretty funny so it isn't one of the better tracks of the week but it you'll at least get a laugh out of it it is a novelty track it's it's somewhat entertaining moving on from there the new Avenged Sevenfold track the stage is a perfect reminder of why I never listen to Avenged Sevenfold just really overproduced overly theatrical and dramatic heavy-metal music with just production that does not really complement this style of metal and I have to give the worst track of the week over 2a McLemore with the song drug dealer where he really tries to make the case for white suburbia 'he's prescription drug problem and how we should all cry about it and while I do understand drug addiction it is a problem I just hate the fact that McLemore has to try to make people cry with every song asks try to get people really emotional with every song this is why people don't like white people in 2016 songs like this and I'm just going to say I'm just going to put it like that call me Chuck if you want to call me a kook but this song people don't like white people this is why so you just just cut it out moving on we're going to get into the tracks that I don't think we're terrible I didn't think we're amazing but uh I think that you guys should check them out if you're into these artists if you're into these genres want to give a shout out to riff raff on the song back from the dead with Skepta not bad mixtape riff raff is back on this cut you know it's not a super commercial or super clean cut or anything like that some of his bars are pretty entertaining the B is very Spacey and mysterious and eerie and actually like the hook quite the song hook on this track I believe his next mixtape might be like halloween-themed or something I'm not totally sure but I am digging this track a little yadi and Gucci Mane with Bentley coupe amazing banger amazing banger the sort of amazing banger you know it's a the recording is kind of off it sounds a little sloppy and messy it's like very demo quality but gucci mane and little gotti at least give like an energetic performance on the cut it's a new track out from the good people over at PC music dreadfully boring song not really sure what PC music is doing right now seemed like they had a really bold and interesting and unique sound not too long ago and now the latest couple of singles that they dropped have been way less than interesting you know it's not the worst thing in the world but I'm just kind of wondering where that fun bubblegum colorful very eccentric and bubbly PC music that you know some of whose material I have enjoyed in the past has disappeared too because this track is not really representative of that cakes the killa has a new track out new phone who dis actually at the lyrics on this track quite a bit the music video is fantastic though the recording is kind of off it's sort of muddy and it's demo quality it doesn't hit as hard as I wish it could have but still I do think it's a fun little song concept the cakes the kill has pulled together here and regardless I am looking forward to whenever he drops his next mixtape Pusha T with circles featuring ty dolla sign and designer painfully boring song like it's it's tolerable but why is Pusha T coming out with tracks this drab and designer absolutely brings nothing to this song he is a boring future just don't let him on your song Pusha it's not a good idea but he's a part of the good music crews so I'm sure that kind of gets forced down his throat in a way but whatever and finally we're going to finish off with Cloud Nothings with modern act literally nothing to say about this Cloud Nothings track it's it's I don't know I mean it's it's certainly not as rough around the edges to the point where it's a Intolerable like a lot of the material off their last record but it doesn't really have the ferocity or the sharp songwriting of the album that preceded that one I don't know it just kind of seemed like a very middle of the road indie rock track with nothing special about it I'm kind of hoping that Cloud Nothings proved themselves to be a little more I don't know less forgettable with whatever songs are going to be coming down the pipe after this one but let's finish off with my favorite tracks of the week the best tracks of the week excuse me we're going to give it to worm rot with the song roots these are these guys are fantastic grindcore outfit this song over here not the usual like kind of primal thrash and bash that I've expected from worm rot this track actually had kind of a very dark and menacing chord progression that stuck out to me a lot and I'm pretty excited to listen to the band's new album voices which is out now I believe then we have Clarence clarity with the song shame which is a part of the new EP he has dropped titled same which I haven't looked into deeply I've listened to a few songs from it I believe it's the same song five times I'm not totally sure I'm sure though that you know because he is as conceptual as he is maybe they're like slight variations among each of these tracks that's most likely the case and I just haven't Dogen I just have a douve into these tracks yet to sort of eat up with those fine changes of detail are and even if they're art it certainly would be like you know totally up Clarence clarity's alley to just like upload the same song five times and put it on the same EP but still this track over here that he has recorded is the same sort of weird eccentric out there fringe riding pop and R&B that he's been producing up until this point is pretty wild it's dense it's noisy it's colorful it's overwhelming it's kaleidoscopic I really did what this guy does and I'm hoping for a new album at some point next year moving on rich chigga the DAT stick remix with Ghostface Killah and puia the music video on this thing pretty questionable especially with the CGI Ghostface Killah that was pretty corny but having said that this is a pretty good remix this is pretty good remix and it's awesome that you know poo yeas get a little shine on this track I'm not a huge fan of the I'm not like crazy as music or anything but as cool these coming up a little bit and for rich chigga to get an endorsement like Ghostface Killah is pretty fantastic like for an old head to just feel like you know what this dude I'll hop on this dudes track and Ghostface he doesn't just hop on anybody's track okay you know you could you could say what you want about Ghostface he doesn't just hop on anybody's track a big crate with free agent apparently Big KRIT is off Def Jam right now he is floating out there roundabout he's independent once again hopefully that means a high quality mixtape in the future because in my opinion his commercial albums just have not been cutting it I hope he ends up working with a label that supports him a little bit more maybe a I don't know if Def Jam in any way was a sort of hampering his creative output in any sort of way hopefully just ends up in a better place that's that's all I can say really and I'm just excited to hear what he's doing in the future because this new little freestyle he has over here pretty fiery pretty aggressive pretty angry he seems like he's not giving up he still sounds hungry so I'm still looking forward to good material from Big KRIT in the future no worries with get bigger I'm not going to say too much about this track just going to recommend this song because I'm going to be reviewing the album that this track comes from very soon it's out early on Apple music so I've been listening to it so I'm going to review that very soon but Anderson pack and knowledge on this track and many other tracks on this album very good blend of hip hop and soul on this cut Smita Lee who I believe is like the lead singer of the band foxing I've been told I could be wrong on that I've been told that this is foxing related lead singer foxing coming through with like a homespun bedroom piece of indie pop indie rock with this song no one likes you and it's a hilarious track really funny chorus on this track the whole now unlike the other thing is is pretty funny pretty sharp pretty witty and I don't know I mean I've never really been a foxing fan but uh I'm gonna hopefully dive into this project further and hopefully I just hear more songs that I like that's all I can really cross my fingers for and finally maybe my favorite track of the week uh the boys in Fox's in our back they have released a song that in my opinion really redeems them from so much of the mediocre badly performed badly written and badly a recorded material off their last record and star power if that is even the title I try to erase that album from my memory to be honest and this track is super orchestral it's dramatic it sort of has that same a DD compositional aspect to it that so many of the tracks did from take the kids off Broadway that I loved and you know they're elements of stones on this thing of Bowie and I like that there's an element of satire that there's an element of political commentary to what the band is singing in this song - it's just so grand it's just so huge and no moment sounds like any other moment on the track they're always changing it's always evolving it's always different and it's really grand it's really powerful now you can say what you say about the vocals they are a little shaky but I think the passion the emotion is at least there to kind of sell the track yeah I mean I'm really looking forward to what Fox is going to do given that this song is so incredible it sounds like something that they were doing early on but given higher production value given more instrumentation given more love given more drama give more attention given more power so really for me if I had to pick a track of the week it's it's most likely this fox ISM track and that's how I'm going to end it guys thank you for watching again these have been the tracks of the week all of them are linked down there in the description if you want to hear any of them or at least referenced down there in the description and the amazon associates link is down there as well if you want to choose to support this segment and I appreciate you guys watching hopefully I turn you on to some stuff that you guys are interested in hopefully it turned you on to some stuff that you guys didn't know about that you end up enjoying and I hope you are having a good week and and that the forthcoming week for you enjoyable edge will you're the best forever 
QOqgk-j-pNI,ah hey everyone Antoine Phan Tuan here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our monthly bimonthly semi semi mmmm sometimes vinyl update where I go through some of the records that have recently made it into this collection right here which you can see a huge video playlist for down in the description now it's been a while since I've done one of these and this vinyl update here isn't going to be I guess probably as in-depth as far as the music I'm talking about here partially because my amp is broken right now unfortunately and as a result I care when we listen to to these records but I still did get them and I am familiar with at least some of them more I'm just going to talk about you know sort of the packaging and what I'm curious about with these records and what I'm sort of expecting and what I'm hoping to hear so again I apologize for that but my birthday is coming up so I think you know I will either splurge or you know get together with a buddy and or maybe sort of drop some hints just but hey hey I need a a whole amp um we'll see you know but but it'll get fixed soon you know I'm not I'm not going to go too long without being able to play my records over here guys not going to go too long okay and not not just gonna deprive myself my my right to listen to my own records but uh can we go so I picked this one up recently and hoping to have a fun a lot of fun listening to this it's a single a GG Allin single and it's called it's not the money it's the mission and it's got this sweet little picture of a little illustration of GG on the front for some reason he has like two hands and what like one hand is coming out of the other one arm is coming out of the the main arm and one has a knife and one has a microphone and it says on the back that this is a this is like a whole live performance or something GG Allin and the disappointments live at SUNY Purchase in 1989 that must have been a fun show to be at and we have intro the outlaw scum song which I love dope money die when you die love that track abuse myself I want to die and dead flowers so there's there's some good tracks on here and is this again are these just cuts of the of the performances the whole thing thanks to the says no thanks to the SUNY campus police who probably didn't appreciate GG Allen's wonderful little stage show that he typically puts on and it looks like how did you G Allen and the disappointments come to play at Art College in New York State so there's like a whole story as to how this whole thing went down so that'll be pretty interesting to a read up on as I am giving a listen to this there what what is obviously a pretty short performance I guess so that'll be pretty interesting so there you go GG Allin single right there 7-inch rather it's not the money it's the mission the title probably alludes to maybe they went nuts and they didn't get paid or something this next record I did get a chance to listen to an actually a review der recently to it is a new street sex record and position if you're looking for something noisy intense heavy it's like some serious like noise samples industrial rock punk oh and it's it's not super abstract or anything like that I mean it is experimental it is odd it is you know challenging but you know it is very visceral record - it's not some like weird art piece or anything like that or some overly conceptual record you know it does kick ass it does you know take some names and so here we go you know it's just the front cover back cover over here which I find to be pretty pretty disturbing the the man depicted on the front sort of being comforted by this uh naked woman Grim Reaper figure on the back we have a lyric sheet on the record not we have we have a lyric sheet over here which came with the record which I have not read too deeply into yet we have sort of more imagery from sort of the story being told here this man on the front cover holding a gun looking at his sleeping wife and baby pretty messed up and here we go on the back he's he's screaming he's going to hell 17 miles ah and actually this thing came with a short story as well it's like a four page short story and position there's page one there's page 2 this case there's page four which I've read a quarter of and that's it's pretty dark so I'm planning on giving it another listen you know when I when I listen to this thing that's when I realized my amp was busted because it only plays out a one channel now and the other channels like kind of messed up so right now I'm like kind of a you know listening uh a lot of headphones and stuff so here we go it's kind of like a clear and somewhat milky but but you know very much a clear clear pressing and there we go that is the the whole package that a the fleN sir put together for this record and also it comes with a a download card and stuff like that they'll probably shoot you some stickers as well if you order from them so I mean if you like this record it's not a bad package guys you know it's like you definitely get a little bang for your buck you know it's I mean it's not like a gatefold or anything not that gay folds of the gold standard but you know you get like this book you get this short story you get the lyric sheet you know it's a colored pressing it's not just the standard black vinyl so you know definitely scope that vinyl package if you get the get the chance to and you enjoyed that Street sex album I am literally opening this album right now on camera I'm literally opening it right now something that I probably would have done before but again amp broken have not played this yet but we have Regina Spektor's new record remember us to life so it's a gatefold I'm gonna be opening it for the first time with you guys whoa Regina you look beautiful you look beautiful in this dress you're like the reverse of Little Red Riding Hood with the black code there's the roses and you're looking up at the sky and you're in the snow you're you're like a beautiful flower girl you're like looking so lovely an elegant and dramatic and dramatic so there you go that's a nice image for the UH for the front there she's looking wonderful and it's a double LP two here we have oh cool lyric sheet I do like the lyrics on this record although you know they're kind of a you know easy to read the ease of this listen to and sort of tell it's going on but you know additional lyric sheet is nice what is going on here what huh this is like some kind of weird like Photoshop of Regina Spektor looking like a caterpillar or something Regina what are you doing so much less elegant than the than the gatefold over here Wow stunning beautiful gorgeous my heart is taken and over here you're you're a caterpillar or maybe this is sort of you know this is her this is a this is just you know her her this is her final form is what I'm saying she evolves into this you know over here she's just The Very Hungry Caterpillar I guess um doesn't seem like there's anything to flash you out there record itself you know nice labeling you know the big fat title over there the record looks great I trust that it will sound good as well if it doesn't you guys will be hearing from my lawyer okay he'll send you a letter and he'll say Anthony Fantana is unhappy with his pressing of your album and what I'm really happy about with this record is that it comes with the bonus tracks and I thought the bonus tracks to the album we're super super good you know just as good as the tracks from the album itself which is typically not the case so I was actually pretty hyped about that so Reena Spector remember us to life nice a nice gatefold package shout out to Regina Spektor follow me back on Twitter yo alright um this next handful of records comes from a record show that I went to recently not usually um you know sort of where I go to pick up records although I don't know why I did this there are a couple records that were like new at the record show that I didn't have yet that I was just like hey I should I should probably have those because I really like these records and I'm not seeing like older copies of them sitting around or if I were to see older copies of them sitting around it would probably charge me like 60 or 70 dollars for them and that's the thing you know going to a record show you're probably going to see a lot of amazing albums that you really want but they're like original pressings so you know you're gonna pay like 60 70 80 dollars so that's tough but one of these records I picked up was a GI from the germs one of the best hardcore punk bands in my opinion although they were short-lived these are some really dirty wild Punk recordings definitely check these guys out if you have not heard of the germs and you consider yourself to be a fan of punk music and what I also saw on the label here that was pretty excited about was that we have a oh wow Wow that is a cool blue splatter I knew it was gonna be blue but I was like what's that looks awesome holy that looks cool what what that is some art what there's some good-looking blue splatter vinyl what what doesn't seem to be a download card or anything like that but um I already own a digital copy of this record so but I'm yet to own it on vinyl after all these years so great germs gie great great also may I say these guys started the to be continued yes roundabout meme before anybody else did okay so you know they're almost the originators of it we have the New York Dolls amazing proto-punk band okay please listen to these guys again classic band uh you know predated the whole Punk thing obviously hugely influenced by the whole glam movement obviously you know gender bending over here obviously cross-dressing you know that was like their whole thing but you know just like some really good crazy catchy rock-and-roll on this record personality crisis amazing song looking for a kiss amazing song and pills amazing song if you had to try out if you had to try three tracks off of this record I recommend those three you know really forward-thinking rock record you know again precursor to punk music this is just kind of like a single you know sleeve record over here I'm not expecting too much other than you know this type of music that came out in this time you want to hear it on vinyl vinyl is its final form vinyl is you know the format it was originally intended to be on so I'm pretty excited to give a listen to this record um nothing too flashy about the album but it does feel heavy it is like a heavy pressing you know it's not like too thin or anything like that so it's got some good nice good weight to it so I'm looking forward to that sound and real nice so moving on from the New York Dolls over here shout-out to the New York Dolls here are some you know other albums that I grabbed that were not pre-sealed not brand new records this is and I'm looking forward to listening to this and again I ant broken can't say too much about these records over here other than what I've heard of them online since I don't own them yet and I just own them now um the Fugs first album some crazy freaky New York experimental full precursor to Punk precursor to folk punk on this thing they ended up I think retitling this I don't know if this is the retitle or if they ended up retitling it to the really long crazy title that I know their first album has now when I go look it up online and it says recorded in April and July of 1965 1965 guys but what's so funny is that if you look at this cover they look like hipsters from 2016 so not not not much has changed not much has changed guys not much has changed um that they really do they they really  do so you know but whatever this is well has a really heavy pressing to it thusly a little beat up but the record itself is an amazingly pristine and clean condition oh my god it's nice it's an this thing is older than me and it's holding up way better guys I look like trash and you know I'm only 22 I'm only 22 guys and I like total trash meanwhile this this is pushing what 60 50 I can't count I could count when I was younger when I was less messed up but nowadays forget about it I'm a wreck and it was just $15 so so what are you gonna do is nice it was nice ah so there you go first first bugs album I'm pretty happy with that a deep purple Machinehead looking forward to giving this thing a listen looking forward to given this classic a bit more bit more personal time yeah again I can't really say too much about the the album itself because I have not experienced this vinyl copy but you know it's in good condition got a nice gatefold over here pretty psyched to give this thing a shot looks like I'm not like deriving any sort of additional information from the sleeve over here that I could rally over to you but you know Warner Brothers Records nice little label over here and you know pretty standard standard weight so you know nothing uh nothing too crazy going on you know you can see just like a little bit of like discoloration from the age of the record on the inner sleeve and you know which is totally fine but it's just funny that you know that that is like really in a lot of ways this album's only sign of wear because a lot of is just like you know it's just been taken so well care of so you know and that's another thing it's like if you go to a record show you're gonna run into some booths you're gonna run some people who you know you're going to find some older pressings you're gonna find some older records you know you're gonna find those albums that they're like hey but it's it's $60 $50 so some of them will you know give me give you a bargain and sort of you know drop the price down a little bit they'll haggle um but a lot of those guys they take good care of their you know so it's and and you know you could check it right in front of them so um you know with permission of course so you know you do you do get what you pay for a lot of the time this is a Dylan record I'm yet to add to my collection so I was so happy I found it for a good price so that I could you know sort of complete those classic years we have Bob Dylan's blood on the tracks and again not too much to say Columbia Records nice little back there like blood red sleeve very dramatic Bobby very dramatic sort of that standard red comb that beautiful standard red Columbia label record is clean as hell it's almost such that it's so shiny I could see myself and I could just like groom myself in this record and I would I wouldn't miss a spot shaving or cutting my hair so beautiful gorgeous happy that's in my collection go Bob Dylan go you're the man man you're the man pop that in there come on Beverly pop it pop it um these next to our records that I've been meaning to add to my collection as well I have I think their first record and I have fear of music so now I've got Talking Heads speaking in tongues and I've got more songs about buildings and food got these four like you know they like took $10 off my price because I bought both of them together so I'm finally happy to have these two Talking Heads records too so now it's like all those amazing classic Talking Heads albums I have them I have them and oh my god you know what I was so excited okay it's good it's great get off it hair there's a hair on it there's a hair on it it's yes it's great I thought I was so excited to get these I saw and I was like aah and I didn't even open the record up to check it and it's just like dawning on me now don't do it Anthony does guys don't do it Anthony does he's messed up he's barely got his life together I didn't even check the record I was so excited I saw these two albums together and they were for a decent price and the guy took $10 off he was a nice man and I think he might have had a like a $60 copy of a raincoats record that I really wanted and I said hey if I had extra money I'd get that and he says oh I take credit and I said you know I have a certain money amount of money in my pocket for a reason sir you know that and and he said yes I do understand that's how all of this started this is that all my records that's how all of this started so dodged a bullet there no I'm kidding you know it's probably what I'll end up doing when I'm old and and you guys decide not to watch me anymore talking heads speaking in tongues sire records seems like there's a couple fingerprints on it but nothing that I can't like you know rub out pretty easily nothing that I can't like buff out pretty easily yep great condition just a few fingerprints buff those out real quick and this thing that we play in like-new so yeah the the sleeve itself is a little worn as well but cannot complain considering that now my little Talking Heads completion for me anyway you know I know that they have come out with other records but you know I'm satisfied you know I got all the studio albums that I wanted you know to its completion to me so uh that's going to be that guys that is going to be that these are the records that I wanted to talk about in this

w159jTHrzt4,dad my dad everybody hi everyone serious regrets here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Green Day album revolution ready yeah Fame pop punk band Green Day is back they're not coming out with the demos record they're not trying to force three albums down our throats all at once but still III know what you're thinking Anthony that album you're about to review that's not very good but I will say this thing is not quite as cringy as some of the band's most recent material and that's a good thing for whatever reason it's like these headache-inducing pop punk bands of the 2000s you know you're good Charlotte you're blink-182 you're your son 41 have all sort of come back to haunt us once again but in Green Day's defense that they have been releasing albums pretty consistently up until this point but they are they are no less the fourth of the Four Horsemen of the pop punk apocalypse and out of the four bands and new albums that I just mentioned I think revolution radio is is probably the most reputable of them all Green Day seems to make at least a noticeable effort at stripping back the gloss a little bit and coming through with a simpler more back to basic sound but in the grander scheme of things it is still pretty much a gutless commercial radio pop punk record loaded with corny ballads and cringy lyrics and Billy Joe Armstrong obnoxious vocal inflections not to mention he really goes overboard with the edgy on some of these tracks over here singing on the song forever now about running a better way to die plus he throws in all of these empty appeals to politics and and revolution which he's been doing again and again and again since like the American Idiot era and there's so many chord progressions on this thing that are that are painfully uninventive to the point where I'm just getting shots of deja vu from either past Green Day records or other albums entirely and I say that because when Green Day isn't dishing out the usual sort of radio pop punk affair on this record they're kind of just tearing ideas straight out of the Classic Rock playbook and not doing those sounds any justice on top of it and what's with the production on this thing I mean I expected some of the songs on this on this album to be sort of stiff and a little rigid but there are so many spots on here where the the instrumentation and the vocals are unnaturally quiet like they were turned down super super low and post just so that immediately after the band could bust in with the super loud distorted blaring guitars and drums to create this I don't know sort of loud soft dynamic I guess to kind of make the music exciting when in reality what's happening is people are turning the the record up to hear what the hell is going on and then just being deafened by the necessarily large change in volume going into this thing I knew I already didn't like some of the lead singles off of this thing like bangbang and revolution radio which I found to be incredibly formulaic singles but these tracks are actually more tolerable some of the better traction check listing at least the latter has a stupidly catchy chorus just wait until you hear the song outlaws oh boy this thing is a sickeningly saccharine track this sounds like punk going prom catch me on the dance floor when this one plays in my plaid Hot Topic tuxedo with my best girl by my side who on occasion vlogs for a my digital escape then we're gonna skip straight to the song Youngblood to kind of pick the pace up do a little bit of skankin and what are these lyrics I'm a rough boy around the edges getting drunk falling into hedges she's my weakness fucking genius oh my god she's a loner not a stoner bleeding heart and the soul miss Teresa supernova cherry cola and how do you shoot the moon into the Sun how do I shoot the moon descent the song still breathing has this really wimpy introduction topped with these a Owl City quality lyrics eventually the track does bust into some decent and anthemic guitar chords and and this huck that's stupid it's somewhat epic and and I admire the writing on this track but it's like greenie just has no fin nests at this point it's like they're plotting along so predictably in these tracks they're just kind of speeding through these songs I think to kind of just get them over and done with so that they can go take a break or something I think there are some decent tunes at the core of these tracks I think the song to dump to die is an example by green dates standards I mean the hook on this thing is solid the sort of loner high school kid lyrics are to be expected and the guitar chords on this one are pretty catchy as well but the production just sucks any and all of the fun and any and all of the human touch at an equation shouldn't a punk record sound wild and a little at least a little out of control you know Weezer learned that they didn't have to water down their sound for a radio audience that doesn't exist when they put out a new album why can't Green Day learn that because if there's any band that actually has a past worth revisiting out of this recent string of pop punk 2000s revivals that I just mentioned its Green Day but aside from you know a couple of tolerable pop punk singles on this thing there's not really that much to this record that I find to be good I mean the lyrics are super subpar they're awful awful ballads all over this thing it's just kind of one pot hole after the next whether that be coming from lyrics or the plain writing or the vocal performances are just the overall sound of the album feeling a strong two to a light three on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

ejL8k6Qri4g,this new Meshuga record over here it's not good legendary Swedish progressive and extreme metal act Meshuga usually credited as the forefather of this whole gent trend going on in metal right now all these dizzyingly intricate staccato riffs riding the most mathematical and odd time signatures you've ever heard and while a lot of artists in the genre come off to me as being overly produced rigid robotic just way too calculated Meshuga has always gotten to pass with me because of the fact they've kind of pioneered this sound a little bit and I think some of their earlier records like catch 33 and chaos sphere are actually decent metal albums but over the years and especially when it's come to their recent output the band's lack of artistic progression has been borderline disturbing it's almost as if they just kind of lock themselves away in a room and each riff that they write is kind of like a day that they mark off on the wall as just all the years pile up but but I just can't imagine how that feels because just the act of listening to these albums to me especially this one over here become so mind-numbing just all these really repetitive guitar phrases whose grooves sound like they were generated randomly by some kind of homespun computer program the band uses to write their songs and Meshuga unfortunately continues to have the melodic sensibility of a caveman you can count the number of notes in a lot of these riffs on one hand with a few finger severed off and what doesn't help is that the metallic groaning tone of the guitars on this album leaves the band's riffs sounding kind of like heavy machinery at some kind of assembly line repeating the one single task that it was built for again and again and again and again and the band's lead vocals have somehow grown less dynamic over the years as well as Jen's Kidman's monotone growls have become just as one-dimensional as the guitars themselves and it goes without saying that there isn't really much variety when it comes to the writing across this new album - the title track is really a shining example as there is an entire verse on this song where the band just rides this one note riff that sounds like it's hammering out a rhythm the and picked up off of like an inkjet printer or an electric typewriter and the only significant sonic changes on this track and on other tracks too is when the band works in these whaling layers of atmospheric guitars that they kind of ice on top of the riffs banging away below maybe Meshuga will work in a flashy guitar solo or a kind of forgettable guitar lead every once in a while but that's it at this point the band really only has the talent the capacity to hammer out these mathematical riffs I guess that our melodically illiterate and just have overwrought groove patterns in a way I can still commend that Meshuga has a unique sound and I guess they're doing a good job of sticking with it I certainly know am a sugar song when I hear one or I at least know in a band is ripping them off blatantly and I guess I can appreciate that the band's aesthetic is similar to that of like an industrial metal song but a lot of industrial metal I find to be a little more sonically pleasing and diverse and if Meshuga sound was really about sound really about the sound of something wouldn't they have more than one sound the band is clearly not pushing the envelope on this record at all they're clearly not experimenting or adventuring in almost any way and I think they're even failing to hold a candle to their past works on this one to the horse the band is beating on this record is not just dead at this point it's a pile of bones that they have ground into a fine dust with each mind-numbing riff this Meshuga album it's not good and those are my thoughts on this newest sugar record what did you think about this album did you enjoy it more than me uh most likely you did but let me know down in the comments or sure you will also like subscribe all that stuff links next to my head which you should clickety click click click on and you guys are the best forever 
8yVjQqOESzI,hi everyone oh the name rate Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new ax Oathbreaker record over here RIA even though I haven't reviewed this band's past two albums I sort of felt obligated to review this new one over here because on the surface it just seems like something that I would enjoy this album just dropped on Deathwish records and the band's style blends together elements of hardcore punk atmosphere black metal sludge metal and more there's some elements of post-rock worked in there as well also the instrumentals on this thing seem pretty dynamic I mean each song on this album is as savage and loud and brutal as it is subtle and melodic there's some female lead vocals on this album as well which is sort of uncharacteristic for incredibly loud brutal music of this style and those are occasionally performed and clean strange harmonies and also a lot of the songs on this thing are really lengthy so it's got to be epic right I really thought this is going to be one of those reviews where it's like so easy to get through because the album basically just kind of sells itself like it's so good and everything that's great about is like so apparent and on the surface that you don't really need to dig too deep into it because what makes it so amazing is painfully obvious but unfortunately at least for me this record was such a slog to get through don't get me wrong the band kicks the record off really well with the tracks second son of our which is 5 minutes and 55 seconds of pure fury with these relentless blast beats and tremolo guitars harmonize on top of each other and a kind of ugly distorted dissonant way it's messy but it's also epic and it's ascending to this huge powerful crescendo this huge climax that I as I'm listening to the song I just feel like I can't take it it's so intense it's pummeling my soul to bits in some respects it kind of reminds me of death heaven but oath breakers heaviness and their intensity and just how incredibly loud and grating and the throat shredding the vocals are I think sets them apart from any other band who are doing the whole black gaze thing now after all these loud guitars and drums the band sees fit to break into these more dreary quiet guitar passages topped with these pain distant vocals and this is a little trick that they employ over and over and over on this album so get used to it on this track this moment is relatively short and the band seems to build away from it pretty quickly with some very dark and heavy guitar passages the ending on this track is pretty heavy and thrilling definitely a standout in the tracklist the next track being able to feel nothing feels relatively visceral and to the point - despite it being seven minutes long the song never really loses its momentum at any point though I don't think it has the most memorable writing on the entire album and despite the fact that the vocals in my opinion are the most unique sounding thing in the mix they continue to get buried over and over and over by the guitars they just have little to no prominence on a lot of these tracks until they get to the point of these very extreme loud screams so far everything's good but I think the quality of this album drops off really quickly as soon as earthbreaker just puts out this acoustic cut sort of unpredictably in the middle of the tracklist that I don't think they really have the writing or the vocal talent to kind of carry this soft subtle melodic style of rock music or folk if you could call it that certainly they have the talent and the intensity and the the ability to deliver these really aggressive rough hard-hitting passages of hardcore in black metal and sludge metal but as soon as they drift away from that to do something soft and really dramatic and ultra dark for me the album just really starts to crumble so when the band embarks on these really long tedious stretches of the gloomiest guitar chords that they can muster top with these awkward squealing vocals it's hard not to want to skip the track before the the payoff even happens which makes the song Bagheera twitch I hope I'm pronouncing correctly a tough sell since that track is mostly consisting of those dreary guitar passages then we have the droning I'm sorry for this which to me is kind of like a bit of filler it's like this four minute soundscape that is an intermission from what I don't know is it the weird crying cat-like vocal harmonies all over the first the song immortal which nearly ruined the track and these same vocal harmonies also show up on the track where I live I love Carrie screams on this record I mean they're they're incredible I think she brings a intensity in her screams that a lot of singers who also try to sound this aggressive don't quite have but as soon as she goes to sing clean it's like she loses most of her composure her performances aren't as stunning or as emotionally engaging and I get that I guess her voice is supposed to be imperfect as she's singing in this more clean manner but it's to the point where it just gets difficult to take seriously for me the album ends off pretty weakly in my opinion the track where I leave is kind of this one overly long post-metal crescendo that doesn't go anywhere significant in my opinion and the closing cut seems way too infatuated with this dark lonely atmosphere to actually execute anything interesting beyond this soul mood that the band has conjured I don't really mind dynamic metal music in fact a lot of the time I prefer it I love to hear a metal band I can stir up a bit of variety and effectively pull off being versatile but pretty much every moment on this record where Oathbreaker wasn't mind-blowing ly loud they were mind-numbing ly drab and that's essentially my major qualms with this with this album unfortunately I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this Oathbreaker record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry but feel free to leave a comment subscribe more videos my website next to my head clickety-click and have a nice day forever 
pB85HT19h4w,hi everyone the entire cast of full house here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Solange Knowles album seed at the table Solange singer songwriter producer younger sister of Beyonce returning once again to add an album to her kind of inconsistent discography every few years Solange seems to reappear out of the blue to release another record with an entirely reinvented sound and style whether it be from her 2003 commercial debut which took more of a radio-friendly R&B approach than moving later to the kind of futuristic R&B and pop blend that she would drop in 2008 with that record soul angel and then in 2012 with the EP true which was mostly produced by Devante hines of blood orange fame she was putting together some very ethereal pop and soul music but in 2016 with a seat at the table she returns to toy again with the sounds of neo-soul R&B and pop and her sound is still relatively laid-back but there is a strong and underlying political message that links many of these tracks together in the recent past Salon news music hasn't really left much of an impression on me much of it just being a little too faint and Spacey and while she also takes a subtle approach on this new album as well there is a newfound elegance to her singing into the instrumentals on this record that I found to be pretty stunning Solange seems to find some great power in this incredibly hushed and calm soulful music the nimble bass lines very gentle string sections the rich pianos and easygoing rhythms on this record all come together really nicely the instrumentals are quiet but they're not so skeletal that there aren't little details that you can eat up and they're refined enough to have intricacies but they're not overworked to the point where they lose their natural groove and feel super stiff and lifeless and the songwriting and the production credits on this thing is like a serious who's who of pop music of hip hop of soul music we have Raphael Saadiq we have q-tip on this record David long strengths of Dirty Projectors Fame Questlove is in the mix as well and there's just way too many to name there's a lot of people going into this thing but this pretty diverse array of talents come together to create a pretty consistent and uniform album the flow I will say though is a little odd given that many of the tracks on this thing are a series of what sounds like interview Clips conducted with a variety of people one of them being master P who I have not heard from in years but it's kind of cool to hear him on this thing all talking about issues of race and culture black empowerment a lot of the politics and Solange's music are playing his day in her lyrics but it just doesn't hit you over the head as a listener because her tone of voice and a lot of these tracks is so soothing listen to the song FUBU where essentially she's talking about cultural and racial boundaries within art within music talking about certain artistic expressions specifically this one being specifically for black people are being a celebration of black pride or with the song don't touch my hair which is obviously in reference to the much blogged about microaggression Solange on this track is framing her hair as her emotions her crown is this personal thing that it isn't for someone else especially someone a white person specifically to be coming over and just asking to touch as if it's like something to just be casually curious about the stress of racial tensions in America seems to be dominating Solange's every thought on this record whether it be on the song mad where she's singing about her constant state of anger over issues like police brutality and the like even though inadvertently she's kind of also singing about how much of a wet blanket she is as she's mentioning people who don't seem to get why she's so angry there's also a semi goofy little wayne verse worked into the track that i do in a way commend because he does stay on topic he does kind of flow into the theme of the track pretty well Solange's vocals on this cut are surprisingly passionate too and the stuttering groove of the track the choppy piano chords as well as the kind of odd vocal harmonies which are very nimble just jumping all over the place we're clearly a work of David long strength and I went into the liner notes of the record only to confirm that pretty quickly the song cranes in the sky seems to be an extension of this same madness the same stress that she's singing about but she's trying to bury her blues and buying clothes and sleeping and reading and having sex all of which is set to some pretty gorgeous strings and a very slick drumbeat but even though this is a social and a political fight that she feels the need to pay attention to or take part in on the song borderline she illustrates her need to take a break from it every once in a while with these lyrics right here and then there are points on this record where she takes the political and she turns it personal like on the cut where do we go which is a reference to her family having to move from their hometown which was sparked by her father getting stuck in a salt mine her family having to pull him and someone else out and then the mine only rehiring part of her family back which created tensions like a split in the family Solange does pick up the mood of the album a little later though like on the track Junie which is sort of this upbeat playful fight song of sorts which features this Jackson 5's funky piano bass breakdown on the hook which is complete with some falsetto vocals from Andre 3000 singing jump I wanted this track where do we go cranes in the sky all kind of come together and make for some of the boldest instrumentals on the record but I enjoy many of the subtle cuts off this record as well not just one of the big singles from this thing don't touch my hair but also some of the opening cuts like rise and weari which kick the album off with a very mysterious and almost eerie mood the only songs on here that I'm not that enamored with are the ones whose instrumentals awkwardly blend elements of soul funk and electronic music like on the song don't you wait whose beat sounds super flat and I don't know kind of robotic considering just how human and silky the vocals tapped with this instrumental art and the song don't wish me well while I really like the intro to this track what sound like pump organ chords were really doing a great job of setting the tone Solange's vocals on this track sounded great too but as the track developed these kind of thin echoey bouncy guitar lines kind of entered the mix and they're super kind of tinny and to me sour the mood of the track altogether but the rest of the record here is pretty beautiful tasteful Pleasant given my experience with Solange's music in the past I expected myself to be kind of bored but I actually wasn't there's actually an interesting juxtaposition going on between the music and the lyrics a lot of the instrumentals being so serene and blissful while the lyrics addressed some seriously rough social topics and angry and fed up feelings personally coming from Solange or self while I may not always agree with the mindset that fuels the politics of this record much of it is pulled from Solange's personal experiences which honestly I can't really argue with and I don't really hear anything all that disagreeable about the lyrical content of the record or many of the interviews that segue one song to the next throughout the album I actually think a lot of it's pretty inspiring even if I don't directly identify with the identity politics of this record because the themes that Solange references of pride and self empowerment and being the change that you want to see in the world are all pretty refreshing and I can't really deny that a great deal of this record is well written well performed and well produced - and I guess I can unequivocally say that this is Solange's best album today as well so even though maybe it is a little too easygoing at times and I don't find Solange to be the boldest of vocalists out there right now I had a really good time with this album I think it's a beautiful record that I have no problem saying that I feel as strong 72 a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen is your love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the light if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this Solange record there's some things next to my head some videos subscription the website click on click click click any click click click click click I hope you guys are doing well get a good night's sleep bye 
3TKlogHjZso,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd dropping a couple of quick iPhone reviews today doing it raw uncut doing it dirty and one of the first records that I'm gonna be talking about today is this new self-titled brain tentacles album which I've been listening to on and off for the past couple of weeks and this was a pretty interesting metal project just came out on relapse records and there's a bit of a concept behind this whole thing it is most definitely a metal record can't deny that it's true blue metal album but rather than it's sort of being your standard electric guitar bass drum sort of affair is bass drums and like saxophone you know just horns replacing the guitars entirely pretty much everything that a guitar would be doing on a metal record horns are doing instead and I mean they take on the job pretty well you know they're blaring they're loud they're in your face they're very aggressive very aggressive horn playing on this thing I will say I went into this album expecting more kind of a jazzy freak out sort of along the lines of like a naked city or something John Zorn related something like that but I did not get that this felt more like kind of a standard metal affair like okay this is like a death metal song but just like the guitars are replaced by horns although I will say not every track on this album takes on a death metal vibe and even though the band does sort of seem to be limited in their instrumental choices they do perform a variety of different metal styles across the record there are moodier and more spacey tracks on this thing songs that I guess you could probably say take on a sludgy or tone or more progressive tone some moments involve vocals on this thing but a great deal of the record is instrumental and some of the writing is decent but I think just a lot of what could have been potentially the quality of this record is kind of bogged down in the instrumental gimmick that it presents so readily so excitedly I will say that even though it is a gimmick and it's a very obvious gimmick it is very fun and it is an entertaining album and in some ways I do think it is a little time Sheik and it is jokey and the band certainly seems to be a aware of that fact especially given that if you I think pick up this record on Bandcamp you get this really long extended like crank call out row to the final track that just kind of is the cherry on top to how ridiculous this record is you know if there was ever a question from the beginning to the end of the record that is is the band not really taking themselves that seriously it's certainly that crank call moment that sort of proves to you okay you know they're not they're not taking themselves too seriously so you know go into this record expecting to hear something kind of wild off-the-wall fun it's a metal record that you know is kind of clowning the audience I think a little bit but you know some some good production and some serious performances and and virtuosity went to a lot of these tracks too so you know I would say it's it's not quite a joke maybe it's a semi joke but a joke or not it's a lot of is very well crafted so very gimmicky very fun but I guess if eventually you listen to it enough times that you can kind of get past the fact that you know you're hearing just horns a set of guitars which in a metal capacity while they are a decent replacement on this record they are kind of limited in a way if you ever listen to this album enough times so you may get past that and sort of enjoy this record sort of as the horn infused metal album that that it is but those are my thoughts my quick thoughts on this album what did you think of this thing if you gave it a listen did you love it do you hate of why was it too gimmicky for you did you think it was ridiculous did you think it was trash or did you think what I saw a lot of people saying about the South that it's like this new frontier that is totally experimental it's refreshing it's a really challenging it's um taking a new approach let me know down in the comments and also if I haven't said it what should I review next and I will see you guys in the next review forever 
D86O_TGb45Q,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and I'm doing a quick raw dirty review of this new ty dolla sign mixtape I thought I was going to be an album I guess it's a mixtape campaign a ty dolla sign songwriter R&B singer rapper coming out with this new mixtape and I don't know I like a lot of the singles leading up to this thing but when I told people I was going to review her when people are recommending it to me I was getting a lot of responses saying oh it's terrible oh it's trash you don't want to hear it it's bad honestly I don't really mind it it's like not that bad of a tape I mean it's not the sort of refreshing and fun and and perfect mix of classy and trashy that his free TC album was you know it's definitely on the trashy ER side of the spectrum there's a lot of material on this thing that you could probably just toss to the side as being sort of you know generic mixtape filler you know a lot of trap flavored beats a lot of very straightforward repetitive hooks ty dolla sign is really boiling his songs down and a lot of them are very short like two minutes and change boiling these songs down to the simplest catchiest most direct elements that he can sort of render which isn't necessarily a bad thing I think you just need to go into this project expecting that you know there are a few moments like one exception is a song I'm stealing for example where you know you are hearing a beautiful lead vocal melody that's kind of sweet and it's gentle you're hearing a guitar and the track you're hearing some strings in the background so it's not like you know every single track is uniformly like this is a toven ripoff production banging away in the background is just like you know ty dolla sign sings endlessly about or something like that though this mixtape definitely has its moments that that are coming from that angle there's a variety of cuts on here you know whether it be these straight forward bangers like the track campaign featuring the future which i thought was just okay the Travis Scott and the migos cut on here were kind of a throwaway in my opinion the Meek Mill cut at the end of the mixtape was maybe one of my favorites in the track listing here meek Mill's verse was hype as hell and the beat was just like unrelentingly just like pummeling and viscera at one more moment that most definitely stood out for me was the note justice tract where ty dolla sign pretty much goes boldly political and gets TC on another track singing vocals which were actually pretty stunning and the song aren't be where he sings about being in love with this what he refers to as a in R&B bitch and you know they're going out there spending time together and they're making mixes and they're listening to all of their favorite R&B artists whether it be Missy or Jodeci or breezy and their love is sort of being soundtrack by all these popular R&B artists that they reference very heavily throughout the track and you know tie another thing I'll give him credit for on this mixtape is that you know a lot of these songs he comes through with a focused song topic you know he's not just like rattling off random BS a lot of the time track after track after track again I mean it's it's not the greatest thing in the world but I'm not really quite understanding I'm kind of confused as to why people think this project is like total trash you know I it definitely doesn't like reek of like a complete lack of effort or anything like that there's some decent moments on this thing you know definitely some some groaning cuts as well you know because it seems like he's really sort of underselling himself you know you could definitely put out a better song than hello for example or you know the song daddy while I did like it as a single you know it is one of the more depraved cuts and the track listing here I guess I'll say that you know I've heard him put out better material I guess I'll say but you know the highlights on this thing are still good and I think and go toe to toe with a lot of the cuts off of free TC so it's not really that bad of a project you know and if somehow this is slipped by you and you're looking for like kind of a quick hit of catchy track confused R&B that you could have on in the background and a few moments will probably stick with you give this thing a shot if you enjoyed any tracks off of TC I think issued a free TC I think you should give this thing a shot and and again for the most part I'm enjoying it you know not crazy about it but I think it's decent and those are essentially my thoughts on this campaign project over here if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it you know why what do you think I should review next and that's it ty dolla sign campaign Fred 
ti-uAwBKP90,hi everyone is $20 okay here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new bank's album the alter California singer/songwriter Jillian Banks aka Banks coming through with her sophomore full-length album right here following up her breakout debut record which came out a few years ago goddess and album where I didn't really get the hype behind it a lot of very super moody low-key songs on this album that were so quiet and faint that very few of them actually left an impression on me and with this new record over here I was just hoping for some stronger bolder more exciting songs more highlights and it seemed like I was going to get that I mean the song Gemini feed I think is one of Banks best singles best tracks to date I love the song smooth danceable groove I love the sharp vocal melody on the hook some of the weird chorus vocal pitch down manipulations on the verses are pretty decent they kind of remind me of the knife and Fever Ray but way less adventurous and weird my issue with that though is that banks while it does sound like she's trying to add a little texture here she doesn't have the most distinct voice as it is so some of these effects only go to mask her voice further and make it difficult to connect with what she's doing vocal performance wise plus she's not always giving a passionate vocal performance on these songs she tends to play it kind of low-key which I would chalk it up to just being her style but at this point on her sophomore record it's almost more like a shortcoming or just like a lack of personality which I think she tries to make up for with this album's focus never-ending focus on stories of heartbreak love sex and a betrayal there are a few exceptions where Banks does give an exceptionally passionate vocal performance I guess exceptional by her standards of the song mind games for example or the acoustic track mother earth which has some pretty great string sections worked into it but the rest of the vocals on this album are pretty mild as is the production again which continues to sound super skeletal super simple colorless way too plain it's not as piano-driven as a lot of the songs were on the last album but it's it's really no more fun to listen to however she does manage to pen a couple of her best tracks including Gemini feed and also the song this is not about us which has my favorite groove on the album actually some punchy rhythms coming through on this one I can't help but want to move to this track I love the vocals on the hook here this is not about us the bassline the slides right in after that is really sharp fantastic and the song trainwreck I think is the closest Banks has ever come to trying to come through with like a top 40 pop hit I wouldn't necessarily say it's a good song but it is clear that she's trying to emulate some pop diva that she might have had in mind however she doesn't really carve out a niche for herself within this sound she just kind of sounds like a mere emulation that pales in comparison to a more popular artist the rest of the record isn't really much bolder than Banks's last album honestly I noticed that she's trying to get a little edgier with some of the lyrics on this thing like on the song a weaker girl or I with myself where she takes on a kind of moody alternative R&B flavor that reminds me a little bit of fka twigs but way less adventurous and odd on the song lovesick this track features all of these very subtle easygoing grooves very slow keyboards vocals that are so lifeless it just makes my ears glaze over it kind of reminds me of the XX a little bit which I know there are a lot of fans of that group but they've never sort of translated for me and I'm getting a similar emotional vibe from this record as well maybe that could be a recommendation for somebody who's a huge xx fan but for me what I'm hearing just sounds like all style and no substance no soul especially when you consider all the sexual cliches laced throughout the lyrics in the song too and on the song to the hills another single from this record just total snoozer in a nutshell for me this album isn't really bold enough to be exciting it's not experimental enough to be alternative which is a tag that a lot of people throw on to it and it's not really emotionally potent enough to be moving its pleasant while it's on but not much else it's kind of like the perfect soundtrack to boring sex and I don't really have much more to say about it than that I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next please subscribe and please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this record though you can leave a comment click on some stuff that's next to my head another video the website again the subscription button and that's it guys banks the alter forever 
W_s3eQ5tQes,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it is time for our weekly best and worst tracks of the week segment where I do a tracks roundup of everything that I've heard from this past week that stood out to me we do these videos in the raw so we're not going to do a whole lot of edits here and we are going to start off with the worst tracks the week get into the best tracks of the week later as usual if you want to support this segment you can head up our amazon associates link down there in the description box if you live in the US and you click on it anything you buy off of Amazon we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price alright so worst tracks of the week let's get into this new sleigh bell song this song and all the other tracks are referenced down there in the description box as well this track over there your sleigh bells while it is one of the worst tracks of the week I do kind of think it's one of their better songs like it's a not the overly distorted and obnoxious display of pop rock that the sleigh bells usually bring to the table it's kind of got a bit of an electronic pop feel to it there are moments where it sounded like Lady gaga Chris on Twitter had told me that he thinks it sounds a lot like a Joan Jett produced on fruity loops which may be an even more apt description so yeah I didn't care for that track I loved Makonnen call me badly I loved Makonnen unfortunately can not still sing his way out of a paper bag so just go into this new track expecting that zeds dead track too young featuring Rivers Cuomo and Pusha T which is a couple of features on one song that I did not anticipate I would ever hear did not think would ever exist but zeds dead made it happen and boy is it a display boy is it is it a horror Rivers comes through and sings this sort of wimpy little chorus while Pusha T delivers these verses about this art school girl who likes her boys bad likes her boys Chief Keef likes her boys I guess you know being gangsters or whatever it just seems I don't know the words that I was looking for to describe the story in the lyrics painfully corny didn't really care for the beat all that much and just kind of hearing Pusha T and rivers on the same track this was really preposterous but I don't know what you get to do moving out from there the radio Department have a new track out titled we got game this track the radio department are really changing up their sound here and sort of doing a electronic dance music kind of thing and it does not do them any justice and finishing things out we have a Molly Nilsson with let's talk about privileges which not only has a series of lyrics that sound like they're lifted straight from a tumblr post but really the songs like you know greatest crime is just how bland and I don't know personality lists it is there's like really no fun or flavor to the song it's just this really awful breathy lifeless comatose synth pop track that you know considering the the the subject matter of the song you think that these points would be the beginning put a little more bluntly or a little more passionately but instead it's it's pretty much a naptime song alright so we're going to move on from there to the songs that I do want to turn you guys on to I do want to point you guys toward but maybe they weren't my favorites of the week I thought they were okay these are the song that was kind of indifferent toward I was just kind of met on these songs we have the new absol track huming new featuring - which I think had some of the better absol verses that have been released in a while a really mysterious instrumental on this track but the - feature on the back end of the track really added nothing to the song in my opinion the band car bomb progressive metal outfit car bomb they have a new song out titled gratitude which do you have some cleanly sung vocals on it that I didn't care for too much but some of the very dizzying and an oddly timed riffs on the track were pretty invigorating we have Joan of Arc with a track called this must be placenta that I'm still utterly confused by go into this song not really expecting anything other than to be perplexed the new mary j blige track unfortunately think of it I found to be kind of bland American football has a new track out desire gets in the way which I do think was one of the better singles that they've put out but um you know it's just not really as emotionally enthralling as the material from the band that came out back in the day so I'm just kind of wondering what they're going to do with this new record considering every song thus far just kind of sounds like an easygoing adult contemporary like you know very pleasant on the ears type of rock song just really isn't doing too much for me Alicia Keys with the song blended family was okay but the ASAP rocky feature on the song was pretty lackluster Hannah diamond from PC music fame with fadeaway new single from her unfortunately this is one of the least quirky and least fun and sort of like melodically sticky songs that have come out of the PC music camp ever and I think if they keep dropping tracks like this fadeaway is exactly what's going to happen to a Hannah diamond then you know the rest of the PC music crew hopefully what comes out in the future is a little more bold and exciting and then we to finish things off we have a track from Weezer fake mile fake smiles excuse me and nervous laughter which is one of several tracks bonus tracks which are going to be featured on the deluxe version of Weezer's latest record the White Album which you guys know I enjoy quite a bit but this song and I love the USA and the other additional tracks that are being added to this deluxe version not really liking any of them they're all kind of okay they're sort of mediocre which you know that they're still better than like the red album they're still better than R attitude they're still better than a great deal of hurly don't get me wrong so you know maybe I'm not going to say that you should avoid the deluxe version of this record or anything but none of it is as catchy in my opinion or as stunning as the core material of the White Album thus far though still if you're yet to get that album and this deluxe version crosses your path why not so let's get in my favorite tracks of the week over here quite a few pop songs made into my favorite tracks which I'm happy about these are not usually artists who make it into my favorite tracks list but here we go Bruno Mars with 24-karat magic this is a sweet little piece of electro funk takes me back to when I was really enamored with like ChromeOS records like business casual he really does a lot for this style the music video is pretty dorky with this awful hat that he's wearing and he sort of does a dj khaled thing jumping on a jet ski at one point you know you ignore that but the song itself is really fun my buddy Evan over at the nerdwriter told me a in sort of private that he thinks this is the the next cha-cha slide he could see the song being played at weddings in the future and grandmas all dancing in unison to this song could could potentially be the case going down the road I think the song is really catchy and really awesome now going on from there Lady Gaga with million reasons this is so good this is such a good acoustic ballad I didn't think Lady Gaga could ever sort of do sort of a sort of country tinged a acoustic number like this and have it come out this classy and this passionate but she freaking did it indefinitely a more lyrically mature I think than her last single which the lyrics from her last big single were unfortunately I think the Achilles heel of the track there's nothing really about this new song over here that I don't like and I'm hoping to hear more raw personal and kind of into material on this new record you know which which could be the case so I'm actually really looking forward to the Lady Gaga album to be honest then we have amber Kaufman of Dirty Projectors Fame coming through with a new single over here which is completely lovely her virtuous vocals are very nimble and dynamic all over this track and it's a well written song too wise blood which is another track from this project that I've referenced in this series came out with a new single Generation Y which is attached to a video if you're into some very Airy Spacey and grand and reverb soak baroque pop you should give this thing a shot because it's a very lovely very pretty sound and ending things off with the o'seas the song the poem yes the poem which is from a new album which is kind of a series of I guess after thoughts from their latest record a weird exits this song is nowhere near as hard or as heavy errs and tenses and he cuts off of that record it's kind of an odd spoken word piece is kind of psychedelic tendencies but still interesting nonetheless and those are going to be the songs going to recommend to you guys those are all the songs best worst of the the week thank you for watching again all these are linked down there in the description so if you want to hear these songs or sort of find relevant links to these songs they're all down there below and appreciate you watching I hope you guys enjoy the rest of your weekend you're the best forever 
vdmzHJ8QsJs,hi everyone sniffing things in aptana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Regina Spektor album remember us to life New York via Russia singer-songwriter Regina Spektor this I believe is her seventh full-length album she's been at it for years but this is the first time I'm doing like a formal Regina Spektor album review why why why why why why why I used to really love Regina's music originally I caught her doing an opening set at a Dresden Dolls show years ago what's so funny oh nothing hey nothing wrong with a little cabaret gap punk piano rack Punk I know that it's ICP for theater majors I'm willing to admit that well at this live show I instantly fell for Regina's voice her piano playing her quirky lyrics and songwriting on albums like Soviet Kitsch and 1111 and song she was as funny as she was captivating and romantic but I soon found myself sort of falling out of favor with her music as she gained more popularity like on her album begin to hope back in 2006 a lot of people seemed enamored with this record but I didn't really care for the way that the trendier production on this album sort of constrained her songwriting down and rendered it into sort of a more straightforward pop flavor the beats and the cents on a lot of tracks from this record were a total turnoff for me and while her following two records weren't really all that bad I didn't see them as consistent as her previous works that I had enjoyed so much then a few years ago I remember really falling in love with her new single you've got time which was a song that she had composed specifically for orange is the new black as the show's theme song and you could just write this song off as an intro to a very popular television show but I actually think it's one of her better tracks in years the tension building and the vocals and the unrelenting pianos on this track are fantastic and I love the way that her lyrics say a lot without giving too much away this song confirmed for me that there's still that fire in her that I remember from her 2000s early 2000s era music so much and I was kind of hoping for a new full-length record where she ignites that again and I think remember us - life does exactly that this album isn't a huge change of pace from what Regina has been doing on her past couple of records fans of those I think will undoubtedly enjoy this but she just seems on with this record like super focused and super consistent on the 11 tracks on this thing there's not a dud among these songs and even the bonus tracks on the deluxe version are fired every aspect of Regina's music just seems supercharged on this record from the heartbreaking stories the passion of vocal performances the wit the dynamic piano playing and it's all amplified with some huge backing instrumentation like some great lavish thick dense string sections and some great bass & pianos this is like the biggest instrumental presentation I think Regina has brought forth on a record thus far and it gives her a real theatrical edge on a lot of these cuts like on the song sellers of roses where she dramatically sings about the winner in this equation of purchasing flowers as a gift it's not the roses it's not the sellers it's not the buyers she sings about the sellers actually picking up old roses and picking off the old wilted petals and then using those to sell and then the roses are dead the next day it's such a small moment in life to sing about but she gives it so much weight the song obsolete is equally grand and pretty heartbreaking when you dive into the lyrics where she's singing about her love her heart becoming old becoming useless the song tornado land is very large and very showy as well and moves through a series of instrumental shifts that are kind of like very stage II Musical costume changes and on the trapper and the furrier Regina employs some of the most biting and satirical lyrics on the entire record singing about these duo's of people the trapper and the furrier the lawyer and the pharmacist the manager and the owner kind of working together to screw over other people or exploit the world around them as on the chorus she sings about the strange world that we live in how those who don't have have things taken away from them and those who do have are given the album isn't all doom and gloom though on the song older and taller Regina brings her upbeat charms with a really funny refrain where she's talking about being told to enjoy your youth like a threat there are tons of little funny turns of phrase all over this track about life's many ironies and and being sort of sentimental about your memories and people you care about and the closing track to this record the visit is such a heartwarming song one of the most heartwarming songs have heard in a long time Regina kicks the song off literally singing about how she's so happy that this person who she has in mind stopped by she sings about how she hasn't seen this person in years there are all sorts of sweet gentle melodies all over this thing the song is like the equivalent of I don't know like tea and sweet biscuits and everything sitting on doilies the song is like so dainty and adorable I've never I think used those words to describe a song while the song small bills takes a really huge risk with a booming funky drumbeat and piano groove and Regina's vocals on this tracker almost rapping as she's singing about this person wasting money on coca-cola and weed and Lucy's and so on and so forth she has all these little refrains interjecting between these verses and deeper into the song the track becomes more and more about losing money wasting money other people trying to get your money from you and I want to mention the song black and white too because it is such a lovely and tender piece of songwriting it reminds me of a artists like Nico or Joni Mitchell it's just such a beautiful moving tune whose melody just sticks with me it haunts me if you don't like this track if you're not like at least a little moved by this track I don't trust you you know I really don't trust you like if I had given you a knife or something I wouldn't turn around you might stab me and the other cuts in the tracklisting don't disappoint either I mean on the song the light the heavenly chorus on this track the way Regina's vocals and the strings come together is really blissful really pretty even the opening track which features these synthetic beats and you know of course these synth leads which I don't really care for when she's working with them I'm so enamored with the song itself it ultimately doesn't matter also the quaint storytelling of the song Grand Hotel again not a track I'm disappointed with even really underwhelmed by in the track listing here which is surprising because that's typically been the case for Regina's past several records and again there's not a huge overhaul of Regina's sound on the album at all it's just like the writing and the performances and the instrumental presentation are a little bit sharper a little bit better so you know if you've been kind of discounting Regina's past couple of Records as well don't let this one slip by you I know it might not seem like the difference between this and her recent material is night and day but uh to me it really is in a lot of ways I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate here that best year the best what should I review next and hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this album but feel free to leave a comment also there's stuff next to my head click on it Regina Spektor new album for forever 
AvvWF8RaXBk,ah hi everyone wrap the nice aunt Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd about to embark on a little bit of a ramble on this woman who I guess is becoming known as the North North women whose video talking about Vince staples infamous song North North has gone a little viral caught the video on Twitter yesterday I've watched it a couple times and I was sort of intrigued and entertained by her reaction just as many of you were there were parts when I laughed like it just how teary-eyed she was getting at the start of the video how she was breaking down reading some of the lyrics as she read the songs versus outward forward which was kind of awkward but whatever oh portions I find it kind of weird that she would have stumbled upon event staple song on what she called her top hits radio station I mean I don't know this lady's radio dial and maybe what she's saying is in fact the truth but I don't believe North nor Fizz like a hit song right now I don't know if the song is really charting or anything it could be if it is I'm unaware but ultimately she seems shocked and offended and in awe that this song despite being neutered of its many cuss words made it out onto the radio because the content of the song is still very violent still very offensive she's raising a bunch of little girls and she doesn't want them exposed to that type of material and I agree that as a parent you should be interested in the media that your child consumes and you should take an active role in deciding what is okay and what is not okay for your child to view or read or listen to maybe not necessarily in a draconian way you're trying to dictate every aspect of your child's life but there are certainly bands and artists and albums that I love quite a bit that I would hesitate to expose it to like a six year old or a seven year old not at least without trying to have an adult conversation about what is being said in the lyrics and fantasy and art versus reality and so on and so forth so in a way I do feel for what this lady is saying she almost seems as if she's been betrayed by the radio waves not completely knowing or understanding that her kids could be exposed to songs like this just by flipping on the dial she even says blatantly toward the end of the video she doesn't personally have anything against people who make or listen to this music she's not advocating for the destruction or the deletion of songs like North North in that respect her video is pretty reasonable but I do think some of this lay these points are trapped in a similar mindset to that of people who were saying rap music or metal music and rock music were dangerous and threatening the mindsets of the youth in the 80s or 90s whose Crusades died off because slowly we came to realize that metal music Judas Priest Dead Kennedys Public Enemy NWA really present no danger and they're just entertainment though Vince staples music can be pretty violent and pretty vulgar I think the same rule still applies in 2016 there are plenty of kids especially kids in the suburbs who listen to plenty of Vince staples and will never do anything that he raps about in his songs wouldn't even cross their minds that's just not how it works your upbringing in your surroundings and the values that the people who are your Guardians or your parents instill in you are way bigger deciders and how you conduct yourself in life versus what music you listen to obviously what her kids enjoy in terms of television music what-have-you is very important to her I don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing that's not a bad concern for a parent to have it's certainly better than having an apathetic parent who doesn't care what their child was exposed to and it was also kind of hard to watch this woman cry to this vent staple song because it was almost like watching her sheltered little naive world you get completely shattered by this hip-hop song and in a way it's a it's an opportunity to kind of reframe and look at the music that we're listening to with a more objective with a more outside perspective because the type of lyricism and lyrical content that passes in in much of today's popular hip-hop and pop music give me pretty raunchy and I feel like us being really hardcore music fans and being especially fans popular music we get kind of used to it after a while and we no longer start to question like hey so some of the stuff said in this song is is actually pretty fucked up and that in fact is part of the appeal of song was like north north it isn't necessarily an endorsement of what Vince staples was rapping about he's just rapping about experiences that he or other people have lived he raps about harsh reality is that some people go through whether by choice or not and not everybody listens to music in that way not everybody wants to consume music from that angle some people just want to listen to music and enjoy television and movies that directly reflect their values back at them furthermore I don't think her experience here should mean that North nor for any song like it should be pulled from the radio I mean their countries like Australia for example where they allow songs have swears on the radio they allow some pretty questionable content to get out there on the radio and all that happens is you know you get a little bit of a content warning you listen to it if you can handle it you listen to it if you're fine with being exposed to that kind of stuff if you're not then you flip it off that's all if you're a parent and you don't want your kids exposed to mature content then you have to take an active role in making sure that doesn't happen you can't just sit back and rely on the radio to make those decisions for you rely on TV to make those decisions for you because if if you allow that to happen then your kids are going to hear a song like north nor if your kids are probably going to hear much worse so yeah those are those are my thoughts on the north or filet D and in her video what did you think of this video let me know down in the comments and yeah we're going to leave it at that transition blah blah

everyone should listen to me when I tell you something is wrong it's wrong I'm the greatest hi everyone kill yourself Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Nicholas jar album sirens electronic music producer Nicholas jar is back with a new surprise album at least it was a surprise to me his first studio album since his breakout record in 2015 spaces only noise now in between these two records you may already know that he came out with like a little soundtrack of his own volition like nobody commissioned him to do it I believe he created music to accompany an old Soviet era avant-garde film he also had that fantastic collaborative album with dave harrington under the darkside name they also did some cool def punk remixes together of songs from the Daft Punk's latest record random access memories and as good as a lot of that stuff was I'm pretty excited to hear Nick go back to just solo Nick album Nick I want to hear that usual moody minimalistic micro house magic he usually conjures but I do know that he is an experimental and an adventurous artist by nature so I expect for him to explore some new avenues on this album as well so I didn't really know what I was going to get going into this record especially given that it's just five tracks and I came away from this thing surprised just how much musical ground Nick covers on this thing the song leaves is kind of this sour space C ambient piece with some conversation in Spanish slipped underneath the synthetic soundscape the song three sides of Nazareth is one of the longest in the tracklisting here and most of the song orbits around this pretty groovy like rock beat rock baseline but it's very low-key very quiet very nocturnal and on top of this groove Nick delivers a vocal that is very flat very deadpan kind of eerie much like what was on his last album but um a little a little different this time can't quite put my finger on what is making his vocals just have a different flavor this time around but again there is something about this track that reminds me of rock-and-roll music old rhythm and blues music like maybe something akin to Tom Waits is going out west but stripped down of all the dirtiness of all the emotion of all the filth of all the grime eNOS of all of the lust and desire and turned into something way more cold and robotic I think it's a cool idea and a cool concept even if the song does end up being a little too long-winded and tedious on the song history lesson Nick seems to go backwards again and dabbles in a bit of vintage vocal pop with layers upon layers of breathy harmonized vocals and falsettos there are some very shy keyboards worked in their sparse percussion a little hand clapping it's probably the most soulful thing Nick has ever recorded but it is still super quiet and super subtle like many of his recordings the song no was another surprising change of pace it was kind of like a bit of ambient pop with a Latin flavor distinctly coming from the percussion and the way that the keyboards emphasised the upbeat of the groove also Nick sees fit to sing over a majority of the instrumental in Spanish of course his voice does get kind of swallowed up in some of the effects that he seems to surround it with though and on the song the govenor there's some jazzy saxophone freak-outs which are backed up with some fantastic breakbeat loops something that I never would have thought I would hear on a Nick Jarre song it's actually really intense track probably the most fiery production I've heard and pulled together and by a wide margin and I'm pretty entranced by the blissful and gore synth layers and melodies on the opening track killing time I'm not so enamored with Nick's falsetto vocals on this track but I don't know if I'm that enamoured with many of his vocals on the track his voice really is a focal point on this album I mean it's incredibly shy and quiet a lot of the time but it's way more prominent it appears way more often than it has on past projects and those are the five tracks on this album in a nutshell this album is a pretty inconsistent Nick doesn't really settle on one style or sound or delivery or anything and not there's anything wrong with a varied album though I will say there is a thread of subtlety that seems to run through every song here my issue is that I don't think a lot of what Nick mimics on this album is done all that well either I don't think his very quiet musical style complements some of the genres that he's toying with or I'm really underwhelmed by his vocals a lot of the time on this record which is a bit of a shame because I liked his vocals so much on his last record even though they were very quiet and odd and off-putting - they seemed to fit and make sense on spaces only noise which is a very abstract very strange album on this new album over here it's like he's trying to put these vocals into more of a pop context and he just does not have the voice for it or even really try to have the voice for it the album feels so short to me as well despite being 42 minutes long and that might have a lot to do with I think some of these songs don't really justify their song lengths all that well some of them are very lengthy but features sort of repetitive ideas that I think could have been cut back as a fan of Nick's work previously I was definitely intrigued by a lot of the risks he was taking on this record I just don't think a whole lot of it panned out into anything amazing you know nothing I'd really be excited to to return to but I was certainly intrigued while the album was on and I enjoyed a lot of the atmospheres he was conjuring even if a lot of them just ended up kind of hanging in the background for me and not adding up too much more than just you know some pleasant and somewhat eerie wallpaper I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this record transition you given this new Nicholas jar album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next hit the light if you like please subscribe and please

Justin Vernon and this is now his third full-length album under this name he is following up his very well-received Bon Iver Bon Iver record which came out about five years ago a record that honestly I couldn't really get into as much as other people were due to its inconsistent songwriting it's weird kind of 80s pastiche thing going toward the end of the record and the the horrible mixing with this new album I was hoping for something a little more focused a little more polished but it seemed like even from the teaser tracks I was not going to get that not that I anticipated this album to be messy but it didn't sound like Justin was going to give us a cleaner more put-together version of his typical sound he was going to be changing sounds altogether he's no longer writing the lavish artsy indie folk music that he's known for instead he is delivering something that is much more synthetic he's fiddling with electronics and glitchy production on this one which is necessarily a bad thing there are a lot of glitch pop albums and folk tronic albums that I enjoy quite a bit but it seems that Justin is using this change of pace as an excuse to not write a coherent song a lot of the time he seems to work in some Peter Gabriel worship more than usual on some of these cuts too and I'm not even going to open up the can of worms that is the ridiculous list of song titles on this thing now it's not that there aren't good moments it's not there's not beautiful music on this record there definitely is the intro track for example is absolutely stunning with its droney samples and loops it's chilling and gorgeous vocal harmonies it's kind of choppy chipmunk vocals that add a bit of color to the mix too that I think is pleasant also the lone sax solo that pops up later in the track is also pretty moving all great ideas all great pieces of instrumentation comes together so harmoniously and tastefully but Justin doesn't flesh it out into a complete song instead he just surrounds these sounds with gimmicky little production tricks and edits and just ends the track off at 2:48 without a real proper ending and many of the other tracks in the track listing too don't really feel like complete works as much as they do a series of full chronic climaxes that either lack of satisfying beginning or a satisfying finish they just leave me wanting way more it's like I'm listening to a bunch of long snippets or motifs like on the track 715 which is not only like an incomplete thought but a thought that James Blake had produced and recorded five years ago this sounds exactly like something James Blake did on his debut album album album the song 45 feels like an attempt to pull off the same thing but with horns being manipulated in auto-tuned instead of vocals which I admit was a more novel thought than what Bon Iver was trying to pull off on creaks the song 21 moon water has no sense of direction at all it's like he sort of bunched together a group of random ideas and transitions and just layered him on top of one another without any real attention being paid to whether or not these sounds complement one another or glide into or segue into one another well it's just kind of like experimental ambient folk electronic salad and despite being five minutes long the only significant progressions on the song eight are that the instrumentation gets a little louder and in G going groov kind of develops there's a bit of an instrumental break down toward the back end of the track - and it's a shame because this track features one of the most beautiful vocal melodies and soulful chord progressions of the entire record it just could have done more it could have gone somewhere it could have developed - or from something else for any one of the incredible artists that Justin clearly pulls from on this record this would have been a mere part of a larger song I'm also reminded of Sufjan Stevens electronic opus the age of odds which this album also pales in comparison to now there are a few very well written songs worked into the track listing here Stratford apartments is absolutely gorgeous and I love the way that the guitars the vocals the horns the piano on this track come together in a very dreamy way and the closing track on this thing is a gorgeous beautiful moving and powerful piano ballad that ends the album off on a high note so it's not like every track here is an underdeveloped piece of filler but on the other tracks where it seems like Vernon has pulled together a coherent track once again the quality of the album suffers at the hand of awful terrible mixes like on the song 33 god ah the way the vocals and the oversaturated base and the distorted drums and whatever else at the 130 mark on the song come together in a word um headache ache ache and the song death breaths I could not even begin to describe what a garbled mess this song is on headphones and on larger speakers for me it was actually painful to listen to this is one of the few songs that I could say sounds best on a pair of laptop speakers far away like with his last album though I would say even worse in a way Justin tries to come together with very instrumentally dense and expensive sounding low fine music and it just does not come together well some of the compositions on this thing are huge they're ambitious some of the biggest I would say Vernon has ever pulled together but he sees fit to just filter it through just the most awful recording and mixing job possible it's not even rickety or rootsy in an endearing way it just sounds really overblown and out of whack the music on this album plays a lot like how the cover of this album excuse a bunch of small and intricate little pieces of art I've assembled them in such a way that you'll think it's really cryptic and obtuse and like it's really deeper something when in reality it doesn't really add up to much if there's anything brave about this album its braid that Bon Iver would see fit to package together a bunch of odds and ends that are mostly unfinished and try to sell it as a new album but because it is Bone Iver this album will be fond over regardless so I guess he's doing exactly what he needs to do to make his fans happy I personally though don't see what's so hype about some subpar folk Aronica some Peter Gabriel worship and James Blake revisions but whatever like I said there are a couple captivating songs here and there on this thing and there are plenty of beautiful ideas to be experienced on this album it's just that many of them don't go anywhere or they are cut criminally short I'm feeling a light too decent 5 on this album transition have you given this boney vert record a listen is you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and you you will cry because you probably hate what I think about this album and that's fine feel free to be angry down in the comments open invitation I hope you have a good day otherwise of forever 
kNaKCPqR4I0,hi everyone oh goody a shadow yeah then - that's better than that and it's time for the most painful segment on this channel the why you know review where I go over a series of Records that I didn't get a chance to review in full with a formal review this past month so I'm just going to talk about them in brief with a bunch of short biased opinions in this video right here to sort of make up for it in some kind of way it probably never does you guys probably come away from this video more pissed off than you do please but hey that's okay we don't always get what we want this is the latest record from this experimental hip-hop music producer and I didn't enjoy his last record break through quite a bit but this new album over here I'm not really enjoying the change of pace too much it seems like the Gaslamp Killer is drifting away from some of the experimental textures and loops that he used to work with and instead is trying to come together with some kind of mix of jazz fusion hip hop with like a lot of live instrumentation with sounds like live instrumentation mixed in there which on paper sounds really fantastic like that's a pretty ambitious undertaking but the actual execution here is really mild and underwhelming and kind of boring like the performances aren't that good neither is the playing a lot at the time like it's super mediocre like playing as far as jazz standards there's nothing like you know super flashy or colorful or exciting about it so while he does kind of pull together these influences in a way successfully and he does create at least a vibe that embodies hip-hop and jazz together at the same time there's nothing really that entertaining about it beyond that the collaboration that nobody wanted but God did they try to make it work the end result here is just like I don't know it's it's like they tried to come together with a quirky blend of rap pop and rock music not too unlike the gorillas at some points but way less well written and performed there are some points arm pretty amazed at how a the RZA goes on his verses but a lot of the time the album just ends up feeling awkward and goofy and just totally out of place like so many different sounds that don't complement each other all happening on the same song it's a mess and only something I would recommend you listen to if you're a hardcore fan of RZA and Paul banks and even then you probably won't enjoy a great deal of what's on this record it's gonna be more of like a morbid curiosity for you I think man against me really did it on this one with a series of mild attempts at trying to make punk music and then a bunch of middle-of-the-road pop rock sounds that they sound really awkward trying to mimic not really sure what the takeaway from this album was sure it sounds a little better than some of the moments in the 2000s when the band was trying to keep up with the pop punk Joneses but now they're just completely without a direction on this record over here as they really just kind of buffet pick like oh let's do a little power pop let's do a little bit of throwback rock-and-roll let's do a little bit of this to do a little bit of that and a lot of it doesn't really sound that great on top of that the vocals which are usually a focal point for against music against me music super passionate super exciting super electrifying very much not the case on this new record over here just as middle of the road is almost everything else the band is doing on this record the rap legend and one of hip-hop's true eccentrics comes through the new LP over here which shouldn't be too surprising because he's super prolific he's always dropping something but that being said the feature list on this thing is incredible people from slug to MF DOOM 2 necro are on this thing the beats are super grimy this thing to me reads like an alt rap record that if it had dropped on stone on Stones Throw Records like 10 years ago it would have been labeled as a classic still though a lot of the lyrics are pretty meat and potatoes for Kool Keith a lot of the beats are super skeletal and stripped back to the point where it's kind of a turn-off and a lot of the chorus is on this thing are terrible not a whole lot of song structuring either as like there's not really much tension or build up to the introduction of a lot of these guests on these tracks they just kind of happen in whenever they happen to pop up on the track given that usher was in a position to really make an album on his own terms this time around like there's really no harm in him experimenting and trying new things and really venturing out at this point in his career this album ended up way more generic and commercial than it should have I thought he'd really kind of take a few risks on this thing but the few moments where it seems like he does that he just kind of does like a little bit of a throwback R&B and synth funk thing which comes off super bland and uninteresting is this album in a way kind of makes a sure sound like a relic when it was only ten years ago the whoo that he was dropping chart-toppers he just sounds more irrelevant than ever on this new album Jack White acoustic recordings 1998 to 2006 with an album title like that how could you go wrong seriously like Jack White is giving you acoustic cuts of some of his best songwriting over the past ten years or so it's good you know and what makes this album good is kind of self-explanatory you know which is why I'm not really reviewing it in a formal review but I am recommending it making sure it doesn't slip by you guys because this is a good collection of gems acoustic gems from Jack White and unfortunately one of the better records he's dropped in a while as I think a lot of his recent solo efforts have not really been that consistent this is a very good you know kind of detour for him to release because it's going to please old and new fans alike I was pretty hyped for this record but unfortunately it's it's just not as entertaining as their previous album it seems less dynamic this time around their sound and the album itself like every single song is subject to the same kind of flat distorted saturated sort of lo-fi sort of shook AZ pop punk noise punk sound it's very catchy a lot of the time I do like the performances and the writing on this thing but it seemed like there was more sonic diversity across the tracks on the last record where is this new one over here is super uniform to the point where just gets old after a while I mean while there is a particular sound to these tracks I wouldn't say it's particularly good sound I think it's kind of a restricting sound it takes away a lot of the body of the vocals of the guitars of the drums and makes everything a little little burnt out in my opinion hoping that the band can sort of come through with a sonically lush and texturally rich album on this next record but with a more high fidelity recording that doesn't just kind of smudge the band's instrumentation together in a sort of unpleasant way Tom really shoots for the stars on this one and tries to make his pop record not that he hasn't been dabbling in pop music before but this is truly like his pop record he has drifted completely away from that whole alternative R&B PB R&B label that has been thrown to him so many times a label that probably wouldn't be where it is today you know a sound that wouldn't be where it is today if not for his early releases under the how to dress well name still though the results as he pursues this new brighter more upbeat sound are super mixed um really inconsistent album unfortunately boring thanks for the meme though the melon meme is a good meme good mean these guys can penalties in tune and they can certainly channel that whole 90s indie rock sound and vibe thing they're obviously huge fans of pavement but they're still yet to come through with a sound a style a vibe of their own I still don't know assemble Z guitars song when I hear it to be completely honest like I still cannot pick this band out of a lineup and I've heard every album they've come out with up until this point and they're on their fourth record if by your fourth record you can't settle on or sort of develop a sound that people can remember you for but I don't know what's what's going on you know I mean really I'm at a loss you know I think there are some good elements to it the band is doing again in terms of songwriting and I think the performances are good and the vocals a lot of the time are pretty passionate but still at this point I just feel like I'm listening to a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy and it's not really that interesting I have never cringed this hard at a the Antwoord record and I plan on never sort of listening to one of their albums again because this this was truly terrible lyrics were awful production is easily some of the muddiest and worst on their entire discography sounds like it was recorded on a potato I've never really been a huge fan of this band but I can at least appreciate and admire the fact that they went for a more lo-fi and raw sound this time around instead of just kind of you know washing their sounds away into the dreamy aesthetics that their previous records exhibited but having said that this record just kind of came off really sloppy and just a bad presentation in my opinion not really the vibrant and colorful sounds from their last albums still though obviously that was the the intention here to make something that was a little bit more rough around the edges I suppose but uh but without sort of that I don't know sort of dreamy barrier between the listener and and warpaint it just kind of reveals that there's a real lack of fundamentals to the songwriting and the performances on this thing the album a lot of the time just sounds like a big mess and whoever produced this thing I would not invite them back to produce my band's album again new record from every time I die I've never really been a huge every time I die fan like they've never really made a record that I thought was so fantastic I was head over heels for but they're they're far from being one of the worst metalcore bands out there you could do a lot worse by metalcore standards of a still even today there's like nothing really about the band's style or songwriting or really anything that that like really excites me you know I guess metal cores genre that I either like to be so brutal that I'm just kind of like you know blown away by the brutality or you know I enjoy the more sort of progressive and experimental and noisier bands like a converge and the like every time I'd I just kind of sits in this weird middle ground that doesn't really excite me or entirely bore me now I certainly understand people continuing to enjoy the band's music it's great that they've been able to sort of carry on all this time without certainly selling themselves short artistically or totally selling out and just kind of making like you know crappy generic scenester fake-ass emo music and that kind of so you know they're gone strong with the sound and the style that they've been rocking for well over you know a decade at this point and it seems like there's no sign of them slowing down soon so you know amen to them you know for continuing to go forward and sort of keeping the torch burning it's just not burning for me that's all I think this commercial debut kind of proves that Micky Blanco is a more interesting figure than she is actually a voice or an artist or a performer because a lot of the lyrics and I do enjoy that song with Woodkid a lot of the lyrics the singing the rapping the instrumentals on this thing are awful if any other artists had put this record out that they would like you know be getting reamed over how bad this album is but in my opinion there's not really too many good things about this record it's just super sloppy super lazy again a more interesting figure than a voice I admire what Micky Blanco is doing you know it seems like she inhabits a very unique corner in music today but as far as like the art that is presented on this album it's very mediocre ah it's okay it's alright session have you given any of these albums a listen if you did did you love them did you hate them or would you rate them you're the best you're the best pusher driver next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on any of these albums which you most most likely do probably at least a couple of them alright hope you guys are having a good one eat your fruits and veggies drink some water stay hydrated forever

on onto this channel I swear to God Kalas a reason people watch your channel that is true that is completely true hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music area you know it is and it's time for our great albums of this past month segment where I go over the records that were my favorites from this past month hopefully none of them slipped through the cracks for you guys you give them a shot all of the links relevant links are down there in the description box to the reviews places where you can listen to tracks from these albums hopefully you get turned on to some some music you like the in this past month has blessed us with many good records in my opinion many good records blessed us with many good bits of music and I shall list them out right now I want to give a shout out to the new Danny Brown atrocity exhibition fantastic experimental hip hop record Danny's wildest release to date no release to date one of the craziest hip hop records I've ever heard ever in my entire life thank God for Danny Brown that's all I got to say really twisted deep dive down into the rabbit hole of addiction mental illness and drug dealing on this thing it's a sick dark crazy record alright moving on from there of the new neurosis album also a Dark album a bit of a sledge metal record a doom metal record here the band is kind of stripping back the heavy saturated sounds of modern sludge metal production for a release that is also heavy but is a little more compositionally intricate some good performances on this record as well just a very raw feel all around I'm really liking the direction the band is moving with on this thing they're kind of taking it back to basics on this record and the results are pretty great new preoccupations album these guys were formerly Vietcong this is their self-titled album and on this record over here I think they do a better job of kind of creating a distinct sound and vibe for themselves still sounds very post punky but it's very noisy abstract strange unsettling difficult to read emotionally it's an odd little rock record that has some good grooves and good Tunes on it liking the way these guys are really taking art into the app really taking rock into the abstract again and coming out with some good results so if you're into post-punk into art Punk into art rock into experimental rock that has a that has an aggressive side that is at least a little accessible and easy to digest don't let this album slip by you moving on from there to Chez amore with Stage four incredibly crushing and depressing record over here powerful scream oh and emo album bit of a post hardcore flavor in there as well and the band experiments further with incorporating some sounds of indie and like some post rock in there too they're really putting the other most diverse album yet but what really impresses on this album are the incredible lyrics which are conceptual they're narrative they run across the length of the entire album and they deal with the death of frontman Jeremy Bowles mother who passed away not too long ago of cancer this album sort of being about her passing and her diagnosis which Jeremy kind of struggles to deal with on one song after another it's a pretty emotionally potent reading along with lyrics not that you necessarily need to you know but you don't want to miss a beat reading along with the lyrics while listening to this album is a pretty intense experience I'll just say that Street sex with n position if you're looking for an incredible industrial noise power electronics rock punk album this is a mind-blower guys this is like so powerful so overwhelming so animalistic so aggressive so colorful the way that these guys use riffs and beats and samples on this thing is absolutely nuts a really creative and colorful album over here looking forward to seeing more from these guys in the future Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have a fantastic new record out titled skeleton tree one of the moodiest and saddest albums that you're going to hear this year I guarantee it Nick Cave comes through with another kind of Spacey album if you're into push the sky away you're probably going to enjoy that very same songwriting style on this new album over here but now the emotions are so much darker there's so much more brooding on this record so that that to me is part of what made it so entertaining clipping with splendour and misery clipping comes through with a short but fantastic concept album about what I guess is a space traveler stranded in space on what was I suppose an intergalactic slave ship it's insane and finally I want to give a shout out to angel Olsen's my woman a really great singer songwriter and rock record over here angels and really coming into her own on this album not only pulling together some of her most raw and in-your-face songs yet but also some of her best ballads as well on the second half it has an interesting little separation point at the middle of the album where all of a sudden all of her sort of low-key cuts come on followed immediately by all of these like you know garage rockers and rock bangers whatever you would call them so yeah some of our best lyrics to today I think so enjoying that record a lot enjoying all those previous records I mentioned a lot and I hope you guys try out any of these albums that happen maybe slip by you over the past month you know we do have some hip hop in there some experimental rocks and singer/songwriter stuff so there's a good mix you know for for everybody I hope and um yeah that's it guys alright I will talk to you later thank you for watching transition have you given any of these albums listen I hope so I hope so again links down there in the description

ouOt4KWwfJ8,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I tell you the best and worst tracks of the week according to yours truly before we get into the best tracks of the week as usual let's kick it off with the worst tracks of the week but first if you want to support this segment hit up our amazon associates link down there in the description box if you live in the US and you click on that link anything you buy on Amazon we get kickback from it use it to just buy some stuff you were going to buy anyway alright moving on to the worst tracks of the week a good handful of worst tracks this week not too many this this wasn't like an eventful release week in in my opinion so you know we do have some material here but not that not a whole ton of material I will give a shout out to the new Juicy J track ballin featuring Kanye West which was an incredibly generic track for both Juicy J and West both of their performances were super underwhelming especially that awful line about hitting the club like a golf ball on this track just a painfully boring song that I just don't know why either of these artists had anything to to do with moving on from there we have a new track from the chainsmokers all we know which is just another painfully generic piece of EDM nothing really special there but you know still it just baffles my mind how tracks like this are still popular because there's really nothing specially interesting about them moving on from there we have Neil Horan I'm not pronouncing his name correctly but I honestly at this point could care less of course Zayn had to go solo from one direction so the rest of the members are going to find out ways to go solo he has like this new like a little acoustic single out and I don't know it's kind of like Ed Sheeran but even more like I don't know generic just even less personality so absolutely boring right there and also uh the this track from the upcoming goat album Requiem these guys are kind of a psyche rock outfit who with their album world music didn't really give that a very positive review though people like Gaga for that record I have no idea why to be completely honest but having said that I got kind of morbidly curious as to what's going on with their latest record because they did come out with their last album a while ago and I didn't really try it and they have disturbed one coming out in Sub Pop Records I figured okay three albums in they have to have matured a little bit they have to have you know maybe gotten some better songwriting into the mix or something I tried out this track called alarms this is just a pile of psychedelic slop there's really nothing compositionally about this track that is interesting or I don't know is any of the even really written I don't know it doesn't sound like it and the performances are terrible the vocals are god-awful and the instrumentation what what instrumentation there is on this track the way that comes together again sloppy super sloppy like it's such a mess and not even like in a chaotic overwhelming like aggressive kind of way there's kind of like in a lazy we did too much drugs and went into the recording studio kind of way so it's really kind of baffled as to what exactly go is bringing to the table still on their third album over here but these tracks though they are some of the worst tracks of the week they are not the worst track of the week that prestigious title goes to the latest single from corn featuring Corey Taylor of all people the song a different world which has an amazing chorus about like cathing me telling me it's it's pretty it's pretty garbage it's pretty terrible yeah I think even people who have managed to pull off the mental gymnastics that would be necessary to continue to be a Korn fan in 2016 or even going to have a hard time justifying this one justifying this chorus justifying this track you could at least make the argument that the Skrillex collaboration album was something new or a risk that the band needed to take in order to stay relevant and just stay in the mainstream stay on the minds of people but there's really no excuse at all for what's going on in this new tract but I digress let's move on from there let's move on to the tracks that I wasn't really in love with I didn't really hate I was just kind of met on these tracks sort of been different toward these tracks though I do think they are worth at least a little mention we do have mr. Alex Frankel of Holy Ghost Fame coming out with a new single negative space he has a new project on the way and even though I don't really find the track as entertaining as I do many Holy Ghost songs it's it's still kind of catchy you know it's got a bit of a new wave thing going on a bit of a synth pop thing going on of course so if you're really into that sound give this thing a shot the weekend came out with a new track false alarm and believe me it is a false alarm the false alarm people false alarm the tracks not that good it's a total mess I have no idea what Abel was thinking on this track that Daft Punk collaboration came together so well but this new track over here while there are elements to it that I think are really cool some risky elements like the way that the chorus on this thing ramps up with this driving beat sounds kind of like a bit of a post-punk thing or a synth Punk thing or a new wave thing it's pretty cool what he's doing and I love the shouting vocals at this point on the track though I think this is the point where most people are turned off by the cut though where I find the song boring is on the verses which just kind of seem like filler seem like dead space just kind of seemed like some sort of placeholder to sort of take up time and lo people into this sense of I don't know indifference before the chorus explodes and it's like oh wow actually something is happening you know I think the verses should be just as good as the chorus if not better but actually they're just really under written and there's nothing all that intriguing about them so moving on from there we have Jaguar ma with sippin slipping I can't read sorry this is a bit of a I don't know just a really middle-of-the-road dance track I was kind of hoping for something a little more vibrant from these guys on this new single and this new album but unfortunately this is just really a faceless ethereal kind of alternative the alternative I told you I can't talk today alternative dance track can't talk today or read today that didn't really rub me in a good way or a bad way you know is just uh you know really just a thing you know nothing all that special about it moving on from there we have civil civic unfortunately in the Mac category with their new single called the mirror which to me just kind of sounds like their usual grimy driving bass and punchy sequence drums formula with some way way way way way reverb din glossy sit synth leads thrown on top of it which doesn't really add much to the equation in my opinion doesn't really add much to the to the duo's aesthetic or sound so I don't know I know these kind of psychedelic layers of synths are pretty popular right now but it doesn't really work in the context of their usual bassline and drums i meanshe change your sound do some new you know you guys have been working with the sound for a while now but it just kind of seems like your usual foundation of the civil civic track with just some glassy synth window-dressing thrown on top but moving on from there our final met track is the the kings of matt the kings of leon with song around the world this might end up being one of the blandest rock albums of 2016 people take notice take notice alright moving on from there we have the best tracks of the week want to give a shout out to Radiohead with their new b-side ill wind didn't hear it but I'm sure if I was buying the deluxe edition of a moon shaped pool I would probably enjoy it alright and the next track in this best tracks category total shocker people a drum roll drum on your desk here just build up some tension build it thank you Kid Cudi surfin yes a Kid Cudi song is in the best tracks part of this video and that's because it's actually good track this is one of Kid Cudi's better singles in a while I love the mix of African funk and jazz elements in the instrumental here some of the sampling is awesome some of the sort of jutting jerky melodies at the beginning of the track are fantastic and even Kid Cudi's vocal melodies are I guess more pronounced and the word I want to say is decisive than the usual aimless annoying terrible moaning that he usually employs on every single one of his tracks like he actually seems like he's focused on this cut I will say some of the lyrics are pretty corny on this cut like when he says the industry is fully shit is full of shit and like this song or he is the enema god why but having said that still I think Kid Cudi's vocal delivery on this track is solid I think the song is well written I like the idea of him not having this hyper this trend that he's writing so he kind of creates his own wave even as somebody who's not really a Kid Cudi fan I have to admit that you know he's kind of on a wavelength all his own in a way so there are a lot of elements of this track that I think are good and he doesn't come off as delusional as usual on this cut either yeah you know vocal delivery the instrumental the production some of the lyrics don't really have a lot of issues with this track ethics the solid track good on Kid Cudi hopefully the rest of his new album is just as good praying praying to the rap gods that's that's all that's all I have to say moving on from there we have this is not a track but something I want to turn you guys on to and give a little shout out to and you know maybe you have you guys go check it out homeboy Sandman and Aesop Rock have a new EP out a new free EP via Stones Throw Records we will leave a link down there in the description where you can go check that out download that thing give it a listen these guys are both great and it's cool that they collaborate with each other so frequently captain Murphy aka Flying Lotus comes through with this track crowned via the Adult Swim singles collection this track was kind of short and not really your typical hip-hop song or anything like that it's a very theatrical a very narrative base and it seems like the instrumental is just there to I don't know kind of create tension it's not like there's a point where like some hard beat comes through where the song really gets going it seems like a teaser or a taster to something which is kind of obnoxious to me in a way because it seems like every single new song that we hear from captain Murphy just sounds like a cliffhanger of some sort you know it's it's not like we're listening to a finished product or anything and all I can do is hope that these tracks are building up to an album because if the fans really want anything it's another captain Murphy record I mean I thought the last record was okay but there was just so much potential to a flying Louis was doing on that album that there has to be more you know there has to be something else to this project that he's pulled together and you know hopefully he ends up delivering on that moving on from there we have Dillinger Escape Plan with symptom of terminal illness really another kind of creative metalcore mathcore track from these guys excited to listen to their final album unfortunate that they're breaking up but at least they're kind of ending it off with the finale consciously you know nothing worse than putting out a great album or putting out an album and then you know a year later without anybody foreseeing the band it's kind of breaks up so you know they're kind of ending it on their own terms that's a good thing and finally the witches with crest of death I've reviewed these guys before I think in a previous segment on this channel favorite track segment I said they were from Australia they're not from Australia they're from the UK I'm an idiot okay so I apologize for that but still this track over here kind of a surprising change of pace for the band not so much the very noisy and chaotic psyche and garage that I'm typically used to from these guys but this is kind of like a I don't know a bit of a punk track kind of a noise rock track on this thing it's it's definitely not the throwback elements to the 60s that I've heard these guys work with before you know it's definitely a little more modern a little more aggressive definitely more gruff so and I think they play to these sounds really well so you know they incorporate these sounds nicely you know they're they're not just like you know trying it just to try it they pull it off well and yeah there's going to be my favorite tracks of this week the best tracks of the week the worst tracks the week the men tracks of the week thank you guys for watching I appreciate it and again hit up that

be a 10 it's gonna be a 10 baby get he's wearing the yellow that was probably gonna be an 11 it's gonna be the first 11 he's wearing two yellow by even be a 12 could be a 12 a 12 classic hi everyone don't send me talk tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Danny Brown album atrocity exhibition grimy Detroit rapper Danny Brown is back with his highly anticipated follow-up to his 2013 album old which was a commercial change of pace from his breakout mixtape xxx now old it was a decent record however it was packed with way more festival bangers and indie pop crossover features than I had really wanted the whole record didn't really come off as raw and his adventurous and his personal as xxx did I get it though you know Danny had a new audience who loved his party songs and he wanted to feed that demand and I feel like he had chased after those more mainstream aspirations without selling himself super-short artistically and I was kind of curious as to where he would go from this album because it seemed like he could continue to make twerk anthems until every attendee at Coachella had od'd but given his knack for lyricism and flow his kind of wild artsy side Danny has the potential to go down in hip hop history is one of the most unique MCS to do it and it seems almost like that's the the reputation he's aiming for on this latest record over here and going into this album I expected as much given the really grim dark disturbing cover also the label change on this thing switching over to warp records how could this album not be experimental in some significant way also when he initially dropped though when it rains single I wanted to know if he was going to take sort of more of a party direction with this new record as well and it turned out to just be one of the most batshit insane things he had ever recorded what would have been surprising is if this album had ended up tame by any stretch of the imagination and it certainly didn't it's not tame to the point where I think Danny might turn off some of his more basic listeners with this record who wanted to come for the high but they didn't want to stick around for the withdraw on atrocity exhibition we go back to the more raw personal angle of XXX but now we are going further down that rabbit hole of life crushing addiction dope fiends and mental illness and Danny complements these tracks with some of the weirdest flows and instrumentals he's ever worked with right from the introductory track downward spiral which is a concept an idea a thing danny has rapped about in the past the vivid lyrics on this track are pretty much all about the rut that Danny finds himself in but the oddest thing about the track is is the instrumental that Danny seems to be spinning on which sounds like some kind of weird psych rock passage with sunburnt guitars that blossom in the chorus Danny sounds less like a rapper on this track and more like the frontman of some kind of weird underground band it's an odd but very fitting introduction to this album and things get odder on the next cut tell me what I don't know which features these break beats and analog synthesizers and what sounds like I don't know some kind of weird synth whistle sample stuttering away as Danny raps about what seems like a point earlier in his life where he's making reference to a friend who died when he was younger living a fast life and this track is delivered in a very low-key somber tone of voice not the trademark Yelp that you're used to listening to from Danny Brown and he typically will go softer he typically will go quieter and rap in a more norm register when he is touching down on the topic that seems to be very depressing for him that Yelp that screamed that shaggy transitions back to it on the song really doe which is a fantastic posse cut that I had waited to listen to all the way through it's everything that I hoped it would be and more featuring features from absol Kendrick Lamar Earl Sweatshirt a Bangor beat from Black Milk with this great piece of percussion this great percussive loop topped with what sounds like a very eerie set of glockenspiel arpeggios every verse on this track is great I honestly can't pick which one is my favorite but I will say the highlight kind of is Earl who does bring in his verse last and the reason why is that I did not expect him to go so crazy and aggressive with it not that I think he's incapable of that I just think it's great that he matched the energy of the track so nicely on the song lost the downward spiral of this album continues as Danny tells this grim tale of drug dealing with hilarious opening lines to both of his verses like I'm Spielberg with ill words and hoes on that curb got a screw loose I'm cuckoo mentally disturbed and I'm like Kubrick with two bricks and hoes on strip off a two-piece a toothpick I flick and I preach the beat also features this really odd stuttering groove that doesn't quite make sense to my ears but Danny rides on top of it as if this beat is as smooth as butter now the album shifts gears at this point a little bit it's kind of like the experimental levees just really break open and Danny introduces some of the weirdest tracks and the track listing here which makes this point in the album pretty volatile like on the song ain't it funny which blows my mind every time I listen to it Danny's wild delivery seems like it's intensified even more as he's rapping on top of these honking blurting blaring horn sections and is really simple one to beat it's really something to behold and the next few cuts for me go so weird that they're almost challenging more challenging than they are entertaining like on the song gold dust which has a bit of a post-punk II instrumental in the background makes sense given that there's a Joy Division sample back there of the song atrocity exhibition obviously a reference point to the title or the title reference point to that you know what I'm saying there are some weird horns worked in there sounds like almost like a middle-eastern groove the way that the song is kind of chopped up Danny comes through with this relentlessly insane flow that barely holds on to the instrumental he's like an animal on top of this beat it's like he doesn't even care if he syncs up with it all the way and he almost overpowers it with the volume of his voice too it's like I can barely make out what the instrumental is doing a lot of the time he's just rapid-fire rapping all over this track as if he had just taken all the uppers that he's making so many direct references to in his lyrics and the song white lines I found to be a little difficult to swallow at first but ultimately it did grow on me the track features this booming beat in these really weird sporadic lead melodies that are laid down by the alchemist on this instrumental and Danny sees fit to just syncopate his flow with these melodies Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada and it creates a pretty weird effect and it's on this track that it becomes apparent to me that we're just traveling further down this atrocity exhibition rabbit hole travelling further down this downward spiral and it seems like the more pleasure Danny seeks the less pleasure he actually has the more pain and fear he actually has to deal with especially at the end of this track where he is afraid or makes mention of the fact that this might be his time to go you might owe Dee this time we have the Erie banger pneumonia which has the soul-crushing chord progression to it and in some really eerie eerie like with sin notes that just ring out just echo out very strangely sounds like something out of a horror movie shout out to Eddy in Christ on this instrumental here schoolboy q adds a little ad-lib stuff in the background like some guest vocals but not a verse not a hook or anything like that but his voice does add quite a bit to the song and Danny goes absolutely freakish on a lot of these verses shouting at the top of his lungs about the subtleties of drug dealing from the broken scale that he's now trying to eyeball his drugs because of as he's sort of packing them up to powder stains on his clothes and the song dance in the water is another hype mind-blowing moment maybe the most explosive track on the entire album featuring a music sample that I cannot even start to like put a finger on it's got kind of a watery post-punk e bassline but then on top of that like these primal drums and what sounds like these tribal chants and if you want to know what the song is about you need to look no further than the hook on here is Danny sings over and over dance in the water and not get wet dance in the water and not get wet essentially playing with fire and not getting burned living on the edge but not paying the ultimate price that is Danny Brown's mission statement that is the theme of this album the song from the ground with Colella I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly I'm sorry if I didn't has a very eerie and pretty beat to it it's very much needed cooldown moment in the tracklisting here lyrically it is kind of Danny Browns started from the bottom not to make a direct comparison to Drake but this is a little bit of an origin story for Danny Brown I guess talking about the foundation he needed to lay down in order to get to areas today it's also one of several tracks on this record that I wish were a little bit longer but there's an element to this record that reminds me a little bit of like mad villainy in that there are so many tracks here that just end so quickly delete delete' it's coming really quick with an idea a theme a story and then they leave you and just right on to the next one the song when it rained is another cut that sounds like no rap song I've ever heard and that's the thing about this record there's so many tracks on this thing they're like what where the hell did this even come from like what fucking planet was Danny on he was coming up with this record when his producers were coming up with these beats I mean I'm sure there are tons of weird experimental beats in the vaults of guys like The Alchemist but for him to like come across these beats and be like yeah I could totally just be on that beat and come up with a great song with it these are not instrumentals that rappers would usually hop on top of like these are whacked-out beats any way with with when it rain the songs driving kick drums and it's jerky horn sample are absolutely insane also that rattling sound effect that sounds like something out of a cowboy movie and on the song today I mean Danny's lyrics on this track describing sort of where he's coming from and what he's avoiding via the life that he is living through music and going on the road and all that is borderline frightening and that's only intensified with the very tense today today today refrain on the track now the song get high is sort of another much-needed cooldown you know he does a good job of sort of providing these tracks that are more blissful or more low-key are more easy on the ears when he sort of hits you with something that's just off the fucking wall and the song features be real which i think was actually a great feature because it was sort of an aha moment for me I didn't really put two and two together until I heard this track and realized that Wow you know the Cypress Hill is kind of a really obvious influence point for Danny Brown that I've never really thought of before and now that be real is kind of on this track sort of doing a really weird almost Danny Brown inspired delivery singing very sarcastically about getting high it all kind of makes sense and Danny Browns lyrics on this track again also very sarcastic and are all about how you know your pockets are on E all these hardships all these struggles but ultimately getting high to escape these things is a fool's errand it's a futile effort now with the song hell for it Danny Brown kind of wraps the the whole theme of the record up by almost chalking it up to being a cautionary tale talking about how this is like the I lead these are the things that I do so you don't necessarily have to now that's just the track listing the album overall super impressed with it Danny has reached another artistic peak not only are his lyrics once again very well thought out very personal very vivid and descriptive sometimes hilarious as well finding some elements of dark or black comedy in the midst of all this pain and suffering that he's constantly describing now the instrumentals on this thing take this album to a whole another level those in the flows combined they create a sound that is not only unlike any Danny Brown release thus far also unlike any rap release I've heard thus far as far as contemporary experimental and abrasive hip-hop records go this could go toe-to-toe with the best of them this is like some mind-expanding shit and again I don't think everybody's going to like it I don't think everybody's going to get it especially given just how catchy Danny's last record was this is like you know really like some off the deep end stuff hopefully his fans stick with him and keep their minds open for what he's doing here because I really do think he's making some of his best music yet on this project I'm feeling a light too decent 9:00 on this thing I'll take and i9 is fine transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this record though you can leave a comment cool cool Danny Brown atrocity exhibition forever 
arcOA1XQZMU,grandpa Skrillex grandpa Skrillex grandpa Skrillex grandpa's Skrillex hey everyone Anthony Fantana here aka grandpa Skrillex the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new neurosis record fires within buyers one of the most legendary bands in sludge metal and doom metal are back with a new record these guys have multiple classics under their belts I recommend you check out albums such as souls at zero or through silver in blood can't go wrong with these and honestly I wouldn't really hesitate to recommend this new record either I'm finding it a little more engaging than the band's last full-length LP honor found in decay which in comparison with the rest of the band's discography was a bit of a dud but still not really a bad album a record that in my opinion proved that after almost 30 years neurosis is still one of the most consistent bands in metal after five years of studio albums silence they could still drop a decent record now as good as some of the moments on this record word did feel like neurosis was at a bit of a dead end with this very atmospheric slow theatrical dramatic post rock infused metal sound that they had been toying with since the late 90s and fires within fires recognises that and as a result takes a more direct approach now relatively direct because the songs on this record are like six to ten minutes long but it's not like neurosis spends a whole lot of time on this project kind of meandering and building tension and building a mood the riffs the drumbeats the vocals on this thing are quite aggressive raw and visceral a lot of the time it's almost like the band is going back to some of the earlier records in their discography before they started making the more atmospheric material that they're mostly known for today now that's not to say that this album doesn't have any subtle or moody moments this is a neurosis album it's just that the production doesn't really sound as dolled up as it has on the band's past few records which was a bit off-putting at first it's kind of weird hearing Anu do more sludge metal album that doesn't have that full compress heavily distorted saturated sound that most of these new records have that's kind of become the the gold standard over the past ten years which I think has been great for the genre sound but also has become a bit of a crutch for a lot of new bands who are just kind of lazily burying vocals behind the guitars they're barely intelligible not really writing interesting riffs or layering guitars all that interestingly because hey it sounds heavy as hell already neuroses have opted for the physical challenge here and have to overcome their lack of girth on this record with solid performances creative guitar layering some really gruff nasty vocals intelligible lyrics engaging song structures all of which are delivered on five monstrous tracks and there's not really a slouch among them each one of them is as pummeling as it is kind of haunting eerie and beautiful each track features multiple phases which flow together really nicely and logically and each track has its own personality its own little musical or sonic quirk to it to separate itself from the rest like on the song a shadow memory which features the album's most anthemic guitar leads and some very dramatic drum fills and some weird galloping grooves that I don't normally hear in this kind of music but it actually works the song fire is the end lesson has this really strange heavy massive monstrous monolithic wall of psychedelic guitars and what sounds like maybe squelching sense or something it's really overwhelming and isn't a monstrous because of the guitars kind of being puffed up too much it's just kind of one guitar on top of another guitar on top of another guitar for a really interesting effect also this passage is topped with some weird spoken word vocals that I thought were pretty interesting the song broken ground is maybe the most beautiful track on the entire record kicking things off with this very pretty serene ambient passage it sounds heavenly it sounds blissful which is why the band has to sound as hellish as possible when the song eventually explodes like around the 3 min and 30-second mark also it sounds like there's some kind of woodwind or like musical pipe worked into these heavy massive distorted riffs that actually complements the tune pretty well it's like the band is trying to work some Fulk elements into their music on this track in a very tasteful way and the closing track reaches the most Moody and melodic track on the entire record which features these vocal harmonies that I didn't think neurosis could pull off as well as they do on this thing not that they're super virtuous or anything like that but they are kind of unsettling and dark they're also these twangy guitar passages that strike me as maybe being a little country influenced or maybe like an early modest mouse record or something in a lot of ways neurosis is pulling out all the stops on this record the track eventually progresses into this hypnotic Jam which gives way to these thunderous riffs toward the end of the track every single song the song included has a really interesting structure like the band really came up with some creative ideas to guide us from one moment to the next on these tracks and didn't simply rely on how heavy they can make their production sound to sort of get themselves by and the opening track I think there's a good job of setting the tone for the album as being the dark mysterious and very raw raw raw an aggressive experience that it is I don't have a lot of complaints about this thing I mean it's not really reinventing the wheel or anything but it is a great sludge record and it's been a while since I've heard an album in this genre that's really blown me away or felt like it was a a compositionally sound compositionally creative again because I think all this heaviness all these trends toward these really saturated mixes I think the result has been a lot of albums that musically melodically riff wise are kind of so-so neurosis have script things back a little bit I think they've taken things back to basics in a way and the results really speak for themselves because we have five incredibly passionate and solid tracks on this thing I'm feeling a light decent eight on this record transition having given this neurosis album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which a tire of you next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my thoughts on this album though feel free to leave an angry calm in the comment section if if you neurosis fires within fires forever 
cmfv7f-0Mbk,gideon either's a new kid cuddly album and away you're gonna love it hi everyone ah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the noumic jenkins album the healing component this is the full-length commercial debut record from chicago rapper Mick Jenkins who broke a couple of years ago with his critically acclaimed mixtape the waters which brought a pretty synthetic wavy and like nautical vibe to the world of conscious hip hop now personally I have been let down by Mick's attempts to follow this project up most namely on his little waves EP so now I'm on this new project I'm hoping for a miracle here hope and he pulls through with something a little more worthwhile and while I do give make an A for effort on this thing this album and its concept are nowhere near as profound as he seems to think it is which all starts at this introduction where Mick is essentially framing himself not as a rapper but more of a prophet who is about to educate his audience as to what the healing component is ooh what's the healing component Mick I just don't know I'm too stupid to understand please explain it to me like I'm a baby when you are is bold on your album to put yourself in a position where you're talking down to your audience or talking to them for their benefit then what you're about to say better be pretty mind-blowing especially considering that the introduction here is not the only time we are subject to this airheaded conversation that works as a segue between many of the tracks here now as it turns out a spoiler alert the healing component is is like love it's love which is not a terrible topic but a topic that Mick delivers nothing but cliches on whether he's talking about romantic love or the world would be greater if we just loved each other we need to spread love we need to love ourselves in order to love others you love different people differently and you have a literal fence around your heart and of course all these messages come with a little side of of Jesus the j-man now there are a few moments where I think Nick takes an interesting narrative angle where he points out maybe a vacuum of love or a lack of love where we think there is sort of like on the track Strangelove where I guess he's kind of pointing out these inconsistencies where hey we're saying we're convincing ourselves that we love ourselves but we're seeing all this hatred we're seeing all this violence something isn't quite adding up and on the song drowning with bad bad not good doing the production doing the instrumental in the background on this track loved the instrumental on this cut I actually love mixed performance on this track as well his vocal sound less like a rapper and more like an old bluesman or like a soul singer or something and I actually think his lyrics on this cut are pretty intriguing as he makes reference I believe to a lyric from Kanye's uses the closing track they're bound to as Kanye says hey when a real one holds you down you're supposed to drown and mix sort of takes that line while it does sound good says wait a second something not quite right here like I'm supposed to feel like I'm drowning what sort of making this statement that love real love shouldn't feel abusive or harmful or painful in any sort of way which I guess sounds and feels nice but I think a lot of the time mix observations on the topic of love are pretty surface-level I don't know sometimes love might hurt sometimes love might feel like a bad thing sometimes love might not be that good and what are the obstacles of love why are the reasons we're not loving each other what makes love so hard and what makes Mick think that the world can just love each other that everybody can just love themselves if they try or at least he doesn't cast any doubt that that can happen on this record what about people who just don't deserve any love at all I mean love is something that I don't think should just be automatically given it's something that I think should be earned a lot like trust and not everyone is trustworthy half the time as I'm listening to the super idealistic lyrics of this record it's like I'm just being told an empty promise which is not the feeling I want to come away from this record with especially given all of these lines where Mick is essentially using his art to give the unwashed masses water water water on the song plugged he goes as far as to say that he has something that his audience needs for the billionth time comparing THC or the healing component to drugs truth be told there's a real lack of conceptual maturity on this record because once Mick has established some of these ideas about love and has delivered some of these flagship tracks toward the beginning of the record he starts just kind of I don't know detouring into different musical styles I guess to kind of pad the record out or give it some sort of variation like on the song has seen in Betsy doe which features these awful like roaring dubstep bass lines that I want to avoid like the plague or on the song communicate which might be a statement on sex and drugs but doesn't really end up sounding like a statement just more like another track about sex and drugs itself especially given the kind of hip House instrumental thumping away in the background not to mention this track features lyrical gems such as ru Bay I don't mean the San Francisco type and she wants a guy that can sing but she only ever wants to hear the the cenotes the cenotes but the tracks on this record that I think are tolerable that I think are good um a lot of them aren't even that impressive to me when compared to mix earlier material not only because I think some of the ideas behind this record are weak but the production isn't anything altogether new for make a lot of the time although it does occasionally go into something a little jazzy I guess my main gripe with the music and a lot of Mick's lyrics and his rapping on this album is that it is so understated it's so sleepy it's so faint it's so Spacey and Moody that a lot of it just doesn't leave an impact and impression on me Mick occasionally delivers really passionate performance like on the song fall through or the opening track as well which I thought a flow wise was pretty fiery and he pulls together a good verse or a nice string of wordplay like on the closing track the up outro which to me just kind of feels like a closed or out of nowhere because it doesn't really tie up the concept of the album or anything in my piñon it just kind of works as a finisher because it has one of Mick's most impressive lyrical moments on the record so in a way I guess it's a finale most of the time it just seems like Mick is unsure as to what to do with this very weak idea of a concept and a lot of the time he depicts himself on this very record as indulging in a lot of the hedonistic and materialistic temptations that you would think someone who's kind of propping themselves up as a Christian would avoid he doesn't even seem to acknowledge this inconsistency in any sort of way I'm not saying Mick has to you know sort of be a choirboy and be super behaved and can do whatever he wants but anybody who knows what Christianity is and understands what he's rapping about on some of these tracks will get some cognitive dissonance between the lines of these songs and they just kind of go unaddressed and maybe it could have made for an interesting topic I don't know and that to me is just one of many many many missed opportunities on this record love is such a huge and such an abstract thing Mick could have taken this record down a lot of different paths but instead he chose a very narrow view of love I think either that or just like an on view sometimes also delivered tracks that didn't really seem to support the narrative of the album the concept of the album all that well either and I don't know that this record just was not really one of his more impressive projects lyrically either for sure it had it's bright spots but I feel like sometimes Mick wastes his potential his lyrical potential on tracks that don't really stand that well because again the foundation the conceptual foundation that they're standing on is weak so even though there are maybe some decent lyrics in there some decent bars decent rhymes Flo's wordplay it's all kind of just a bit of a waste because the logic and the forethought that win to the bigger picture of this album is kind of flimsy I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what do you think I should have you next and that's it guys Anthony Fantan Oh make Jenkins the healing component you're the best but bye-bye 
L3E0kq9YkjA,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd Internet's busiest music nerd probably a little crazy in this video yeah that was my gum uh but that's because we we've run into a very special album right here a very different album uh an album that I think is the worst album of the year and album that I think will maybe go down as the worst album of the decade album that quite frankly um I I think will break the records of badness if there are such things now this album is a titled angelic to the core angelic Funkadelic slash angelic raka Delic it is a 90-minute record it's a double album and it's from the one the only mr. Corey Feldman who is most notably an actor who's been in numerous famous 80s films such as The Goonies and stand by me but for a while now he's been trying to break his way into the music industry with like a single here an album there and every time he's met with the usual mix of docs and cheers and polite applause and and that's no different for today where recently he appeared on The Today Show where he performed a song from this very album and God God is a SPAD this album is bad the seldom is so bad I can't believe how bad this album is I mean I knew it was going to be awful Corey Feldman not really a talented songwriter not really a talented singer not a talented lyricist not a talented musician and sort of looking like grandpa Skrillex on the front cover over here which I have no idea what why this couldn't have been properly cropped like there's crappy white lines on the side of the album cover and I have also left in the black lines at the top and the bottom of the cover because obviously that they're in there for artistic effect and he's sort of being brought out of the depths of Hell by two angels I guess and the 22 tracks on this record are painful really up there with Chinese water torture I can't even begin to describe how terrible this album is which is why I'm sort of in this very loose format right here because as I was writing my review for this record I realized there are some albums that are really beyond description and this is one of them this is one of those rare occasions where an album is beyond description and when I say this is like the worst album of the year it really is the worst album of the year like I dare you to find an out worse than this album and I've heard some terrible albums this year and I was thinking about writing a not good segment about like the latest die Antwoord album or like the new little Pete mixtape Hellboy which is like I don't know angsty white boy broken side quality garbage rap from the 2000s come back from the dead manifesting itself in a world that is influenced by like I don't know like bones and that white Iverson song from a rapper who shall remain nameless post Malone sorry for the lack of edits here but really I'm having a hard time sort of gathering myself and gathering the words here and preparing myself and really trying to prepare you guys for what we're about to embark on here so god damn it 22 songs on this thing 90 minutes on this thing um I just I just can't prepare you guys for what about to play you I just can't that I just wish there was something I could say that would take the edge off that would get you ready for what is about to happen here because this is pure fucking insanity this record this is insane this is like delusional to the most potent most disturbing degree like so delusion that you wonder if corey feldman like need some help or something because there's no reason anybody would make this album and then say this is a professional product this is totally finished no way we can improve this there's nothing we could do our work here is done I mean it's not even bad in the way that like speeding bullet to heaven is bad like Kid Cudi is uh trying to do something really weird and noisy and artsy or anything like that like Corey Feldman is is legitimately trying to write like pop tunes here like like pop hits he's doing his best to copy like electronic dance music the the song go for is really dubstep influenced like funk music sin function called acts in a couple times his songs have always kind of like pulled heavily from MJ for whatever reason and uh it's just like every awful idea musically corey feldman has ever had just turns up on this record um and but before I even get into playing some of the music on this thing I will say that interjecting between some of these tracks are these really weird skits where I think Cory is playing the male voice in the tracks and it's kind of like he's ripping off Charlie's Angels or just parroting Charlie's Angels and being like angels you have to do this and my mama bud talking to them through the loudspeaker or whatever but like every single time he plays the transition from Adam West's Batman which has nothing to fucking do with Charlie's Angels every single time I hear you play that it triggers me it triggers me because these are two worlds that don't collide and yet you're making to do it and the dialogue and all these skits reads like a bad porno like it makes the beavis and butt-head skits on speeding bullet to heaven seemed like highbrow comedy let's just get into some of the horrors on this album song's called ascension millennium believe it or not one of the word one of the better tracks on the record but kicks off with this really ridiculous little intro where I guess there's like maybe a devil or something uh I don't know I'm suffering on the inside that's all I can say come on the sound effects so we go ascension you oh my god and I say that's not one of the worst tracks on the record because it does like oh it does have like a coherent vocal melody and like in like a sensible beat and everything but still the stuff gets like batshit insane really fast on the next track eleven lies I'm not joking what like I I don't get this sort of religious devil angel kind of theme that some of the earlier tracks here play with because the the rest of the record doesn't dive into that all that much it's kind of like this album tries to have maybe like five different concepts none of which it fully explores like which concept you're hearing sort of depends it on what part of the album that you're in the middle of here we go [Music] [Music] like where the hell this little simple you'd come from it's totally ripped off from some other popular song I don't know which one but I know it is because the only part of this track that sounds good and oh my god Corey Feldman from oh yeah like what is this vocal melody he's trying to sing like it doesn't make sense at all like there's no rhyme or reason to this vocal melody oh Jesus Christ it's like he's not even in control of his own voice and then the auto-tune that he throws on top of it doesn't really know what pitch or key to put his voice in because it's like what the fuck what the fuck are you singing like you actually have to be trying to hold the note in order for the auto-tune to like put your voice where it needs to be but I'm not even going to try to make any more sense of this track literally those few seconds of this song that you heard that's all you need to hear if you just kind of want to laugh at it a little bit if you really want to make yourself question whether or not you should live and you know really get those suicidal thoughts bubbling up in your head please listen to this whole record because that's gonna happen meanwhile back on planet Earth why what why what why is why is the guy answering them before they give their answer like what why is this dialogue so awkward no II just your mission today should you choose to accept it is going to be a three part mission for one I need you to go out there and spread love right and to all the people of the earth if you were to do it lickety-split and remember go for it do it lickety-split um that you know this this bit of dialogue here references the titles to several different tracks on the the album and I have no idea what lickety-splickety is like does he know it's lickety-split like I don't understand what this lickety-splickety thing is I'll just jump forward and play this track which actually features corrupt of all people I don't know how he pulled like corrupt on this album I don't know how he pulled Snoop Dogg well Snoop Dogg shows up anywhere where there's a paycheck and fred durst I mean Fred Durst has made music that is almost as bad as this out I guess I'm not surprised by some of the features on this thing but here's this track called lickety-splickety yeah okay all right all right come on now why is corey feldman doing on this track oh I get every single verse he's doing this growly weird little voice where it's like it's kind like his angry little Michael Jackson yes I won my turn i'ma come Brandon down there like whoa he Wow I worry about Corey Feldman I really do worry about Corey Feldman after listening to this record I truly do meanwhile every time plays the stupid Batman music Batman has nothing to do with Charlie's Angels stop it me so I don't want to hear about Corey Feldman tasting anything in a sexual manner please thank you come to me attend this like Jesus Christ Oh [Music] [Music] again this is one of those moments on the record where Corey Feldman is clearly trying to pull from some track that that had a more talented artist recorded it back in the 90s it might have been a semi popular song but now he's just trying to like force this sound today and I don't know why like the it's it's one of many things about this record that makes me kind of sick but we'll continue a little bit further stop bitch oh no more of this skit it's terrible but this song is called bad people bad people there's probably a joke in there about bad music but I'm just too stressed out to even make it because this record really is taxing it is a taxing listen [Music] [Music] [Music] you could barely impersonate Michael Jackson 20 years ago you can do your you're even worse at it now you know like not that I thought that he might get better because sometimes practice does make perfect and Michael Jackson super talented guy a lot of that talent natural talent the kind of talented if you wanted to have it for yourself you would probably have to spend at least a decade honing those talents but Corey Feldman over here seems to have gotten worse at his Michael Jackson impression with age and it's just it's just unfortunate that this little duo of this little ditty over here I'm thinking of duo of the dynamic duo because this Batman music plays every single time but this little ditty is titled duh it is one of the worst dance songs on the entire record [Music] how is this legal how is this allowed how is this okay like shouldn't someone go to jail shouldn't someone be in prison I don't know um we have this song everybody featuring doc ice which is a funky a funky little cut from the record [Music] [Music] um Oh [Music] like how do you make this to be serious how can you listen to this would be like wow seriously good good oh my god this is a seriously good song guy oh no way I'm dying on the inside I swear okay so so being single from the project go for it with Snoop Dogg snoop Dogg what were you very thinking man what are you thinking I mean again listen I know money's cool but like can you at least for once be like hey listen this is a bad song I'm not gonna make it appearance on it you know like I don't care how much you pay me I just want to hear Snoop Dogg say those words one time I don't care how much you pay me I'm fearing on that song because I know he's never said those words I know he's never I know he's never uttered the words I don't care how much you pay me corey feldman i could appear on his song but yeah let's listen to this stuff they think of a number in your head how much money you would need to be paid in order to be on this song grandpa Skrillex brings the dubstep he brought the dubstep come on snoop don't disappoint us don't disappoint us new as your she there's like ten things going on at once while Snoop Dogg is rapping you can barely even tell what he's doing which I mean I guess if you're going to be involved in a Corey Feldman project is the ideal way to be involved like you know just bury me under so much stuff people won't even recognize me that's that's how I would like to be featured on a corey feldman project I guess if it was life or death though death would be the sweet release of death I'd consider it I'd think about it you know everything it would be a tough choice again what are these messy-ass horns hanging in the back I don't think they add the the epic backdrop that Corey was going for on this track that is clearly trying to be really meaningful all right we're just going to move on to one of my favorite tracks on this thing seamless featuring fred durst this is a very special song one of the funkier tracks on the entire thing I've never heard fred durst on a song so funky I'll just say that much yeah this this has happened do you hear this do you hear this Oh goddamn I can't I can't say no to the beat I can't say no to me it's like almost accidentally Punk like it's almost accidentally post-punk like the vocals are so bad that it's that it's a it's it's like accidentally doing something experimental um and then then the fred durst cut goddamn this is the Fred Durst feature why here we go [Music] oh damn oh damn what when you arm do this mix is terrible like these horns are so much louder than everything else stop please stop God and this is this is track 12 this is track 12 there's 22 tracks you know is it worth it I think you guys want to see me suffer more so why not we're already this deep we're already this deep we're already this close to killing ourselves let's let's just take that extra step and see if it happens [Music] why [Music] [Music] what is this what what he didn't record all this himself it was a producer involved right like nobody said to him hey yeah maybe we should do it maybe we should do another take you know you'd think there would be incentive to do that because the the producer might you know make some more money you know because the more hours you're in the studio maybe Corey Feldman did this in his own studio I really don't know I just feel like he couldn't do all this by himself there were other people there so nobody was like hey maybe this could be better maybe we could fix this or maybe maybe that's a bad performance oh the song is called negativity so I mean I'm hoping that the song really tears at the critics says hey you're negative about my music you're an idiot I hate you or you're stupid you're just a negative loser that's why you think my musics bad that's what I hope this song is about but if it's not then I'll be pleasantly surprised oh god what is this like a new metal song what's going on here this is like a hip-hop beat as well like took a dip touch touch to burn and earnestly but what is going on here [Music] [Applause] stop what is going on the the I don't even know where to begin with this track I mean from the awful guitar to what sounds like a very thin synth bassline uh korie's uh his vocals man and and then didn't didn't like this is another moment where it's like he's trying to borrow so much stuff from the 80s and the 90s and just making it sound awful in 2016 it makes me want to let never listen to a song from the 80s or 90s ever again you got me we're obviously in the angelic raka Delic section of them god this is really wearing on me this is really sucking me of energy I feel like I'm being drained I'm being drained power through it what is going on here and notice again like the whole Charlie's Angels thing is gone like the devil voices and all that stuff are gone like will but like where was all that shit in the bit lake where was all this shit going it just kind of disappeared you know now it's just like awful songs we're in the awful song portion of the the concept of the record I guess is what you can say [Music] oh gosh Oh miss rim pay and and bend it one day what is effect on his phone and why does it make his voice so loud and in the in the mix I mean I think I'm really the best option here cut your losses make everything else louder than your voice and the album would be semi listenable in in one's opinion okay we're down to the wire with this record however the last handful of songs here is really where the album like pulls out all the stops like the worst ideas on the record Cory really saves them for last this song over here titled for my love it's a touching little track about not being able to express one's emotions properly and he kicks the whole things off I kiss the whole thing off with a little bit of spoken word some string sections to make it extra dramatic it's like something out of a Disney movie sometimes words don't express the feelings something you don't really care doesn't matter [Music] [Music] how [Music] no bring the Stars up to the moon the stars are farther away than the moon wouldn't you have to bring the moon up to the Stars how does that make any sense Jesus get so scared I can I think say the words I mean why kill me now god damn that little simply likely would add a really nice touch guys God where oh this song this is one of the worst songs on the record this may be the worst song on the record you're in here why right away there's there's really no um there's really no buts about this being the worst track on the record you're gonna hear this and say wow Anthony you were right this is the worst song on the record come on suffer I want to die give it this is real and this isn't like a joke intro either I was waiting for this to be oh he's just joking he's just joking we're gonna get into the real song in a second no no that's not how it works like this is how he would sing at the intro of the song if I was trying to make fun of this song that's how I would sing but Corey Feldman is singing like this [Music] change you know I can see that I can see this recording being something that I maybe enjoy if like some other group had tried to duh do some like weird lo-fi tongue-in-cheek jad like vocal jazz track with like bad singing is like a joke or like a b-side or something but for it to be like a main feature track on your full-length album and be like the only like track that sounds like this so it's clear like standing out for a reason here and just the way that is he sings on this track so close to the microphone like he's trying to kiss the mic I don't know what he's doing I'm not sure he knows that we've all together and we do [Music] play it again Sam Wow that jazz certainly does swing you know um well it's it's stuff like this that when people say a book white people ruin everything um I know that's not true but in the face of this I can't I can't come up with a retort that's something we were together we won't it change [Music] um I I wish I had a hammer here because if I did I would keep tempo with this song on my skull with it he the this next track cuts the cuts together some new news clips some news clips Wow so Wow this court is Corey Feldman make it political on this track was Corey Feldman gonna I'm gonna take on some serious serious topics oh there's a piano it's probably going to be meaningful it's probably gonna be it's going to be about the world today and it's going to be a tearjerker too because everything's so sad damn words change in I gotta take a stand I got code inside a dream [Music] just me oh of course he had to go funky with it he had to go funky with it as soon as he started singing about the pain he had to go real funky with it had to drop that that funk rhythm guitar in there like that even makes sense like what [Music] oh yeah it's so bad that it's almost it's almost entertaining like if this were a some album a you know recorded by a crazy man this is an album recorded by a crazy man and maybe like years down the line I can I can go back and listen to it and have a laugh but just knowing that this is like Corey Feldman it makes it difficult to swallow I guess is what I'm saying not that I have anything personally against Corey Feldman but I've known that in the past he's released super mediocre music and the fact that he still still at it is uh I guess impressive in a way because he seems to get worse and worse ah just a couple more weird neat we're nearing the end here people we're so close I could taste it [Music] [Music] what is this vocal melody then Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin like it's not something sit down and really conceive of I guess seems almost improvised and in a bad way [Music] ah those harmonies came together terrible just like every vocal harmony on this record mind you but but there particularly it was pretty bad that was pretty bad [Music] [Music] no no stop it God stop it oh mercy the song is titled mercy hopefully it shows me some [Music] hopefully please Cory please I'm begging you go easy on me please I'm being prematurely aged by this album I feel like I'm 55 [Music] Oh [Music] chairman be by my lease ha ha thinking about my niece my niece I know he didn't say knees my niece I get he's a concerned uncle and then those vocals in the background BAM others thinking and a bow man do you like that's the kind of lyric that you could only do your own background vocal for because you're not gonna get any other jackass to record them bouncing off of you singing that we are going Babar noose boundaries so thank God for modern recording technology where you can sort of overdub your own vocals because that that that song would have never been graced with the baumanis Bala peace hanging in the background there [Music] haha my camp my camera is given out here it's like no more please and I'm sorry camera this have this course listen isn't it it's a mercy [Music] but that's like actual that's almost like a new idea on the Trekker that's like something like an R&B artists would sing today like hmmm si like this will end up on a weakened record or something uh mercy who mercy I could hear Abel singing I feel like you heard some weekend and then he recorded this like this is Cory Feldman's attempt at some glitzy glamorous you know chilly depressed little all R&B or something [Music] you gotta stop you gotta stop we're at the last track working class hero which cross my fingers is a is a cover of the of the song by John Lennon because if it was it would it would be very bittersweet mostly better but but bittersweet a proper ending properly confusing ending to put a bad performance of a head scratching cover at the end of really one of the most perplexing records I've ever heard in my entire life letter let er rip Cory let er rip no no no no no he's really trying to sell the full Kangol on this chat it's really raw isn't it truly dramatic Cory dramatic that's you though is something to be there's almost like Marilyn Manson's cover of the track oh yeah Oh [Music] no stop I'm waiting for there to be like a big like you know explosive like rock instrumentation popping up in the background because he's really building up the tension here you know there's got to be a moment of release where is like Oh whack and glass hero is something to be you know like guitar solos wailing away in the background drums pounding the lights are bright shining on Corey Feldman the the most working class hero motherfucker you've ever seen I tell ya God how's how it's even possible like there's distorted guitar blaring away now but the instrumental sounds almost quieter than it was than like a couple of seconds ago what [Music] what [Music] no no okay no we're done we're done here guys um this is the the this is the worst thing I've heard this year and you know I do like hey guys worse worst albums of the the year segment here let's let's give you guys a list of the worst albums of the year this this has to be number one this has to be number one I can't think of an album being worse than this I can I just can't conceive of a worse record um I can't even think of how to make an album worse than this I need the the sure you know there's like some messy sloppy bad demos out there but the fact that this thing is like close to being coherent but it's like also far away from being go here and it's like you know kind of saying but kind of nutso and yeah you know that this this thing this thing inhabits a special place I I guess I can say um Wow Wow but the grass here is sad and me I guess um yeah that's that's really as unnecessary as a closure gets for an album this long what does that even mean like what is what is the context of that within this album like what does it have to do with anything that he sung before this track and the alleged good evil paradigm of this record the rock funk paradigm of this record what did that crappy sudden out of nowhere jazz song have to do with any of the rock songs on the second half of the record the Charlie's Angels thing the god devil a heaven spirituality thing that this album has going again like nothing lines up nothing makes sense in terms of the concept in terms of the flow and and that rings true for the songs and the recordings on this album themselves none of them make sense they're all messy they're all sloppy they're all badly recorded they're all badly written like there's just enough there in order for it to sound like a song just just enough just barely enough there to make it sound like it's a song but it's awful songs it's like terrible songs it's not even just like bad masturbatory you know like just banging on pots and pans and going Ripper burger like certainly there is you know odd music out there like that but this this thing is just ah I want to leave I want to turn off the camera and I want to be done talking about this thing there's just something about the existence of the salamis at Anthony you got to talk about this because you can't not do worse two albums of the year segment and not talk about this and it's it's true this is the worst album of the year this will be the worst album of the year and it's almost like unfair you know to the other bad albums out there that would maybe like to be at the top of the worst albums of the Year lists you know it's it's it's really unfair because I feel like if they even wanted to they couldn't make worse music than this and um I don't know it's you know some people are just blessed with all the bad music talent you know some people just naturally make bad music and other people while they may try to make terrible music no matter how hard they try they'll never be it that bad of a musician so I guess all we can do is just hang back and be in awe of Corey Feldman's lack of talent why 
1qGj_m4V3Ms,hi everyone Matheny flag tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Wilco album shamil Co the Illinois rock folk and country outfit is back at it again here's Cal's country outfit I'm country man that is not a country shirt that is the million view flannel please take it off make me melon man the band are essentially music industry vets at this point 20 years going strong but wilcos last album star wars was kind of a strange change of pace not only because the album was originally released as a free download to fans but the LP also featured some wilcos most low-key indulgent and playful songs ever which was good and bad I mean it certainly gave the record a certain character because Wilco sounded like they were having fun and that they were far beyond the point of giving a about what anybody thought they don't really have anything to prove to anyone at this point in their career but a lot of the material because of that on this thing was sort of unimpressive and unambitious and we have roughly the same vibe running throughout this new album over here I mean it is titled sh milk oh right off the bat the band is almost telling you the amount of effort that went into this project almost giving you permission to write this one off if you feel like it and on the surface it almost feels tempting to do so from the kind of weird awkward acoustic ballads on here to the handful of electric rockers that make their way into the tracklist the entire album feels uniformly pleasant and unintrusive it's really best not to let your attention slip away from this album because there is a chance that it might never grab it back but if you do manage to focus on what the band is doing on this project from beginning to end or if you're just looking for something that may complement to a lazy Sunday Schmidt of a record like with the album star wars there are a handful of questionable experiments on this record that I know a more discerning Wilko ten years ago would have either fleshed out or developed into something more fulfilling or would have just kind of thrown into the scrap pile like on the song common sense which at No point in the song actually feels like it resolves in any sort of way as the track moves on it sort of gets more and more dissonant and cacophonous yet it is so quiet it is so low-key the tension on this thing is actually kind of obnoxious and there's also all these fluttering guitar notes layered on top of one another that come off really sloppy definitely not one of wilcos better executions and then there's the way the song quarters which is a pretty underwhelming tune as is suddenly just drifts into this sonic droney dream state or something that doesn't really sound all that great I mean I get it that in Jeff Tweety's lyrics he sings about being in a dream just before we transition into this moment but the transition itself is not all that graceful and on the song locator we see the band throwing some backwater vocal harmonies above what sounds like the quietest noise rock instrumental ever recorded it is kind of head-scratching and interesting but then the band all of a sudden just fades the track out out of nowhere as if they didn't really have any ideas to where to take it next having said that there are quite a few decent solid songs in the track listing here it's just that you've really got to focus on them because again they are so low-key they are so breezy they are so easygoing like on the song North American kids where Jeff Tweedy sings very gently about his upbringing which I guess was so mundane that he turned to drugs to kind of pass the time by or heal whatever depression he had been suffering at the time Tweety continues to wax poetic on his childhood on the track if I ever was a child which is very pleasant kind of country twang song cry all day is most certainly a standout even though the track is again very low-key very pleasant not really in your face or anything it still manages to whip me up because even though this instrumentation on this track is very gentle it moves at a very fast pace with a tight groove damned abandoned abandoned impediment and it's almost got a gallop to it I also like the rootsy vocal melodies coming out of Jeff Tweedy singing on this track too and on the track someone to love it's almost as if Wilco goes back to their first record a little bit and delivers to another quiet instrumentalism glam rock swagger it's got a bit of a power pop vibe to it I guess because he's really fuzzy muscular lead guitar harmonies come through at various points in the cut color things brighten things a bit pick the momentum of the album up now of course given this album's demeanor and the lyrical topics of many of the songs thus far of course the tracklist here has its share of very depressing very somber ballads the song happiness seems to exert anything but and the track shrug and destroy is maybe the most tortured of any on here with its heart grinding chord progression and very breathy lead vocals and a chilling refrain at the end of the track where Jeff Tweedy is singing when nothing is left rejoice when nothing is left rejoice this wasn't really a bad record I mean it has its handful of filler and tracks that could have been green to be better and there's not a whole lot of sonic variety or I guess a emotional variety to the record because again it's a little too uniform it's a little too all Pleasant it's a little too all breezy though it is kind of intriguing to see Wilco go a little further down this I don't care a rabbit hole we're going to do whatever we want whatever kind of feels comfortable and we will entertain whatever experimental whims grab our attention as well and while there are a good handful of very well-written songs on this record a great deal of this record even the good tracks feels very bland because a lot of the instrumentation is doing everything it can to not stand out I'm gonna just say I think this record is more for hardcore fans but I still manage to like it I'm feeling a light a decent six on this thing transition have you given this Wilco album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you disagree with my thoughts on this Wilco album hope you guys have a good one forever 
PBIBfrRgKlM,hi everyone youth in a tube here oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly tracks roundup segment where I tell you guys the songs those men just merely indifferent toward the tracks that I thought were the best tracks the week the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks of the week they are all linked in the description below this video along with our amazon associates link head on Amazon using that link anything you buy over on the site we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price but only if you live in the u.s. cool cool alright let's get through this a magic list of songs starting with the worst tracks of the week before I get too deep into this video I do want to address an elephant in the room pink guy has a new track out new mixtape on the way song is titled STFU it's actually pretty hilarious track however I recommend that rather than listen to the song yourself it is link down there in the description send the track to someone who you want to shut the fuck up because it is time to shut the fuck up and the lyrics are pretty direct so if you were to send this song to somebody else you'd really be getting your message across so they're you know yeah then we like to begin things on a depressing note on this this segment and because by the time we get to the best tracks we're in a good mood so you know start with your worst foot end with your best that's that's what I think um okay of course leading up to the release of the new record Green Day has another track out this one titled still breathing after this track I wish I wasn't some of the most cheesy metaphors I've heard in a rock song in a long time and they just kind of piled them one after the other after the other and it's just completely a tiring so this Green Day track did not like it but not the worst track the week moving out from there Opeth with the wildflowers didn't care for this track either Opeth insists on continuing down this progressive rock road despite the fact they don't really do the sound that much justice in my opinion but they're just kind of like Steven Wilson at this point they're just indulging in progressive rock nostalgia and not really pushing forward or doing anything that revolutionary interesting they're just kind of living this old progressive rock sound and really not doing much with it so that's just my opinion though from there we go to this one Hertz Dirty Projectors with keep your name new track from the Dirty Projectors famed indie and art rock outfit who have made some pretty interesting records in the past I mean they're pretty India idiosyncratic the the group's music so you know the it's not going to rub everybody the right way however this new track over here I can't see it really appealing to the group's fan base at all I mean maybe some newcomers who have never heard of Dirty Projectors before and kind of like the somewhat trendy sounds that are being hopped on to on this track might dig it a little bit but Dirty Projectors go down this weird alternative R&B sound it kind of sounds like fka twigs but even way more accessible than like her melissa EP that she just came out with and the horrible pitched down vocals that run through the entire track spare me I did not care for this at all some of the production seem kind of odd and off kilter I thought that was cool but the the tune the vocals and some of the glitchyness of the track which I think kind of kept the song from feeling as soulful as I think a song of this style should feel just completely tiring and uninteresting moving on from there we have a rap rock gem from the band attila the song is titled ignite and hey listen if you hate rap rock if you hate this band's music doesn't matter because if you go look on the lyrics to this bad boy they don't even care man they don't even care didn't even care that you hate them you're just a hater save your hate for another day that's one of the hot sort of retorts that the band actually writes into this song but please check this track out it's good for a laugh you will have a good laugh I promise you and finally worst track of the week in my opinion comes from none other than miss Scarlett Johansson apparently she's in a group or a band that was assembled maybe not for this perk but this group has sort of laid down a cover song on a new compilation of tracks that I believe are raising money for charity which makes it hard to be like hey guys the song is terrible it's it's for charity but still regardless they do a cover of New Order's bizarre love triangle and it is the flattest most uninspired cover of that song I've heard and I've heard a lot of covers of that song and believe me when you're talking about a new order cover you're kind of at an advantage right from the start because Bernard Sumner and I Love New Order one of my favorite bands Bernard Sumner not one of the better singers on the planet so you know there's kind of like a low bar of vocal technicality there to start with so you don't need to be the best singer in the world but you should at least sell the song but Scarlett Johansson sounds completely uninterested in singing on this track so as a result I'm completely uninterested in hearing it and the most baffling thing outside of that is the instrumental has I don't know there's something about it it's like Scarlett Johansson's vocals feel syrupy and slow and almost like they're just uh encased in molasses and they're completely emotionless but the instrumental seems almost as if it's going too fast so all those great little melodies and and synthesizer nuances that were worked into the original are kind of sped through to the point where they kind of just fly by you and don't really impress all that much really odd cover and really awful track the worst track of the week moving on from there a series of tracks that um I think you should be aware of I think you should check out if you're into the artist I wasn't in love with them but I at least want to give them a nod how to dress well can't you tell some alternative R&B here new album on the way I thought it was okay the this kind of cleaner more straightforward sound from this project that's let's art see less abstract not really sure if I like it too much but you know again if you're into that area Theory 'el you know kind of a very tender and vulnerable alternative R&B sound I think you'll dig this kake's the killa with a new track up out my face featuring peaches it's a hip house track not like the biggest fan of that genre but of I have to admit cakes tequila and peaches are a very sensible combination of people and cakes the kill I'm always down to listen to or try out at cakes the kill attract Big Freedia DJ snake and Diplo with the song drop not the greatest banger I've ever heard but you could twerk to it for sure banks with to the hilt this was kind of a very dreary forgettable little ballad here kind of reminded me of some tracks from her last record which I didn't care for too much I was kind of excited by her previous sing which felt like one of the better pop tunes she had written so far but this new track over here again feels like a nondescript little sad number that didn't leave much of an impression on me but maybe you guys will connect to it a little bit better than me a block party has a new non-album single I believe it's not an album track is titled stunt queen kind of goes back to their dance Rock sort of dance punk sound a little bit and it's pretty catchy moving on from there the cool kids with running man I mean the verses on this thing are okay but the beat just seems I don't know just like any other instrumental you would hear today you know just a trendy hip hop instrumental doesn't have that quirky creative and sort of 80s influenced and off-the-wall cool kids production you typically expect from these guys unfortunately just didn't really stick with me all that much brain tentacles hand of God next track over here this band we have referenced in a previous episode of best and worst tracks of the week it was one of the most insane metal tracks I had heard in a while because there were these huge blaring honking horn sections throughout the track and that is also true of this song too but this track compositionally and performance wise is way more tame so I think without the horns kind of adding that element of chaos and noise to the mix they're left to kind of awkwardly play the chords of the track in a way where they just feel really out of place I mean I still think it's pretty creative what the band is doing and I'm looking forward to what they're doing on this new album but I don't think this track went over as well as the previous one did Leonard Cohen has a new cut out in a new album I believe the track you want a darker instrumental didn't really do too much for me but Leonard Cohen's very husky poetic lyrics we're actually pretty intriguing and pretty entertaining so if you're looking for something real dark something real moody put this track on please I'll say with Kodama the title track to the black metal projects forthcoming record one of the more ethereal tracks have heard from the album so far didn't really do too much for me but you guys who are huge fans of the projects my project might find it really pretty a couple more common with black America again actually no this is the last matte track common with black America again yes I just want to make sure I got that title right a super politically charged track from common a music video that I could see making some people cry in fact you know if you're kind of in tune with what's going on in terms of racial struggles in America in 2016 however I thought there were some elements of the track that didn't go over that well I thought Stevie Wonder's placement in the cut wasn't all that great and he just kind of fell out of place when he was introduced and I think some of the politics of the track were a little ham-fisted not to sort of you know put a pun or metaphor here or anything you know bond purpose I'm not trying to make a joke here but it seemed like a little black and white and that there wasn't too much nuance to what common was trying to say on the track but I'm just going to leave it at that you know as far as like a political hip-hop song you could do way worse so alright a handful of tracks here that were really great this past week for one the weakened with the song star boy did not anticipate I was going to enjoy this track but I did like the lead single to Able's last record you know I love can't feel my face that still think it's a great track and I think star boy is an equally good song it's not like a banger it doesn't have a huge course or anything like that it's way more low-key it's way more sad and moody and dreary that's the appeal of the track but I still think it's row it's well-written and Daft Punk brings a pretty interesting instrumental to the mix with its analog synthesizers and its a percussion hanging in the background a able and Daft Punk not a bad pairing so we go there you go slaves with consumer be consumed UK punk duo they're back with another track another single from their upcoming record this one features Mike D of Beastie Boys Fame his verses okay it's kind of kooky and corny but that's kind of the appeal of the Beastie Boys a little bit although maybe it feels more like that without the other two Beastie Boys kind of back him up I digress though it is kind of a heavy hard-hitting Punk tune with a lot of guts to it and I think a funny little chorus and refrain Danny Brown I have not heard this track really do with Earl Sweatshirt Kendrick Lamar and absol admittedly I have heard the first four seconds of the track and I'm like oh shit oh shit ah but people are telling me this track is amazing I trust that the track is amazing and I'm just going to say I haven't heard this track because I am looking forward to the new record I don't want to spoil anything I just want to hear it all when the album is here I've heard when it rain I think that track is great but I just don't want to spoil any more of the record for myself because there's so much material from the album out already and just want to spoil it just going to leave it at that moving on from there no worries Anderson pack acknowledge of course have a new track out titled like this via Stones Throw Records and the usual blend of soul jazz funk and hip hop come together on this track if you've heard the no worries EP that they came out with not too long ago you know what I'm talking about and it's a soulful little track with a catchy chorus and it's super sexual and sensual it's sweet it's nice moving on from there Bower and cz how can you tell when it's done uh one of the best bangers I've heard this year everybody I mean it was unfortunate that Bowers album that I reviewed not too long ago wasn't as hard-hitting or as diverse or as well produces I would have liked but the single over here is is very nice it's off the fucking wall I will leave it at that crazy banger crazy banger moving on from there flower truck an Australian band this song is titled Sun shower and the reason I'm getting them out is that they're going to be supporting some of the speaking engagement dates that I'm going to be doing in Australia this November if you're in Australia and you haven't heard of this yet look down there in the description I will leave a link to the video where I announce my Australian tour so check that out and these guys it kind of had like a straightforward garage rock maybe a little bit of jangle pop influence in there too and some of the very plain simple guitar chords and I wasn't anticipating all that much but then the vocals came through and they got kind of a wild eccentric post-punk e personality to them that I thought was really cool and that that's just really kind of sold the track for me you know and then once I got into that I realized the band's performance on this thing is pretty energetic it is fun it's a fun-loving track it's got a lot of personality to it so shout out to flour truck and one more note two more I want to give a nod to Kevin abstracts new track empty a track that reminded me a little Frank Ocean and mentioned that on Twitter pissed some people off because I think you know he's kind of copying him a little bit but you know whatever I mean some person was like is she a biter or a genius uh-huh and I don't know not mutually exclusive some of the greatest musical and artistic geniuses out there were blatantly biters but I digress all that being said I think this is one of his better Tunes and it's not really one of the more soulful or hip-hop centric tracks that he's dropped which he has put out in the past this is like more of a straightforward pop tune everything from the the very Spacey not Spacey but um steady I want to say steady steady piano chords to the chorus vocal to the finish of the song it's just got a really bright sort of upbeat but also subtly melancholy pop tune vibe to it that I like a lot I think the track is well written and I don't know I'm waiting for him to kind of come into his own a little bit more in terms of personality but you know maybe that'll happen on this record as far as I know that should be coming out soon and this track is pretty well written so I have faith I have faith it's catchy tune and finally we're going to end it off with a Regina Spektor who every single time she drops a song from her new seems to get better and better and better this track older and taller is another one of the more subtle and easygoing piano ballads from this forthcoming record of course it's emotional and poetic and very personal and is very moving and very touching so make sure not to miss that okay all right thank you for watching this video I hope you guys check out some of these tracks if they interest you again they're down there in the description along with the amazon associates link and that's it all right do the best anthony Fantana best and worst tracks forever 
L-ZQEUZxtZM,hey everyone four thinly stretched Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled preoccupations record this is the latest full-length album from Canadian band preoccupations fresh off the name change wasn't too long ago that they dropped a record under the name Viacom which the band was known as until some people got triggered and now they're back with a new record I was pretty excited to hear not only because this band is essentially a phoenix that rose out of the ashes of one of my favorite Canadian bands women but also I enjoyed their last record quite a bit and I thought the teaser tracks leading up to this new record we're pretty good they forecast a much darker release for preoccupations this time around not so much the reverb II washed out indie vibe that I got from their last record something that was a little bit noisier more textured and kind of depressing I think the band sounds a little more upfront this time as well not so much like you're listening to some group play at the end of a distant cavern or something the drums and bass especially are very up close up front and center very meaty very punchy and there's a really prominent since throughout this record as well which enhance the very dark moody tone of the music reminds me quite a bit of some of the darker groups to come out of the new wave and post-punk move and artists like Bauhaus and maybe a little a cure but even though a lot of these tracks are pretty straightforward as far as riffs and grooves go it can be kind of difficult to read the emotional tone of this album it's kind of unsettling or just like purposefully obscure the emotional intentions of the music that is a lot of the time preoccupations come off colder than a cadaver on this thing which is a quality I have enjoyed about this band since the days of women but preoccupations sort of bring that same vibe but they played a little more aggressive on this record with the guitars the bass and drums the tight grooves and bright guitar melodies on the song stimulation make for one of the catchiest moments on the entire record and the driving bass and glistening synth leads on the song degraded are pretty sticky too the band isn't afraid to go despondent on this record either though like on the song forbidden which is one of the shorter cuts on the record strangely enough it just kind of fades out just as it seems like the drums and bass are starting to bring the song somewhere but still this track features some of the most off-putting and surreal lyrics on the entire record at some very dreary melodies to enhance those lyrics to also the very texture drone at the end of the song memory is as heavy as it is sad and the song anxiety gives the entire album a very odd and depressing start with its deep wavy synths its percussion that sounds like these very flat just aggressive thuds the song does deliver a very pretty synth lead on the hook though that kind of sweetens the deal and makes the song almost digestible and a little bit of Joy Division influence resurfaces in the band's music once again on the song monotony namely with the lead guitars and the lead synth melodies on the track just feel like really pulled out of the new order Joy Division playbook but the band seems to channel this influence in a very tasteful way and kind of make it their own and I would say that's the case for all of preoccupations influences generally though many of them do seem to be coming from the post-punk era with a touch of noise rock and some indie mixed in there too like more dramatic acts such as Wolf Parade seem to be a massive influence the band's strange approach to sound and texture as well as some of the odds song structures and album flow definitely set them apart as an act on their own and while we're talking about album flow there are many tracks on this record that actually segue into one another but somehow the band still manages to come together with a record that almost moves from moment to moment very awkwardly and I'm sure it's kind of intentional because it feels like the album every few tracks or so like resets in a way interrupting the emotional maturity or emotional progression of the record by shifting in weird unpredictable ways still though the band does deliver a transition that is so smooth going into the track zodiac that if I wasn't paying attention to the tracklist I would just think it's an extension of the same song I had been listening to I also loved the noisy guitar strumming on this track that sort of pads out some of the verses to give us kind of a weird noisy musical passage some of the psychedelic scents and throbbing electronics on this track are pretty cool too not to mention that this track has one of the most dramatic and in-your-face vocal performances on the entire record as well the entire album finishes off with the very ghostly and haunting fever which features these sci-fi flavored synth leads it's it's strange man like in the band is kind of delivering a strange groove that I wasn't expecting on the next track or a different vocal delivery or it seems like the guitars or the sense are taking on a different tone entirely sometimes kind of noisy and abstract and experimental sometimes kind of punky sometimes kind of indie and then I get something that sounds like it's straight out of like an 80s spaceship movie soundtrack and even though again the flow of the record is really weird and doesn't make all that much sense sometimes especially as the band is delivering an 11-minute track out of nowhere to one-minute tracks out of nowhere I still actually came away from this record pretty entertained and very impressed by what each track was delivering individually at least and I remember feeling slightly the same way about the band's last record it almost felt unfinished in a way and I feel like I'm almost left with a cliffhanger this time around as well but in the case of this latest album over here it feels like it adds to the perfectly weird and unsettling character of the record so much I'm not really seeing the massive wave of hype that I've been seeing some people throw onto this record you know I think preoccupations do tend to kind of where their influences on their sleeves and there are a few moments on here that do pale in comparison to others and while I do appreciate the odd sequencing of this record I probably would have been more fulfilled by a record that had a more logical progression to it but still I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing we're thing we're thing really impressed with the performances the writing the production the texture the sounds the band's eccentric tendencies and the emotional flavor of this album I'm hoping you guys are enjoying this thing as much as I am I think I'm just gonna get out of here and transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you read it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this album preocupación self-titled forever 
RYWCHEJV_CI,hi everyone sure can embed tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new to che amore record Stage four these guys are a California rock outfit known for their fiery passionate lyrically dense scream oh and post-hardcore records a couple of which I have enjoyed quite a bit even Cal Church esta uses them occasionally to get a little emo you could say I'm I'm finding emo just just like the movie however going into this latest record over here I wasn't too excited because the teaser tracks to this thing kind of rubbed me the wrong way which is occasionally the reason I hate teaser tracks because maybe they ruin or spoil my expectations for the album a little bit I decided to just stop thinking so hard about it and just go into this album with open ears and just whatever the band delivers they deliver and if I like it I like it if I don't I don't also there's no reason to count a band like touché amoré out based off of a couple tracks because you're always going to see those tracks in a different light within the context of the album because there are usually some pretty thumb attic narratives that run through their records that would become more apparent once you actually listen to the entire thing and on this record those songs do gain greater context when they are embedded into the rest of the tracklist because homeboy the concept of this thing it's it's quite a doozy the stars kind of aligned here in a way because stage 4 referencing in a way the fact that this is the band's fourth album but also stage four is in reference to the cancer that had taken away the mother of frontman Jeremy Boehm just a couple of years ago and this entire record seems to be about Jeremy's struggle with that the band explores these stories and explores these feelings with these fast explosive energetic harmonious triumphant rock instrumentals sounds like to Shaam where his usual sound but with a little bit more layering in the mix sounds a bit more like something La Dispute would do on a record except a touché amoré doesn't really go overboard throwing bells and whistles instrumental bells and whistles into the tracks occasionally the instrumentals on this thing sound like some sped up alternative radio rocker or Foo Fighters even on the song rapture the dreary guitar melody on this track and the kind of mid paced rock instrumentation and in the background sounds like something J Mascis would have sung over back in the day whereas the song benediction has this huge glorious crescendo encrusted instrumental that sounds like something out of like the 2000s explosions in the sky type post-rock era and some of the almost spoken narrative lead vocals that run throughout numerous parts of the track fit the song pretty well the song skyscraper track that I originally did not like at all I enjoy again a little bit more as the closer to this entire record it's kind of a chilling finish especially given the more melodic vocals on this track the more ethereal guitars the huge crescendo at the end and then a voicemail message that sounds like it's from Jeremy's mother a message that earlier in the record that he alludes to saying that he is afraid to listen to the last message that she sent to him on his voicemail because just his emotions surrounding her death are so intense and hard to bear the band continues to incorporate some new things like on the track palm dreams which features these a melodic chorus vocals singing unknown which in my opinion are a little dull in the mix like they are super quiet and just don't really fare all that well against the instrumentation these vocals feel more like a placeholder than they do a legitimate hook the vocals are almost inconsequential in a way because they just don't carry that much weight in the mix against Jeremy's intense and passionate shouts and the bright guitars and the driving drums and bass and I feel somewhat the same about the song skyscraper too I think those lead some vocals could have been a little higher in the mix could have been a little more prominent could have been a little more passionate I don't understand why it is that only Jeremy's shouted vocals deserves such a clear placement in the mix but no other vocal on the record does still though I will say this is Touche Amore's most instrumental II a musically diverse record yet and it only required a bit of tweaking in order to make this happen you know the band really doesn't feel like they've stretched themselves too thin anywhere or push themselves into an area where they're not playing to their strengths I actually think the band could have taken things a little bit further because cuts such as 8 seconds and softer spoken the instrumental vibes on these songs barely stand out against the rest of the tracks which feel almost identical in a way these songs to me would just be completely forgettable if not for the fact that the lyrics on these songs were absolutely stunning and the lyrics on this record given the topic at hand are painfully sad honestly some of them are kind of hard to read and will certainly hit close to home for anybody who has ever lost someone really close to them a loved one especially somebody who is older than you and has had an incredible influence on your life on the opening track we have Jeremy facing down his mother essentially on her deathbed singing that I apologize for the grief when you talk about belief I didn't know just what to say while watching you wither away struggling not only with her death but with her I guess holding on to her faith as she's dying and not knowing exactly how to deal with that feeling almost like a kind of disillusioned by religion and faith in a way toward the beginning of the album later on the track we see Jeremy describing the tension in the situation that kind of kept him from handling this death this situation in the way that he wished he could have you know sort of pacing and not being able to stay in the room and maybe the most momentous part of the track is toward the end as he sings this refrain I took inventory of what I took the way he phrases that it's really interesting because he puts a pause there so you're like okay he took something but then he says for granted and then he comes up with all these things that he took for granted that he didn't expect that he would list out when he actually thought about it on later tracks Jeromy struggles again with not dealing with the situation in the way that you wish he could have or just not being there for example on the song a seconds he sings about the fact that her death occurred while he was on stage performing with touche amore he actually puts together really smart metaphor here comparing the death comparing the situation to being on a stage being in the midst of a play that he has not learned that he's not practiced for her death and the fact that they are on stage while this occurs is sort of compared to a curtain call toward the beginning of record we see Jeremy kind of questioning his faith questioning religion not really seeing a place for it in his life I think but later he gets almost spiritual in a way as he sings about walking away unscathed from a car crash and tributing that to his mother looking out for him Jeremy sees his faith and sees religion as a way of kind of keeping in touch with his mother or saving something about their relationship and he boldly acknowledges that this is in fact the case that he and many others who deal with similar situations of loss kind of clutch onto religion clutch on the faith as a bit of a safety blanket he specifically talks about this on the track posing holy and that really kind of sums it up for all of the lyrical narratives and emotions explored throughout this record this is actually a really interesting and cathartic and emotionally powerful album not just in the screamo or emotion or post-hardcore genre but just in general I think this is one of the Bands best if not the best of their four records so far it's not as instrumentally one-dimensional as some of their previous records have tended to be I think the lyrics and the very clear themes and narrative that run throughout the entire album not only keep the record interesting but also very tight and focused there are a couple tracks I wish were longer like eight seconds a couple tracks that I wish ventured out instrumentally a little bit more some vocals I think could have been brighter could have been louder and I think occasionally the instrumentals the the production does sound a little too clean you know I do prefer in a way that Rahr sound from Touche Amore's previous records but even after adding up all of those minor complaints it doesn't really take away from the fact that I think this album is great and really enjoyable given the genre of music that this album fits so snugly within it's not going to be for everybody but for those hardcore screamo and emo fans out there and people who might want to hear that genre experimented with a little bit and complemented with a really tasteful and a really detailed concept then look no further than this album feeling a light to decent hate on this thing transition and those are my thoughts on this new to shame or a record hoping you guys are enjoying it as much as I am but if you're not that's completely fine - all right what do you think of this record if you gave it a listen did you love it - Jada why what do you think I should review next and that's it and Fantana Touche mor a forever 
Ckz7LtXSHo4,
PyLi_BCFYsI,hey what up everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerding it's time for a review of the new street sex record and position street sex is an Austin Texas music duo making their full-length record debut on the flen Sur label a highly recommended highly recommended by me experimental music label that usually drops some great stuff I especially like to take notice when they sign a new artist because they might bring an artist like street sex to my attention the first time I laid ears on these guys my brain melted and then it poured out of my ears and then I needed to slowly and carefully funnel it back into my into my ear cavities then I went to the labels PR guy I sold my soul so that I can get an early promo of this thing and boy was it a good trade because what I heard on the song and I grew into ribbons was some of the most vicious vile disgusting and soul-crushing industrial music I've heard in a long time fused with crazy overwhelming sporadic samples high-volume power electronics as well as just harsh abrasive noise street sex we're just lighting my brain on fire and I also like how it's so visceral so animalistic but it's also very mechanical it's not brooding or ultra dark it kind of sidesteps the whole goth thing I think but there are plenty of moments on this record where the duo is not hesitant to work in some melodies like on the very despondent verses of the closing track on this thing which sound like the muttered ramblings of a madman and then all of a sudden the vocals burst into this really theatrical performance on the chorus I also love the pained vocals and the very dreary guitar passages on the opening of the song black din song progresses into this harsher wall of instrumentation that features these wailing lead melodies that sound like whatever is making them is really about to break now the melodies while there are some good ones here they are not so much the selling point is the sporadic and frenzied walls of noise that Street sects build their songs out of it sounds like a mix of sequence drums that are hard pummeling head crushing easy piano guitar and whatever samples really is difficult to tell in a way it kind of reminds me of some early reckon reference records how that band did such a great job of recreating a very dark abrasive hard-hitting black metal vibe with like just a sampler I'm getting a similar vibe on this record but the end result is just so much more to the point and direct it's like a brick to the face it's super muscular and well-structured this album is not flabby at all this band does not just kind of hang around and in one kind of vibe aimlessly for for very long at all the performances and the sounds on this thing are so incredibly wild and out of control yet from the detail that goes into these tracks it seems like there's an incredible amount of forethought that went into every single track here it's like trying to paint a beautiful portrait by violently hacking away at the canvas with a machete and somehow the end result is a hyper-realistic still life of a bowl of shrunken heads this album is so freakish it makes the blackest of blacks look gray by comparison and again despite all the cacophony on this thing these songs are very well organized the insanity of every single track flows so incredibly well each passage of a track feeling distinctly different from the next but without going so far as to make the song sound like a random or out-of-control and the grooves on this thing god I've never wanted so much to violently convulse in the middle of a china shop with like I don't know hammers taped to my wrists as this thing blasts so loudly on nearby loudspeakers that my ears bleed the dissonance the harsh distortion the variety of sounds on this thing incredibly loud fantastic sounds just like my soul ablaze and then the dark melodies and very dreary passages just a stamp that fire out and crush it and just grind it into the ground like a leather dominatrix boot I'll have to say about this thing is it's one of the best debuts I've heard in a while and just holy shit this shit is the shit now I do think that the duo does tend to wear their influences a little bit on their sleeve the vocals are kind of buried a little more than I would like them to be sometimes sometimes I wish they would just really take the reins and bring something a little more distinct to the table and the song feigning familiarity even though it does feature one of the loudest and and most intense sonic freak-outs toward the back end of the track it is one song that I felt meandered a little bit especially toward the beginning and didn't have one of the better structures of the album but other than that this album is incredibly intense and as much as I love it I know it's not going to be for everybody you know I know a lot of people are going to hear this and just think it's just noise and that's totally fine I understand that I sympathize with that but for me that this was a very spicy album that was that was cringy hope you like that dose of cringe there I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing might even grow on me a little bit by the end of the year I don't know we'll see I hope you give this thing a shot and enjoy it as much as I do transition and those are my thoughts and it's crazy a Street sex record did you like it if you give it a listen to do love it hate why what do you think it should be next as always and make sure to smash that like because it would make my day okay and don't you want to make my day what one like equals one happy Anthony please please I lied I'm already happy but you know it would only add to the happiness but I digress what do you think I should review next and I hope you guys are all having a good one okay bye forever 
vDzb4npeozE,ah hi everyone both a boy Thao here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Mac Miller album the Divine Feminine Mac Miller is a Pennsylvania rapper numerous mixtapes under his belt at this point but this is his fourth full-length commercial project following up his last full-length album dropped last year good a.m. my favorite Mac Miller release thus far an album where he woke up a little bit from his typically sleepy stoner raps in favor of writing tracks that were a little more vibrant energetic catchy some of his most adventurous production as well appeared on this project and after this record it seemed like everything was just looking up for Mac Miller and I was excited to listen to this new project over here even though I wasn't expecting him to be following through with another commercial project so soon but even though I was looking forward to this thing the Divine Feminine is not the fun vibrant creative and colorful album that good a.m. was there's a lot of very very quiet melodic smooth jazz rap neo-soul on this thing and Mac Miller seems to return to the very low-key vocal delivery that has underwhelmed me so much in the past so it's a bit of a change of pace and in a way ambitious because Mac Miller is sticking to something for 10 very succinct tracks but I don't really think he draws anything that fantastic out of this direction instead this album turns out kind of weak because Mac Miller thinks that his singing can kind of carry numerous songs from beginning to end when it just can't especially in the case of the track soulmate where very quickly my ears just glaze over in boredom due to Mac Miller's lifeless vocal delivery and the songs relatively slow pulse most of the time with his vocals and the production on this record it seems like Mac Miller is shooting for seductive sensual and intoxicating but for the most part this album reads more like a stale clambake cheap incense and blacklight posters and that's when his voice is an awkwardly moaning and cracking against a bland jazz funk instrumental on the song my favorite part or on the tracks stay where he's essentially doing his best at just writing a chance the rapper song with only a fraction of the charisma and performance that chance usually brings to the table and what a really glamorous pretty instrumental comes through like on the song skin Max despondent kind of woe is me vocal delivery takes away what little appeal to the track there is and between ty dolla sign Kendrick Lamar and Anderson PAC Mac Miller's guests consistently outshine him on these tracks and take to the musical style that he's shooting for a little better than he does though I will say that dang is one of the few tracks on this record that actually plays to Mac Miller's strengths with his kind of smooth low-key kind of funny and charismatic straightforward verses throughout the track and his kind of personal glum bars on the song Cinderella aren't too bad either this album is just super lovesick it's just saturated with heartbreak and and lust but it all manifests itself in like the most pitiful of ways unless you want to listen to a track where Mac Miller is effectively whispering into your ear about wanting to procreate that is personally I don't see this record getting too much traction outside of Mac Miller's hardcore fan base though I do give it to him for not only sticking to a sound and a theme for an entire record but what's going on on this album is is very kind of current it's very now it's very hip the whole jazz rap thing and neo-soul thing is very popular at the moment I just kind of questioned whether or not Mac Miller really did his homework and did this sound this style any justice I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this project Tran and those are my thoughts on this new Mac Miller record if you're pissed off about them that's fine you don't have to agree but feel free to voice your anger at me through the internet if that will make you feel better did you love this album did you hate this album why what do you think I should review next and that's it guys Mac Miller the Divine Feminine forever 
Vz2YokGxlT4,Darvin days Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds record skeleton tree this is the latest full-length LP from singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist Nick Cave musical legend and the follow-up to the band's 2013 record pushed the sky away admittedly one of my least favorite records in the cave discography a really slow syrupy spacey emotionally flat record that didn't really leave much of an impression on me the album for the most part felt like being stranded in some kind of emotional purgatory not quite heaven not quite hell and caves latest record over here is equally spacey and kind of droney quiet subtle however this album sees the return of Nick Cave after what was an incredible tragedy in his life last year losing his son Arthur cave and since Nick likes to focus on evil and tragedy in his music so much those who were in the know were no doubt looking for this to manifest itself in some kind of way in the music on this record now even before getting into the lyrics of this record I will say in comparison with push the sky away the emotional tone of this record is very dark is very despondent outright depressing I'd say the difference emotionally between this record and Nick caves last is absolutely night and day despite this new album not really being much more aggressive than push the sky away the potent sadness that runs throughout this record even though the album is slow and is a very patient album creates a severe sense of tension which pretty much keeps every single song engaging as Nick Cave just performs one emotional exorcism after another across these eight cuts many of which sound almost improvised or ad-libbed to an extent once the instrumentals droney backdrop kind of starts or the very subtle musical embellishments are established that the band will continue to run through as the song progresses Nick Cave is sort of free to just emotionally explore the topic of the song as he sees fit a lot of the time Nick Cave is waxing poetic on the human condition love loss as well as mortality and the incredible amount of sorrow on this record Nick Cave channels into a lot of different things this isn't just some album where Nick Cave is blatantly putting his tragedy out there in bold plain lyrics for all to see hear and read he's not coming out of this record to exploit his personal misfortune for prying eyes and ears and from what I understand a good deal of these songs were already written or conceived long before the tragedy in question had even happened now there is a pretty prominent moment on the record on the track girl in amber which is one of the most lyrically intriguing tracks on the entire record where Nick Cave is kind of going over what seems like a recently shattered conception of death and the afterlife which is set to these very lonely pianos and the dreariest choral vocals I've heard on an album in a long time the track seems to mostly reference this girl or this moment in time in the past that's almost frozen or I can't quite tell you know there's a lot of imagery in this track and the others - that is super surreal esoteric really difficult to put a clear finger on what exactly Nick is trying to convey sometimes though I will say the ending moments of this cut where Nick Cave is singing in this ghostly vocal don't don't is absolutely haunting another song about losing someone but in a more abstract and romantic way is the song I need you which features these really depressing refrains where Nick is singing in the voice of a really a broken man nothing really matters the performance on this track is pitifully sad and intentionally so the instrumental in the background is a bit of soft easygoing rock music which is thickened up with these synth chords that work very nicely into the track and we also have the very powerfully dark and lyrically vivid Jesus alone where Nick is referencing a really a lot of different things a drug addict a girl filled with forbidden I guess sexual energy an African doctor harvesting tear ducts and Nick on the core seems to be calling out to all of these people with his voice or with this song I'm not 100% sure about what it is about all these characters that sort of makes Nick think about all of them in this one track but maybe further listens will reveal that into the future which are most definitely warranted because even without understanding the full meaning it is a beautiful and a sad and an emotionally traumatizing track on the song rings of Saturn Nick Cave is singing over the sparse drums and he's kind of glistening shy sporadic synth keys that kind of sputtered throughout the track and the lyrics tell the story of what seems like a girl who's almost like a slave to her sexual desires or maybe her profession or the world that she's in he seems to talk about her being born to do what she's doing whether that is because of her personality or her genetic makeup or her surroundings or her upbringing I'm not entirely sure seems like she's engaging in some kind of destructive behavior which is also affecting Nick in a significant way as he's referring to whatever association he has with this person as being like slavery the lyrical imagery on the last verse of the track actually gets pretty strange and it actually would have been one of my favorite tracks here if not for the fact that the ending really fizzles out which sort of goes back to the fact that even though this album is a much more emotionally potent record than the previous Bad Seeds album still the songwriting structure and the songwriting style is mostly the same which was slightly a turn-off for me on that record still though I do love the song Magneto which features some of the darkest instrumentation on the entire record especially this heavy groaning bass and over the track lyrically cave delivers one of his most dramatic performances a lot of the time referencing what seems like a sickness in him maybe making reference to a time in his life when he was addicted to drugs intravenous drugs specifically talking about throwing up in the sink clutching the bowl anther scene I consider to be a pretty stunning and commanding track on the record a definitely one of those moments where even though this is a relatively soft and quiet album this is a track that will demand your attention merely because cave sort of performs on this track like an actor in the spotlight and on the song distance sky this is maybe the only cut in the track listing here that probably could have fit snugly on to push the sky away which features not only some of the most broken and sad vocals from cave on the entire record but also a very lovely guest vocal performance from Elsa Torp I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly who interjects in between caves versus in this angelic set of melodies which is a very nice counterpoint to what cave is doing on the track now the closing track on this thing skeleton tree feels almost like a glimmer of hope like a ray of sunshine amongst all these incredibly dark tracks cave is sort of left with a bit of much-needed catharsis after all of these incredibly depressing songs catharsis that at this point I think the audience needed a little bit of - he seems to have gained a little bit more emotional and vocal composure on this track as well it's like he's moving past the trauma of the previous seven songs and now starting a new day and a clean slate overall I was really impressed with this record it is a beautiful dark moving intensely sad and emotionally potent album despite the fact that it is such a quiet record it is such a subtle record and I'm glad that cave and company were able to come through with a captivating record come through with a compelling record without having to change the formula too much from what they were doing on push the sky away wait wait wait still I do wish the the songs were a little more structurally sound but that doesn't really seem to take away from much of what the album is already doing incredibly well I'm feeling a light of decent hate on this thing Tran and those are my thoughts on this new Nick Cave record what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it guys Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds skeleton tree forever 
v-cMNvQ4aE4,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I get into the worst tracks of the week best tracks of the week the tracks that was just merely kind of indifferent toward God I've got quite a few tracks here this week to show you guys but first before I get fully into it I want to say if you want to support this segment hit up the Amazon Associates link down there in the description box if you use it and you live in the u.s. anything you buy on Amazon we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price and that is that just use it to buy some stuff you were gonna buy anyway and I also want to give a shout out to the new skit cast album from the double D's podcast my good buddies DOM and D respect over at the double these podcast came together with a bit of a comedy album yours truly is featured on a track and I think generally these cast album is pretty funny I enjoy a lot of the skits that they kick their podcast off with so of course I knew I was going to enjoy at least a bulk of what was on this album there's actually a pretty hilarious Bernie Sanders sketch on there that I liked quite a bit the itunes link is down there in the description box I implore the you guys to check that out as well especially if you've heard the collaborations that I've done with these guys in the past both of them appeared on the couch a chest a mixtape that came out not too long ago I know I have done a video with dom where we read Death Grips lyrics I've done numerous videos with D respect where we've reviewed some albums together so you guys may already be familiar with their work alright let's get into these tracks first worst tracks of the week this one first one's not even really a track but a rather a performance Corey Feldman made a stop by The Today Show to perform a song that I have already said in a previous segment was horrible a track called go for it from his latest record pictured here it's a double album I'm very tempted to do a not good on this album because it is it is terrible it is like awful track after track after track and not even just awful but hilariously awful like at points as hilariously awful is like speeding bullet to heaven but the thing is a lot of people don't really care about Cory Feldman's so if I were to come and be like hey guys corey feldman record it's terrible a lot of people would just be like who who's who's that Anthony because you know he's a bit of an 80s relic you know but if you're if you're from that era you remember him and hopefully you make some time to listen to this new record because it is hilariously bad and this little Today Show performance is a particularly funny and cringy alright moving on from there let's get into the legitimately the worst tracks of the week got to give it got to give it two waves on this one this is not the worst track the week this is just one of them we're getting to that waves they did a cover recently of one of my favorite Weezer tracks so you gave your love to me softly they absolutely bring nothing whatsoever to the cover a lot of bands like Weezer back in the day we're kind of stereotyped and pigeon-holed is these slacker rock bands but if you actually listen to a real-life group of slackers try to cover this song it sounds terrible it's utterly boring vocals are awful you know the the musicianship is shoddy at best there's really nothing to like about this version you know it's not like waves put a spin on it on this track or anything it just sounds like a lazier worse recorded version of your worse performed version of the track so yeah I guess if you want to hear a lackluster version of a great song then give a listen to this waves cover moving on from there Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick do a track called true colors for the trill Patrol soundtrack for the neutrals movie that's coming out and it is a clawing terribly written ballad super corny makes me sick and moving on oh gee Mac Oh with the song no love a lot of people were hyping this track to me just sounds like an auto-tuned mess that has no redeeming characteristics to it whatsoever it's it's like if the future had even less sense about him and didn't had absolutely no clue what he was doing that's how this song sounds to me and finally the worst track of the week it conclusively worst track of the week has to be this new clams casino song with little be titled live my life you know little B I understand basedgod I get all that stuff okay I get it I get the meme I understand the joke okay I understand the mindset okay but they're just some lyrics on this track that are absolutely inexcusable where I think he raps that he's a he's a white man trapped in a black man he's a black man trapped in a white man and he's trapped in a spycam again there's some absolutely hilarious shit on this track it's it's bad and what's even worse is the instrumental on this track like it's not even just that little B's lyrics on this track are awful it's also clams casinos beat on this thing it sounds like you know that that kind of stuttering bit of percussion from that beat to that song it sort of escapes me but you know the R&B hook on the on the track it's the kind of classic little R&B and rap tune you know the song the instrumental sounds like a worse version of that sorry the track is just you know escaped in my mind at the moment listen I lived through the 90s I don't remember everything about the 90s okay I'm trying to spend most of my days forgetting about the 90s all right so I just just leave me be this is this is the worst tracks of the week so again all this stuff is listed and referenced down there in the description box so if you're morbidly curious by all means let's get into the tracks that was merely kind of indifferent toward didn't care for that much I thought were just kind of okay and I'm recommending them to you guys because you might enjoy them a little more than me meh this section is for me we have marching Church which you know is a project that is related to one of my favorite bands Ice Age and this new track lion's den is a really odd track how did this odd awkward falsetto experimental rock cut that did not vibe with me at all I did not dig the vocals on this thing especially I was kind of wondering what the hell was going on there but it might be interesting to hear some of these weird ideas maybe tinkered with a little bit more and groom to the point where they make more sense on an ice age record I really don't know moving on from there we have planes mistaken for stars with the song riot season this is a nice little chaotic piece of loud rock over here from the people over at the death wish label didn't strike me as particularly distinct but you know it had its moments and it has some kind of fun little guitar leads leads leads leads Deerhoof has a shoo shoo cover out in the style of white reaper in of the song hi and white reaper if you may or may not know is a cool little garage rock band over on the polyvinyl label however this track doesn't really sound like anything to me other than dear Huff kind of extending the garage rock vibes that they were doing on their latest full-length record which we're okay you know it wasn't really like my favorite sound of all the sounds that deer hoof is tinkered with over the years and it just kind of seems like they're continuing to do it on this little shoe shoe cover if your deer have fan if you're a shoe shoe fan it's worth checking out then we have justice with the song Randy you know I love the last justice single I was pretty excited by it but this new one over here totally underwhelmed me didn't really care for it to me sounded like a version of like I don't know one of the bad falsetto vocal songs off of like the latest Daft Punk record it's like Daft Punk has to do a little weird falsetto vocal disco throwback and now justice has to do it on their record or something um and it's it's just not as good don't care for the tune don't care for the vocals just really kind of an underwhelming moment for me you know which is disappointing because their last record has such a nasty groove to it their last single had me excited for this new record but maybe they'll pull through on the deep cuts well we will see moving on from there we have the men with the song lion's den another track titled lion's den in this tracks roundup and the men ever-evolving you know they've done like some noise rock they've done like some hardcore like 90 shit they've done like I'm trying to think of it they've done like country I believe in on their records before they're really hard to predict you never know what the hell the men are going to do but on this new record over here they're going like straight ex era mental noise rock and they do they do it some justice you know again I think it does kind of suffer from the fact that the men are always changing their sound so often that they never sink into something so far that they carve out a niche for themselves in it but I I do think they kind of tried their hand at this very chaotic noise rock style and passed with some up flying colors that is a kind of fun track so you know Amen to them Jenny have all comes through with the song period piece a new Adult Swim single which doesn't sound too bad not quite as indulgent and taxing as some of the songs that she has been dropping recently as a pretty direct and airy in a theory a little art pop tune I guess you could say that's a pretty enjoyable moving on Dwight Yoakam with a little prince cover Purple Rain not crazy head over heels for it it's just kind of merely a country rework of the classic pop song if you're interested in that sort of thing I would highly recommend you checking this out because the performance is at least good moving on from there Joyce manor with last you heard me which is a bit of a bland 90s throwback for the band and the band has always been hugely influenced by that era of rock music but they've at least always come through with a decent hook you know to back a track up but this particular instance not so much it's just kind of a very low-key cut that didn't leave much of an impression on me but the joyce manor fans out there take notice new record on the way new track and to round out the mattracks section to shame or a with the song rapture yeah i mean these these new songs the band has been dropping just not really as raw you know just that really as raw and as emotionally potent as I enjoy their past material as I know their past material to be you know that's really kind of what I enjoy their past material for and it seems like with that previous track they dropped that was super atmospheric and airy that just had no guts to it in this new track over here it's kind of a oh no it's really kind of melodic and straightforward and it's a little catchy which is fine the band doesn't want to do the same thing forever but it just didn't really strike me as a that captivating of a song I guess you know it kind of felt like touché amoré was turning down the intensity in favor of just doing something a little more instantaneous I guess but moving on from there we're gonna get into the best tracks of the week in my opinion these tracks are the best that I heard this past week we have warehouse with the song super low band that I've never heard of before and they're doing kind of a jangle pop on this thing but it has like the oddest vocals that I've ever heard on a rock instrumental of this style they're super raspy and weird and have kind of a cartoony vibe to them I would never imagine in a million years these kinds of vocals over a Django pop instrumental but it works so well you know it's got a lot of character to it it's got a lot of personality it's pretty eccentric and I would say the song is catchy - open mike eagle there's a fun little they might be giants cover of the song cow town on video I don't know if there's an mp3 floating around of it or anything like that but it is a kind of spacey atmospheric cover he doesn't exactly you know do the kind of upbeat tempo that the song rides at originally you really just kind of spaces it out and does something a little more airy and meditative with the track which I thought was pretty cool and you know I love that open mike eagle is one of the few rappers out there who you know sort of openly appreciates they might be giants in the way that he does something that a lot of rock and pop artists don't even do which I think they should because they might be giants incredible incredible duo came out with some of the great you know greatest rock and pop music of the 80s and 90s in my opinion it is a little nerdy and dorky I understand I get it but you know they have their kind of idiosyncratic nature to them that keeps some people from being into them all that much but I think they write great music all right Tony Malina my do Tony Malina has a new EP coming out on Slumberland records I imagine that this one as well is going to be a very short to the point have a bunch of one-minute songs on especially with this very very dreary acoustic one-minute ballad on here titled see me fall which I thought was pretty heartbreaking moving on to Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth Fame has a new record on the way the song is lead single out and this song kicks fuckin ass this is a fantastic track this is a fantastic freakin track like I'm looking at myself smiling right now because I want to make sure that I'm like giving you guys the the the correct reaction here because it is a really good song like the groove on the song is insane her vocals are so deadly and nasty and mean and some of the guitar sounds on this thing are killer so the track really lives up to the murdered-out title the first thing that I thought was like when I saw this title was murdered out windows two exits and you know I was like this is gonna be as badass as Death Grips and and I don't know why I was making that comparison I'm just a moron but then when the song actually started to play I was like holy SH a a hit it's like fuckin hardcore as hell so give a listen to this track if you're into some noise rock and in that kind of thing entrance with promises this is kind of a very another group that I'm not familiar with a very dark dreary a little ballad that has a ever so familiar lead melody in chord progression couldn't quite place it but the very dark lyrics and very personal lyrics on this track kind of struck me as being a very entertaining and you know sort of struck a chord with me I'll say car bomb with sets this is a little metal track that has some odd odd riffs and grooves to it like and I don't mean odd like hey they're super experimental or you know avant-garde or anything like that I mean odd in terms of like the time signature just seems like it's always shifting or something you know there's something about the groove and rhythm of this track that is really off-putting and interesting as well you know but still the band manages to keep it really visceral with you know just these guttural screams and growls it's a pretty nasty track going to be pretty intrigued about what the span is doing in the future I remember hearing their past material not being like totally crazy about it but this new track over here I thought was pretty impressive bo Zack Morris with never change featuring Conway and West Side gun this is a grimy ass rap track one of the grimy estas I've heard in a while it's got a bit of a low Phi boom bap flavor to it and you know just uh just the kind of vocal delivery that just makes you want to just go mean-mugging throughout the whole track like mmm nasty so moving on from there we have diploid from Australia this is a bit of an extreme music act I believe I met some people from the band when I did a live performance like a speaking engagement down there in Australia a little while ago and I just kind of stumbled across their record they might have sent it to me someone else might have said it to me I can't remember off the top of my head but this is like some grindcore it's really spazzy it's really noisy it's colorful it's not kind of your you know meat and potatoes grindcore it's like really shrill and in your face and like abrasive it's not like you know super brutal or anything like that it's just more freakish I would say than brutal so this track is titled barrels definitely make sure to check that track out but their entire record is up on Bandcamp as well so give a listen to any and all of the tracks if you're into you know sort of extreme music grindcore spaz enos for frantic intense music and we are gonna end things out with ghosts who dropped the track square hammer which I believe is a part of a handful of different tracks that the band has dropped recently this track is incredibly catchy don't really know what else to say about ghosts at this point other than that they're still fucking killing it some people are you know kind of disappointed with ghosts recent material but I think it's really good in this track to me had a pretty unique edge to it with the lyrics and the narrative that the band was kind of pulling together you know super eerie and the video was as well is really cool which we will link you down there in the description box too and yeah ok so those are my favorite tracks the wee best tracks of the week rather the tracks that was kind of different toward me and the worst tracks of the week again they're all down there along with the amazon associates link which if you live in the u.s. we please ask you that you use and also that double Ds sketch cast album which I am featured on would love for you guys to check that out as well and yeah that has been this episode of the way the weekly track roundup we're gonna leave it at that thank you for watching I hope you're doing well and like this video forever 
vlls8lQNgi4,hey everyone don't they need touched an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new mi a record a I am aim mi a rapper singer-songwriter activist out with a new full-length album a record that I was anticipating but also I kind of wasn't anticipating it really I was a sort of afraid to listen to it anticipating it because in one breath mi a has proven herself over the years with just a handful of records to be one of the most influential creative and boundary-pushing artists in the mainstream her first few records are these amazingly creative blends of dance music hip hop synth punk and a myriad of musical styles from across the world amazing singles on these records fantastic deep cuts as well and in retrospect I've even come to appreciate her 2010 album Maya a bit more which was her most polarizing record at the time that it had been released because it was so distorted so abrasive and so difficult to swallow and even her last record Matangi was a respectable album you know up until this point I've never really had a reason to doubt the abilities of m.i.a but with aim I just feel like my faith has been shattered I'm just not sure how to take this record or I didn't even know how it was going to take this record because pretty much every teaser tracked to this album I hated outright all of the songs were were dreadfully boring even the politically charged borders which you think would be a little more compelling considering the subject matter of the song but mi a approaches the track with some of the most drab lyrics she's written in a long time and I feel equally cold on the songs go off and birds and free done which features a very mediocre vocal performance from none other than Zane I just don't get what she was trying to do on this record pretty much every track features a repetitive one-dimensional redundant instrumental and over it vocally she delivers some of her most underwhelming singing and rapping ever put onto an mi a album and she's not exactly penning any sharp hooks on this record either the verse on this record just drone on and on and on and lack the lyrical wit and the vocal swagger that her past records had in spades things get painfully awkward on the song foreign friend where she says this you can be my best friend you know too much to be a foe you were there from before in the days when I had no dough gonna be your best friend gonna make that trend I'm gonna be your foreign friend all the way til the end are we writing lyrics at a fourth-grade level now even the song finally the lyrics on this track sounds like something a thirteen-year-old would write to her hater on the Internet I know m.i.a has never been like you know a spiritual lyrical miracle or anything like that but this album sounds and reads like she had to write it at gunpoint because she had been abducted or something by her label or maybe she's trying to just blatantly bore her listeners out of protest I'm just not sure the most lively and compelling tracks on the entire record which are by no degree some of her best that she's ever released but still they all kind of come in the second half of the album I love the song visa with its instrumental which features this stuttering tangy sour little piano lead which fits very snugly against these awesome Polly rhythms even though mi a's vocals do sound kind of flat on the track at least the instrumental carries her a little bit and gives the song some move and then there's also the song all my people which also features a pretty awesome instrumental total banger which weaves in these elements of Indian music for a nice spicy flava and on the song fly pirate mi a raps over this fuzzy booming kind of loaf IB this sounds like a fusion between what she was doing on Maya and maybe what you would hear on like an early kool Kidz single and finally on the track Ally are you okay this is maybe the only song the track listing that I think does something great with the very chill laid-back and simple vibe of this album overall as the instrumental weaves together this sort of droney hypnotic sound with twangy strings and chanted vocals and very cerebral rhythms unfortunately the other deep cuts don't attain the same level of the of simple bliss this level of Nirvana because generally the the songs on this album aren't quiet for the sake of sounding experimental and alternative rather instead the album sounds under produced sounds under written under structured because there are a good handful of tracks on this thing that are just two minutes and change and kind of abruptly the more I listen to this record the more it feels like some of the tracks here could have been good like there were some good song ideas at the core of these tracks but again the instrumentals just seem so underdeveloped the lyric writing is just non-existent sometimes seems like mi is really phoning it in on her own album and this is especially clear when you're listening to the entire album from beginning to end as you're hit with one forgettable moment after another the biggest irony of this album is its title which essentially is aim because I don't think this album could hit the broadside of a barn because it's too unfocused and lacks dedication to pretty much all of the ideas that it's putting forward for the mi a ten years ago this simply would have been a handful of demos that she would have built on to make a more vibrant record I'm not really sure what else to say about this record other than that it's just a most definitely the most lackluster release I think she has put out so far I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing transition and those are my thoughts on this new mi a record what did you think of this thing if you gave it a listen as you loved it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it everybody mi a aim forever 
YUtwxblNMOY,everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd doing another quick raw review this time of the new de la Sol album and the anonymous nobody De La Soul quintessential hip hop trio back with a new record a comeback record Luke comeback record another comeback record which of course had me hesitant because comeback records generally not that good you know usually pretty disappointing but you do have those comeback records every once in a while that that do turn out great and if there is a trio that I had faith could come together with a good comeback record it is De La Soul because they've always kind of had this really a vibrant crazy fun personality they're really eccentric so you figure that they got to do something wild with the new record they can't just come out with some boring 12 track album with a bunch of songs that all sound the same you know you gotta expect that there's going to be instrumental shifts there's got to be skits and stuff like that so De La Soul you have to you know anticipate at least something interesting and while the trio certainly tried I'm not saying they half-assed anything on this project for sure they just kind of ended up with this really inconsistent album it's kind of like a clash of of different sounds and moods that excuse me that I don't think particularly work all that well together for one there's a handful of tracks on here where it seems like the trio is really going super self-serious and I don't really uh find these moments all that compelling not only because I feel like it kind of derails this album which already has so little momentum to begin with because it's always changing it's always doing something different it's always detouring but also I don't really feel like the trio makes that many poignant statements on these cuts then we have these songs that feature some pretty surprising guests I mean there's actually a really impressive guest list on this project a guest list that on the surface would have made me really excited and did make me really excited to listen to it we have guests that are big names that totally make sense and I could see collaborating with De La Soul really effectively Snoop Dogg Estelle Jill Scott Pete Rock there's some really surprising names on here that are really coming out of left field I don't want to mess his name up mr. Justin Hawkins I believe also a dated burn of talking-head spain damon albarn of guerrillas and blur Fame two chains as well as a little dragon pop outfit little dragon so again a lot of surprising names on this thing but for the most part all the names that you wouldn't expect to be associated with De La Soul really derail the record not only do they bring a musical vibe and sound that I just would never really want to hear on a daily solo album but these guests take over the track so much that it's almost like DLS whole just hands the album over to them for a few moments to change the album into something that fits their image more than does De La Soul it sounds like I'm listening to a Damon Albarn track featuring De La Soul it sounds like listening to a little dragon track featuring De La Soul it sounds like listening to a David Byrne song featuring De La Soul and so on and so forth there are a few moments on here where I think the duo pulls together tracks that sound like something that they would have put out back in the day and not to say that hey as long as they stick to their old sound that's good you know I appreciate that they wanted to progress they wanted to evolve and they wanted to do something different but you can't disagree that on the two change track and on the track nosed up for example the trio really plays to their strengths you know these are fun eccentric catchy tracks with engaging verses with a lot of witty comedic lines this is sort of what the trio seems to do best you know if they actually managed to make some of these collaborations a little more effective and sort of a be a little more collaborative you know a little more 5050 rather than it just kind of feeling like they're passing the keys off to little dragon to kind of just take over the little track and then they just kind of hop on it and then they're calling it a de la Sol song yeah you know if the collaborative celebration has been a little more split if it felt like there was just less input from the feature and more input from De La Soul on these tracks and the the more low-key tracks that are trying to be more emotional trying to be more mature maybe they just kind of brought their points home better a little bit more or if they were just a little more engaging there's one kind of point a moment on the record right at the start which I felt was a little self-serving with Jill Scott where she's talking about hey when nobody loves something when something's irrelevant that's when you gotta love it that's when you gotta love something the most and I appreciate the sentiment of that but it seems like at the beginning of the record De La Soul is telling us how we have to feel about this album before you can listen to the album which I thought was a huge turnoff you know if the album is good and if the album is worth loving then people will love it you know and and that's really all there is to it you know you should love something not because other people love it and not because other people don't love it those are two stupid reasons to love something you should love something especially an album if it appeals to you you know if you think the music is great if you think the performances are good if you think the statements the album is making make sense and you know are relatable to you or you know touch you in some way emotionally and unfortunately that's that just was not the case for me you know I didn't get much of any of those things from this record you know musical entertainment interesting performances you know in sort of a sound that I feel like is distinctly de la Sol you know there are a couple tracks here that feel that way then there's a series of tracks that just feel pretty drab and moody and there's a bunch of tracks where I feel like I'm I'm just listening to oh this isn't de la Sol this is Dave Bern this is Damon Albarn this is Justin Hawkins this is little dragon and so on and so on and so on so unfortunately I was pretty underwhelmed by this thing just because of how inconsistent it is again I know de la Sol has this tendency to jump around and not really just kind of deliver this uniform type of record but I feel like I don't know they just kind of let that tendency get the better of them this time around and really just kind of lost control of this album in a way in my opinion anyway but those are my thoughts on this record did you give this thing a listen did you love it did you hate him why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana De La Soul forever 
WtG5VhDBk9Y,what up everybody Antoine Fantin here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is doing a quick couple of raw iPhone reviews today one of which is for this new suicide boys tape album eternal gray a record a project that I was anticipating pretty highly not only given that I reviewed not too long ago the duo's latest EP which I thought even though I wanted more from it was an admirable effort had kind of this dark dingy southern rap sound that borrowed a lot from 3 6 mafia a little bit of Bone Thugs touch of Bone Thugs in there and if you're a fan of Bones I think you can really understand kind of where the duo is coming from appreciate where the duo is coming from excuse me so then on top of that EP I was highly anticipating this album because the single that these guys dropped from this project with Denzel curry one of the best songs this year one of the grimy as' hardest was aggressive just mind melting rap songs of her this year had me kind of sitting on the edge of my seat for a project that was really going to turn the underground into a bloodbath honestly like really turn the underground into a fucking bloodbath because that's just how deadly that track is and if every other track was as deadly it just would have been decapitated heads everywhere impaled on sticks but now that I listen to the record now that I listen to the project it's it's just okay you know it's not like this mind blowing experience that I was hoping for the duo brings their standard kind of eerie southern traps sound but then on top of that they don't really build anything that impressive in my opinion I mean they certainly experiment with some different stuff for one there's some weird kind of metalcore screams that pop up on the record here and there that's not like they could have been on like a you know one of those Orange County hardcore band records with like the tight pants and the crazy scene hair like a broken side record also a number of tracks on here where the flows and even the vocal deliveries change up like every few bars or so like you have these cartoony changes of flow and cartoony changes a voice that I I think if they had kind of pasted all these things out spread them across the record in a logical way it would have made for a very colorful and a vibrant album but instead it just kind of seems like they can't really commit to any vocal sound and they're just kind of changing things up because it's just a little bit of musical ad D I guess things just kind of shifting in random directions there's no real rhyme or reason and I think it takes away from these tracks more than it gives to these tracks because it kind of makes them hard to digest kind of makes hard to it makes it hard to make sense of what's really going on and a lot of the verses I think it distracts from as well which for the most part aren't really like you know the greatest I've ever heard though I would have certainly accepted something that was just kind of you know one-liners grimy violent aggressive in-your-face blunt to the point but I think just kind of the I don't know the duo's inability to really just kind of consistently deliver us some decent flows and performances on this thing takes away from you know what good things they have put onto these tracks then there's kind of the weird structuring some of these songs there are some tracks on here the opening track of puia for example that just completely forgo any sort of hook and it's not only that they just kind of bunch all these verses on top of each other into these short tracks then you know no one moment kind of stands out from the next er you're not really given a proper amount of breathing room between the verses to really kind of you know digest what just happened maybe hear a chorus that's going to kind of stick with you after the track is over it's not just that there are a few moments on here where instead of a chorus we just literally get dead space like we get air like it's it's just just quiet just quiet you know with maybe it's like a little drone or a weird kind of noise in the background and then the next verse kind of kicks off it just kind of seems like a really underwhelming rate a way to write a song or it's just kind of like a non way to write a song actually so yeah we have these uh just total avoidance of hooks on some of these tracks some weird experimental moments and vocal deliveries and flow change ups that I think take away from these songs unfortunately some of those screams are sort of horrendous um and uh when a song is kind of solid I think it's just kind of merely on par with what I heard on the last suicide Boise P and I was kind of hoping all along with this new project over here that they would go above and beyond a little bit and I do give the duo credit it seems like they tried to do that by changing things up trying a few things here and there that had really a played a prominent role in the sounds of their previous projects but the execution I think leaves a lot to be desired and then there's a few features on here most notably a - who is equally easily not equally easily easily one of those mediocre rappers out there right now have no idea why people keep handing him features but his vocals not only are they not that great but they're also buried in the mix of the pie where you can barely hear the guy so yeah there's there's a good handful of lackluster features on this thing - again that Denzel Curie track is just earth shattering but pretty much everything else it's on here is not really that impressive when sort of given a deeper inspection you know the the duo certainly pulls together the same vibe that you would look for from their previous projects you know it's a decent eerie grimy dark moody vibe but again the the writing the lack of hooks the vocals and the the flows I mean they're they're really not a that great in my opinion but those are just my thoughts on this thing you're free to argue with me down in the comments if you I'm not saying they're just my opinion because you can't attack me or anything I'm just saying it's my opinion so you could say your opinion that's all those are my thoughts essentially on this thing what are yours let me know down in the comments did you love this thing did you hate this thing why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana suicide boys eternal gray forever 
J_LvLhFq2IU,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new clipping album splendor and misery clipping is an experimental hip hop trio been following them for a while now given the group a couple of positive reviews from what they have released thus far and this new album of theirs highly anticipated for me especially since their last record in my opinion was so great their Sub Pop Records debut it was an album loaded with these technical fast wordy and grimy rap verses backed up with these sampled dense instrumentals and not like sampling chunks of music samples like clipping was incorporating sounds of ball bearings and Static and Distortion and even alarm clocks to build the music of this record now at least from my perspective as a music band it seemed like the trio's future was hanging in the balance as frontman Davi Diggs had landed a major role in the Broadway smash Hamilton so I was thinking would he go back to clipping would he continue to pursue a career in theater but it turns out he did go back with clipping not too long after coming back from Hamilton they put out the very rough wild dirty and lo-fi wriggle EP clipping really being as directed to the point as possible as they could on a lot of these tracks which I liked them but it did feel in a way a little beneath them because clipping couldn't they have got a little more conceptual with this thing ambitious but now that I here splendour in misery I think what they did on regal makes total sense because this is kind of a the flipside in a way this album is not really catchy at all in some respects and it is hugely conceptual really a story album in a lot of respects about a space traveler which I was not expecting at all but really I didn't know what to expect from this record especially when I heard the first single from it baby don't sleep which has this very skeletal abstract instrumental which reminds me of their debut mixtape which I liked quite a bit but this track seemed even harder to digest plus the tracklist - this thing was loaded with all these one-minute detours and interludes on the surface they might look like Phil but the truth is every single one of them plays fluidly into the very cohesive narrative of this record it's almost like David's time and Hamilton inspired him to come back to clipping and do something that was very theatrical very cinematic and it's a story that's told with incredible detail right from the opening track the breach where Diggs is rapping incredibly fast to kind of set the story and it seems like your typical opening clipping track there's a little drone or some noise in the background it's really about the speed and intensity of David's verse and then at the very end of it you're met with all these shots of distortion and feedback but it kind of sounds like there's a bit of a sci-fi twist to the sounds this time around and unfortunately he does not a and his verse with its clipping bitch probably because it doesn't play into the narrative of this story now on the song all black we have dahveed rapping again but this time over a very sporadic kind of droning instrumental sounds like Jonathan Snipes and William Hudson are really in movie soundtrack mode on this track and at this point in the album it is told to us that the spaceship that the story is set on is being commandeered by our protagonist who is referred to as cargo 2 3 3 1 and this story is kind of about his travels on the ship the fact that he experiences I guess what you could call space madness on this particular cut on the record he finds solace in rapping to himself he asked the computer he asked the ship if it has any beats for him to rap on so instead he's kind of rapping against the weird sci-fi s sounds of the ship itself which is I guess why the instrumentals sound so odd and this track is also kind of a mission statement it's a bit of a life affirming moment cargo to 331 says that he's not going to succumb to the all-black everything and I kind of get the sense in the story that he's a of being chased being searched for and at the end of the track the ship seems to put out this message where it's telling people not to come search for them not to come find them cargo 2 3 3 1 is not a threat this is love don't with it so the ship might be in love with him he might be in love with the ship then we're hit with an interlude where I imagine its kind of cargo 2 3 3 1 rapping over this static and distortion it kind of sounds like a lost transmission and this happens at a couple points on the record our protagonists exploits on the ship continue on the song wake up where he's kind of rapping about going into hypersleep it's pretty crazy because the the refrains are actually pretty frightening as dahveed is rapping there will be you know here when you wake up there will be no here no when you wake up there will be you know here when you wake up I also like the very fast pace of the beat and how they get crowns which is depth and then all of a sudden things take a serious change of pace musically we're hit with the song long way away which sounds like a piece of old gospel a spiritual and this is performed by very somber choral group with no real backing instrumentation of any kind and while it sounds nice at the time when I heard I'm like wow does this does this really fit in to what is going on with the album so far it's kind of confusing because sonically it sounds so much different than anything else but up until this point the album has been so unorthodox that sure why not throw a choral group piece in there right but as the album continues on there sort of seems to be this very clear juxtaposition of old and new music that sounds like it had been written or recorded hundreds of years ago and then music that sounds like it's coming from at least a hundred years in the future and these two elements come together beautifully on the song true believer where we have an interpolation of this slave spiritual into the chorus no even I'm going home which actually fit pretty snugly and nicely in-between w.zahn the track the song ends with like this robot box voice singing at the very finish which is pretty eerie but again fits into the track despite the anachronistic clash of sounds and it's on this track that a few things become clear that there are religious parallels between slave spirituals and W Derek's but also his reference directly to slave ships makes it apparent that our protagonist here is a victim of what I guess is a futuristic intergalactic slave trade he's literally a slave in the space age he's cargo on a cargo slave ship in space the front cover is literally depicting that as from the bottom half he is in torn pants and shackles but from his legs up he's in an astronaut suit which again I think plays into the fact that dahveed had spent so much time in Hamilton because I mean the period of time in which he was playing his character slavery pretty popular now the song era mouth is the album's lone banger it's the song that I think worked best as a single for this project though still I think it makes more sense within the context of the album that it makes outside of the context of the album because while it is loaded with some clever braggadocious lines a lot of them reference space and space travel sci-fi also one line about the protagonists haters or as enemies having had to make the noose a little tighter I also like how the ending of the track blossoms with these beautiful glossy eerie synthesizers and the ending the last several tracks of this record are pretty intense and add to the story quite a bit we have the song break the glassware car go to 331 pretty much goes crazy in a way loses communication with the ship so the intensity of the instrumental really ramps up gets noisy sirens going off tons of texture and this just a frightening refrain where he is rapping about having to break the glass in order to either get attention get out of the ship or just feel something and then from here we have a bit of an interlude on the song Story 5 now you might notice that if you've listened to everything clipping is done up until this point we've only had two installments of the story series so far so with this album being set into the future now in the story series we are also going into the future I guess I have heard that we will understand better what this tracks connection is to the other two story tracks once Story 3 and Story 4 are released but in this particular cut we are hearing another track that sounds like a spiritual that sounds like a folk song it's levered by a choral group and it is about Grace a woman named Grace who is going overseas fighting battles the story doesn't necessarily tie into the overall theme and concept of the record but there are some parallels on this track I think with being out of your element being away from home I think we're basically supposed to relate Grace's struggles on this track to the struggles of the protagonist and just kind of use this track again as a folk song to just kind of help us make sense of the trials and tribulations of their protagonist is going through now in the song baby don't sleep it sounds like we are getting the ship rapping again or at least Dobby does rapping from the standpoint of maybe the narrator that he was at the beginning of the record and the track is basically about our protagonists insane behavior on the ship as he just kind of falls further and further into madness due to his isolation talking about how he is most likely not going to survive the cold grips of space and right after this is the closing track it kind of sounds like we're leaving our protagonists in a better place as the instrumental is a little bit more triumphant and upbeat but um still lyrically it's pretty much we're leaving this guy stranded in space and maybe he'll make it probably not and the track gets almost trippy and surreal toward the back end with all these effects and some of the lyrics that dahveed is rapping it's kind of like clipping trying to make their own little finish to their 2001 a Space Odyssey and that's really the record it's an interesting album and I know I really went into the concept of this thing but I like the music on this record a lot too I love the instrumentals not just because I think they're super catchy I mean that was a little underwhelming when I was first getting into the album because it was sort of confusing but now that I understand the concept of the album so much more the sound of the instrumentals makes sense and is way more captivating to me now if there are some shortcomings of the album they are as follows for one the moments when dahveed is singing on this record aren't really that good I wish he just kind of brought in some of the singers he had on the other tracks especially when he is singing on the closing song on this thing to me the singing that he gives on this record is just not really up to par with his rapping and feels little awkward at points and then there's the fact that aside from the song air I'm out but even that track still nothing can be pulled out of the context of this record and really sound good or make sense you know there's not really anything that has single potential on this record so I think that's going to make it difficult for it to find an audience at least you know for your average person the more patient listener the people who've been following clipping up until this point I think will find a lot to love on this record it just doesn't really kind of have that banger potential that single potential that a lot of songs from their previous records did so that can make it a little more difficult to swallow because you've got to listen to it as a holistic piece but clipping didn't really overstay their welcome with this thing because it is just 38 minutes so if you want to hear a tight well-written detailed concept album and under 40 minutes clipping has delivered it now that's really the extent of my complaints on this thing aside from that there's a lot to love here the lyrics the story the flow of the album the combination of sounds and musical styles old and new the fact that once again clipping is made a hip-hop record but stylistically it's just so far outside of even the fringes of what you would normally categorize hip-hop music to be all the performances on this record are incredible I would say from the choral groups to the rap verses and finally it's again it's just worth praising that the trio has pulled together this really intriguing concept within such a short amount of time because there have been a lot of great concept records as of late but many of them have been an hour been an hour and 30 minutes so clipping in a way puts out really one of the most hard-hitting and direct concept albums to come out in a while but all that being said I think this is a really great record I mean clipping has done it again you know I don't really love it as much as I do their last record or maybe I can't even really love it in the same way I do their last record because they're entirely different animals I can always come back to that album for a ton of different tracks that are incredibly catchy stand well on their own whereas with this record over here really have to listen to the whole thing in one sitting I don't want to going I think I've said everything I need to say about this album I'm feeling strong eight to a light nine on this thing really impressed with it I hope you guys are as well and I hope I was able to shed some light onto what exactly is being said and the idea of this album or what I think the idea of this album is and I hope I didn't spoil too much for you either because I know that maybe if you miss some of this stuff going back and listening to it and looking for those elements looking for those hints looking for those parallels between the new the old slavery future past all that stuff could make the album more interesting certainly transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate you're the best you're the best so should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you disagree with my thoughts on this clipping in album okay bloom limit limit anthony Fantana clipping splendor and misery forever 
S4XyD506RrY,hmm this nutritionist EP it's not good clickbait queen of YouTube is back with a brand new set of tracks on she makes music for Christ's sake God why and this is not Trish's first rodeo over here she is in the past put out the fat chicks EP the superficial bitch EP the daddy issues EP whose lead single features a cringy video that just rips off the plot from taxi driver and let's not forget her under the covers album where she delivers cringy renditions of siya days soldier of love and green days basket case no and now with this new EP over here It's Showtime but it doesn't really feel like Trisha is pulling out all the stops or anything on this new project it just sounds like another bunch of plainly produced pop tracks featuring her painfully average voice supported with some auto-tune whenever it sort of has a shortcoming which is pretty often it's to the point where I feel like I'm listening to a text-to-speech generator sing me pop songs to put Showtime in a nutshell it's essentially Rebecca Black pushing 30 no it's not entirely accurate maybe this EP is more like the musical submission of a child's beauty pageant contestant pushing 30 Trisha on the other hand is old enough to be aware that her music isn't all that good and old enough to know that if it's not good at this point you should really pack it in I mean her her lyrical talents on this EP haven't exactly improved it feels like love I don't know if I felt this before it feels like love come on baby pour me some more and then oh she pursuits to us saying is this love in a robot voice or on the EPS closing self love and self empowerment anthem damn I look good Trisha assures us on numerous occasions that she also looks good [Music] why the fuck you lyin why you always lying you lyin who is producing these generic dance-pop kind of dubstep infused sometimes instrumentals for is like poor home producers who she's just licensing random instrumentals from after she makes money off her vlogs where she talks about I hate this food I had sex with this celebrity I had sex with this food I ate this celebrity the song Cinderella has a little bit of a trap influence where that's rattling high hats but the lyrics on the track don't really have anything to do with Cinderella the Cinderella story or plotline why she sort of frames herself as Cinderella in this track I don't really know most quotable lyric on the track though is I got that Nicki Minaj it goes badonkadonk da and the title track on the EP is Trish's lone attempt on this thing it's sounding meaningful and it's it's kind of misplaced because it's like she paints herself as this artist in the spotlight on a stage when in reality she's on camera putting a hundred layers of fake tan on her body and a hundred layers of what she had originally titled come on her face so yeah the CP it's not good it's really a trashy pop music with absolutely no flavor whatsoever no personality lackluster vocals bad mediocre songwriting terrible lyrics and the only reason you might enjoy this thing is if you're such a blind Trisha Paytas fan that you like anything and everything that she does and there you go my thoughts on this not good EP a try and a and those are one's thoughts on this new Trisha Paytas EP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love hata why what do you think I should review next and that's it guys I'll see you in the next video hope you're doing well Anthony Fantana Showtime is not good forever 
z1v-F1WgI9w,hi everyone table here the Internet's busiest nerd and it's time for our monthly y-you know review segment where I go over a series of Records that I did not formally review over the past month in a standalone review so I'm going to so I'm going to talk about them in brief yeah let's get into a factory floor over here with a new record some DFA dance music on this thing DFA records the label that you should be familiar with if you're not look them up and of course dance music on this thing it's pretty left-field its robotic it's chilly it's icy it's nothing but motherboards and wires and all that stuff it lacks a human touch consciously and as a result I have a hard time kind of connecting with it having any fun with it really even wanting to dance to it and this was kind of an issue I had with their last record but it's even greater here it's like here they wanted to be even more alien and you know if that's how you want to hear your dance music then you're probably gonna love the hell out of this thing but for me personally I like a little bit more of a personal humanized angle I guess Fame post rock band over here they dropped one pretty great record years ago and then fell off into obscurity and now they're back like a decade later new album and I was pretty excited to hear it given that their last one was such a seminal record in the genre but this one over here while it is pleasant does have some pretty instrumental passages to it it is a pretty dynamic record and it doesn't really overstay its welcome either it still would have been much more refreshing to hear this maybe shortly after the release of the last album because now it just feels like it's not really bringing anything new to the table and I wanted to like this thing you know I didn't really want to believe in my heart of hearts that post raucous is is completely out of ideas but still this album isn't really making that case unfortunately mr. Dean blunt saw fit to name this thing 10 out of 10 so it must be a 10 out of 10 I think it speaks to peripheries creativity that the band essentially releases the same album over and over and over and over the same generic gentie guitar tones the same angsty new metal screens that have been sounding dated for the past eight or nine years the same neutered clean vocals that sound like something out of a Lincoln Park or a My Chemical Romance record the band even releases every LP with nearly the same album cover just this is the same logo just slightly varied with just a little bit different graphic design and color scheme and there doesn't really seem to be any kind of grand scheme or concept linking all of these tracks together either I mean as obnoxious as a band like Dream Theater can be I can at least give them credit for making a 90-minute album and making numerous long albums that actually have a clear concept to them whereas periphery just name something part three and it's it's not really the third part of anything other than the ongoing saga of a band that refuses to evolve in any significant way this is just a record that exemplifies how bankrupt of new ideas a lot of progressive metal bands are we have some sludge and doom metal here that is pretty heavy actually one of the heaviest records I've heard this year however some of the riff writing I think is kind of bland the Buried screamed vocals don't really do anything for me either but I will say that there is occasionally some backing instrumentation and some sound effects that kind of elevate the very gloomy sound of this band so if you're looking for some doom metal some sludge metal with a bit of instrumental nuance to it maybe you'll be into this thing however it is like 90 minutes long so it is a little bit of an epic maybe too epic for me as this sound kind of wears on me a little bit after a while at least if it doesn't have kind of some more visceral explosive passages to kind of make these slower movements a little more interesting but for people who like their metal very patient very meditative very hard very monolithic then you should give this thing shot while beasts on this record not really the quaint funky and emotional group that I have come to know them to be on this one instead they're trying to write a record that has a little bit more pomp to it a bit of an 80's pop and rock pastiche on some of these cuts writing songs that are a bit more direct and I feel like the end result is just kind of met it's like the band sounds a little awkward on this record trying to attain some sort of swagger or a strong just to the point pop sensibility you know the vocal sound kind of awkward over this new instrumental style that they seem to be going for as well wild beasts me have always thrived within the subtle nuances of their songs and these seem to be kind of dissipating on this new set of tracks unfortunately I'm just kind of indifferent toward them too many skits for something titled home of the strange this certainly sounds like your run-of-the-mill indie rock and pop record that was written and recorded for a mainstream audience who have never really even heard an indie record in their lives Watsky you may know I did kind of thrash his last record I'm sorry it's just legitimately how I felt but he did hand me this newest record over here and I wanted to give it the old college try because the dude is running his own show and he seems to really be putting all this effort in his music and he's just not making rap music that I'm interested in honestly and it's a myriad of different things I mean it is his consciously corny lines I mean and though he is self-aware about it it doesn't necessarily make them easy to swallow his delivery to me is still painfully geeky and this is coming from someone who calls himself a music nerd and on this record the instrumentals seem way more overdone than they were on the last record like he's trying to do this big instrumental presentation like he's trying to be the next Macklemore or something with the jazzy instrumentation and the background singers which the hipper and the funkier the music sounds in the background the more out-of-place watsky actually sounds with his gimmicky fast flow and his super emo verses that are just pathetically sad a lot of the time so again it's just not for me it's not hip-hop music that I'm that I'm interested in I'm just going to put it down I'm not going to touch it again and I want to touch it don't make me touch it and now we have the unwary astre turn of the 2000s biggest pop diva miss britney spears and yeah with this latest project over here she gives us a new sound though it's not really new for the mainstream really what happens as britney falls into line with all these other mainstream pop records that are out that have this kind of ethereal syrupy slow moody aesthetic to them think like the new justin bieber record the new zayn record and i think the end result is just that it's just really underwhelming not a whole lot of punch to this album because it seems like just trying to make these long spiraling non songs is the way to write a song in 2016 and i think we're gonna leave it at that that has been this month's y-you know a review relatively painless didn't even lose a limb so i think that's cause for celebration thank you guys you're the best transition and those are my thoughts on all of these albums in brief of course this has been the wining overview appreciate you watching to my side over here you can watch either the previous wine overview or check out the why you know review playlist where we have pretty much all the videos in this series listed down and you can just kind of watch me suffer for hours on end cool cool I know you're excited about that alright guys I will talk to you later have a good one but bye 
fWxQJiyLK1k,"ah [Music] hi everyone wear the knee shirt tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new glass animals record how to be a human being UK pop band glass animals they are back with their sophomore full-length LP reminds me a bit of similarly funky and artsy rock and pop outfits from the UK such as alt-j or wild beasts I think glass animals sounded even more similar to these groups on their previous records ABBA but under sophomore effort over here the band seems to be doing a better job of defining themselves a little bit more namely with all of this really funky and foreign percussion lots of hand drums also I think the production in general is a bit better more vibrant more instrumentally dense and there are some amazing grooves on this thing I mean some of the instrumentals on this thing are absolutely killer cannot help but want to dance to this thing and man some of these beats are just so far outside the spectrum of Western music that it will have the cultural appropriation police banging down your door just for playing this thing too loud especially on the song life itself which is the opener to this project great performance lots of energy coming through on the track and even though the instrumentation and the beat seems super upbeat there are some very dark vocal melodies woven into this track that keep the mood just a little sour the band can play a kind of ominous but feel good at the same time although I do wish the vocals on this cut and really the rest of the cuts on the record had a little bit more personality to them a bit more character a bit more of something that would allow me to pick these vocals out of a lineup they seem to sing in this really effeminate vibrato that reminds me again of those groups like wild beasts and all J but doesn't seem to contain the quirks that actually makes me remember the vocals from those bands so unfortunately glass animals don't really come through with the personality of the contemporaries that they seem to have a lot in common with if it wasn't for the fact the instrumentals and sometimes the songwriting on this thing were so good that I couldn't deny it I would just call this record a carbon copy or just boring but the fact of the matter is I love the song season 2 episode 3 which is this very subtle and quiet ballad the band has a knack for writing these very tiny and emotional songs that pull at the heartstrings really well and actually I have a lot of interesting quirky bits of instrumental worked in even though the track is low-key there might be some interesting chord progressions or glitchy effects worked into the track I also dig the song Mama's gun as well the vocal harmonies on this thing the plucked strings are all incredibly well layered and assembled for a pop record this thing is super duper refined but not so refined that it can't have fun I also like be very hypnotic and eerie vocals on the cut cane sugar those are a highlight too and the instrumental with its rattling high hats so it's a little trap flavored now it's the more animated tracks surprisingly that I find to be more of a letdown on this record tracks that are more energetic there dance here but I feel like they don't take that vibe far enough like the band has really got a groove going but the instrumental in the performance seems a little too reserved and a little too reeled in in order to really kind of get me excited get me jumping off the walls the music on this record that is more upbeat sounds more like the soundtrack to spending an evening in a Brooklyn bar where the beer is overpriced and it's loaded with women who you would never want to date ever like social media gurus for Gawker or BuzzFeed writers and then there's the song pork soda unfortunately not a Primus cover but the track does feature some of the most horrendous lyrics on the entire record many of the lyrics though do seem to reflect on the band's recent experiences since the blow-up of their last record and also of some like commentary on the mind of Millennials or just millennia a life in general and while some of the liens that the band offers here and they're kind of interesting I wouldn't say across the length of the record they come to any great truth or observation or make any statements that are really going to kind of make people look at millennial lows in a different way the album features a short interlude in the middle of the track listing and then after that the second half of the album just fails to bring back the magic that the first half had at least on some of the tracks the song take a slice I appreciate how dynamic the track is but I feel like the payoff these quiet and tension building verses is followed with isn't really that exciting it's actually at this point in the track where I feel like glass animals maybe unintentionally do a bit of a ripoff of Nine Inch Nails closer it's it's like they tried to recreate closer but not so close that they would actually get sued and there's something about the opening guitar lines on the song popular' street that remind me a little bit of Red Hot Chili Peppers namely the song under the bridge but the band I guess comes to a little bit of a different conclusion on the chorus even though the verses do sound eerily similar in a way and then we have the song agnes where it feels like the band is really overstepping and trying to force this really upbeat happy glitzy sunny vibe that sounds like a quaint summer night spent with friends all of whose parents make $100,000 salary a year at least and you're all just hanging out in your classic cars under the star looking at fireflies you don't have a care in the world because because you don't have a care in the world other people are suffering jackass it's the kind of music that I feel like would be set well to like those just girly things tumblr images but I digress a little bit having said all that I think this is a decent pop record you know that you could certainly do worse by pop standards and while I think the band really could be saying more interesting things lyrically or at least connecting these things in a more significant way and they could be delivering some better and more interesting vocals there are some decent ballads and songs on this thing the production is really tight and colorful and well put together without actually kind of sucking away the energy from the mix it's not too clean it's not too pristine it's not sanitized or anything like that some of the performances some of the grooves on these tracks are great catchy as hell sometimes the band comes off eccentric and and a little on the fringe but it's only when the songs are so quiet that they can't possibly be catchy or punchy or instantaneous it's the louder tracks on here that I find to be the blandest it's kind of like a weird paradox you know when the band is quiet they seem a little unique when they're loud it's like their personality traits just vaporised a little bit I see the potential for glass animals come through and make a much better record in the future but for right now I'm just mildly enjoying what they're offering me over here I'm feeling a decent ooh strong six on this thing tritscher tritscher transition have you given this album a listen did you let it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best or the vessel should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my thoughts on this record thanks for watching forever "
