Zel8mYBDrZg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review circle takes the square decompositions volume number one these guys are a scream oh and post-hardcore outfit whose heyday in the early and mid 2000s can pretty much be summed up in one single album as the roots undo its one of the most celebrated albums in screamo genre that is appreciated for its extremity especially in the vocals as well as its poeta sysm and melody if you're new to the genre definitely check out bands like page 99 envy or kid seshu but what circle takes the square brought to the table around this time was a slightly more progressive edge a lot of the song structures on this debut full-length of theirs were pretty winding lasting over six minutes in one occasion almost 10 there are a lot of riff and groove and time changes throughout these songs very frenetic pieces of music and the playing especially with the drums was kind of flashy now when it comes to scream Oh honestly circle takes the square while I do like them they've never really been my true drug of choice I've always been more of an Envy fan and mostly because they posed to me a much more car gancho and feel in their songs emotionally and sonically you can really kind of feel a very bold post-rock influence and a lot of their Tunes the circle takes the square didn't flirt with that as much as they did experimental rock and math rock I mean against the test of time the album really has kind of held its own with all these multi-faceted songs these male female vocals that are screaming or harmonizing and like I already mentioned some fantastic drumming there's a lot of contrast on these tracks sometimes these guys will be going into these extremely triumphant and epic scream sessions and then match them up with these slow quiet very spacious and melodic interludes that are sometimes graced with some very strange deadpan singing they go from fierce and fiery to stone-cold in a second however the band didn't really managed to stay intact after the release of this album the band's drummer moved on they lost a guitarist as well there was definitely some lineup rotation going on circle takes the square is is really a completely different band at this point not just because of the lineup change but because of time I mean it's been about eight years since the release of the roots the only major piece of material the band has put out since then is just that little EP that they dropped in 2011 which was decent and kind of forecasted to the sound that the band is working with now on this LP if this band's debut album was way more math rock and progressive rock influence I would have to say that this LP is way way sluttier it's slower it's a little bit heavier there are some familiar things on here though I mean the vocals are pretty much the same aside from a little bit of tweaking with the cleaner cuts and the band still hits some pretty speedy tempos as they transition out of these heavy crushing riffs but when the band moves from point A to point B to Point C and D it's nowhere near as stark of a change that they used to indulge in on their previous LP they're really not breaking into those quiet interludes with the force and the element of surprise that they used to and now when I'm hearing these some vocals they don't feel so much ominous or deadpan but maybe a little bit more emotive at times kind of cultish I actually think the cleaner some vocals the more melodic moments on this LP are actually this album saving grace including this LPS 10-minute acoustic closer you guys know I'm into heavy stuff but just so many of the louder spots on here kind of underwhelming like be syncopated noodley guitar leads in the middle of way of ever and branching paths though the slower guitar chords that kind of kicked in right after that with the narrative vocals were pretty sweet moving I like the track a closing chapter to that is one of the few songs on here aside from the end track that is actually pretty melodic throughout and stays engaging I think because of it especially toward the end where you're getting all the furiously strum guitar chords matching up at the drums I just love the rhythm I love the syncopation and it's a nice touch that the song just slides into the next track with a bass line a lot of songs do kind of just transition into another kind of making I guess this LP feel a bit more cohesive but still unlike the band's debut LP I don't really feel a distinct progression to this album unfortunately the only track that really kind of hits me as being like whoa this is a huge shift this is a huge change and I really moved from one track to another here is when the acoustic closer kind of comes on this album is produced pretty well I like the vocals and when a melodic spot does come in it's really enjoyable but the loud spots on this LP and there are a lot of them to me just kind of a mass into this big indistinguishable slow riffs do that when I'm listening to and thinking about what I'm hearing there's clearly a lot of ingredients but just very little layers of flavor even the climactic moments the band manages to build up to in these louder spots are cut kind of short in favor just diving back down into the hectic Rivage I still ended up enjoying a lot of the performances and each song does have kind of a primary or a key melodic moment or break or build up that actually is pretty entertaining unfortunately I didn't like this as much as I expected I was going to but you know whatever such as life I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what should I bring you next anthony Fantana circle takes the square breath 
gVx1ME8KaZY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's stuffiest music nerd little runny nose right now hmm and you know it's time for another one of these quick weekly gauntlet reviews where I talk about a group of releases as well as tracks there's just been too much awesome stuff going on over the past week and something needs to be said let's start off with a few things that I would like to highlight this up-and-coming electronic also live instrument group psychos has all these rehearsal demo videos up right now it's some really interesting stuff to me sounds like groups like holy as well as Death Grips it's pretty interesting check out those videos linked below this video this band named the dirty mill has a new split single out in their side of it is awesome a nice catchy piece of alternative rock that sounds like it came out of the 90s a heavy ass guitar riff some awesome melodic leads and just a really catchy song Hong Kong Hong Kong and finally Touche amour and the pianos become the teeth having you split out look that up as well automata Gucci now the New York chiptune rock outfit has dropped their first single from their forthcoming album their first full-length LP in a while the name of the LP is endless fantasy and this song sounds like the beginning of an endless fantasy it's titled meow yum-yum yeah yeah there's a bunch of cat sounds in it but man it is more hyper melodic and energetic than ever Anamanaguchi really stepped up with the production this time it is just so thick so dense so detailed just filled with rich lush neon colored synthesizers it's so freakin powerfully fun and overwhelming I mean it is just party party party party party kitty pryde Dead Island V in the tumblr rat princess has a new track out a new video along with it a lot of people are saying that she's kind of up to the quality of her rapping on this song she's sounding better she's becoming an artist who's worth paying attention to and I was impressed with some things in this track I like the instrumental I like the vocal sample in it which I believe came from a major laser cut and you can certainly hear that Kitty is is flowing really well underneath this bead but her vocals are so muffled I can barely make out anything she's saying you know I know there's more to hip-hop than just lyrics but I feel like her especially I would love to hear what she's saying at this point in her career where she is growing she may be putting out a full-length project later this year she's kind of forming this persona and forming the style past the songs that initially made her famous and and I feel like the lyrics play an important part of that progression can you tell him psych for this album I mean every bit of music that has been dropped so far from this forthcoming Thom Yorke fronted project has been pretty good too great and I would say that this song sits on the great side of the spectrum stylistically the song is pretty similar to default I'm feeling a very heavy sort of the eraser vibe on this track but that doesn't mean it's not done really well I mean I love the beat on this song the mm-hmm like sampled and recorded and looped throat sounds on this thing sound fantastic I mean it makes the rhythm so much weirder and pretty unique outside of that humming I guess you would call it the beat is really rhythmic it's very detailed I like the way it kind of plods along with just all of these drums just flying in at every angle it feels like something I would hear off the King of Limbs but maybe with a bit more detail a higher range of frequency you're hearing those lows a bit more clearly and on top of all these rhythms and these throat sounds I mean Thom Yorke lays out all of these wery just very somber vocals that and some acoustic guitar being matched up with all these electronics I mean it's really raw clean acoustic guitar place really beautiful chords I'm what's not to like on this track my Serge coalition yes if I owned a calendar like a physical calendar I would just mark February 19th on there with a marker if I owned a marker if you remember these guys from a few years ago they are a Danish noisy post-punk II rock band with just a ton of raw and and to be reckoned with energy Coalition is the first track they've dropped from their forthcoming LP titled you're nothing and I was pretty surprised by the direction of this song overall the band is sounding a little more clean a little more composed not so drowned out in noise and effects so of course everything sounds a bit less hazy but I feel like the band has kind of pumped up their energy level and they're playing to kind of make up for that on top of that the song that they're playing is is pretty catchy too I think the song has a lot going for it I love it it's just got me even more psyched for this forthcoming album new David Bowie track where are we now David Bowie's 66th birthday is this month and with this new LP that this song comes from he's gonna be releasing his 30th studio recording amazing accomplishment there are a few artists whose influence is as far-reaching as David Bowie's everything from art rock to glam rock to pop rock and he championed numerous great groups through either covers or production or songwriting like the Stooges and Mott the Hoople Iggy Pop development underground and then the guy put out at least half a dozen classic records in his heyday but to be completely honest I was kind of underwhelmed by this track I wasn't really in love with it I thought the instrumentation the production was kind of hollow lifeless made it feel like an adult contemporary track however I mean I don't really expect that much from David Bowie at this point not that he's not capable of making great music still I'm just feeling like he's made so much great music already I'm not you know gonna get angry or get upset if this record you know isn't awesome are fantastic it's not gonna make or break my opinion of David Bowie in terms of songwriting and vocals the track is very syrupy it's very weary kind of saddening I feel like the emotion that David Bowie puts into this track is the greatest thing it has going for it although there are times when I feel kind of ambiguous about the vocals I can't tell if the way David Bowie's singing is due to some kind of vocal weakness or the message and and the places that he's talking about in these lyrics just have such a great personal meaning for him Skrillex leaving EP I'm actually pretty happy that you know the new dubstep King if you will you know let me call him that graced us with a handful of tracks to kind of kick off the new year and you know you could really just spare me the whole is it dubstep is that this is that argument I don't really care I mean I just like that Skrillex produces such heavy fun jittery electronic music that is just very full of life now this new EP has three tracks that range from pretty good to the track that opens this thing up the reason has a great party atmosphere especially toward the end of the track where you have all these whooping synthesizers against these building beats the dude really really freaking knows how to build tension in a track I mean that's pretty much what he built his name on building up that tension and then sort of bringing that drop after this track Skrillex brings a dub version of a previously released track that was actually pretty decent but the closing track on this EP has a lot of people kind of talking it's the title track and it actually kind of sounds like you know that style of dubstep that people claim to be way better than Skrillex's version of the genre the style that artists like burial perform the beats on this thing are way more subtle there are no wub wub whoops there are vocal cuts of a female singing sort of scattered and chopped throughout with some reverb sounding very kind of delicate I know Skrillex has taste and electronic music that is wider than most people give him credit for it wouldn't surprise me if he was into burials music and into a lot of these more subtle dubstep artists but I still can't help but feel like this track isn't all that necessary because for this style of electronic music this isn't really all that well produced the sounds are kind of flat and bland and the vocal sample is just absolutely boring it just sounds like a less detailed and less fine tuned version of what's already out there omar rodríguez-lópez guitarist really multi-instrumentalist member of the mars volta as well as a composer has dropped not one not two but three full-length albums very recently I was really excited to kind of get into these things and dig around and just see what he drummed up that was so amazing that he had to just put out three full-length albums at once but I was kind of disappointed to hear that there was just a lot of maneuver in dull Junt low fibers just nondescript cacophony there are just a lot of noisy progressive rock cuts on here that I feel like the bad recording hurts them more than it actually helps them plus there are some songs on here especially on Equinox that are way more electronic drum machine back kind of poppy I have to say that I felt like unicorn skeleton mask was the only one that I thought was at least somewhat enjoyable although the 15-minute cut El Paso Texas on Equinox was pretty impressive and I will say finally that the up-and-coming hip hop trio known as super helpful consisting of Chuck strangers from pro era as well as kwame 3000 and Lee Bannen have a new project out called the help and while Kwame and Chuck are not really my favorite rappers I do think Lee Bannon is an underrated producer who is on the come-up and producing better beats for better artists as he continues forward there are some throwaway tracks on here especially the opener which has some pretty you know hair-raising singing on it but then again there are songs like lawns the feature Joey badass on here have a great instrumental and stylistically actually kind of remind me little bit of like Mad Libs Quasimodo work and those are the songs and releases and just sort of recent musical events that I would like to discuss thank you very much for watching I love you you're the best mwah mwah mwah stay healthy and yeah that's it the needle drop quickies forever 
4ZFpIxySk6w,oh my god my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's nose runny aesthetic nerd and it's time for a review ASAP Rocky long live ASAP ASAP Rocky is a Harlem rapper and this is his commercial full-length debut since blowing up a few years ago with the infamous Live Love ASAP mixtape which was actually one of the best tapes of that year featuring tons of hazy just atmospheric production from clams casino as well as a lot of chopped and screwed vocals very relaxed flows and overall a very kind of druggie hazy vibe but before I get completely entrenched in this review I have to address a few questions and issues that constantly constantly come up with ASAP Rocky I do this to kind of circumvent the angry fartcloud of comments that is sure to gather underneath this video easy at truth at ASAP Rocky is a mediocre lyricist yes that's true ASAP Rocky is pretty much an average lyricist he does have flow he does have charisma and personality he does kind of have his own little rap style but still as far as lyrics lyrical content wordplay a lot of the magic is really there per se however we are kind of in a new era of rap where lyricism isn't dead but a lot of rappers that aren't that lyrical can easily compete with rappers who are very lyrical and the thing is they're making worthwhile music as well the not so lyrical rappers because they are more likely to go down a road where the beats are catchy or the hooks are more infectious I personally don't feel like you need to have all these heady meaningful messages and a ton of impressive lyrics in order to put together a good project does ASAP rocky depend too much on his production I most can't believe when people say stuff like this like yeah of course ASAP Rocky is very dependent upon his production the beats he chooses I mean the beats he chooses makes his projects worthwhile however in post 2010 post My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy hip hop land what MC isn't dependent upon their production yeah guys like Action Bronson and Big KRIT and Danny Brown and Kendrick Lamar as well as yay are all praised for some of the things they say some of the messages that they have I mean certainly contribute to their personalities but they're also unique because of the beats that they either produce or they choose to hop on I mean the instrumentals that they choose to rap over give them a musical edge that makes them stand out against other MCS is it true the ASAP rocky didn't invent the sound he has yes ASAP Rocky is incredibly influenced by other styles of hip-hop and he is kind of this amalgamation of all of them everything from East Coast style boom bap to Southern Houston stuff chopped and screwed as well as those darker more atmospheric rappers such as Space Ghost purp who people seem to be really angry that ASAP has gotten way more famous than him in the rap game with that style you know he wouldn't be the first guy on the planet to kind of get influenced by a growing style and then make a huge record with it so what is it true that ASAP Rocky sounds like ASA Brack ASAP Rocky's name does sonically resemble that of ASAP rock and I don't care I think it's hilarious that people actually think he did this to try to grab the attention of ASAP rock fans when that wouldn't even really be a good marketing scheme considering that one rock makes an entirely different kind of hip-hop than the other I don't think there's a lot of crossover fandom going on here so there's really no reason to compare them or even think of one when the others name is mentioned it's asinine now that now that now that now that that's out of the way I am well aware of ASAP Rocky's flaws and for sure they can come around and bite him in the butt I mean I think we all saw that when he dropped his ASAP mob mixtape a little while back last year only so many of his weaknesses can be piled on top of one another before you're just listening to crap but honestly I was pretty surprised and impressed that he came through on this album one track after another ASAP rocky makes the right beat choices gets good producers good writers on here current features he writes and co writes the right hooks and on top of all that he maintains his style while still coming through with an album that feels a bit more commercial has some nice radio friendly singles and I'm sure some people may even interpret this album as a bit of an improvement over Live Love ASAP because of its variety because of its more detailed production and overall it's more kind of expensive sort of new improved and and revamped feel don't get me wrong I do think Live Love ASAP is a great tape and it's consistently slow and hazy feel makes it a pretty potent listen from beginning to end but what ASAP rocky does on this album instead is just brings variety a little something for everybody something for a different mood on almost every track and even though yeah he doesn't really step up lyrically or anything like that I do think he proves himself to be pretty versatile more versatile than I think some people assume he could be this album opens up with the bass rumbling title track which has all this disjointed imagery thrown together of cash registers ringing guns cocking cocaine horses and it's kind of got this gangsta vibe to it but it's also posed in the sort of weird reverb artsy way that I like a lot and I love the spacious falsetto vocals on the course that just soar over the beat once the track switches off from the verse it is just a nice transition and one of the prettiest moments on this album this track has quite a few producers credited to its name and it really shows the track Goldy comes in shortly after this it's pretty much like a haters anthem but a hilarious one saying that people are talking about him until they get lockjaw ASAP Rocky throws out some corny lines here and there like I think I'm the tell me do I stink there's another line on here saying I think I'm King ask Coretta Scott but honestly it's not that serious it's kind of semi a joke yeah ASAP Rocky does put forth this really cool personality he's very composed much of the time very cocky but at that but at the end of the day this album is about fun it's about being appealing and ASAP rocky manages to do that while still having this really kind of cavernous sleek and sort of dark vibe right after this track pmw comes in which of course stands for money weed what did you expect and this song is just you know another extremely charismatic stunt anthem with some nice atmospheric synthesizers and a lot of clickety-clack rhythms schoolboy q comes through the nice feature and moving ahead I actually enjoy the song problems quite a bit Drake's on this track as well as 2 Chainz on the hook Kendrick Lamar follows up in the back I actually think Kendrick is the weakest moment not because he's a bad lyricist or anything like that but I just feel like this party track especially when she's like in jiwan's that did to me he just feels slightly out of place here he's so much more fitting on the song 1 train a little bit later which is this huge long Posse track really lyrical really hard-hitting I love the epic cinematic beat on this thing I've mentioned this song in a previous video and I'm still enamored with it with huge names on this thing like Action Bronson Danny Brown Big KRIT it just does not and yellow wolf 2 does not disappoint ASAP rocky goes kind of weird and suicidal on the song Phoenix and he gets kind of personal with his rap history and growing up with hip-hop and just being a hip-hop fan at the closing track of this thing there's also the dubstep and reggae influenced wild for the night which actually features Skrillex on production which I believe was kind of a flip of a Burdine and name production this French DJ outfit that you should definitely check out so this album does have some surprising left turns some messages and cohesive narratives here and there I will say though this album does have its low points for one ASAP Rocky's singing toward the end of Phoenix yuck also the song pain has really one of the most nondescript beats on this entire LP and of course ASAP Rocky's lyricism doesn't really make the song feel all that distinct either he'll also on this album which features Santee Gould has some decent verses you know some interesting personal quirks in there with ASAP rocky saying we used to be in rugged boots now we're getting tailor suits but the Santee Gould hook is just so flat lifeless it doesn't even feel like she's trying to put emotion in her vocals and fashion killer is this incredibly saccharine in a sickening love song where it seems like ASAP Rocky is rapping about woman but he's more interested in the clothes she's wearing that's really kind of what's making him fall for her I mean you know you could throw some clothes on a mannequin and maybe you would look attractive to him at this point I don't know this song really should have been a bonus track could have gotten switched out with ghetto symphony and that would have been nice and ironically this track credits way more writers than most of the songs on this entire LP and it's just oh all still I have to say overall I enjoyed listening to this album a lot I mean I thought it was really really good for a commercial hip hop ever and ASAP rocky came through with his head held high his bass rumbling his atmosphere there his cockiness there I mean you know not that he really needed to change all that much to make a commercial album Live Love ASAP in and of itself really kind of plays with a lot of those hedonistic ideas that commercial hip hop usually does but still that's not to say that ASAP rock doesn't have his own angle on this style he sort of ushered in this more atmospheric production as a mainstay at the moment I'm going to stop ranting I'm going to stop ranting I'm feeling a strong 7 to like 8 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think loved it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana ASAP rocky forever [Music] 
Aq-kK9XNebo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review to EPs in fact double EP review things that happen a day and things that happen at night from my low [Music] [Music] Milo is a Wisconsin rapper and his debut album slash mixtape I wish my brother Rob was here was not just the best del the funky homosapien reference of 2011 but also in extremely creative and fun as well as personal hip hop album from an MC who painted his nerdy lifestyle as not just a joke or some kind of character Milo might have spent a good chunk of last year playing Diablo 3 but that does not mean he doesn't have worthwhile thoughts feelings and it doesn't mean that he lacks self-awareness kind of sidestepping that overly goofy like Big Bang Theory esque nerdy character Milo revealed that instead he is just this guy whose mind kind of runs a mile a minute all over this LP Milo's kind of flawed character makes him incredibly incredibly relatable even to people who aren't necessarily experiencing the same things that he is he himself has said in lines that he is not the greatest at structuring a song and that maybe he's not the most able rapper out there plus once you get into his influences like bus driver and open mike eagle it's clear that he takes things away from them stylistically still despite all this Milo comes off particularly peculiar shortly after the release of his debut project Milo came out with a Milo takes baths which was kind of a concept EP where he was rapping over a bunch of beats produced by baths it was okay you know to me it felt like kind of a goofy ER and less potent version of what I had already heard on his debut tape with a few sort of personal updates thrown in there and now this latest group of tracks comes through with this double EP this day and night EP which the only major sort of difference between them aside from the title is that one EP was produced by one person and the other by another day being handled by Riley lake and night analog tape dispenser and I was kind of expecting this but I was sad to find that I didn't really see an eerily complex set of connections from one IP to another or anything like that overall they just kind of feel like two sides of the same coin because conceptually and lyrically instrumentally and emotionally these EPS have quite a bit in common for one the production on this thing is way way way more melodic detailed and Atmospheric especially atmospheric on the second of these two EPS these atmospheric spacious instrumentals just bring the emotive quality of Milo's music to a new level especially on the track like almond milk paradise which is the last track on the first EP Safari aloes on the hook singing nicely the instrumental is blissful it's heavenly it's got a really upbeat smile inducing mood to it but then the second half is so dark and strange and murky which is a huge juxtaposition from the pristine pianos that were on the first half of this song plus Milo's rapping on the second half comes off a little more urgent and the emotion of this side of the track changes to to kind of being a little self-defeating where you saying if I had written the greatest rap song I wouldn't let you hear it to kind of continue on the production the very cool chorus vocals on the opening track to the first EP here Sweet Chin Music which has a lot of wrestling pro wrestling references in the lyrics the chorus vocals awesome just so pretty I like the reverb soak percussion on the track cut my hair and there are more Airy tones on the song folk metaphysics with some weeping guitar kind of mixed into these synthesizers as the song progresses I love that sound that kind of pops in the beat and surprisingly Milo actually reappropriation Eirik sand melody from The Wallflowers song one headlight the chorus specifically and his singing is noticeably improved I'm not saying he has a huge range but he's sort of making sure he kind of stays within what he has and the song legends of the Hidden Temple which comes in right after that the strings on that track are beautiful I mean it's such an elegant song the acoustic guitar in there too just this mix of instrumentation and the cords that are being played it's really sorrowful now as far as the second EP here from lazy kun to Gus Haynes and just onward everything is just some of the best production I've heard in this more atmospheric hip-hop production style that has been kind of coming up ever since guys like ASAP Rocky a little bit popularized the vast reverb on the first track and the sole sample on the second track here there's just a lot of sheen on these instrumentals I mean my low fan or not he has definitely definitely stepped his instrumental picking game up as well as his recording game because I mean the vocals sound way better too so I mean the beats on these EPS are really good but I enjoyed this project lyrically to Milo is still kind of the same dude he was on his past releases he is a highly referential dude he is a guy that constantly gets caught up in his own personal musings as well as his hunt for objective truths and the indie rap culture he currently thrives in whether he's having bus driver on for a verse or rapping about debating philosophy with open mike eagle or talking about in a song whether or not you should be making more kitty pryde references wishing that he could sing raspy like going to sufi or seeing in this abstract visual concoction Danny Brown stung by itself floating in space on the track folk metaphysics Milo is spitting kind of like this personal to-do list for his life or kind of like a series of New Year's resolutions where he's saying I'm gonna eat more Fig Newtons I'm gonna sign women's rights petitions I'm gonna be better than my father I feel like on this track Milo sets all these goals out for himself and he's kind of in a way determined to make it all happen but he's facing all these difficulties and shortcomings and past failures and failures that he is sure to make in the future however he doesn't really keep that from making him feel any less determined I guess it all to me kind of feels like that Baz Luhrmann track you know the wear sunscreen track I mean maybe not quite so much on the level that I'm giving you advice but it's just in a way kind of weirdly moving and and Milo's lyrics and in his inflection when he's rapping on the track legends of the Hidden Temple that combined with the instrumental on that song I just feel like I'm listening to some kind of just personal emotional tragedy unfold before my very ears I mean I think the only major flaw with a lot of these songs are for sure the hooks which again on another song here Milo kind of says I wish I was better at songwriting and there are some hooks here most notably on songs like where he's saying I need to make more kitty pryde references not that that's a bad lyric or anything but there are hooks like that one that feel a little too long and jumbled to really kind of have a hook enos to them or anything whether it be a silly love tune like that folk metaphysics track addition to or something funnier a little more racially charged and clever like the Gus Haynes cribbage league track it's pretty much the same Milo but he has gained some experience points he's leveled up he's evolved into the next form however you want to say it what really matters is that Milo has pulled together a series of tracks here that have fun creative sometimes interesting thought-provoking and moving lyrics and great instrumentals I enjoyed the first while on more than the second but putting them to sort of as one project I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this EP set if you've given them a listen what did you think of them love them hate them why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana Milo hairdryer forever [Music] 
e8imGBOTic8,hi everyone Anthony pantano here buh-buh-buh-buh-buh classics week is over it's dead it's gone it's buried it'sit's killed for 2012 classics week 2012 done and now it's time to get away

forward to listening to this year what artists do you hope get their acts together and actually come out with a new LP as far as new releases which I understand should definitely definitely be coming out I am crazy looking forward to listening to more and reviewing the new ASAP rocky LP i know it leaked a lot of people been talking about it but i am looking forward to doing that one as well as the new Toro y Moi LPD to indie dance grooves from chas swedish metal outfit ghosts should be coming out with an LP in the spring from what i understand as well as voivod not the spring but you know thrash metal outfit voivod dropping new album this month another heavy release from cult of luna is dropping soon some experimental electronic music later this year from Matt mos I'm also looking forward to hearing the debut from up-and-coming pop outfit Rai Chris Owens from girls new album as well as Thom Yorke's atoms for peace the new ill bill LP should be a grimy ass hip hop album and electronic music producer kavinsky might put together a pretty huge album this year I mean from what I heard from the the teaser the trailer I mean some really big Dancy epic sounds might come out of this release I can't even describe how excited I am to hear new lps from Danny Brown and nails I'm also looking forward to hearing more material from pop trio Haim if any of the stuff on this new album that they may drop this year is as catchy as the EP they dropped last year I mean it's going to be held an album also nick cave and the bad seeds that album is already released dated and projected and the the track that they've dropped so far is really great also the knife where have they been what have they been doing this whole time oh my god I need here new knife album looking forward to reviewing the new foxygen LP very soon and Ice Age post-punk noise outfit Ice Age they need to trap an album's here that tears my face off and then my 2013 will be pretty good cat6 Arab and the pastels should be dropping their new full-length LP this year their first album in over a decade and freaking My Bloody Valentine is projected to put out an album this year too according to Kevin Shields in my fantasy world of 2013 if not a Wutang album then definitely some new full-length material from ghostface killah and raekwon I'm also crossing my fingers for in avalanches album a waves album a kanye album a no age album an album from xxyyxx who really should drop something this year to kind of strike while the iron is hot as well as hudson mohawke lunes or just tonight in general I mean they've had a high year but I think people would love more material from them this year also kind of hoping that BADBADNOTGOOD does something this year considering how prolific and just consistent they've been in the past few i think captain Murphy should strike while the iron is hot as well and his death from above 1979 going to get it together this year and do something also crossing my fingers for Beck cold cave and I've read in a few places that the new madvillain album is kinda almost semi may be done also what will Death Grips do this year for people who hated Death Grips especially but maybe even for people who liked Death Grips maybe 2012 was a bit too saturated with them or 2012 just in general was Death Grips year what could they possibly do in 2013 I mean maybe a new full-length album in the next three months would be too much too soon but considering how much they've evolved in their three major releases and how close they were all released together I think maybe easily they could drop an album somewhere in 2013 and have it sound different enough from all their other releases that it's likable okay it's fine yeah yeah of course Tyler's wolf and Earls new album should be dropping this year I'm especially looking forward to seeing if the Earl album does turn out good I hope it does and finally this I'm gonna do something this year are we gonna get some Sun some kind of maybe live album or studio album I don't know you know I really need some also from what I understand low should be coming out with an album soon and and so I watch you from afar that's pretty much my list of releases that I'm looking forward to this year artists who I hope drop something this year let me know what your looking forward to in 2013 what albums from what artists would or will make your 2013 yeah awesome Anthony Fantana anticipated releases forever 
5XfIPy6iJsw,my sons my daughters how are you I hope you're well I hope you're well Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for yet another review of an older album for classics week Miles Davis bitches brew Miles Davis trumpet ear bandleader composer and one of the most versatile musicians in jazz really since Miles Davis started putting out solo albums it seemed that no matter what new idea or musical concept was coming up in jazz he was there to either spearhead it or just wholeheartedly embrace it with a top-notch album that rang true of Bop of cool also his modal masterpiece kind of blew and later in the late 60s and early 70s when avant-garde jazz and fusions of jazz and rock music seemed to be the next new hot thing he was there innovating and while this LP is maybe not my favorite of his fusion pieces and and definitely not the easiest to listen to there are moments where it does get pretty damn impenetrable I in a way sort of prefer in a silent way for for a shorter easier listen the grooves are a bit clearer the ambient esque interludes on this album are gorgeous and it all seems to be a little bit more composed later after bitches brew Myles would fly in the face of funk and an afro be with albums like on the corner and the extremely fiery and kind of psychedelic Agharta but bitches brews undying popularity does kind of make it miles definitive fusion piece and it's really no wonder why I definitely think the strong rock influence on this LP does make it sort of an easy transition for rock music fans this album also for its time at a very you're catching name as well as an illustrious album cover plus the extremely lengthy list of guest musicians and a very long long run time does make this album pretty much miles most ambitious foray into this style of music every track on this LP is a panoramic display of these very loose fluid jams that are very instrument and improv heavy this album is actually pretty post-production intensive for a jazz LP there are a lot of in song edits as well as echoes reverbs tape delays the sounds on this LP are so clear and sharp and vivid throw this on some headphones and it's actually like sitting there in the middle of the studio session there are instruments all over the place there are at least two drummers on every single track typically one mix all the way in the left channel and another mix all the way in the right and the same goes for electric piano players to the tracks Pharos dance and Spanish key feature three electric piano players each now as far as some of my favorite and most notable players on this LP for one there is John McLaughlin guitar player and Billy Cobham both who made fantastic music in the infamous Mahavishnu Orchestra Jack DeJohnette also brings drums Chick Corea play some fantastic electric piano all over this thing Wayne Shorter soprano sax Joe Zawinul electric piano and each of them contribute some writing to this LP as well and there are many many other players outside of these guys on this LP too just a lot of great jazz fusion giants on this album that either had their own solo albums or projects out there a lot of them on the very jazz fusion friendly label ECM records and another thing that kind of steps this album outside of the traditional jazz realm for the most part it is electric and just rock instrumentation on this thing the only obvious exceptions being Miles Davis and Wayne Shorter but of course benny mal pin is on a ton of tracks here playing his very prevalent bass clarinet it does feel kind of weird having a woodwind in the midst of all of these guitars and and drum sets on this LP but it actually adds a pretty interesting texture on a lot of these songs I mean with the production the players the instrumentation and the song lengths bitches brew can pretty much be summed up in one single word and that is XS and I wouldn't even say it's like well groomed excess on a lot of songs here miles is completely happy to sort of lay a tempo or a groove or a mood or a key out there and just kind of let the jam progress naturally beyond that quietly urging certain band members to improvise a certain times there is definitely not a tight snazzy swinging feel to this LP which usually gets associated with the word jazz it just goes to show how much of a jazz purist Miles Davis was not if anything he was in fact just an improvisation purist and while bitches brew was not exactly pushing the avant-garde jazz or the improv envelope as hard as some other LPS that came out around this time did or even some LPS that preceded this album bitches brew is certainly one of the best full-lengths when it comes to improv of this shade something that is performed with a large band very lengthy and rock influenced there are parts of these tracks that do feel very clearly composed whether they be introductions or themes or just sort of syncopated riff something like that that brings a song from one area to another for example the very kind of refined and slow buildup of instrumentation on this album's title track as well as miles bright and echoed shots of trumpet once this passes some bass guitar bass clarinet comes through starts playing some lines and the song goes into its next phase a very dark moody and funky groove but it's not like a good time funky groove I mean it's just got this very sour quality to it has this heavy sense of uncertainty or everybody's trying to make know of what everyone else is doing but also be heard and add something worthwhile it's this tension that kind of makes the songs on this LP sound a certain way this song and many others on here just bring the just awesome electricity of improvisational chance it's like what's going to happen next wow they are really riding this groove so hard it's getting more tense getting less tense you don't really get these very clear posts moving any of these tracks from a to point B to Point C when the songs on here shift it's it's a very kind of subtle or gradual shift the music doesn't just kind of break into a catchy melody or anything like that it doesn't bring the tension into a sweet spot so that you can kind of have a break and not think of what's going on and if the never ending sense of tension for 20 sometimes almost 30 minutes makes you uncomfortable and totally turns you off to the idea of listening to a record then that's fine maybe this LP isn't for you but regardless of how planned out this album is or isn't I will say that you're basically hearing on this album track four tracks some fantastic performances from some of the best players in this style around this time now as far as other notable moments outside of the jams easily the introduction to the song Pharaoh's dance that bassline right at the beginning is unmistakable and the droplets of electric pianos slowly falling onto that track are just gorgeous it's such again a very vivid cinematic song if the first two tracks the longest two tracks on this LP are maybe a little too dismal a little too long-winded for you or uneventful then definitely try out the song Spanish key really one of the more hard grooving tracks on this album and on this track you really do feel those double drum sets as the band is hitting some really fast tempos as they boil over with energy plus there's a spot in the song where John McLaughlin and then Chick Corea are dueling in each channel guitar and electric piano it's fantastic hearing them just bounce leads and melodies off of one another after that Wayne Shorter has a huge solo piece in the middle of this song and his playing is fantastic especially when he hits those high notes and lets them wring out and the way he moves and shifts in intensity as the band gets louder or gets softer underneath him is just really impressive around 8:45 on the song this riff sort of pops in that changes the song into another gear or just sort of a revamped groove that's not the only time this occurs in that track but it's really one of the most clear sort of shifts from one moment that's on to another on this entire LP like I said there are changes in our posts on this album it's just that they're usually pretty subtle and sort of slow arriving really the meat and potatoes and what makes this album so attractive are the jams John McLaughlin kills it on the track that he's attached to Miles Davis runs the Voodoo down is another hard grooving song if you've loved Spanish key and what was once the closer out here sanctuary before a lot of modern reissues of this LP added another song toward the end of this album which is also awesome but still back to sanctuary I love the skittering drums on that track and the way the slow-moving and echoed horns kind of interact with the drum sets on the track it's just so so strange there's not much more that I could say about this LP in terms of describing the tracks I mean to go beyond where I am now I feel like would be insane I would be describing literal solo moments in the middle of the songs and the thing is if how I've described this album generally it sounds completely like a turn-off to you then chances are you don't care what the solos out like if you're looking to get into jazz music there are more accessible and more traditional albums that you could listen to a lot of them made by Miles Davis but if you want to listen to some really strong unique improvisational music with some potent moods some very clear vivid instrumentation just piled in layers upon layers upon layers that you can really get lost in for hours and hours at a time then give this a try Miles Davis bitches brew if you've given this a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why is this one of your favorite albums of all time if so why why not let me know Anthony Fantana bitches brew forever you 
iG_0Exs9jTQ,suppiy oh Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd here and just woke up not too long ago and you know just getting straightened doing this new classic review over here because here we have reviews for breakfast let's do this my Bloody Valentine loveless these guys are a rock band hailing from Dublin Ireland and this album is possibly probably the most seminal shoegaze album ever however while this LP does pretty much lay the groundwork for a musical movement I would not say that loveless is like an island of musical thought or completely unorthodox for one shuji's itself is kind of an offshoot of a lot of musical styles that were around the time of its inception neo psyckadeli ax noise pop dream pop and it's not entirely difficult to imagine the existence of loveless when you consider that the release of this album was closely preceded by other releases from bands like the pastels Sonic Youth the Sundays the Jesus and Mary Chain Stone Roses spacemen 3 and Galaxie 500 and the band themselves didn't just pull this album out of thin air they built up to the release of this album with the yeah a debut album but mostly a series of EPs that kind of evolved My Bloody Valentine from a gothic post-punk band to a musical act that embraced the tenants of noisiness lo-fi recordings and hazy walls of effects the fact that all of those things that happen before this LP actually makes lovelace arrive at really the perfect time is that a wood chipper at the time of the release of loveless My Bloody Valentine was belinda butcher who was on guitar and vocals kevin shield guitar vocals who also brought a sampler into the picture plus he co-produced this LP with the band's drummer column deputies on bass to put it simply at least in regards to this album I would say she gaze is a genre that sounds exactly like how this cover looks we have an image here that if we look at it long enough it becomes clear that is a guitar but it's slathered with all of these just i seducing waves of pink smog and these waves are so plentiful to the point where it obscures the guitar but also kind of makes you see the guitar in a different light and the act of obscuring an image or just obscuring an original thought or idea or sound is something that we do a lot today in modern media from bands shooting their music videos on 9 millimeter or on VHS or people loving to take polaroid pictures or even instagram pictures with smudgy filters intentionally making the picture look more grainy there's plenty of low fine music out there that intentionally shoots for a dirtier sound there's been a huge revival in terms of 90s boom bap flavored hip hop instrumentals because a lot of those drum Tambor's back then had a dirtier feel to them My Bloody Valentine did not invent the idea of obscuring an image or a sound for artistic effect but on this LP they definitely took it to such a creative extreme that it became just inspiring and kind of jaw-dropping it's the act of obscuring that actually makes this LP interesting if you listen to the opening track on this LP and your only thought is man this guitar chord progression is pretty slow and boring and the vocal is kind of quiet and underwhelming then you're doing it wrong not to say that if you don't like this album then you just don't get it or that you need to be in love with this LP I will admit that if this entire album were to be acoustic there'd be a good chunk of songs on here that would be pretty boring but that's because Lovelace is an album that is not song focused as much as it is sound focused what really makes the track only shallow so enticing are the thick heavy massive guitar riffs that open the track up which is backed up with all these whaling shots of feedback of different shapes and sizes that leads and all these bright compressed chords and just miscellaneous levels of fuzz that can only really be separated mentally in sort of your mind's eye with dozens and dozens and dozens of listens from the very start this album is just kind of melting my grasp of the concept of sound before my very ear and while this album does have songs like this one that are loud and that are thick I wouldn't exactly say that Lovelace really kind of rocks it's not a fast paced album it's not an album that has a ton of momentum rather it is very mid-paced kind of chill sort of relaxing in a way it's a very static album it's a very psychedelic album it's kind of like staring into space at all these colors just kind of appearing before your eyes which of course are brought there courtesy of whatever hallucinogenic drug you just ingested trying to make a heavenly album with all these loud sort of ear shattering sounds doesn't exactly look like it would be an easy thing to do on paper but yet it works so well at least in this instance of practice now as far as the remaining ten tracks on this album goes My Bloody Valentine just kind of looks for a series of different ways to liquefy and overblow all of these simple and and somewhat shy rock and pop songs the song Loomer is especially viscous because of its lack of drums I feel like I'm just sort of dipping my arms all the way up to my elbows in like a vat of molasses or something like that when I put this track on and the way the guitar chords hum on the track to hear knows when it just feels like TV static and the way it sort of moves and shifts over the song it's really sort of surreal the guitar sounds that Kevin Shields and company were coming together with were just insane essentially this guitar tone that is just sort of wavy but also sharp but also light is really one of the weirdest and most psychedelic drones I've ever heard of my life the track when you sleep is really one of the clearer and just more straightforward songs on here but still the hook on that track is haunted by all these spectral guitar noises that sort of overshadow the song again the sound is just so weird and just so unique and otherworldly that it becomes captivating to me anyway there are a lot of tracks on this LP that I feel kind of follow the same blueprint of this track I only said is another example another standout though is definitely the track sometimes which is one of my favorites on here a beautiful little tune and maybe the closest that this LP comes to like in an acoustic ballad and the way that the song is written especially in terms of the melody it sounds like a track that the Smashing Pumpkins would produce much more clearly just a few years later the guitar drones on the track blown a wish are especially icy and just glossy and the closing track on here soon one of the longest on this LP is one of my favorites and and for me really the first time since the opening track that I actually feel like I'm hearing a drum beat that rocks that is just very still plane and kind of rigid I mean I'm really kind of hearing a danceable groove on this track and my Bloody Valentine really milks that as they're finishing off this LP now as much as I do love this album and do you think it is intensely creative and unique I don't think it's for everybody because of the sheer fact that it puts an extreme priority on sonic properties or properties as opposed to songwriting while when it comes to tune and melody and chord progression my Bloody Valentine does kind of present a limited set of ideas on loveless I do think there is more than one way to skin a cat you don't just have to write songs with me I mean what they were really trying to do on this LP is compose songs with a certain kind of sound and you can't really argue that that didn't happen considering just how much this album stands out so if you're looking for some pretty heavenly light rock and pop with some really really detailed and mind-altering sonic manipulations then most definitely give this a listen if you have heard my bloody Valentines Lovelace what do you think of this LP love I hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan oh and B V forever 
CEpKouCO6L8,fixing my eyebrow cuz it always sticks up sup y'all anthony Fantino here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for yet another review of an older album a vintage album an aged album King Crimson in the Court of the Crimson King King Crimson is an ever evolving and changing progressive rock band hailing from the UK whose only real consistent member over the course of King Crimson's many phases has been guitarist and keyboardist Robert Fripp however that is not to underplay the role taken by other musicians in the group at this time or really at any time in King Crimson because as the band's roster changed so did their music I mean the group but sometimes ultra its lineup midway through the year in addition to gaining or losing a member pretty much every single year since the release of in the Court of the Crimson King until the band's very first hiatus in 1974 and the band did make really good and worthwhile music after that hiatus for sure but this album represents really a golden age for King Crimson coming before the extremely experimental and indulgent larks tongues in aspic and the slightly more New Wave influenced discipline I would actually go as far as to say this album pretty much represents the starting of a golden age for progressive rock in general however in 1969 when this album dropped King Crimson was not the only rock group trying to advance rock music before King Crimson had put together this full-length LP we had releases from soft machine jethro tull Moody Blues of course Zappa was already releasing music can and the debut yes album actually preceded this LP by a few months as well in this particular version of King Crimson's lineup you have Robert Fripp on guitar you have Michael Giles on drums Greg Lake on bass and vocals Peter Seinfeld doing the lyric and Ian McDonald really coming through as a multi-instrumentalist on this thing with vibraphone saxophone flute among other things also how can we forget the Mellotron and the five tracks that this LP has to offer are an awesome musical journey and I know that sounds really cliche but I do wholeheartedly mean that the band starts with nothing but feverish riffs and some insane drum fills on the opening track 21st century schizoid man it's a no-holds-barred opener with some extremely just ah escalating and exciting saxophone leads the catchy distorted vocals on the hook it is a really heavy track and from there we move to the balladry and in flute Armin ease of I talked to the wind toning things down a lot more but but still very detailed beautiful inspiring while this tune is still very much rock song the melodies and the chords being played feel so funky in a way I mean the it's just archaic kind of in a sense it's like I'm hearing this old music from a completely different world or something like that the melody is is absolutely intoxicating and even though this is a quieter song the drums still very very detailed and kind of improvisational against the song but still not really impeding upon the beauty of it enhancing it and the flute solo on this thing is it's great and from there we move to the extremely just dark middle piece of this album epitaph it is a Mellotron kissed dirge that really helped associate this instrument with progressive rock and King Crimson in general they went on to use this instrument many many many times on subsequent albums and the band's yes rush Alan Parsons Project and many many more would write some really powerful music with it as well and if you can look at how the Mellotron worked I mean this keyboard instrument was an extremely important piece of technology for its time because it was kind of playing tones that were essentially sample but it's got kind of like a grainy quality to it then that feels familiar like I'm hearing an orchestra or something like that but it's also very haunting King Crimson definitely shoots for something sort of orchestral at the beginning of this track with some big drum rolls a lot of reverb and when the song finally kicks in is just absolute drama being filtered through this rock music lends the guitar chords on this thing are just like breathtaking whether it's the hugely strummed acoustic guitar chords that just call out with echo again and again and again along with some very very I'll use the word again dramatic arpeggiated guitar chords and they slowly build the track higher and higher and higher not just instrumentally but emotionally I mean this song just feels like death to me every single crescendo the band brings on has this intense wave of sadness to it that I think very few artists ever have bottled into a piece of music as well the track is just an absolute funeral dirge especially during the the last minute and 47 seconds of this thing where the music it's incredibly incredibly heavy with the drums and the Mellotron the track mood child which comes right after is equally as effective the track starts off with all these mournful guitar leads and eventually goes into some very somber guitar chords and keyboards and while it is a very pretty tune I loved the vocal melody on this track the band quickly kind of evolves into this very sort of quiet understated and and very spacious improv session where you're hearing nothing but Keys drums guitars and and later some vibraphone everybody is making sound but nobody wants to step on one another and you're hearing the instruments interact in a lot of ways throughout this track somebody will play within a certain key or play a certain rhythm and another instrument will react to that and they're not afraid to totally interrupt and break this very intimate improvisational session apart with the opening chords of the clothes tract on here in the Court of the Crimson King which if the song epitaph was like you know the death of a single person and was like the funeral for that person this track is the apocalypse and musically and melodically I feel like this track is a lot like epitaph in in a way it's kind of like the reprieve in this very theatrical prog rock masterpiece it's really heavier than any other song on the album with these long slow drawn-out chorus vocals in the code of the Crimson King and the drums are going crazy just some of the best drum fills and progressive rock ever being laid out all over this track and the crescendos on this track get heavy heavy heavy as well especially when these harmonized guitar leads come in and I mean the album really ends as as strong as it started and it's funny I feel like I should have more to say about this album but I simply don't because there isn't a ton of material on it it is under 50 minutes which is sort of short by today's progressive rock standards considering just how much ability and technology the genre has gained since the late 60s however that's that's definitely not to shortchange this album I mean this album is a beautiful starting point for anybody trying to get into this genre I mean it's an essential starting point and it's because of the haunting and sometimes abstract lyrics it's because of the extremely masterful masterful playing it's because of the longer song lengths where you see a group of very experienced musicians drawing tracks out not only great solos but very cohesive improvisation I mean the first track on this thing alone makes an essential listen for any rock fan in general much less a prog rock fan and while I feel like a lot of new modern music listeners today may sort of roll their eyes at an album that even thinks about being this indulge in I say to you listen with a slightly more open mind and I think that you'll just get a lot of joy out of how well these guys played together because the technicality and the finesse that Fripp and company bring to their instruments enhance the songwriting on on this LP distract from it it's not like you're hearing verse-chorus 12-minute guitar solo the really great playing is peppered throughout these songs in a really tasteful engaging way personally that's where I feel like a lot of modern progressive rock groups kind of missed the mark the clean playing the technicality the high quality production is most certainly there but they forget to engage the listener on this extremely artful and and deeply emotional level to which to me is is the thing King Crimson does best on this album especially with tracks like epitaph so if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why Anthony Fantana classics weak King Crimson 
-7_UEorW3Vg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd Happy New Year and it's time for a nother review of an older album today Dead Kennedys plastic surgery disasters Dead Kennedys is a California hardcore punk band who at the time of the release of this album in the early 80s their roster consisted of jello biafra on vocals D H peligro on drums Klaus flouride on bass and East Bay Ray on guitar and in my opinion this was one of the best quartets in hardcore punk during their time I mean tight talented unique and very creative this help he is Dead Kennedys sophomore full-length for the most part I've seen more I guess sort of accolade it's given to their debut album people really prefer that LP over this one but in my opinion this album is actually nothing but improvement past the debut LP maybe it didn't really have the strong viral and kind of punk music defining singles like California or Alice or holiday in Cambodia but still I think this is some of Dead Kennedys best material if not their best material the period for long the production on this thing is absolutely fantastic the guitars on this LP are just brittle eardrum shattering fire just the way they kind of fuse in with the bass in this recording sounds great plus on top of just East Bay Rays guitar tone he plays a lot of intensely catchy and melodic leads and solos all over this album I mean this dude is a fantastic guitarist and some strong elements of surf rock and and rockabilly show up to especially when he's throwing on a little bit of a vintage reverb onto whatever he's playing while Dead Kennedys was a punk and there were clearly other influences coming from genres such as jazz and blues especially from clouds fluorides baselines at this point Dead Kennedys career Klaus was an extremely refreshing Punk bassist I mean some of the stuff that he did with the pick I mean his pick etiquette for one was fantastic and sometimes like I'm tracks such as riot he'd just sort of pull something crazy like just be strumming these chords on the bass he played the bass with a lot of speed a lot of aggression it was rough but also very tight and focused there was a lot of treble on his bass tone too which had a nice grinding quality to it now as far as the drums go it is fast fast fast very muscular playing from D H he just brought so much momentum and so much thrust to this record I mean his snare rolls on the track buzz bomb opening up the song are fantastic and the way he would just bust into a song like when the main riff kicks into the song forest fire just the flurry of symbols that come in and snare drums and kicks all at once it's just so overwhelming how much sound hits you at once when he just sort of brings the drums into play and jellow the band's frontman really one of the most unique frontman in punk rock not only because of his personality but his singing style is lyrical content while a lot of people do associate punk music in general with political ideology political revolution very few punk vocalists had the detail and the level of satire that jello did in his lyrics and as far as his singing goes will yeah like any punk vocalist jello could and did show aggression he would scream occasionally but typically he sang pretty cleanly but when he did sing it was in this insanely weird vibrato and not only did that really set him apart from many other punk vocalists but the extreme amount of emotion and intensity he would put into his vocals not just you know I'm angry I'm angry at something I'm pissed he would really act out a role in these songs like the extreme paranoia and urgency coming through on the track well-paid scientist or the I guess sort of self-centered and very cocky persona he puts forth on buzz bomb or the young dumb and shallow effigy he kind of puts together on the track terminal preppy and what he would say when he was kind of in these roles was was really some of the most cutting-edge social commentary of the 80s I mean really to the point where a lot of it is kind of relevant today to an extent Dead Kennedys debut album to me had a lot of kind of wacky zany silly violent shenanigans going on left and right this album seems a little bit more focused on kind of making a point where on government flew this story of a government literally kind of testing chemicals and drugs on the people through the water and other various means either poisoning them or experimenting on them terminal preppy kind of makes fun of young dumb college kids going to university just to get a business degree and get drunk and get laid and really just kind of jerk off trust your mechanic kind of paints this evil picture of the drug industry where people have to basically take drugs to survive because of an illness or an ailment but it ends up screwing something else up and you have to take five or six or seven other drugs moon over Marin talks about pollution riot is this really just disturbing story about the kind of mentality that goes into a crowd of people destroying everything and kind of has this very funny mantra lyric saying that hey tomorrow you're homeless but tonight it's a blast in Halloween that makes fun of the fact that we had this one national holiday dedicated to dressing pretty much however you would like for an entire day whereas we really have to conform to what society thinks we should dress like on dealer bases for the rest of the year with great guitar playing great bass lines drums and thought-provoking captivating and sometimes even hilarious vocals Dead Kennedys and this time in their career were a tight well-oiled punk machine turning out one fantastic song after another and whether it was a short song that was under two minutes or a track that came out around five these guys would put a ton of detail into these songs whether it be through their playing or through song structuring nearly every track kind of has a very unique characteristic to it whether it be a musical one or a subject sort of lyrical topic oriented one like these saxophones on terminal preppy make that track even zanier and kookier their Winnebago warrior has all these funny female background vocals and jello going yeehaw as he's making fun of these people I sort of get Winnebagos and then go out for the weekend into the wilderness and kind of rough it it sounds like I'm listening to some sort of punked out version of a spaghetti western soundtrack the Dancy groove on Halloween is fantastic the really intense and just dark sour instrumentation on the song riot perfectly I mean musically accompany is the story that jello is telling especially as he gets to the part where there's a line of cops up against all these people who are rioting the extremely hilarious forest fire with how that song starts off about eating berries and then getting high and wanting to turn into an arsonist really the silliest and most sense to sleep violent track on the entire album but still sort of turns into a very dark satirical picture of these extremely rich people who are very materialistic trying to save their things as their houses are burning I really could go on and on and on about what every single song sort of brings to the table on the whole plastic-surgery disasters is one of the most unique creative and colorful punk albums of the 80s there are very few punk albums from this period that I prefer more than this Dead Kennedys always have been one of my favorite bands in hardcore punk and they continue to be and with albums like this in their canon I don't see that changing anytime soon playing production lyrics songwriting it's it's really all here for me on this album if you've given this thing a listen that what did you think of it do you love it do you hate it why is it one of your favorite punk albums if so why not what punk albums do you prefer more and and that's it if you haven't given it a listen do try it out because even people who I think aren't necessarily into punk can definitely see the musicality that these guys bring to the table see the satire it has that punk speed it has that punk volume but I would say this album is much more animated than it is just angry alright thank you for watching Anthony Fantana Dead Kennedys forever [Music] you 
u7JPMQkVuMo,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're starting off classics week we're talking about some popular beloved older records that I don't normally talk about on this channel taken sort of a break you know oh bit of a break from new stuff talking about some older stuff we're just going to kick things off with Matt villain Matt villainy Matt villain is the infamous pairing of MC / producer MF DOOM and producer / MC Madlib and the one single album they released together in 2004 just happens to be pretty much the most celebrated abstract hip hop album ever this LP is proven to be pretty influential to a lot of upcoming emcees lyrically stylistically conceptually instrumentally but but even if this album influenced no one it would still be an extremely potent unique creative strange and pretty oddball hip hop album with a strong personality let me list off a handful of things that sort of make this album stick out to me for one the continual non-stop flows that MF DOOM throws out on one track after another passing for the most part on choruses on many of these songs which are pretty brief and the flow that he uses on this album as well as almost every other project MF DOOM has ever been involved then is pretty hypnotic and I feel like what also kind of makes that sort of entrancing characteristic come out is definitely dooms very dark deep and grimy voice usually MCS that repeat a flow this often get a lot of shit and and just you know don't get any respect and I feel like MF DOOM has taken this thing that it would usually be a negative aspect and turned it into a kind of unique characteristic when he spits he goes pretty much one two three four five six seven rest like an eighth note rest or even like a sixteenth note rest and then goes back into it one two three four five six seven benedetta dot that attended of that but it added added enough he can use a variety of different rhythms depending on what the words are that he's saying in a given line but he typically likes to leave a a Thor a sixteenth worth of space in between one line and another line I'm not exactly sure why of course there are moments on this album and on other albums where he'll totally skip over that beat he'll sort of bring the lines a little closer together sort of erase that space entirely but he works in this meter so often if any other MC uses it it's instantly recognizable as oh that that sounds like MF DOOM now if there's anything that sets MF DOOM apart from other emcees besides his flow his very gravelly voice or his mask it is definitely his lyricism MF DOOM does rap about himself like other MCS do but when he does it he tends to kind of do it from the standpoint of a narrator he'll say doom does this doom does that he does this he does that and of course as he's referring to himself he raps about his rapping ability writing rhymes off Heinekens and his villainous deeds and the violence and the shenanigans that occur within his verses it's all very very cartoony to me it kind of in a wu-tang like way but really even going further down that road to the point where I feel like I'm reading comic book or why like watching a Saturday morning cartoon but like for adults a Saturday morning cartoon featuring superheroes that kind of catch themselves in sexual situations or have no moral compasses whatsoever and of course this vibe has helped along with sound clips that are very animated either sound clips that are kind of talking about this duo of villains that's sort of being edited to make it sound like the guy talking about these villains is in fact referring to mad lib and doom or even some clips from the Fantastic Four show referring to Doctor Doom who obviously MF DOOM sort of you know takes his character from and even though this album does feature a plethora of sound clips like this and that that certainly does paint a picture nothing sort of brings the image into fruition more than MF dooms lyrics like on the track curls where MF DOOM opens with this line how he gets money like curls and everyone else's squirrels trying to get a nut in his mad world or the song meat grinder where MF DOOM goes through these extremely coded bars about this strange encounter he has with a schizo prostitute who's got a little bit of a lisp or the song America's most blended where he is nominated for rollin the best elves and they wondered how he dealt with stress so well fancy clown kind of details a breakup MF DOOM style strange ways to me kind of highlight some extreme societal hypocrisy z' and the ultra abstract shadows of tomorrow which actually has mad lib rapping as Quasimodo over the track is is really one of my favorite songs on this entire LP it's just such a lyrical attack on the concept of time it's sort of mind melting like any other hip-hop album there's a strong element of egoism here but it's for this totally dark weird made-up character that the MF DOOM put so much effort into that he seems you know almost real the lyrics are to me just one half of the magic of this LP I mean Mad Libs production is just freakin awesome all over this album there are a lot of jazz samples a lot of soul samples stuff that you would to be in hip-hop generally but in hip-hop especially if you're a huge fan of many artists on these Stones Throw Records roster but still despite the fact that Madlib does pull from genres that are typically associated with hip-hop samples what he does with a lot of the snippets of sound that he takes and incorporates into his beats is just so freaking off the radar like the track accordion where you get the dude like the track accordion like really a trademark track off of this LP I mean one of the major ones that everyone remembers mostly because of its quietly pulsating accordion sample humming away bringing a really interesting sound to a hip-hop beat that wouldn't normally be there I love the sharp little rhythm behind this accordion sample and the synth bassline that comes in around 50 seconds in awesome the beat has a ton of personality but it's also kind of understated a lot like MF DOOM himself what I love even more than that though is the Sinister upright bass line on the track meat grinder in that wailing sort of strange reverb guitar that pops it occasionally in that sharp rhythm guitar in the bass line on the track America's most blunted boom BAM POW and the drums on that thing so crispy and the track curls the the rolling vibraphone melodies on that track it's just so amazingly bubbly and then fun and the way the organ pops in later into the track I mean it feels like I'm listening to some kind of radio drama from the 1950s or something like that it's it's just another awesome sonic addition to this track that just kind of hits you with one sound after another these songs on this LP they're very very linear they don't loop around from verse to a chorus to a verse once again for the most part a lot of the songs on here just kind of continue onward on this one groove and kind of hit you with one new little piece of instrumentation one new sample one new little vocal snippet one new kind of change or just sort of ad-lib MF DOOM throws in oh yeah I love the quickly picked guitar groove on the track shadow of tomorrow by rendering a man the watery scents on the track Figaro and the somewhat muddy soulful vocal sample on the track strange ways and I like the way the strings is there building up on the hook on that track I mean how they just sort of rise up it's it's quite beautiful just so many unique freakin sounds on this album and even the tunes on here that have beats that are a little more straightforward and I guess kind of you know I guess I would say conforming to a usual hip-hop sound like the song fancy clown even that has some vocal samples that are cut up in a really interesting way the samples specifically come from the track is easy hills that ain't the way you make love and the way his vocals are just kind of separated throughout that track it's just refreshing however this LP is not just you know rapid-fire non-stop raps over Madlib beats there are a few tracks on here that are instrumental and believe me they are completely fine and awesome as is there's a very playful moment on here with track Bistro or MF DOOM is kind of I guess sort of inviting guests who are here for the album listening it actually kind of reminds me of something that Biggie Smalls that already done although I'm sure the reference is completely intentional and there are a few vocal guests on here as well and media appears on a track wild child takes up an entire song just on his own and Stacey Epps kind of finds herself singing in a very heavenly way through the murky darkness of Mad Libs MPC though these tracks do break away from pretty much everybody's favorite moments on this LP where MF DOOM and Madlib art doing just just awesome collaborative work together they do break up the monotony of the album they do kind of become posts of this album's progression it's like okay I'm this farm sort of gone through this phase of the album let's go into the next phase because there are quite a few tracks here 22 to be exact and it's sort of like these instrumentals and sort of extra vocal guests act as separators among all these little bits all these brief songs because even though there are 22 songs on here this album doesn't even break 50 minutes but even though the tracks on here are kind of short they're brief they hit you with a lot of lyrical ideas and references that on the surface may appear to be very disconnected this album is anything but unfocused I would actually argue instead that this album is extremely sharp creative and refreshing I think because the idea is on here are so awesome MF DOOM can present them in this kind of rapid-fire way and they still stick as we sort of distance ourselves from the release of this album more and more I feel like mad villainy proves itself to be kind of a game changer when it comes to abstract and underground hip-hop a sub-genre that's been growing and growing and growing ever since the Internet has been kind of leveling the playing field in terms of who can and cannot influence hip-hop culture will there ever be another mad villain album you know I'm not really sure and the fact that we are just only having this LP to listen to I feel like only builds up the intensity of love that people have for this album even more I'm just going to leave it at that just going to leave it at that if you haven't listened to this album do check it out Anthony Fantana mad villain forever 
U2FHlWpSZ3A,hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd this has been a long time coming I've said I would do this just before classics week classics week is coming right after this video just be patient it's coming it's coming albums are already chosen no need to make suggestions only going to review five or maybe six then we're gonna get back into the swing of things but for right now I'm doing an epically long arduous version of my least favorite segment on this show the why you know review where I talk about a lot of releases that I missed in just one gauntlet of sadness now I do want to say that there were a lot of LPS on this list that I didn't necessarily think were bad I just didn't really have either the time to review them or they weren't really I guess enticing me enough to review them or maybe at the time they weren't appealing to me all that much I'm not saying that my reasons for not reviewing these albums are necessarily well-developed informed or anything like that you know I just have my reasons and that's it and here I have almost 90 different albums that I have overlooked this past year and believe me there's a lot more where that came from so will I address every album I didn't review in this list of course not I can't you know it's it's impossible I'm one person you know but before we embark on this kaljaa chesta any words of wisdom or advice before we do this thing may God have mercy and your soul count your chest a god-fearing man royal headache self titled these guys are an Aussie garage punk band this album actually got dropped in 2011 but it came out this year kind of got reissued in the US and I just found a lot of tracks on this LP to be a little Sammy Sammy there was instrumental track on here as well that I didn't care for it all but there were some really hot fast and energetic singles with a seriously catchy power pop vibe and if you're looking for something that is speedy energetic and kind of upbeat lo-fi little grimy then definitely check this thing out Nathan fake steam days this LP was okay you know it's got an eidm kind of feel to it electronic music producer and while yeah it is a little more out there than your usual electronic music album I didn't really think the progressions and the sequencing on this LP were engaging or interesting enough for me to want to listen to it from beginning to end again and again and again birth of an icon riff raff easily one of the most entertaining pppp people in the underground rap game today and while this LP or mixtape does have some hilarious tracks on it I found a lot of the auto-tune ballads to be pretty weak on those tracks specifically I don't really see the entertainment or the comedy or the eccentricity maybe a little bit on some of the songs but to hear an auto-tuned ballad again and again and again it gets kind of old Spectre enjoy it while it lasts some very speedy I guess pretty slick indie rock with some deep and dramatic lead vocals kind of reminds me of Joy Division or Interpol for people who have happier dispositions there are some really sharp and concise singles from this thing but I found a lot of the deeper cuts to be kind of spotty to Door Cinema Club beacon while there is good production here there is performance musical performance here as well this LP definitely has those things going for it but outside of that this is just pretty much textbook blueprint indie rock without much effort toward bringing an original recipe to the table I mean yeah while I'm not looking for something to be completely unorthodox I don't even feel like these guys make an attempt toward making a record that sounds like it could be unique to any band at all much less than DMX undisputed this LP is like moldy food in the Brij I mean it's just so fuzzy and disgusting that you don't want to touch it but it's in your fridge you know you have to pick it up and remove it and throw it away I mean this LP kind of sees DMX coming back with you know a little bit more promotion behind him this time and some pretty current features on the guest list here including a Machine Gun Kelly but still this LP to me is everything that I've never liked about DMX ever but this time around much older unfocused and kind of focused grouped and they're just sounding like your average mainstream pop rap record Bob Mould Silver Age I've never really loved this guy solo stuff as much as I have his work and hüsker dü I mean that music to me is so much more energetic and edgy a lot of his solo LPS tend to be a little more poppy and this new album of his is especially slick maybe a little too slick for me personally I mean there are some moments on here that sound like they could be you know alternative rock hit singles if they had gotten radio play in the 90s or something like that I mean that's that's just my opinion on it but still it's a well produced album some catchy songs Niall at the gate of Sethu hope I'm pronouncing that correctly these guys are a death metal figurehead still making pretty worthwhile music but kind of like the band neurosis it doesn't really seem as I guess exciting or thrilling this time around though they're definitely as brutal and as technical as a lot of their past material just got feels like Niall doing Niall with some slight variations to kind of keep hardcore fans interested in what little progression they are kind of making ash borer cold of ages' atmosphere black metal that I think doesn't really make enough instrumental progressions and variations in these extremely long monolithic songs to keep them interesting and keeping them and keep them engaging for me personally but you know if you are looking for a black metal album that is more on the repetitive and Atmospheric side and I know people are then this is most definitely for you yeh Sayer fragrant world as a lot of people who have been watching the videos for a long time know I did not really care for this bands - 2010 album odd blood and this LP to me is like all the weaknesses of that album without the power of strong singles like one and ambling alp to kind of make a listen through of this LP from beginning to end at least a little interesting there's definitely some experimentation going on here these guys try to push themselves outside of their comfort zone with a bit of R&B but still that this help he just was not all that I guess mmm rewarding Meek Mill dreams and nightmares this guy is a very energetic just enthusiastic Philly MC and a major figure head in the Maybach Music Group crew at the moment and I actually found this project to be way better than his dream chasers mixtapes which kind of originally turned me off to listening to this at first and I have to say like most MMG projects the production does sound really expensive really lavish and there are spots on here like In God We Trust where meek is just going hard and there are other songs on here like traumatized that come together with a pretty good subject matter and a lot of conviction coming from his vocals there are some strong pop rap elements on this thing steaming piles of auto-tune but still I think this is the best project best solo project in MMG member drop this year Machine Gun Kelly lace up honestly I can't really take too much away from this guy because when it comes to technical rapping ability he does have a lot at his disposal I mean he can't go harder you can't go fast he can spit some tongue twisters I just think the lyrical content a lot of a lot of his songs is just kind of weak to me personally I don't really take him all that seriously I don't find a lot of depth there I don't find a lot of substance while yeah he does address some personal subjects on this LP there's nothing here in terms of charisma or conviction or really great instrumentals that even makes me interested in what personal kind of angle Machine Gun Kelly can even bring to a track there are tracks on here like wild boy that are pretty catchy and he does have some impressive and curve features on this LP but Machine Gun Kelly is just not making hip-hop music I'm interested in and then that's it lightning bolt oblivion hunter a nice collection of noise rock tracks with a strong lo-fi edge and some strong playing bass and drums fuzz down vocals and on this LP especially I think because of the sort of compilation kind of loose-fitting nature of these tracks some of the songs feel pretty jammy not so much planned out and I guess sort of meticulously crafted I mean really psychedelic chaotic so if you're looking for that in your noise rock then certainly look this up periphery I guess periphery number two this LP is basically some ultra ultra sanitary prog metal with a lot of staccato riffs genre that a lot of people label has gent and while that isn't really a huge genre for me there are quite a few bands that I find to be way less tuneful than these guys on this record I actually like the fact that these guys are pretty tuneful on this LP there's a very nice and strong element of melody throughout all the songs on this LP making them pretty catchy even though I'm not really huge into the style there are a lot of modern metal cliches on this LP and I mean stylistically when I listen to this album it sounds like I'm listening to just a blended combination of Linkin Park devin townsend and like some Meshuga two birds in row self-titled one of the many solid post hardcore bands that came out with an LP on Death Wish records this year this album just kind of blew by me because I didn't really find I guess sort of a unique angle or approach to this genre that these guys brought to the table I do think they have performance production energy on this LP I just wasn't finding I guess kind of a definition to this style of music that made me keep coming back to it I suppose but still not not a bad LP and some strong singles 2xv popular culture this LP was you know pretty much an upbeat hip hop mixtape with a lot of poppy instrumentals a very kind of energetic emcee and while it wasn't terrible I just thought it was all pretty breezy and forgettable actually like zero heroes which came out last year a lot more the new Patti Smith LP Banga I do think this album overall is is pretty artful strained it's got personality I mean Patti still kind of has it in terms of just being an out of their musical mind I just didn't really think this album was all that thrilling vocally and a lot of the songs didn't really have the the momentum that I was looking for I mean you know kind of kind of a trudge for me through this entire LP the new Walkman LP Heaven tons of people were asking me to review this I either just didn't get around to it or it just wasn't passionate enough about doing a review of it to the point where you know I just thought I'd be interested in doing and you know the Walkman are a band that I like a lot of releases from but I was pretty disappointed with their LP Lisbon that they dropped a little while back and I did get this out in the listen I do like it more than Lisbon but stylistically conceptually there's not that much to report I mean it's a Walkman album it sounds like a Walkman album it's like modern current indie rock music but for people with sweet old souls the band still sounds really slick they're still writing some pretty good songs just maybe they're their next LP LP more interested in I guess cat power son I kind of glossed over this one though still a Chan miss Marshall did certainly get back to writing some sadder and slightly darker songs I just wasn't all that huge on the production on this LP there were some songs on here that took a slightly Dancer vibe in my opinion especially the opening track which does have a pretty apparent dance beat behind it once the groove really kind of kicks in I thought overall the instrumentation on this LP though the songs were pretty good made me feel like I was listening to a singer-songwriter record from the 90s but not like you know a cat power record from the 90s more like a chart-topping you know sort of singer-songwriter record from the 90s that I would hear on the radio just not a favorite of mine for this year Mahna Mahna mom's uh you know I hadn't reviewed this band's album Minds either and I just keep going back and listening to their stuff every time they put out a new be and I I really cannot explain it this band does not engage me and and I don't even know why I do acknowledge that musically they are more interesting and a little bit more adventurous than than your average rock or pop indie band but there's just not a lot about their songs that just kind of hook me in and then I don't think it's for lack of ideas or just really boring songwriting it's just something I can't explain and I'm gonna have to leave it at that hopefully their next LP clicks with me or I actually kind of come to the realization as to why their music doesn't ever really appeal to me that much though it's it's clearly sort of you know in a style that I am familiar with and do enjoy Kreayshawn something about cray um yeah yeah shout out to speak you're the man Big Sean Detroit I skipped this thing like I was playing hopscotch a Big Sean in in no way whatsoever interests me I mean I think lyrically he's usually very corny and and picks and/or writes just some really terrible terrible punchlines I mean I can barely stand to hear him on other people's tracks and you know I think he either writes or sort of takes on really weak hooks as well and picks some pretty boring instrumentals I do hope that his music in the future appeals to me more than what I've been hearing from his mixtapes and is full-length debut LP but you know honestly I'm not sure if that's ever going to happen black puss-puss mordom Bryan Chippendale from lightning bolt solo LP if you haven't heard of this it's up on Bandcamp it's extremely noisy hectic chaotic heavy lots of distortion it's pretty decent though I personally found a lot of these songs to be a little too repetitive could have used more I guess progression more detail to kind of keep them you know sort of interesting but to me a lot of these tracks kind of feel like a lightning bolt song but instead of the bass guitar you're just hearing maybe a very distorted sin or just some kind of distorted tone every time speed of life this is a duo a project consisting of members of A Tribe Called Quest and black sheep you know to Seminole old-school hip-hop groups and this is pretty much just like a modernized take on the boom bap style that Native Tongues hip hop style that was so awesome back in the day it's certainly likable but a little old hat and and that's all I have to say if you're into this style you're looking for a hip hop album that goes down that road or if this somehow flew by you despite the fact that you like these two groups then definitely look it up the o'seas Putra fires - this is a garage and psych band that whose last few releases have really really let me down ever since I got into them with the album masters bedroom and the reason a lot of their LPS have let me down is because I think the production for the most part is very very lackluster I mean more noise and reverb than actual songs or anything like that and you know while I do like noise just this really thin brittle bouncy kind of Garage psych music just does not appeal to me whatsoever so I did kind of let this LP slide by me because of just all the disappointments that have come with their previous material but I was actually shocked when I listened to this album and found that whoa I can hear instrumentation on this thing there's clarity here I hear like horns I actually think overall this is their best LP since masters bedroom I'm hearing actual focused concentrated tunes on this thing I feel like there are some bands that like the fall can really kind of take a riff or take an idea and kind of blam it out as a group and sort of jam on it I just don't think the OCS are one of those groups or at least they have been able to make that translate all that well on record maybe they're fantastic doing that live I don't know but still actually will say again this LP I do think is their best since masters bedroom kissee Bashi 151 a some really string heavy art pop I believe this guy has actually worked with of Montreal a little bit with bringing some of that string work into their albums not a bad P some really strong pop tunes with a sort of strange creative edge though I do think there are a lot of moments for the back end of this LP where I'm hearing songs that do feel pretty influenced by sort of more contemporary indie artists like Sufjan Stevens for example which isn't a bad thing but you know I just kind of feel like the LP lost its flavor a little bit as I traveled through it toward the end though still start very strong over childhoods end this LP was actually kind of a surprise from these guys though I guess it should be no surprise that they kind of made another surprise I mean there's Geiger fuse is full of sort of weird turns and this LP pretty much brings a bunch of covers of psychedelic rock and pop songs and while I do think Oliver does a great job of recreating this musical landscape instrumentally I'm not exactly sure if vocally these songs are recreated all that well there are some good covers though there are some good covers and good song choices again I just think the vocals don't really you know bring the magic in the same way the instrumentation does chariot one-winged this is certainly a more experimental album for this metalcore band you know you're some weird interludes and in vocal pieces kind of interrupting the songs on this album bring some variety and and bring an element of oh I don't know a metalcore mathcore album would do something like that but still even though that does give this album some creative and crossover appeal because you know people will sort of see it at least in a slight way to be kind of outside of the box as far as these genres go and experimenting with them then go I don't really think this album is all that I mean the riffs are just kind of okay I think there are a lot more worthwhile metalcore bands that are doing much weirder things not even with their newest album but with their past albums for example converge or maybe even a post hardcore band like Drive Like Jehu something like that again a slightly more creative endeavor for these guys but really not a huge appeal to me the sludge slash doom slash psych band hufo mehmet i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly probably not they dropped two full-length albums this year both which had oro in the title and then colon and then kind of the other part of the title and these two LPs were just kind of night and day to me in terms of quality the LP opus overhauled was was actually not too bad it had a lot of clarity in the recording the bass lines were really heavy it actually had some nice grooves to it some momentum though it did get a little repetitive it wasn't a bad listen but the other LP these guys release was much noisier and not in a good way like a subpar recording kind of noise Ian and much muddier if you're looking for something heavy something that jams on for a long time something has a slightly psychedelic edge to it then definitely look these LPS up catatonia dead-end Kings I don't think I need to tell you or anybody else who has heard of this band how much their early records have contributed to the world of Death Metal however I'm not really feeling much of their new material at all and this new LP of theirs is one of the most sanitary that they've ever produced while a lot of people like these cleaner more friendly more to sort of pristine sounds entering modern metal music I mean I just think they're okay I mean they certainly can be executed well but in this case it just feels a little too I guess feathery for me I just prefer their early stuff and I think that's just how it is that's how it's going to be that's it Ben Folds Five they're back the sound of the life of the mind and they're still kind of bringing that same Ben full can of i'b though with a lot less I guess sort of snark and personality and an energy than their earlier stuff like what ever and ever amen I mean there are some cool tunes on here it's just not really all that riveting of a comeback break pot by your side some poppy dancey new disco stuff from France there are some really good instrumentals on here some really good beats as well I mean I do feel like break button does a fantastic job of recreating this genre of music groove wise I just think a lot of the tunes on here as far as the deeper cuts go Singles are tight Singles are tight on this thing but as far as the deeper cuts go it can get a little spotty and the vocals are a little as well but if you're looking for something Dancy then check this thing out there's some great bass lines too fresh and onlys long slow dance I mean originally these guys were a psychedelic slash garage rock band that didn't really have that much personality but on this new LP they've transitioned into like a jangle rock band that does not have that much personality the music tapes Mary's voice this is some very instrumentally vibrant vaudevillian lo-fi indie rock and pop from Neutral Milk Hotel Julianne Koster and there's some really awesome orchestrations on here some fun songs a lot of character I just wasn't really huge on the vocals and the singing it's a pretty decent album if you're looking for something fun bubbly and just like I said somewhat circus like teen girl fantasy tracer a lot of kind of repetitive atmosphere somewhat fruity deep house tracks that didn't really have many interesting sequences coming from the beats I mean the tracks the instrumentals they're just okay and you know maybe I would have reviewed if there weren't so many vocal guests on this album that I feel like actually made this LP weaker I mean none of the vocal contributions on this album in my opinion specifically from even panda bear don't really bring all that much to the beats that these guys pull together he's on air Meeta I'm probably pronouncing neither of those correctly this guy is a black metal and death metal figurehead this is his latest full-length solo LP and while I'm not usually into prog metal this clean I did find this LP to be extremely likable I found the vocals to be great the production was definitely there the performance was definitely there are some great guitar playing with albums like this I definitely feel like I can much easier enjoy a lot of these more clean modern metal sounds I mean when this guy does drop a new LP I hope to review his next project and hopefully give you know his music the enjoyment and the attack and that it deserves verbs herbs senator centers and john cale shifty adventures in nokia which is a hilarious album title of course this guy is from The Velvet Underground fantastic producer as well this is an art pop record with some pretty catchy songs but a very strong underlying element of strangeness and if you are a hardcore Velvet Underground fan then you should give this a listen though I will say that the vocals are just alright Meridian Brothers des Esperanza after a few lead tracks coming off of this LP specifically a single that I throw on my loved list on the needle drop calm I was psyched to give this thing a listen but when I finally heard the entire LP I actually found the entire album to be really unlistenable and the one song that I love to be the only great song out of the bunch I mean a lot of the tracks on here it's just very repetitive one note one dimensional and pretty shallow land flavored organ pop but I wouldn't even really say it's pop since all the hooks are pretty weak and it's just also ad nauseam leave annoying and there's a lot of weird sort of very kitschy effects thrown on everything making it kind of sound like I'm listening to a bad alien movie soundtrack from the 50s or something like that it's just not all that great of a listen miss cherry and the thing came together on this new album and did a bunch of jazz and and soul flavored covers of songs from across the musical spectrum music from Ornette Coleman MF DOOM as well as the Stooges and you know while I have loved quite a few albums this year that took a jazz kind of performance and improvisation angle and applied it to other forms of music I actually found the tracks on this LP to be extremely extremely obnoxious I do not know how I guess sort of people involved in making this album actually thought that these versions of the songs actually made these original Tunes more interesting or at least interesting in a different light I found a lot of the vocals to be pretty just boring or annoying on this LP just I guess sort of over acted and campy while the horns and sort of orchestrations we're just okay I mean I know that's a little brutal it's a little kind of nasty but I mean that's really how I felt this LP really really got on my nerves but you know if you're not pissing somebody off then you must be doing something wrong the new ceremony LP zoo didn't really translate all that well for a lot of people because of the stylistic shift that these guys made on this LP it wasn't even that great of a shift though I mean these guys are usually a sort of hardcore punk band with a lot of energy where the tone things down a little bit just kind of went for a more straightforward Punk vibe it's a decent collection of songs just not all that full of momentum for me I actually feel like a lot of the tunes on here pretty catchy if they just had a little bit more ferocity to them in terms of just hearing the band play together Freddie Gibbs Baby Face Killa again and again and again I keep trying to get into this guy because people sing this guy's praises and I just can't do it not that I feel like his flows are bad or his subject matter is lacking or his lyricism just isn't there I don't really think he's a shallower dumbed-down emcee or anything like that I just find the the sound of his voice and just the things that he raps about to be just a little redundant I mean from one track to another I feel like the only things that really change all that much on a Freddie Gibbs album are the instrumentals I mean if it wasn't for the instrumentals on a lot of his mixtapes then you know it wouldn't really be all that interesting to listen through an entire Freddie Gibbs project and I and I felt that way about this mixtape two tracks man the mind of tracks man this is a really awesome kind of you know roots representation blueprint depiction of this emerging style of electronic music footwork yeah it's been around a while you know and it's influences have been around a while too but this is a growing genre in terms of popularity maybe didn't blow up as much as I thought it may make possibly could have in this year but if you're looking to get into this style of music this album is a great representation of it a great representation of the variety that the genre could bring as well there are very hard speedy jittery tracks on here as well as more spacious tunes as well pulled together by this guy and while it is all pretty rough around the edges lewd and nasty it is a pretty fun experience blood house Nord seven seven seven I mean pretty much all the LPS that these guys have been dropping in this seven seven seven series I haven't really done it for me I mean a lot of people love their black metal sort of fused with industrial for a more sort of mechanical and Atmospheric sound and while I do think on paper that sounds like a great idea I guess I wasn't really in love with the execution of that on on this album or any of the album's that they've been kind of doing in this style and that's it you know just not for me blame lies here whatever I'm not cracking bagi des hommes this is a really hard heavy fast extreme metal and you know not a bad listen I just wasn't all that huge with a lot of the melodic courses I just found them funnily enough to be just maybe a little too over the top for for this band you know while some melody definitely would bring some flavor to music like this I just kind of felt like it was it was a bit of a clash with the very grimy dirty and in fast and busy and technical nature of the drums and the guitars on this thing does arrhythmia dysrhythmia test of submission a Colin Marston project very technical very progressive lots of riffs I just wasn't all that into much of any of the riffs or how they kind of you know segwayed into one another on this album it just kind of felt like one big bowl of riff soup but without much flavoring or seasoning behold the arc to post horror section another Colin Marston project with all the other projects he's involved with and all the great albums that he produces I actually was afraid that I would never hear another album from from this band even though sort of for a while behold the octopus was my favorite band that he was in now it kind of become Crowley's and with this LP I mean it's just not that much to report it is behold the arcticus as you remember them that very technical busy and sort of dizzying angle that they always bring to their compositions but it just wasn't that interesting of a listen because they didn't really try to push their boundaries or experiment outside of what they've already done on their previous LP all that much which I do I do like that LP quite a bit skull grid rock marciana reloaded while I do think this New York emcee has some great lyrics and I love hearing them on other people's stuff I mean I feel like he is like the ultimate feature emcee because of just how quiet and different his voice usually sounds I mean he usually comes across as very kind of understated and that's what makes me just sort of stop and listen to him and everything that he's saying whenever he sort of hops onto a track with another emcee I enjoy but by himself one track after another he gets really really one-dimensional and very underwhelming I have heard some people praise the very quiet and minimal approach of this album and I do feel like that does make this LP unique it doesn't necessarily make it a weak album it just doesn't make it a very appealing album for me personally and that's all the new - the bare LP infinity overhead I've never ever been in - the bear fan this LP is not changing that because for one album after another - me - the bear just puts out very soulless indie rock and that's it you know that a brutal I know but that's just how I'm going to leave it - fingers Stud rhythms this is a little duo involving amon tobin where instead of throwing together some very deep somewhat experimental or sort of strange atmospheric electronic music tracks he can produce some fun bouncy bubbly bangers and there are a lot of tracks on here that that are actually pretty fun and do get me tube on my head it is kind of shallow and some limited stylistically but but still backers Circa Survive violent wave again another and I've never really been a fan of while they are a post-hardcore group and I love a lot of bands in that genre there's just a really weak alternative rock kind of flavor to this music as well it's just - I guess it you know I don't want to say whiney but I mean I find this bands music to be very wimpy and not in a very admirable way either I'm kind of like a would-be slacker indie rock band from the 90s but I mean it's just - again feathery clean poppy it's just not for me father John misty if you're fun while I didn't really like this album overall I mean not not to say that I didn't really feel like it had that big of an impact as an album for me because of how much of a mixed bag the songs are but still a lot of great songs on this album a Jay Tillman X member of Fleet Foxes does write some really great tracks on here and I think the only thing better about his songwriting is just his wit I do think this guy's hilarious especially on tracks like I'm writing a novel it's a very good album I should have reviewed it it's enjoyable give it a listen father John misty fear of fun slightly stupid top of the world American reggae man American reggae mono for my parents there's nothing really to report it sounds like a mono album I mean you know it's actually kind of boring in comparison to their last LP which had those huge orchestral additions to the music but this was just you know just okay and that's it brother Olly morning in America while I do feel like this kind of concept album does have a great subject matter I just wasn't all that enthralled with I guess or the delivery or execution of this album I do acknowledge that brother Ali has something to say the thing is the instrumentals are just okay and I don't really feel like there's anything on this LP that that brings that social urgency that's necessary for a lot of the topics that brother Howie tries to attack on this album a place to bury strangers worship definitely not a bad shoegaze album while these guys did do a good job in backing off the compression a little bit there last LP exploding head did feel like my head was exploding as I was listening to it I mean really an overbearing listen this was much easier to listen to a lot less taxing I just feel like the songs you were maybe slightly less catchy the hooks weren't as beefy as they were on the last LP but still enjoyable listened and the babies are house on the hill some garage rocks some lo-fi indie rock on hear from members of Vivian girls and woods not a bad LP I actually think a bit more cohesive and a little more well written in their last album I'm looking to see what these guys do in the future you know I'll see if they impressed me with a full-length next after this one coheed and cambria the after man ascension for a while these guys were really like a rising star in alternative rock but honestly honestly I found some tracks on this LP to be like vomit-inducing like the track good night fair lady I mean that track is one harmonica away from being a Blues Traveler song I mean there are some tracks on here that are heavier a little bit more catchy I mean to me there's definitely some sort of I guess concept being implied by the titles of these tracks but still the songs on here I did like I just kind of found to be somewhat of a variation on track like Mars Volta would make or like at the drive-in and and I would much rather listen to those bands The Killers battleborn while I do think Brandon Flowers is one of the most passionate and just the I guess captivating front men in mainstream rock music this to me was just a little too slick even for the killers I mean it actually kind of felt like at some moments I was listening to solo LP from Brandon as opposed to you know a new killers album there are some songs on here that are okay but overall it's just pretty MIT Vinnie pants got of the Serengeti I mean more Jedi mind-trick from the man himself box-cutter Paz II and it's just pretty much boom-bap flavored East Coast tough-guy rap which isn't necessarily a bad thing but a lot of vinius flows on this on album get pretty weak and redundant and that's it ahman raw mass V these guys are sludge metal slash post-hardcore band whose new LP I found to be actually pretty one-dimensional just very slow very heavy not very eventful at all or full of interesting sounds either and then the vocals are pretty you know one note too I actually felt that their previous LPS had much more variety on them too and had some faster tracks to kind of break up the slower tracks while I do admire the ambition of this band to be writing you know several long-form songs and kind of make it this monolithic album it as a whole experience just you know was pretty underwhelming ty Segall hair I mean this album the solo album was just not as interesting or eventful as the other two LPS he dropped this year and and that's it you know I had already kind of talked about him and there were other artists that I wanted to talk about this year that's kind of why I didn't review this thing trash talk 1:19 these guys are a West Coast hardcore punk band and you know a little bit of power violence in there too and while these guys run pretty much all their releases have a lot of ferocity I mean songwriting not as much you know and that's what's really kind of kept me always from being a trash talk fan Neil Young and Crazy Horse psychedelic pill um this LP did not appeal to me at all I mean you know there are some pretty long songs on this album and that's not necessarily a bad thing it's what these guys do across these long songs and that's just jam very very weakly and uninterestingly I mean really all you could do to these guitar jams is just kind of drift off into space and while I'm sure some people do enjoy doing that to this LP I just don't find the guitar solos on this album to be interesting at all I mean they're all pretty mid-paced you know uninspired and just kind of boring I mean this entire album in general is like taking a road trip and just a broken-down station wagon where the floor covers you know smell like pee and the I guess seat covers smell like weed and the Dec is broken and the second track on here - I mean it's like there's just one giant phaser effect on the entire track sounds awful now the other long tracks on here aside from the opening song which is the longest on this entire LP they're not that fantastic either I mean it's just one big long uneventful Jam and the shorter songs on here aren't bad they're just you know a little ill-conceived as well I feel like it's easy to praise this LP because of Neely owner status but I enjoyed the sort of Americana folk album that he came out with earlier this year Bob Dylan tempest this LP did not appeal to me either I mean they're just some chord progressions and then songs on this LP that feel very very schmaltzy and I don't think I need to tell you that Bob Dylan's voice is not really what it used to be I mean the man is an American treasure but mostly because of the music he had made at one time not because of the music he's making right now I didn't really think this album was terrible certainly you know enjoyable for hardcore fans but you know me I enjoy you know more golden period Dylan and that's a Gary Clark jr. black and blue uh to be straightforward about it this is a rock album that doesn't Rock and that's it y mumps etc um a lot of Queen in the instrumentation with some hip hop elements just not not for me at all the new Seoul Jazz Orchestra LP I mean I feel like at one time these guys were I kind of really refreshing revivalist group when it came to afro beat sounds and Latin music - I mean they grabbed a lot of music from a lot of different cultures and and just played it very vibrantly and with a lot of energy but with this new LP they actually kind of embraced somewhat of an old-school recording aesthetic making everything sound much older than it actually is and it's you know pretty pretty scary accurate to the times that a lot of this music comes from but now because of that I feel like these guys just kind of sound like a nostalgia trip as opposed to you know something refreshing and you know that's kind of a vampa this whole thing now I just kind of feel like they're they're muddled a little bit too much on this LP in in nostalgia and a lot of the reggae tracks because they do kind of go down a reggae road on this LP ansan some songs to you know throw a new kind of genre into their repertoire the reggae tracks to me are just kind of weak the new flume self-titled album I mean some interesting electronics and beat music on here this young Australian producer certainly does have producing chops and is listening to a lot of different stuff but to me overall the album lacks stylistic flavor um you know while again I do say the chops are there I'll just listen in for whatever this guy does after this and you know just hope that that is a bit more distinct UV race racism I reviewed this band's last album on the channel liked it Roger rock band from Australia nothing really much to report just a UV race album that sounds like a UV race album although the recording isn't as great in my opinion Larry love Steen Stein and the Velvet revival jazz a kind of a pseudonym for Mac Miller of all people actually kind of singing over a lot of very synthesized pop jazz instrumentals um yuck The Darkness hotcakes you know fun catchy kitschy for a little while but as an album as an overall experience it gets you know kind of old a lot like foxy Shazam I do feel like these guys are you know kind of all the glam and all the energy of a band like Queen but but none of the awesome playing or creative songwriting the new diamond rings LP free dimensional I just found this guy's last full-length LP his debut to be a lot more interesting and just sort of down-to-earth this new album is way more slick it's a bit more basic structurally - it's not bad you know a little bit more pumped up to me a bit like the Twin Shadow album that that recently came out you do kind of get this you know sort of somewhat I guess humble album to start and then the next album is kind of you know a little built up and it just you know doesn't feel as magical I guess this time around but still not a bad listen some good papi tracks on there Suzanne son for Silicon Vale somewhat of an art pop album do check this out she has a great voice some interesting songs the title track of the selfie is especially awesome there are just some spots in the production when electronics kind of come into play where things get very very kind of weak questionable not that interesting Sean price Mike Tyson a lot of tough guy raps not a lot of clever lyricism just kind of a lot of blood brutality and and underneath that some very very low fighting badly sort of produced instrumentals I mean not that there's not a flavor to them it's just that everything feels pretty I guess kind of tinny grainy and not in a hard kind of gritty Street sort of way just like you know this could have been better kind of way marker and bow maker trans sectoral - pretty awesome electronic music producers coming together for this collaboration the LP is decent it's kind of a mixed bag there are some great techno tracks on here I do feel like these guys kind of stretch themselves out stylistically a little bit pushing themselves into electronic music genres that may not necessarily be their strengths which not only makes this LP kind of disjointed but you know there are tracks on here that are kind of inconsistent in terms of quality you know just not as awesome as other tracks where these guys find themselves a little bit more comfortable I guess Flatbush zombies drugs a lot of people have asked me to review this tape and while there are some pretty good instrumentals on this thing and these guys do have some eccentric personality you know especially coming from their vocals I just found a lot of the lyrics on this thing to be pretty underwhelming boring very cheap punchlines that aren't really all that clever or interesting at all hopefully the next projects that these guys drop are a bit more enthralling I guess guided by voices bears for lunch I didn't really like the last two full-length LPS that these guys came together with but I actually kind of found some very catchy tracks on this new album maybe this album is a little more accessible than the last two that they made but any changes that this LP brings are to such a slight degree it's not really you know nine-day or anything like that it's just another album from guided by voices in this kind of certain part in their career and that's it man with the iron fist soundtrack I don't really have anything to say about this because I don't really like reviewing soundtracks but there are two kinds of soundtracks there's one kind of soundtrack that has a lot of original music maybe sort of instrumental orchestral that is meant to speak set to the film and it really only finds its true power when you're listening to it in that context the other kind of soundtrack is where you're getting a lot of popular artists coming together and it kind of creates an awesome compilation of songs this album is more going down that road it is an awesome compilation of songs and that's all I can really say about it Soundgarden King animal while these guys did come out with some epic and awesome hardrock LPS in the 90s this new LP just has like no teeth whatsoever I mean it's just pretty much a textbook underwhelming return to putting out studio material it's not as bad as you would expect from a mainstream rock band hasn't dropped a new LP in over a decade but still you know just just not anywhere near a favorite of mine for this year Poppa Gandhi failed States I mean this to me is just a - melodic hardcore album it's propoganda to me just way too slick and groomed I'm much more of a fan of their kind of dirtier rougher pop punk stuff Carter - devoid transverse this is actually an LP I bought earlier this year and I have been enjoying on and off throughout the year it's pretty much a noise album from you know members of cheese throbbing gristle I'm getting really tired at this point can you tell throbbing gristle factory floor on strange sounds noise eNOS very dark somewhat danceable beats and it's it's an interesting experience and that's all I'm going to say about it the new RAM LP quarter-turn but the simile awesomely produced dark ambient music I mean great sounds on this thing just some really short underwhelming and kind of uninspired song structures I wish this entire LP all of its tracks were way more well developed developed at all past the first five or four minutes that they last the lengths of these songs and just the directions of these tracks are not as ambitious as the sounds that these guys bring to the table Gazza no absolutes in human suffering um you know a core core core core core album noise core grind core metal core math core a lot of heavy riffs on this thing very abrasive vocals it's a hard ass frickin album it's just a little OneNote though I mean just not I guess what I'm trying to say is well I love aggression I guess uh I would have liked a little bit more flavor outside of that but so if you're looking for something heavy looking for something fast give us a listen and finally the new Shackleton project music for the quiet hour um I didn't review this because I didn't have not even gotten a chance to listen to this thing all the way through which I actually do want to do because of how strange and sort of experimental and surprising it is um I hope to be able to do that sometime soon that's it that's it god this depressed me this is depressing alright I'm gonna go be depressed somewhere all right that's all I'm gonna do so I'm gonna go be depressed somewhere alright thanks for watching 
ARInCuMQXaI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and doing a video that I promised would come after I finished my vinyl videos I finished them six ility sixteen video you know I personally I have to get caught up because I think I left off at number eleven or something like that took me 16 took you 16 well I'm proud of you but without the 7 inches I don't even touch the seven inches yet oh so yeah make sure you do that sorry excuse me a video that I promise will be coming where I just sort of talk about with my good friend Derek here about some audio equipment whether it be amplifiers some headphones or turntables styluses and cartridges speaker wire things like that basically you know what to look for what brands to look out for as well as maybe even kind of doing this whole thing on a budget Derek is the biggest audiophile I know and you know someone who if I hadn't met I wouldn't you know maybe even be into the music that I'm into and and most definitely would not have the the speaker setup that I do because much of it came as a recommendation from him so you know a lot of people after my headphone video have been asking tons of questions on headphones and that's and that seriously in an age of where music is is very portable a very important piece of audio equipment so you know out of all the pieces of audio equipment that we will talk about in this video I think we'll definitely start there I mean Derek what do you recommend in terms of headphones what to look for and you know what to avoid first of all there's a lot of you know there's a lot of debate or not defeat but there's two sides of the headphone do you want your side do you want sound like isolation or do you want you know just a studio quality headphones what I would recommend is to avoid is first off avoid your you know anything in the 300 to $500 range that really is hype and yes I'm talking about the beats by dre you know very inexpensive material you can buy comparable headphones for much less as far as quality goes but also you know audiophile has a kind of label to it that you're spending way way more money in general than you need to it's kind of a half-truth people with a lot of money tend to spend a lot of money on anything but with you can be an audio file and not spend a lot of money on things a big headphone model that I'm a fan of and that is well under $150 now is the AKG K 2 40s they are the very much been the standard studio quality headphone for four years I mean my parasol over 30 years old it's actually survived a flood to there was a flood in my basement about I think 15 years ago and it was funny because I remember leaving the the headphones just lying on the floor of the basement and it you know thought an inch of water came down and then they survived I died I took them out left them out to dry the next day and they survived but the thing is a ok AKG makes kind of a rule of thumb gold standard audio production brand of headphone that is around $100 so two Sennheiser and so does Sony you know you know and they're comparable they're comparable brands so I mean if you run into those models as well or those models have either the noise cancellation you're looking for or just the fit and the comfort that you're looking for as opposed to the AKG you could go for that too because a lot of people have asked me and I said to you before the video like I'm not enjoying music properly unless I'm paying X amount of dollars for music you know whereas that's not necessarily the case I mean you know you don't need to spend a thousand dollars on a pair of headphones to hear the power and you know the the detail in a song by gap of by Godspeed you black Emperor you know you don't need to spend a thousand dollars on a pair of headphones to hear how heavy son is cops you know you don't need to spend a thousand dollars on a pair of headphones to you know hear the solos note-for-note in a jazz record you know from the 50s or 60s or you know hear the raw energy in a punk record you're going to have to figure out what you want for a fit and for sound because we can talk about sound and quality what it means to us but at the end of the day the golden rule of being an audiophile is your system your setup only has to sound good to you doesn't have to sound good to anybody else but you pretty much um yeah I mean Derek when I knew him at first came over to his place and was listening to records he always had those EKGs but then later I got introduced to them working in radio stations and you know working with Sony's as well and Sennheiser's and out of trying those three I mean the AKG they're just the ones that had the best fit to me and the most clarity and I just ended up sticking with them and you know you know just figure you know it wasn't surprised as to why you had you had been with them that whole time um okay so moving on another thing that people ask about all the time there's more and more and more and it seems like there are tons of models of these coming out every year that our us be ready or supposed to be you know taking your records and then transferring straight to digital as soon as you put them on the platter record players people I see we've got record players all the nine record players what brands are great what should you look for why should you avoid okay this is more of a cost related product as a record it is record players you definitely want to avoid anything under a hundred dollars period it's not going to be a good record player you to really get you know a decent record player that has key features you need which includes an adjustable car weight so you can adjust the weight of the tonearm removable head shell and cartridge so you can change the needle easily and use a higher quality needle that what comes with it um and also a variable pitch adjustment you know to adjust for variations in pitch that may occur over time or you know or a compensate for malfunction for a occasional malfunction of the record player and then also the weight of the platter is very important to the way to the platter basically stabilizes the speed arm so it doesn't fluctuate as much and that's referred to in electronics terminology as wild flutter my favorite turntable right now that's out that's USB capable is the Stanton t92 USB it's $240 turntable comes with a stellar and two entry-level DJ cartridge um a lot of a lot of audio files which will say well this is a DJ turntable it has a DJ cartridge well it's good for starting out and DJ cartridges nowadays are designed for minimal record wear so you can definitely start out with that and move to an audiophile cartridge because it has a standard s-shaped tone arm with a standard cartridge mount so that means you can you can upgrade your cartridge later and you have the adjustable counterweight to do that it also has three modes of output has USB it has traditional phone a level which goes to the RCA plugs that you may be used to on an older CD player but the sound level is much lower than what you would get out of a CD player so it has your traditional phone a level and it has a built-in phono preamp which allows you to bring it up to the level as the same level as what you would hear out of a CD player or an older tape deck that is is a USB turntable that I can definitely get behind another model that I'm particularly fond of is the audio technica ATL 120 USB that's a great turntable it's it's modeled exactly off of the SL technics SL 1200 series which is now no longer in production and of course when that happened the value of that turntable doubled but that that particular turntable adds three speeds which is important to me because I collect so many eight records from from the post-war 28 is 20 1920s in the 50s but but it they basically took the they took the technics model and then they stripped it down with a little bit cheaper parts but it still got a great stellar sound however in my experience I will warn you um do not take out that stock cartridge in the atll 120 or it's going to have a slightly different sound it's going to be a limited sound which is why the slight edge goes to the stand t92 because it does everything that the audio technica does it doesn't come with a dust cover but you get a much clearer sound out of any cartridge you put into it alright and um you know where would people shop for an item not an item like this necessarily I mean is there an online place that you would suggest you know our pawn store pawn stars even try pawn stores you know or pawn shops even trustworthy you know for an item like this well pawn shop would be good as long as you know that they allow you to test it out there make sure that the that the platter spins at this steady rate that there's no damage to the tourm that it moves freely um and of course that if if you don't plan on purchasing a cartridge and needle separately um that you know that the needle is intact as for online retailers um you can go for the Staunton it's very widely available I bought mine in person at Guitar Center and that the that was a excellent purchase because it was open box and I got a deal on it but you can also try needle doctor.com they have a lot of high-end stuff they also have a lot of mid-range stuff too if you're looking for that for the Staunton also um you can go to you can buy that pro audio because that's one of the things that's studio quality but also marketed towards the DJ market so you could also pick that up at a pro sound PSL comm they're an excellent retailer I like I like to get all my crossover studio pro gear from if you can't find something at a pawn shop you may have to go online around the early 2000s and mid 2000s it was a bit easier to get a hold of a good good turntable at like a music shop like Guitar Center because DJ culture was on the rise and you know people were using that equipment to DJ and they were selling that equipment and you know they were making sales on it but the thing is DJ cultures is assimilating to the digital age you know and you're seeing iPad DJs and iPod DJs and just mp3 DJ's CDJs and so it may be harder at a smaller music store to get a hold of a really good turntable unless you see a bigger music sort of bigger music specialty store then you may be able to get one there but if you can't find one at a pawn shop just like you said hit up those websites try to look for a turntable there now if if someone is has gone one of these turntables and they're with the cartridge that comes with it and they want to step up a little bit with the stylish of the cartridge what brands would you recommend beyond what you know kind of just comes with the the record player sure that's SH you are e they're more famous right now for the microphones but they have a mainstay cartridge a DJ cartridge the N four four seven that comes with a very durable stylus with very minimal record wear on that's been around for a while they also have a studio audiophile line there M 97x e is a very excellent cartridge a very you know very excellent pro level of stylus at a very very approachable price or a very acceptable price Grotto is you know you're getting up there when you get to grotto and order Fon a very high-end a stuff at that time at that price range but it's very very high quality very respectable an audiophile circle circles but if you want the best bang for your buck stick with the Shore m9 and XE and you know one more thing before we move away from the record players I'm sure people are going to be running across record players of both kinds especially if they're looking for older and more used models P mount versus you know just just a regular mount does it even matter for people are straight are more in in shaped arm um the the S shaped arm is going to be more common when you get two turntables that were made in the 80s um I would avoid most P mounts that you would see in the 80s just because that implied that it was a lesser quality turntable back then and you know it's likely that it's the same now um brands that I would recommend as far as use turntables go technics any of the technics line from the 70's and 80's if you see that it's pretty good even the P mount stuff is good for an entry-level when you're when you're with the technics because they rule the roost back then um also when you're getting older like seventh and into the 70s or Thorens if you want to go eBay it's going to be unlikely you're going to find a Thorens or a dual in the you know in goodwill these days because most of them have been scooped up but if you have a little bit more money and want to get a little bit more higher-end for the old stuff definitely go to ebay and get a Fornes or dual um but stuff that you're going to want to be looking for when you're out at tag sales and goodwill I'd say technics all the way I'm also pioneer you know pioneer has been around for a while and they made some excellent turntables all right moving on past the turntables if you think we've covered this base enough if you're going to get a turntable then it's not you know a USB turntable or something like that you're going to most definitely need an amplifier yeah you know so I mean with with amps hi-fi amps what to look for you know what to avoid what brands are great and you know how much are you going to pay for you know to get that certain level of quality that you're looking for amp is probably the most important piece of puzzle normally it'd be speakers but we are talking about you know more of a headphone setup which actually lowers the price of what you could what you would need to pay for an amplifier and it also bumps up the level of importance of your amplifier personally it depends on your price range you know that's what I would say if you're a little strapped for cash you can hit up your goodwill tag sales for used gear one thing you would definitely want to avoid is the old combo record changers in amplifiers from the 70s they were not kind to the records they don't have adjustable counter weights and most of the you know most options with that and also the most of the tuners and and receivers that are built in underneath the turntables are in bad shape you want to mainly look for standalone units highest highest end but what are probably going to be hardest to find Marantz Sansui to a lesser extent pioneer but but older Yamahas are pretty good too and also another one hard to find but a good brand if you can find it Eldar Onkyo receivers and integrated amplifiers all these brands are making newer amps as well or is their newer one that you would recommend some of some of them and some of them have switched their quality levels to UM two mainstays that are still popular today and actually make very good hi-5 stuff still it's on Keo and Rance um that you can pick that up even at PC Richard's kind of thing you know because they're prop popular outlet now but also for higher-end if you want to go new um you can go Music Hall is a very high-end brand Teac has been making a high-end small integrated amplifiers for a while for a few years now and some of them have USB connectivity which is nice because you don't have to you can all it the digital converter in the Teac is going to be a lot better than what you're going to find on the you know the onboard sound card on your computer um so I mean what would you say in amp like an entry-level amplifier I would run you you know if you if you were looking to get one of these brands something that's going to you know give you a little bit of bass and your speakers and you know just a heavy sound a nice full sound I would say about three to five hundred dollars isn't acceptable about to spend on new equipment I would definitely avoid surround sound of course not unless you plan on actually using it for surround sound I don't I don't feel that the surround sound receivers handle high five very well they seem to be even though the work with your set up work with your computer and everything else very well um as far as features go as far as the sound goes it's really tailored for the home theater market and you could spend the same amount of money and get a high five unit that was specifically designed for that purpose and it will sound a lot much better alright um let's go to speaker wire since that's going to be bringing everything together very much I mean you know I you know one of the easier and things to come by and one of the cheaper parts of the puzzle but something that you know you need to look into a little bit you know if you want the everything actually sound good yeah you know because everything can sound pretty thin and cheap if you're not getting the exact right thing yeah the only thing you need to worry about speaker wire is gauge need to make sure you have a thick enough gauge for the amount of power you're running as far as brands of speaker wire um you know monster cable is one of those gimmicks you know that you're going to spend a lot of money on and not really get much bang out of it you know speaker wire speaker wire but the physics you know underlying you know what is going through that speaker wire is going to say that if you have a powerful stereo if you have a powerful receiver you're going to want thicker gauge speaker wire and um with speaker gauge um it's important to note that the smaller the number the thicker the wire is because it's based off of American wire gauge um so I would definitely stick to fourteen or sixteen nothing smaller than sixteen okay um and I guess from here we should go to two speakers you know just like with amplifiers and then and [Music] turntables I mean what brands are the best you know what kind of wattage should we be looking for you know anything else you know to kind of say about just about speakers well your your speakers should have a peak wattage that's higher than your amplifier to reduce the effects of damage to those speakers that's the first thing you need to worry nee you need to be conscious of the second part is the brand brand is very important as a speaker um KLH I believe is still around Polk Audio Boston Acoustics those are your higher end brands um a lot of the speaker depending on the weight to which is kind of hard to judge through online shopping because not all online retailers list that kind of thing on their websites but if you're if you're going to use drought and want to go to Goodwill or a pawn shop kind of thing and give the speakers a lift they should be at least 15 pounds each for you know for floor-standing speakers at least five pounds each for bookshelf to have any bit of quality and and also remember that the cabinet is just as important as the magnet inside you want to have a cabinet that's made of real wood not particle board that's hard to find a newer speakers so spend the extra if you can on on speakers that have you know real wood as a cabinet all right anything else to kind of note about note about speakers maybe a price range or something the price range of speakers I would you know I would definitely not spend any more than a few hundred dollars per for a pair I don't think that you don't have to specifically spend a lot of money on speakers and thing is the speakers are the easiest thing to buy used um because they typically are the most common and they're also the they stand up to the most they'll last the longest out of all the other equipment that we've talked about today for the sole reason that they're um sure purely more simple in construction and operation alright I mean we've touched upon you know pretty much every major part of the puzzle yeah um go on oh I just wanted to mention as a final thought being an audiophile being into quality of sound can be anything that you want it to be if you have a lot of money you could spend a lot of money and be an audiophile tomorrow but I I feel that the real way to be an audiophile is to build up your system from smaller pieces so go out and buy that you know cheap $10 receiver that seals collecting dust and goodwill and then decide that you don't want that anymore and bump yourself up I mean the thing is buy things that have the features you want and then adjust it to your tastes and then that's one way you can do it on a limited budget so it's it is what you make I mean you could probably go out tomorrow with several hundred dollars and you know buy yourself some speakers a little tiny amplifier from RadioShack or something like that and maybe get you know another piece here there for free and just string something together you know in order to have a hi-fi system or be an audiophile you don't have to have the best system on the block tomorrow you know I mean in order to be into this kind of thing it's something that you just slowly you know you teach yourself about over time yeah just because you have you know a system that maybe just okay if you gathered up some cash this week and got it together right next week that doesn't mean that's the system you're always going to have yeah you know and that doesn't mean that you're enjoying music any less than anybody else just because your system is the most high-end that you you know that's that's out there today you wanted to mention one other amplifier brand what was that Harman Kardon Harman Kardon yeah okay all right we are going to turn toward the system that I have together okay which I told you guys just you know in my opinion gets the job done it works for my purposes um so first you know let's tell them about the the receiver I have a Sansui stereo receiver 771 that came at recommendation of you yeah um you know why this amplifier okay oh okay I can do that okay do it oh are you recording that yeah hey didn't see you in recovery I hit the recording gun so you've been recording yeah Sansui seven second one I have one of these when I was when I was a youngin I think when I was like 10 years old it's a good little receiver for not a lot of mustard it at 10 what no I'm just saying a 10 years old you had a Sansui receiver yeah yeah yeah well the thing is I've been building up my stereo for probably you know 20 years now I don't know I kind of lost track I got a lost track well I have a fortune of growing up with it too so you know it's it's been work in progress but the the stereo and what I've had you know has probably been 20 years yeah probably been 20 years but the sanzu e77 one is great because it has two auxiliary inputs it has ox one and ox two which is good for you know your mp3 player your computer things like that that's that's how I use it yeah when I have photo in the five the record player on the phone oh yeah I have the computer an auxilary one and I have auxilary two if I want to hook up my mp3 player you know something like that mmm up into it yeah and photo I want to mention that for those of you you know we're looking to collect or looking to buy a turntable your amplifier if you have a turntable and it does not have line level output you want to make sure it has a phono stage input basically what that means is a phono line level or funnel level input is a lot lower a lot lower voltage than your normal line level output that's because records require a certain Equalization that's only brought out by a special amplifier mostly called most commonly called a phono stage pre amplifier most actually all older equipment that you're going to f----- I find has that newer equipment you're going to have to specifically look for that feature a built-in phono stage but of course if you have a turntable that has line level output and your turntable will tell you that or the packaging will tell you if it does um you do not have to worry about that so I mean there are others there are some other features on the front of this thing there's a loudness feature there's mono there are different filters for highs and lows yeah there's the auto muting um and of course there's a there's a radio tuner in there as well yeah the auto muting goes with the with the FM tuner um basically it's a way to mute static on a weak on weak signals so this so basically what that means is your FM signal has to be a certain um as to be of a certain strength for audio to even come in so you're not going to just be getting nothing but the speaker's as you're searching for the radio station that you're looking yeah and of course there's a there's a headphone out there's a microphone in and there's not just uh what I want to say is there's not just outputs in the back of the amplifier - there's there's an input or two as well so if you want to do some recording I think I usually unit you switched it around it's it's there's a lot of inputs but there's a couple out pose a couple outputs as well yeah you want to do some recording to your computer that you have in one of the axillary ports or something like that through the record player which I've done numerous times I've digitized records by playing them on the record player running them through the amp into my computer and then recording the audio that way turning it to mp3 if I didn't happen to get a download or something like that from the from the the purchase that I made the record player yeah that's in the record that's how I do it I use that I use my receiver it's kind of a switching point to route you know audio from a number of different sources tape reel-to-reel record to my computer for archiving all right um next of the the record player that I have which out of the whole bunch is maybe the rarest thing that I am here because you were telling you that well I mean we both found out they don't even make them anymore yeah if well he has a SL 12 or technics SL 1200 mark 5 which if you or take the value of that turntable it's worth more than any of the high five stuff he has probably excluding his Macintosh here it's worth it's definitely worth more now because when they started it and I got it for free Hey and he got it for free I mean here I was jealous of him when he got it but of course it the turntable doesn't really are his turntable doesn't really do much for me because it's uh it's only two speeds and I collect 78 but I can guarantee you mostly everybody watching this will not be collecting seventy-eights anytime soon it's true it's it's only two speeds you know to be completely honest it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles it has you know it doesn't even have an automatic you know lift of the tone arm if you want to drop it or pull it up off the Underdown it just has a lever yeah and you know it does have the pitch adjustment but not a literally wide range of course as 33 and 45 but it's a tank I mean it's one of the heaviest record players still today I've ever picked up he's probably not going to have to buy a record player again because of the fact that that was made to be on the road that was made to be a DJ turntable and he's using it as a just regular personal you yeah high five turntable in his home it's gonna last him forever you know again the thing is a beast it's just really really functional and sturdily built and it's it's a direct drive as well when she a lot of people have said to me in the past you know oh with the direct drive especially with the gears it's not a belt drive if it's a direct drive you're going to get a lot of noise but I have not expected that guys not experience that at all with this turntable I've made numerous you know recordings of records with this turntable and you know there's really no static or so you know noise in the background or anything then I've passed some of the recordings of my records to you and you get said yourself that the sound coming from it isn't bad yeah you're cheaper direct drives are going to have that problem but not a technics SL 1200 or even the the audio technica I mentioned and the Stanton I mentioned I mean those are both direct drive turntable 's but they're both medium high range you're not going to have you're not going to have that problem if you're going for it if you're going for the less expensive you're gonna most of the time not have any choice but to get a belt drive alright um of course on that record player I have the the the sure the cartridge that you have commend it to me that I've been using that same cartridge to for for a while as well yeah um the m4 for seven it's a cartridge designed for DJ use but actually works very well in a home studio setting it's got a very high level output um it will play through damaged records so if you buy a lot of used records at Goodwill or wherever um it'll play through mostly anything um and all with minimal record wear um it does give you a little bit of a boost on the highs and lows so if you're looking for a warmer pure sound m97 XE than i mentioned earlier will probably be a better choice but for you know everyday use can't go wrong with em four four seven and especially with price of $60 you can't beat that best bang for your buck alright and and what's easily that may be the cheapest piece is out of my entire setup my speakers mm I have two Fischer speakers floor-standing speakers on the bottom when you see their STB 827 s mm-hmm says uh the evidence is 8 ohms the input power is uh 10 to 100 watts yeah that is a you know that's pretty standard for a wattage power or power handling for speakers that age and that was another set of scenario he just found him and goodwill and I found him for 25 dollars in goodwill and they were you know I mean you know you still see the the speaker where on there I mean the the outer box itself has a little bit of wear you know while they don't give me a lot of highs um that's pretty much why I have the the the bookshelf speakers to kind of make up for that yeah you know which are Jenson's yeah um but yeah those tweeters aren't very small and I can definitely you know I can definitely say from the years that I've listened to these speakers um that they're not very good on the high end but I mean for 25 bucks you still can't go wrong and that's the thing with the most of the older equipment like the Sansui we talked about just earlier you could have multiple sets of speakers hooked up at once and have the sound go out to all them this one this particular amplifier has a B and C and then it has a setting for a and B and then it has a setting for a and C or yeah yeah that's it that's absolutely so the thing is if you have one pair of speakers that don't sound perfect maybe you're getting a lot of highs out of them or you're just getting a lot of lows out of them you can just grab another pair of speakers and then balance that out and get both sides of the spectrum that you're looking for yeah if you have um if you have a respectable pair of studio bookshelf speakers which are really popular right now because of the whole you know personal computer and producing from home kind of setup um those are definitely the way to go you'll get a lot of lows out of that technology because the speaker technology has improved greatly and studio monitors are really a really good bang for the buck okay so we pretty much run through my setup we run through pretty much everything that we could say about speaker wire the amplifiers speakers and turntables um anything else that you think we should touch down on you know an end price as well you know you don't need to spend a ton of money you don't need to spend an arm and a leg you don't need to spend two thousand dollars just to get a good stereo system one thing that comes to mind is amplifier brand I did forget Harman Kardon we recorded that all we did anything else anything else oh just say other than how great friend how greater friends we are we are great friends yes know each other since high school oh yeah since like junior sophomore year yeah no um it was freshman year for freshman year oh yes man yeah that's because I was yep you were in health classes held back I was held back in health class um whenever whenever I've made mention of Derrick in a video any video this is a guy I've been doing that that's me and you know and and and that's it you know he was gracious enough to come on and sort of share with you guys what he is told and to me and taught me over the years and um you know I don't have a really expensive stereo system just as I have shown you guys but it gets the job done for me and I'm able to listen to an extraordinary amount of music on a regular basis without any kind of you know annoyances or issues I mean when I went he says every day use for me I mean literally every day I'm listening with this equipment and I'm not running into any issues with it or anything and you know sometimes I'm listening all day you know almost 24 hours straight you know with you know eating breaks or you know actually making a video or something like that and you know still it holds up so I mean this works for me you know the trick is to go out there and then finally works for you he's given you the amp brands he's giving you the brands of turntables he's told you what you need to know about the speaker wire he's told you the price ranges to look for you know spend this much if you want something good of course if you find something underneath those price ranges at a pawn shop or at Goodwill or at a tag sale that works for you then pick it up you know it'll get you by for now until you have that chunk of change later to step up to the next thing that's you know it's best to just kind of put together whatever you can now if you don't have any speaker system whatsoever to kind of practice yeah because the thing is you're going to need to cut the speaker wire and put it together and with into the stereo and make sure you're not putting your whites and your reds and you you're also the RIT and break the amp yeah you're also gonna need to find out what works for you and that goes back the biggest emphasis I can make is that your audio setup only has to sound good for you and also you know don't spend a whole lot of money on the speaker wire and don't buy $300 headphones so you know just get some just get some crap now you know and practice with that and then step up as you know the opportunities come by and as you teach yourself what you need to know in order to know that you're buying the right thing and getting the thing that's going to work for you alright that's it I think we can close this conversation out yeah I think it was I think it was very good and I hope that you know more people can get into um you know listening to music outside of their you know stock iPod earbuds or their laptop speakers without breaking bank and without getting snake oil because even if you know you don't actually you know even if you're just a digital person and you you know aren't exactly trying to go down the whole vinyl you know direction still to have a nice pair of speakers and you know an amplifier hi-fi amplifiers a good investment you know to be able to actually feel the music and hear it maybe at a you know slightly louder volume yeah and you would on just uh your headphones or laptop speakers or something like that yeah and another important thing your amplifier is going to give you range it's going to it's going to low it's going to lower your lows and heighten your highs and that's more alright that's it thanks for thanks for watching I hope this very long conversation has been has been fruitful I'm like barely out of this I'm just gonna put everything okay just let everybody you know the those who really care and really want to know this stuff we're gonna watch the whole video and go out there and try to get a stereo system that works for them yeah alright thanks for coming on yeah it's my pleasure been a good guest yeah I try he was good and everything you didn't make any annoyances with me in the green room he didn't ask for nothing but green M&Ms and his golly I'd have to feed him or anything I said just gave me good I just gave the longer I just gave a little bit of water yeah and then he and then he agreed to do this and I couldn't say now the price the price was too good all right guys forever forever [Music] you 
tstRFTn7hoM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for another little video where I am talking about my record collection going through in alphabetical order we're actually almost done you've got this and a little bit of this down here just a little and after this I am planning on trying to do a video where I show you guys my stereo setup it's really not that impressive but it gets the job done and maybe have a friend come in as well and just kind of talk about uh if you're in the market for a stereo system you know what to look for good brands things like that and and yeah that's it that's it let's just get started in the vinyl and we'll take it from there and I plan to maybe on a monthly basis do like a vinyl update of some sort of like some new purchases just new things I've run into the stuff like that things that have made its way their way into the collection alright let's get going on this little EP from Jaime vexed one half of dubstep and electronic music duo vex just three tracks on here the in-system travel EP some great great electronic songs on here and kind of a take on dubstep that isn't quite Skrillex isn't quite burial if you've heard vexed Smew zyk before then you kind of know what to expect but Jamie vex down on this EP takes things in a much more fruity colorful kind of weird direction on those three tracks especially on the track in system travels such a great song alright let's keep going somebody in one of my last vinyl videos left some dumb snarky comment about Anthony you don't have any time Waits of course I have Tom Waits when did we assume I didn't have Tom Waits I had a Tom Waits obsession in college I actually used to own a lot more Tom Waits vinyl than I do now all the other Tom Waits stuff I have is on CD this one of my favorite Tom Waits albums blood money really one of his darkest and most gritty albums in terms of just his voice being so nasty on here and I absolutely love songs like gods away on business while others such as a good man is hard to find our heart-wrenching and this is actually the first time waits out my owned on on vinyl and law it is not a number one favor for a lot of Tom Waits fans maybe I just kind of have a very personal connection to it because I it's like my first Tom Waits vinyl um yeah I mean he does a lot of sonic experiments on here I mean some of the tracks on the back end aren't his best but I absolutely love tracks like don't go into that barn hoist that rag I thought maybe this album was a little bit like mule variations in that he really experimented with you know that kind of route see textured kind of barnyard sound a little bit more on this LP that I absolutely loved and I thought it was pretty surprising of him to actually kind of go out on a limb and avoid piano for the most part on that album which is really kind of his main acts all right let's keep going washed out we got the chill waves life of - ah nothing really special about the packaging on this but actually should should show you before we continue this Tom Waits LP is I believe is a gatefold that's pretty nice they fold all the weeks and they're actually I think they're the sleeves on these records are pretty nice to do they give a real gone yes they give the the personnel of all the tracks which is awesome because Tom Waits does bring a lot of great guest musicians outside of his regular band onto his albums I know Les Claypool's on a few tracks of that LP this is actually a band that my girlfriend is a is a fan of we are trees little boyfriend EP we caught them live over at a South by Southwest reverb II indie pop it's kind of fun they were very uh I want to say I want to say carefree live very carefree band carefree attitude we've a little bit of a female post-punk right here on some clear vinyl got some clear ass vinyl here I believe it's it's really sloppy it's really hectic but also a very energetic and fun I mean I'm a huge fan of bands like the raincoats The Slits and because of that you know the sometimes I do get kind of suckered into a bands that uh that kind of share that similar sound although I would say tracks on there like I'm a lot little liar and mouthpieces Starion mouth beats are actually pretty legitimately awesome for for that sound alright wire peel sessions why are peel sessions nice nice freakin jacket on this thing that they put together for this short little collection is a short little collection of songs practice makes perfect I am the fly culture vulture as one of six beats that my favorite tracks from them but this is just a nice collection of tracks I get a nice jacket just sort of a nice spot for them in their career musically you know and I uh like the such a shiny nice pressing it's pretty it's like a jewel I really like the packaging that they put together with this simple sweet effective gotta woods lp's woods songs of shame as well as echolalia anything really amazing about the packaging here that I am not mentioning oh yeah they you know little hand-drawn or print it but you know sort of like hand-drawn designs I surely like that actually like that that's style that is that I actually think I like at Echo Lake now in retrospect a little bit more than some songs of shame which can be a little all over the place in terms of just like maybe quality of the songs a bit but still like tracks like rain on on that album are stellar whereas this is a little bit more punchy kind of like a you know similar setup in terms of in both black vinyl some are set up in terms of design let's get going who's next man great album from the who Bob O'Reilly bargain oh boy how many car commercials was that been in since it's been kind of reappropriation purposes but if you're looking to get in the hoop you know and you're looking to get into I guess some bigger more epic who then for sure for sure who's next peed all over that long peed on that thing on that column rather not necessarily a wall Chelsea wolf got some Chelsea wolf apocalypse ass with CSL sauce sheís a get into the end here folks nothing amazing about the record here although I do like the Old English lettering it's a little insert in here thought there was yeah there is got some lyrics here we're drawing more drawings personnel liner notes I love having some good liner notes in an album you know because I'm curious about that stuff produced it who played bass I want to know about that stuff they ask a nice package I like the back - it's kind of like the dichotomy of this record do you have light Chelsea Wolfe oh you have dark her her her ooh heavy its moles in the throne room here the other wolves in the firm stuff I have is on CD got two hunters on CD but this is a nice album map on Final Cut script pronunciation here I'm sure the diadem diadem of 12 stars got a little little nudity in here oh yeah we got a little nudity in here let me see tracks face in a night time mirror part 1 part 2 mmm queen of the borrowed light shimmering radiance - damn 12 stars I mean long tracks 20 minute track the last track I mean it's an epic ambitious large-scale black metal on this thing it's a trip Zappa weasels ripped my flesh for not my favorite Zappa album but a great one there's actually a fantastic trying to remember who is on this track I can fight it right here who was on here Dom sugarcane Harris oh man he does some epic epic violin solos on this thing this is actually not the best but I keep going we're almost done friend the Z's runnin Z's I'm just gonna keep going it's gonna be the last final video hmm so yeah there are some great tracks on here if you haven't heard of Zappala or you're looking to get into Zappa definitely check out tracks like where's that one is I'm just double-checking make sure it's on this album yeah my guitar wants to kill your mama check out that that is a fun little track but yeah I do believe this one crackles it skips a little bit not necessarily the best copy in the world looks clean though yeah you know there's a little hairline scratch across the a side you know bought it used you know you run into stuff like that but I remember this this is like one of the first Zappa records I got ahold of so maybe at the time I didn't know what I was looking for fun little live album from the zappas not from this app as the mother's Frank Zappa and the mothers just another band from LA if you're a Zappa fan and you're yet to listen to a Zappa live album please do I mean you you want to UM their live shows were notoriously spontaneous creative and hilarious I mean the amount of comedy that is on is that the album is just like you know a morsel in comparison to the kind of stuff that they would pull off live umm waka/jawaka from Frank Zappa this one's actually a water-damaged got it for free from a friend I mean the covers water damage the record itself is actually in a good condition and plays it's actually in shockingly good condition like it looks like shiny scary brand-new and the record cover itself is like all shriveled up like a raisin but I'm yeah not uh hmm it just might be a one-shot deal I remember liking that track and your mouth your mouth is a great track as well but I'm not my favorite Zappa record and actually a bigger fan of this one burnt wienie sandwich Frank Zappa and the mothers of invention let me see what's on here Igor's boogie is on here overture to a holiday in Berlin mm-hmm mm-hmm Valerie I like this all that percussion the keyboards for example looking Sweden his neckerchief it's a nice record and here's our last record in this collection to be shown to you a zombie surface-to-air my favorite zombie album I think the favorite zombie album for many people you know definitely some progressive species synth rock progressive synth rock on this thing that is actually absolutely badass um I could definitely come back to this record again and again who maybe I'll play this again soon haven't played this in a while it is a really epic album and you know though the band I think has become a little bit I guess a you know repetitive you know just sort of uh not really developing their style as much as I would you know to kind of keep things exciting you know I would definitely say if you never checked out zombie I mean really try out any of their albums you know because I mean though they do kind of keep delivering the same thing again and again again it is it is consistently you know it's not like there's been a huge drop in quality I would say you know it's been consistently hard vast you know epic meticulously crafted I guess I could say and I guess the last thing I could kind of show you but maybe not go too deep into is this LP compilation that I got history of jazz music from a Riverside records there's like five 12 inches in this thing and it's got a lot of different things on here from like you know early gospel music tracing jazz roots to that to you know swing music and you know trio quartet quintet jazz later after that ragtime in here as well blues stuff boogie woogie New Orleans stuff but yeah you know I got it for just like 15 bucks to see his record store all the records on here seem like they were in a good condition and there were some good cuts on here that I was interested in having in a physical form and you know just like I said 15 bucks for all this tracks pretty good alright that's essentially my entire LP collection I'm throwing all these videos together into a playlist gonna link to every one of them inside of the freaking you know description box so it'll be this one big cohesive thing you can watch the whole thing and just kind of see oh he has this he has that he has this and like I said into the future I will be doing video sort of talking about you know final update so I bought this I bought that you know I got this in my collection and yeah yeah that's it that's it Anthony Fantana Pinal grabber [Music] [Music] 
nfoc1wvKUHc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Sufjan Stevens silver and gold who is that I hear knocking at my door it's me it's Santa Cal laws yes it is hi here to bring Chris to the people back to the people well you brought you brought presents too right oh well yeah you know where you're in the bag all this guy my dad's it was yet another zero it's a really how I gotta remember that guy's my brilliant writers we don't have free out the door how five never processes okay Anthony but have you be a good boy this year yes whore I did let's get these presents presented you got me mortal kombat 3 on Super Nintendo how'd you know you wrap everything in here in saran wrap it's you could you could see right through it see it well you got to keep the prisons fresh you know pork wouldn't Mouse thing well I have one more gift for you it is a the gift of sin oh boy what a wonderful song Oh a song so I got a review this silver and gold is an album a compilation of sorts of Christmas music some of the songs are like you know pretty good you didn't listen to it he didn't listen yeah yes yes I did I'm looking at your last if I'm over here and there's there's no scrabbles so you you wouldn't net you didn't listen to it fine I'll listen to it now yourself a merry little Christmas snap put it simply to put it belong this new compilation Christmas album created by mr. Stephens silver and gold is a very spontaneous 50 eight-track affair and I love that it covers pretty much every musical bass where he finds strength meaning there are all sorts of weird glitchy in the electronic songs on here with drum machines that are really dirty messy and an auto-tune there's beautiful chamber pop on here as well as choral pieces experimental folk freak outs with weird group choruses their tracks on here that slide by in about a minute like the frosty mint track and others like the child with the star on his head that are pretty progressive strange and enticing and go past 15 it's really too much music to just be like this track does this that track does this this parts like this but the entire compilation as a whole is just one full gaudy kitschy but also kind of refine refreshing yet familiar it's got tracks on here that are just simply sweet and others that are very complex ly composed it's basically all the highs and lows the good bad and the ugly of Christmas in 58 tracks the rampant commercialism the religion the love the caring for your fellow man and the fun and the surprise and the annoyances and the headaches the stress just like on mr. Stevens last big Christmas release there are all sorts of old-time Christmas songs on here that are reworked to be maybe stranger a little bit more experimental or quaint and there are originals on here as well that can be really inspiring sometimes silly and funny and while maybe conceptually this doesn't really seem to be anything new for Sufjan because yeah he's put out a Christmas album before he's done weird Christmas covers before but this album for sure feels a little bit more ambitious covers a little bit more ground sonically illegally and musically and maybe also it is just a smidge more festive and that's it I actually loved listening to this it was a really fun experience not every track is good but the thing is not every track is meant to be good you know just like on regular Christmas you do get some crappy or just you know thoughtless presence under the tree that that aren't exactly all that appealing but the thing is the downs of Christmas are part of what makes the holiday so interesting and if you have a nice large chunk of time to yourself this holiday season or with some other people who have some very open mindsets I would say definitely give this album a listen because it is a really fun experience thank you for watching I hope everybody who celebrates Christmas has a nice holiday everybody who's celebrating other holidays have a nice of those holidays too and everybody who is not celebrating any holidays whatsoever at all your your cool as well I wish you the best too in any Fantino Merry Christmas forever 
PCuvTiXUI8U,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a little video question/comment thing I've been asked quite a few times before in tweets comments emails YouTube messages for me to list off some of my favorite guilty pleasures and you know for sure I could probably compile a list of artists like cake and Abba maybe put some Lady Gaga on there some carly rae jepsen foreigner maybe put a little Eddie Murphy on there or something pies out at 10 so I guess the short not thought-provoking answer to this question would be yes I do have guilty pleasures I could probably put a few together for you but the long philosophical answer to this question is no are you have no guilty pleasures in fact I'm proud to say when I enjoy something if it wasn't already obvious from the hundreds of videos I've made of me enjoying things and you should be the same way not the hundreds of videos part but the part where you are loving and understanding your tastes because your taste is uniquely you and you should try to listen to as many genres and artists and albums as possible testing the boundaries of what you do and do not like and along the way you may find that you enjoy some artists that others may deem to be out of fashion shallow kind of corny people usually call these guilty pleasures because something you know you like you know you enjoy but you would be embarrassed to tell other people you enjoy it but I wonder why should the music you listen to always appeal to one or two or three emotions or have an aesthetic that other people deemed to be okay why not explore and venture out and listen to some other things even if some of those things according to the masses or just a very snooty small group of people is corny or old-fashioned or shallow etc etc you know because sometimes you just want a party you just want to fit in and be normal or just do something regular or be silly or be stupid or be ironic whatever reason you find yourself enjoying something that other people kind of seem to be shunning then just be happy because you're the winner here you are driving enjoyment from something that just makes other people remember and that's their loss that's not your loss you're enjoying yourself not them not everything you listen to and enjoy and own in your record collection needs to be cutting edge or genre-defining or a masterpiece or really trendy or really deep typically people who constantly try to seek out music that that meets only those criteria are pretty boring and though I enjoy a lot of records that you know kind of receive those accolades I like taking a break once in a while I like taking a break so guilty never this is not a courtroom there's no judge here there's no jury it's music and that's it be proud of what you enjoy and always be testing what you enjoy Anthony Fantana no guilty pleasures never ever forever [Music] 
qEQV9tWfnEU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Lianne La Havas is your love big enough hmm Lianne La Havas is a songwriter neo-soul and pop soul singer as well as guitarist hailing from the UK who whose debut full-length LP dropped much earlier this year I'm on it pretty late and it was preceded by some pretty catchy singles like the title track and the song forget good songs that I kind of had you know my issues with which sort of kept me just made me hesitate to really get into the album and listen to what was going on for example the title track on this thing the singing on the verses it just kind of feels like very I guess unmemorable vocal improvisation zuv the lyrics that LeAnn is singing it's not really bringing a lot of heat for me and the song forget which wasn't all that deep lyrically but I actually loved the sounds on that track it felt so colourful and clunky the instrumentation it was just I guess bulky and loud I love the way the percussion on this track just stomps and stops in the hook the it just kind of feels like there's sort of an African vibe coming out of that and I love the dude like background vocals the bassline is great I just think this track is so layered just so many nice little musical chunks going on at once when it comes to soul both of these tracks are very colorful very kind of futuristic for me but there's not really much about these tracks that I find to be all that silky or smooth or fluid which is totally a feel I get from artists like Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu or just soul music in general however I did find tracks like that once I finally got listen to this and got into the deeper cuts they're actually quite a few patient slower and and more dynamic ballots on this LP then there are clunky and poppy singles I actually think that in the greater scheme of things these very poppy singles are balanced out nicely by these ballads and also in Leanne's music I found a really strong strong sense of melody I heard just the sheer power that her voice has in terms of pitch volume and emotion and there's quite a bit of folk music that kind of Wiggles its way into the recipe through lands guitar playing and her songwriting - like on the track no room for doubt which is a duet with Willie Mason and there's actually some really nice sweet jazz chords on the ultra cutesy track age overall it's just a really seductive multifaceted and and very enjoyable album the LP opens up at this track don't wake me up which has these eerily manipulated vocal harmonies all over the track that just feel icy and robotic it's beautiful and and sort of dark at the same time it's just haunting stuff for me and this track like others on here has a fantastic and subtle growth of instrumentation as the song progresses really making things pretty tense pretty engaging in my opinion it's actually one of the better openers of this year now after the title track of this thing this LP settles down into a depressing piano ballad where LAN is singing these lyrics like you taught me to hate myself and be somebody else the piano just the music that's being played is is actually pretty beautiful and when the subject of the song and the meaning of the lyrics finally hit me it was like wow I mean you know what a contrast of feelings hell of the atmospheric tones that pop up occasionally in the background the guitar playing has quite a bit of finesse to it to ground the halfway point of the LP Leon pulls a cover out of her bag of tricks it's actually Scott Matthews cover of the track elusive and the song was was once a very somber Lee strummed I would say kind of like an indie folk song very understated but she's really transitioned it into a finally plucked beautiful piece of neo soul and I love the ascending vocal harmonies that she has all over that tract there are some vocalists who do not sound great with their voice sort of layered over itself with foreground and background vocals but that is most definitely not the case with Leah now with the back end of this LP is where things sort of quiet down slow down a little bit it's not my number one favorite part of this entire LP because I feel like simplicity can sometimes be glans friend and maybe sometimes not so much like the guitar driven everything everything just like acoustic arpeggios all over that track feels I guess kind of repetitive somewhat underwhelming it just makes me kind of pine for all those colorful and flamboyant sounds that were on the first half of this LP however the piano ballad gone on the latter half of this thing I actually think is one of the more powerful tracks on here I mean Lee Ann's voice and her emotions just reach a breaking point toward the end of this track as she just gets more and more intense singing the chorus of this track the closing track on here is great it's a nice strong finish for this thing but again I do feel like toward the end of this LP without some of that extra instrumentation that was in the beginning of the LP this album does lose some of its creative flair some of its definition overall on this LP I feel like there's a strong foundation of playing and songwriting there just needs to kind of be that consistent creative flair that makes some of the tracks on here just amazingly memorable and kind of unique because I do feel like there are elements of this album that border on eccentric but are not quite there I guess I actually enjoyed this thing quite a bit I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan out how big is your love forever 
aCIJRmawdsw,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd here to talk about some albums and tracks that I didn't really get to review this week but I wanted to talk about anyway things that I missed but I wanted to hit the Swedish metal outfit ghost has a new track out on their website for streaming and for download yes this band's last album loved it so I'm excited for this new LP of theirs but was kind of surprised by what I heard with this in papa papa 3-4 rhythm and the circus organ in the track that I wasn't digging all to much the guitars fell swallowed up by these electronically tinged synthesizers and it just didn't Rock to me I know ghost traditionally has been pretty campy has never really been about being all that heavy but I just wish this track had a little bit more to it a little bit more of that devilish attitude that made their debut LP so awesome but still I am looking forward to the new LP which I'm assuming is coming out in 2013 I hope you guys dig the track more than I did if you did then Earl tracks so many people ask me to talk about the new Earl track and yeah I haven't really been in a rush to do it but given how inconsistent hot future has been up until this point with weak albums and forgettable songs can you really blame me I guess you could I should talk about things when they come out I'm sorry anyway this track was actually pretty decent pretty good with a very choppy piano beat some murky and dirty drums behind that too I actually think it's one of the better beats and Odd Future member has been on since the early mixtapes and it's one of the more mature tracks too with Earl lyrically diving into ideas of mental illness as well as separation from his father and feeling alienated and just having this feeling of not belonging with kids his own age however it's not really anything striking new or all that emotional for me personally because I kind of feel like you've already heard this angle before from Tyler however I will say the chump does squeak by as being more interesting now will I review Earl's album when it comes out most likely but am I going to be hyped on it and and everything like that no you know if the album is great I will decide that when I actually hear it Starkey is an electronic music producer this is his third full-length LP and what you're gonna find on here is pretty much a synth Odyssey that is trap music flavored with all sorts of futuristic sounds weird samples and an extra helping of bass it's very colourful very playful I definitely recommend it to tonight fans but I didn't really come out loving this entire thing personally because some of the progressions some of the sequencing of these tracks does get a little predictable but as is there is a nice dynamic going between these synth pieces and these bangers boom hey Sam Ron you dropped in tight track with this one and a lot of people are telling me his new album leaked I know I know that I know it now while I'm not going to talk about that help yet I'm gonna wait you know until they were a little bit closer to the release date but you know we do have classics week coming down the pipe but still in the meantime if you have not listened to the leak or anything like that you know you you just have this track to listen to it is a great track I mean it is worth listening to again and again to kind of hold things over because it has been crit yellow wolf Kendrick Lamar Action Bronson Joey badass who am I forgetting Danny Brown and together I mean it's just a lot of big modern names and they do not disappoint together I mean Joey badass raps about signing a rockefeller Danny Brown wouldn't hit that with his worst enemies penis Big KRIT does this thing Action Bronson does this thing yellow wolf brings that grimy Eminem flavored trailer-park flow Kendrick Lamar does is cry-cry thing it's all awesome and the beat the instrumental is great to bring in that epic string kissed boom-bap aesthetic that is really enjoyable hopefully other songs on this thing have is big a presentation this is the latest LP from TI trap music for father and you know after listening to this the only question I have in my head is what happened to this thing there's some pretty hot features on this LP especially andre 3000 on the track sorry awesome track and listen to the subliminal he throws a big boy on that thing the recording on this album is terrible so many of the beats on this thing are thinner than a crack head and Ti is vocals sound very thin as well it's like it wasn't mastered right I mean there's not a lot of beef to some of these tracks especially on the first two songs where T is vocals are actually kind of buried behind the instrumental some of the sounds some of the instrumentals on this thing can be bearable they sound okay but there's just not a lot of bump to this album plus the album doesn't really have a cohesive or cinematic feel that's kind of implied in the album title and I understand there supposed to be like a sequel to this album coming out next year I'm hoping that's better because the production of recording on no mercy beats this album by a long shot [Music] which unfortunately does not stand for only nice and Venters find cash this new Wiz Khalifa LP while I did actually think it was way better than rolling papers it was not necessarily because of lyrical content or anything like that I mean in terms of lyrics and flows it's the same old Wiz but the production on this thing is awesome with this LP Wiz khlifa actually hops onto the cloud rap bandwagon with some really spacey atmospheric beats that kind of make me feel like he's been smoking up a lot to Live Love ASAP definitely a clams casino kind of feel on this thing but I wouldn't necessarily say it's like a ripoff it's more like a much more expensive version given that you do have a lot of big name producers on this thing making these atmospheric beats you know a lot of the repetitions and these vocals and just the topics can be pretty mindless but the instrumentals especially on a track like make what I'm hearing feel really epic and purposeful and meaningful even though that's totally not the case its mood music you know what I'm saying but I feel like the only reason it succeeds as mood music is because Wiz is so uncreated and what he raps about pretty much weed money women haters that it's easy to kind of tune him out over time and just enjoy the instrumentals finally I want to talk about the latest track from indie rock superstars Yola Tango they have a track out titled ohm which is actually pretty nice it's from their full-length LP dropping next year in January titled fade on Matador Records this is a pretty sweet indie psychedelic folk rock tune that is very repetitive kind of mantra like in terms of lyrics and music getting thicker louder kind of more intense as it goes on noisy er too and I like the sentiment behind the track that you know bad guys sometimes when good guys sometimes lose but things will not always stay the same if you've given these albums these tracks will listen what did you think of any of them did you love them hate them why and yeah that's it thanks for watching Anthony Fantino album's tracks forever [Music] [Music] 
K8OJ5BC-7Xg,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's it's just music nerd and it's time for a review the new burial EP true in rough sleeper burial is an electronic music producer a dubstep and future garage innovator who's pretty much been taking it easy on the whole releasing a full-length album thing since putting out the genre-defining untrue in 2008 the number of artists seized influence since this LP came out is damn near incalculable especially with all the band camp and soundcloud copycats out there his music is is very influential in the underground but he himself is is kind of elusive only occasionally releasing an EP worth of material here and there two to three songs but I wouldn't necessarily say it's to hold fans over this is just kind of the pace that he seems to be working at right now because the tracks the material that he's putting on these EPS it's far from being throw away these releases have actually been a pretty vital and interesting part of his progression past untrue the last EP that he put out kindred was my second favorite EP of this entire year year year and on this EP he was getting really ambitious with ambient sounds and textures song lengths and he's pretty much going down that same road again with this new release with two tracks just two tracks but both of them span easily past ten minutes this EP stylistically is kind of like a sequel to kindred but that doesn't mean what's happening here isn't done really well and it does have a few experimental surprises they're all these watery synth chords on this track that have kind of an eerie resolution to them there are some very finely choped female vocal samples echoing over that as well as a very subtly pulsating two-step beat which goes through these really quiet and subtle changes I fell in love with you along with those vocal cuts there are glitches in here just shots of subterranean bass and some chimes and as the song moves along there like some sudden stops that kind of bring the song to a hole at the 130 mark the song kind of glitches out and everything disappears for a moment for the track boomerangs back with that vocal cut that I just said at 3:50 the song stops again silence but then it comes back quickly once more with a beat that is way more tribal and has kind of like this fluttering quality to it that's really strange at 5:16 another full stop and after that it feels like I'm listening to the same song but there is a notable change in it all these stops in this track it's kind of a very interesting use of silence to kind of bring this on from one point to another but the 8:30 mark kind of brings this song into its last movement stops starts again but it feels like an entirely different track at this point the song has a minor key bass line and it has a different kind of momentum to it it's crawling it's lurching it has kind of like a I don't know I guess I would say a reptilian quality to it it's not as pretty as the previous spots at all it's actually pretty hectic and noisy for burial it's so clunky and I think kind of otherworldly just the sharp drums and these murky alien bass hums it's definitely my favorite of the two tracks and I think a step up for burial when it comes to bringing together a really unique sound palette the song rough sleeper though get started right away it's a nice pace I love the effect that these synth chords have it's kind of Skippy and the sound of the chords has a bit of a church organ feel to it a sexy saxophone sample comes in and I'm noticing that in this track there are full stops as well there are gaps there are pauses and at a few points in this song they occur at the same points in the previous song and of course as the song stops and comes back in it introduces newer ideas like these I see synth chords that pop in occasionally at this point I'm feeling like these stops are even more interesting it's actually a really nice way to make these two tracks feel more like not just two tracks but an entire cohesive piece like they're connected in some kind of weird abstract way that I feel like us as the listeners really fully understand but we can kind of draw some conclusions come up with our own interpretations there these really weirdly harmonized vocal cuts that kind of pop up throughout the track that I wasn't really too hot on was pretty kind of lukewarm on that how they sort of felt dissonant against each other but I love the metallic arpeggios bouncing all over the track and this song comes to a pretty noisy and strange and kind of clunky end as well I mean burial really makes a case for noisiness and distortion on these two tracks especially at the end where they come to an apocalyptic close though still I would say overall these songs are pretty quiet and subtle understated like you would expect from burial overall I really enjoyed these two tracks I didn't love it quite as much as kindred but I thought that these two songs were a worthy sequel for sure I'm feeling a light at ease an eighth on true and rough sleeper but if you've given them a listen why did you think did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana burial forever [Music] 
0fRWxAV3Eik,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Chief Keef [Music] Chief Keef is a Chicago rapper who sort of seemed to blow up overnight after Kanye West for the cruel summer compilation album put together a remix for his already hot internet hit I don't like and it was getting people to check out his other material as well outside of I don't like mostly tracks from his 2012 mixtape that came out in March back from the dead and in fact a lot of tracks from that mixtape are on this album along with some newer cuts that were put together after Chief Keef blew up most notably this newer version of three oh no which now features a very phoned in Rick Ross contribution and the track hate being sober which has 50 cent and Wiz Khalifa on it it seems like right now finally rich and Interscope Records are kind of sitting back on tracks that are already popular already hits on the internet along with like I said a few new ones to kind of get Keefe out there and keeping him on people's tongues I guess it's kind of a smart move on Interscope sparked but Chief Keef isn't really playing the game in a way you would assume an up-and-comer would for one he's lashed out against the notion that Kanye is the person who made him famous by doing this remix saying that he was famous before Kanye didn't do shit he laughed at the death of little Jojo which shocked a lot of people to kind of see this this young man died at the hand of street violence the same street violence that Chief Keef raps it out and a lot of people assume he's involved in you can also look at his mannerisms and interviews where he seems very kind of quiet and uninterested in even really talking about anything and of course there's the instance where he didn't show up for his video shoot for the track hate being sober with 50 cent in Wiz Khalifa I'm really honestly not sure if there's anybody on the planet especially in the rap industry that gives less of a fuck than Chief Keef now when you put this album on the very first thing that's going to hit you is this long angry audio clip of this young kid screaming about Chief Keef lashing out at people who questioned his authenticity his thuggish background saying that he's on probation since I don't know when and you know honestly I have to agree 100% I do not for a second doubt that background to missiles I don't question chief Keef's status as a thug I question his status as a rapper because all over finally rich I mean you get recycled flows recycled hooks mediocre lyrics and a really really sloppy delivery and a touch of bad singing as well for good measure the track I don't like is my favorite song on here it continues to be my favorite Chief Keef song it's kind of like the sex and violence of trap rap this is this track in a lot of moments on here basic basic basic lyrically topically guns girls drugs money mmm I get a lot of commas I can fuck your mom I with the trauma you can meet my llama he makes ASAP rocky look really deep and he makes waka flocka flame look like he's spittin Shakespeare sometimes Chief Keef being messy and amateurish and sloppy really helps some of these songs out and gives them personality but it gets kind of old over the course of 12 tracks and you know I'm sure in a way Chief Keef is totally conscious of this but I don't think he cares I mean he's not interested in following the rules which is completely fine you know breaking rules is cool I love on rules get smashed but still as a greater piece it's not like finally riches all that unorthodox it's just kind of one step closer to the shallow end and the homogeneous Asian of trap rap Keef does not care if the music is diverse or if the rapping is good I think he's really just kind of bullshitting hilariously on some of these tracks like laughing to the bank we're all over the track ha ha ha ha ha it's kind of like hey we tricked you and of course this track is delivered over the same bouncing bass lines and the skittering high hats and the synthesized bells and the orchestral hits that pretty much every song finds itself on top of now to be completely honest I feel like tracks on here like diamonds love Sosa hallelujah I mean there are a number of tracks here that are pretty fun they're wild they're crazy they're dirty they're filthy I mean there is an appeal to it I just feel like this album gets kind of unbearable when singing and an auto-tune comes into the picture like on the tracks ball in and KK and no tomorrow I mean all those songs because the auto-tune just sound like muddled messes the real talent on this thing is this albums most utilized producer young chop if Chief Keef didn't have his detailed and memorable trap beats he wouldn't have a musical appeal I wouldn't necessarily personality-wise put Chief Keef in the ranks of other meme rappers like riff raff even though he made a track with riff raff I think he's got a little bit of a different flavor but I feel like most people out there on the internet listening to music listening to Chief Keef are consuming him like he is a meme rapper because all of his songs have these repetitive anthemic mantras that all kind of have you know a certain topic that is very obvious from the song title I think the only people that are going to listen to this LP and find something truly real and just life-affirming about it are people who are about that life that Chief Keef is rapping about other people are just kind of voyeurs teenagers from the suburbs who are on winter break and waiting for Christmas or college kids who are probably logging online after this review to check and see if their professors have posted their grades leads leads leads leads again I like Chief Keef sound I love the singles on this LP I mean some of the catchiest and most memorable songs of 2012 up there with some of the most notable songs in trap music period but as an entire experience this LP is really one-dimensional it's repetitive it's not an enjoyable listen from front to back I'm kind of feeling a strong three to light four on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it thank you for watching Anthony Fantana finally rich forever [Music] you 
fGIJCX1Yitc,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the game Jesus piece the game is a compton rapper dr. dre protege and ex g-unit member this is his latest LP he has been making music for easily over a decade and I'm just gonna come out and be honest and say that I've never really taken him all that seriously when game first blew up with his LP the documentary he was doing huge things for the west coast but along with a lot of other rappers that I mentioned in my woo block review and to me the game was just one of many phases at the time who were a part of a trend where hardcore hip-hop and gangsta rap were no longer throwing radical ideas out there were no longer coming up as being uncompromising xìng xìng xìng xìng those things were being swapped out for popular hooks smoother beats just overall a nicer more accessible sound however it's not like in albums such as the documentary was entirely bad I mean dr. Dre had a really positive influence on that LP people like Just Blaze and Kanye has some great production on that album there are moments where game kind of conveys sympathy for people who are victims of street violence in this LP there's a moment where you dresses racial tensions in the current hip-hop landscape on the Eminem featured song we ain't and their tracks on this LP that just all around are really good like Church for thugs but still the game has never really been a favorite of mine especially since everything since the documentary when he severed his ties with g-unit has never really been that great especially lax and the really feature bloated red album so I didn't go into Jesus piece expecting something great expecting to be pleasantly surprised however I was caught off guard for a little bit even though this from what I hear supposed to be a concept album I wouldn't really say the game reinvents himself here or comes a thought-provoking nc he kind of takes his usual personality and and quality of lyrics and and then flows biting a few other styles here and there and comes through with a few serious song topics as well as some great instrumental choices too and the concept is basically to kind of illustrate people who are stuck between this religious life and this violent immoral street life it's kind of a dynamic that was highlighted already recently by artists like Big KRIT as well as Kendrick Lamar on his new LP but those two artists kind of illustrate these lifestyles as two different paths the game instead kind of focuses on people who think or kind of managed to be living both at the same time people who are completely fine with doing these really terrible violent immoral things but still think that you know they're in favor with God or that they're following Jesus and you know to be completely honest there are people like that I mean I think it's really real of the game to make that kind of statement you see the juxtaposition of this violent life and this religious life all over this LP in the very profane and kind of gritty I mean gritty for the game lyrics and all the religious imagery in the lyrics as well and the song titles too like the title track and heavens arms and see no evil I mean the dichotomy is definitely brought up it's obvious it's there I mean it hits you over the head the game literally beats the crap out of the listener with this dichotomy but he doesn't really go that deep into it he doesn't go into it with any detail or really analyzation or anything he doesn't question why people are like this or how they can live their lives like this I mean the only real conclusion that this album comes to is toward the end of the LP or finally it's just kind of screamed at the listener that you can't do both you got to be one of the other I'm not saying go out and kill somebody but you know don't be mixing that together I mean if I wanted to hear somebody dive into this issue with at least a little bit more emotion I could listen to a rick ross album the fact of the matter is that a lot of songs on this LP aside from some great instrumental choices just sound like you know you're just run-of-the-mill game songs but with a little bit more religious imagery mixed in like on the song Church where the game says that he's in love with a stripper there's the lyric where he says he has Christian Louboutins he's going to crucify the in the hook it said that she's thicker than a Bible baptism is kind of brought up too I mean some of the words are there there is profanity and there are mentions of religion but it's not really brought together in the juxtaposition that is implied in the album title in the cover art in the sketches that sit in between the songs I mean the sketches are actually more telling than the songs themselves is a sketch about the dude coming in with the Jesus piece that he dropped 50 stacks on is hilarious and just really good satire I mean if only the game's lyrics were that witty and exposing when it comes to this issue if this is the concept of the album their songs on here that just feel like they missed the mark entirely and could have been on any game album actually like named me King and most notably the song all that lady which features a terrible line from Big Sean talking about like sex toys and then he drops that line toys stories the only tracks on this LP that I thought actually highlighted the concept of this album well were songs like Hallelujah where the game is really profane but finds himself in this church setting lyrically and with the instrumental as well which has all these gospel vocals in it it's actually really great beat and the song pray the game kind of finds himself being this tough gangster but being sympathetic to this woman who's going through a really tough time it's actually a song that reaches a level of emotional vulnerability that I didn't even know the game was capable of and there are some other tracks on here that don't exactly fit the theme or the concept perfectly like Ali bomaye and yeah while it doesn't really kind of highlight what this album I guess is supposed to be about all that nicely it's still an awesome song the great instrumental I mean this track goes hard it's one of the album's true bangers and 2 Chainz on this track sounds powerful he just like is going off another track on here that also kind of hit me with a lot of energy that I loved was the title track the game actually has a nice feature from common and while Kanye is credited it just kind of feels like he contributed a phone in hook to the track which gets stapled over and over throughout the song and it's kind of silly that that is the contribution that ya brought to the table and yet the game is like saying me and yeh toward the end of the track on this track and a lot of tracks on this album just the game tracks in general I feel like this dude exaggerated siz power and influence and just I guess networking skills in the industry all the time there are lyrics on this LP that shows he still clearly hung up over the g-unit thing I mean who's even paying attention to g-unit anymore is g-unit even an influential power and hip hop if he's not doing that he's measuring himself up against jay-z I feel like if the game didn't have all this industry drama and just hip-hop history behind him he wouldn't be that interesting or controversial of an emcee because he doesn't really have all that much to say despite the fact that we're supposed to have the concept album here about the dichotomy of being a violent gangster but yet trying to be religious and faithful to God at the same time again there were a couple standout tracks on here some really good instrumental choices I liked the pitch shifted soul sample on the track freedom I liked the very spacious instrumental on the track see no evil and Kendrick was great on that track as well like he was on the last track that he got featured with the game like previous LPS it's overloaded with features but still a little bit more focused than lax and the red album however lyrically this album is just kind of passable I mean sometimes the game can put out a pretty clever line but for every very clever line he has he has a line like this one line addressed to his critics I'm paraphrasing here you know that I'm classic I don't even got to say Frank ocean's more man than you get up off that gay a very kind of on the fence album I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan oh the game forever [Music] [Music] 
r3XRB7afE84,"hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new big boy album vicious rumors and dangerous lies no swap that reverse it vicious lies and dangerous rumors however before we get too deep into the review there is an order of business that must be taken care of the channel passed over 100,000 people subscribe to this channel right now which is crazy and we need to party counter chesta please your most celebratory and upbeat poppy instrumental right now my good man you get my friend your jackass and I wish you were dead bigboy is a Georgia rapper this is a sophomore full-length LP and as he says in the very lyrics to this album he is known as one half of the infamous hip hop project duo Outkast whose first four albums are pretty much essential hip hop listening however together Big Boi and Andre 3000 have not really done a new album of studio material since 2006 is Idlewild and since then the two haven't really been putting all that much effort into holding us over with you know solo material Andre 3000 keeps really busy with a lot of features spots on tons of tracks and also keeping his facial hair really stylish and in 2010 Big Boi brought his full-length debut LP sir lucious left foot and even though I didn't love the album it was received really well despite the fact that people kind of had every reason to sort of trash it and compare it to outcasts output and just say but where's a new Outkast album which people still do say but on this LP audiences really sort of embraced big boys awesome flows his catchy poppy beats his smooth personality and charisma and of course southern flavor and he really approached this project with a seriously open mind when it came to musical styles and variety which definitely shows up in the feature list on this thing and it becomes apparent on this new LPS featureless that it is kind of even more diverse than sir lucious left foot it's a pop rap album that is loaded with instrumentals and artists too that aren't really associated with hip-hop typically there are quite a few instrumentals on this thing to have a kind of electronic flavor the closing track on here is like an acoustic Jam the song raspberries is loaded with all these melancholy synthesizers Big Boi invites producer singers like Bo B Bosco he brings on ASAP rocky 2 as well as indie artists like waves Phantogram and little dragon the last of which brought this album a lot of hype because people were interested in why Big Boi would even want to collaborate with little dragon what would they even do together musically at the end of the day this LP is a real mixed bag and big boys willingness to hit his fans with a bunch of tracks with a bunch of different styles and flavors to them is is maybe the most unique and likeable thing this album has going for it however whether or not it is well performed written or produced is a totally different story because when it comes to those aspects of this LP vicious lies can be a little kind of hit or miss there are definitely highlights great tracks strong singles on this thing but nothing as sort of creative as colourful or as bouncy as like the song shutterbug in fact I actually think the kind of diverse and eclectic personality of this album distracts away from some of the pitfalls that the songs on this thing have though I like big boys rapping as an emcee I think he has a ton of personality but so many of the instrumentals on here in the courses are just too sugary for me I mean it's like chocolate-covered Sour Patch Kids dipped in caramel and you know being sweet isn't necessarily a bad thing I just have an issue with just being simply sweet its sweetness and nothing really else to enjoy like on the song raspberries which has a cute little instrumental but the singing all over that track is just bad and that is repeated on the track tremendous damage not with Bosco though he sings really well on that hook even though it is kind of generic but once big boy comes in and starts singing the melody it just lacks so much personality it sounds like a million other songs that have already been made and he sings with no sincerity or emotion or energy at all there's a real night and day difference between his singing and when he goes into rapping a line about the Wright brothers having to crash before you actually succeed right after where wow it actually kind of feels like he is putting something into what he's saying right there I feel the same way about the closing track down here too and as far as some of the beats go on here they can be kind of under as well like the song the thickets while I love the chorus on that track it's filled with smooth syrupy R&B vocals it's hot it's sexy and I love the line that he throws in there about the rabbit's foot I thought that was clever but the instrumental self feels so hidden it feels so hollow it's like the instrumental has no beef and I feel the same way about the track Tom Petty which has all these really farty synthesizers to that I just do not agree with I don't know how you disagree with an instrument but I managed to do it the great instrumentals on here to me are tracks like in the a which is a song that kind of fits the usual southern trap mould with a bit of fine detail to it it's a banger it's colorful but I'm still kind of stuck here wondering why does the song sample shutterbug I like the song but I feel like I'm just constantly at every turn on this healthy being reminded of yeah you know I like the last one so much more the only other instrumentals that I feel like I loved consistently on the Selphy were the Phantogram tracks and of all the artists that Big Boi brought on this LP I think his collaborations with them were the most fruitful and I think he understood that too because he had them on here so many times the beat on the track lines with ASAP Rocky came out really great I love the pulsating sampled guitars on that track as well as the epic piano chords the chorus went a little sweet a little feathery but I thought it was a nice transition and see what you will about ASAP Rocky but I like how is emphasized flow actually made the song kind of catchy the song's objective sexuality and CPU hit really catchy awesome electronic grooves to the latter of the two songs was maybe a little corny maybe a little too flirty but the vocals that are featured on these Phantogram tracks are usually so glossy and sexy and smooth and just kind of stop me in my tracks there's some of the prettiest sounds that are on this album they're actually way more interesting than what little dragon brought to this LP it actually feels like they're collaborations they didn't really have a lot of input in them or they just weren't that fun or creative or bold and they were just all kind of stashed in the back of the songs to the point where you can't even really tell if they're there the hook on the track that Kid Cudi is featured on is okay but again that song kind of takes a corny modern look at love and in this instance it's kind of like breaking up in the modern age involving Facebook and deleting pictures technology is affecting relationships this song does acknowledge that but still emotionally subject wise it feels kind of one-dimensional you already kind of rounded this base with the song CPU and you did it much better there I thought the Kelly Rowland feature was decent the waves hook which could have totally gone terrible was decent as well but the thing is these collaborations that are on this album didn't really feel as surprising or as explosive as they look to be on paper it's like big boy already had this kind of preset formula planned out for all these songs and he's just sort of plugging guest singers and songwriters in and out you're kind of getting the same flavor of bubble gum over and over and over wrapped delicately and meticulously in just a different colored wrapper this album is just really sweet without a whole lot of depth or narratives or anything like that bigboy still comes off kind of clever on a lot of these songs his flows are still really strong but this album didn't really have as much direction or as many strong songs as Sir Lucius did I just didn't find a lot of conviction on this new big boy LP it just felt like one kind of breezy forgettable pop rap song after another I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this LP and I want to know what do you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think guys should review next and that's it thanks for watching Anthony Fantana big boy forever [Music] [Music] "
LDNTB524fy8,hi everyone Anthony Pantano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a discussion video kind of addressing one of the most frequently asked questions that is thrown my way what headphones do you use what headphones do you like headphones headphones headphones headphones now headphones in general can be pretty great they have their pros and their cons no matter how cheap or expensive you go while it's awesome that you always kind of have this ability to have your own kind of personal listening space that cancels sound out from outside you can kind of be inside your head enjoying music you don't necessarily need to bother anybody else with the music that you're listening to you're not necessarily going to get that physical experience though that you do from a live show or a really nice hi-fi system headphones are easy they're portable they're convenient some more high-end models are known for bringing lots of clarity and bass response to the table so if you really want to hear the details in the production maybe the way things are pan things of that nature headphones are really kind of the way to go now I don't do all of my listening when I'm reviewing or just sort of listening for pleasure on headphones I do prefer speakers I prefer a hi-fi system I have stacked a and B speakers in my office and I primarily listen to those but of course there are occasions when I have to use headphones maybe something is bothering my girlfriend or maybe something's a little too loud for my neighbors in my apartment and you know I can't be like blasting metal at 2:00 a.m. or maybe I can but whatever and that's when headphones come into play and when I am sitting here listening you know at my leisure or for a review the headphones I primarily use are AKG 240s these are studio audiophile over-the-ear headphones 55 ohms and I mean they're incredibly durable clear comfortable there is a nice base response and I've owned and trusted these headphones this specific pair of headphones for at least six years now and with regular use it shows very little wear and you know that they actually feel more comfortable now the day that I first got them because they are broken in the reason I kind of stand by these headphones not only are they just you know great they fit perfectly on me and you know just you don't need any kind of crazy adjustments or anything like that to just kind of put them on your head it's just like oh it's just a snug fit Oh ooh II it's like I'm wearing a cloud but I like that on over ear headphones in general it's not just an on-ear headphone you're not just getting the speaker shoved right on top of your ear you are getting some space between your ear and the speaker it's not quite as suffocating as an on-ear headphone or especially in your but the bigger speaker of course lends slightly bigger sound and again to kind of go back to the durability again that there's not really much about these headphones that I think have have really kind of turned sour over the 6 years that I've owned them the headband is still tight fits on my head nice I do see a little bit of cracking and wear in the leather pillows over the speakers but the thing is these are easily viable online and you could just sort of snap them and sort of snap them out another thing that they do with these newer models that I absolutely love is this this comes right out it is a little mini XLR Deeley that goes right in the headphones anybody who's owned a pair of headphones that they listen to regularly in the past knows that you know happens you step on a wire the wire just kind of gets tangled in something and it tears a little bit and then you gotta throw away the whole you know set of cans and then get a whole new pair it doesn't even make sense it's perfectly logical to be able to pull the wire out and then get a new wire headphones like these and this specific model are used frequently in radio audio production and music production as well there are more high-end headphones made by AKG and other brand names of course but you wouldn't want to go much lower than this if you we're going to go down that kind of road there are headphones out there that you could easily spend a grand or more on and you know I don't happen to own any of them because I don't exactly have that kind of money to lay down on a pair of headphones so I'm not exactly going to comment too deeply but a lot of these high-end models boasts that they have better bass response that they can get louder that they're clearer some sort of half cups that have openings in the middle so that you get more space between your ears and the music for a better sort of listening experience allegedly some have very sleek designs and maybe if the stars aligned and the opportunity to own a pair ever came up I you know might grab the chance however you know I I would definitely advocate that you don't need all the bells and whistles just to listen to music just to hear the music with with clarity and in comfort that's why I continue to use these EKGs they're just around a hundred bucks on a lot of websites definitely not too high of an investment for a solid pair of headphones there are other more consumer grade headphones that are more expensive but boasts bigger sounds like you know these dre beats headphones that I've had for a while but never actually opened and you know I might actually do a video on them if you guys are interested in such a thing because I know quite a people out there own these things but the thing is about these EKGs is that you know they're there for home listening you know what do you listen to when you leave the house what do you listen to when you go out it costs porta pros right here ah easily adjustable to sort of slip them on your head like that yes they look a little clunky a little metallic a little dorky but they are nice for sort of going out and knocking around and they just have a really kind of durable metallic frame that you know has made them last so long and I love the fact that you can kind of fold them up and then just throw them anywhere while they do not reverberate as much as the AKG 240s you can make out the bass you can hear it the only downside of these headphones I would say though is that these cushions on the phones after a while of regular use wore out on me and they were literally disintegrating on my head like I would wear them and then I would take them off and I would have all these black chunks of like foamy dandruff on my face which is why when you get these things you should invest a couple bucks in these replacements you may end up needing them as far as Knockaround headphones go these are pretty solid I like that I can kind of adjust and maybe have these kind of fan out a little bit more if I need them to I've never really used that feature all too much of course I'd hit some snags as well but like I just kind of Illustrated these speakers come off pretty easily not too easily but pretty easily from the headband that they're attached to so if you you know do kind of hit your cord on something it kind of comes right out and it doesn't necessarily pull itself out of the headphone I'm looking for something that's even more Knockaround than those I mean I just pretty much use your your general ipod white earbuds I haven't tried the new earbuds that they have out that have the different shape maybe that might appeal to me a little bit more but the reason I still stick around with these even though you know it's not the best sound that your buds are so tiny yada-yada-yada I'm just not that invested when it comes to earbuds I hate shoving something inside my ear not only is it just uncomfortable for me and I've tried some of those you know bigger better softer bass your earbuds as well the high end of earbuds just does not really appeal to me whenever I'm using earbuds it's most likely because it's kind of a necessary evil not because I just love using earbuds just like music headphones it's all a matter of personal taste as long as you're getting some bass response as long as you're getting the clarity of the music then you're pretty much there you just need to find what kind of headphone style fits your comfort standards and that's it that's pretty much all of the stuff that I use for headphone listening what do you guys use for headphones do you prefer over ear headphones on here headphones earbuds what are some of your favorite models to listen with tell me your dream headphones what headphones would you own if you had the cash and that's it Anthony Fantana thank you for watching headphones forever [Music] 
lBdnBBgmCTM,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's rosiest music nerd and man I'd list week is doing horrible things to me right now it's doing terrible things to my psyche nice couch esta - it's it's not a pretty thing this is our final video of list week final list video discussing my favorites of boot oh yeah and this is my fifty favorite albums of 2012 good times [Music] alright starting off at number 50 we have the the satisfaction album on naturale a very interesting cross-section of hip hop neo-soul R&B as well as funk and jazz on this one little at number 49 it is a series of dark and crazy beats on the Gaslamp Killer album breakthrough and at number 48 John Talbot with some much dancer and exotic beats on the LP Finn very nice dance music album check it out at number 47 Nick's a Mutoh of the books comes together with a really solid solo album titled zmuda really creative experimental pop album right there and at 46 definitely for me death grind release of the year murder constructs results awesome album cover 2 at number 45 beach house comes through with another nice solid dream pop album in the same style that we usually hear from the band on the LP bloom and if you don't finish the lunch pop outfit torch gets a little poppier a little catchy a little faster more straightforward while still kind of maintaining a bit of that heaviness and nice riff äj-- harmonic raft for number 43 the bad plus comes through with a nice creative and forward-thinking jazz album with made possible and coming in after that at 4-4 442 Corrine Riggins along together really great series of funky and jazz influence hip hop instrumentals it is a beat album in the same vein of artists like mad lib and J Dilla this guy was cut from the same cloth has been in the industry for years has been making beats for numerous artists including Erykah Badu and the roots and all of this experience really comes together on this very nice full-length debut at number 41 tame impala improves improves improves on its psychedelic pop style with the LP loner ISM and come in and after that at 40 the tallest man on earth with there's no leaving now another solid record from him at number 39 Deerhoof reinvents it sound from being a guitar driven experimental rock and pop band from being a MIDI and beat driven experimental rock and pop band while yeah the sounds are much different than you're likely to hear on a Deerhoof LP the eccentricity the really fun songwriting it's all still there at number 38 acid house gets futzed with on the new recondite album on acid these tb-303 bass lines that you typically hear squelching away in acid house music are cleaned up played very very delicately over one subtle beat after another an awesome collection of tracks and a couple remixes at number 37 the UK indie pop outfit alt-j comes eccentric colorful and strange with an awesome wave and at 36 shivbaba brings together elements of doom and breakdown hardcore for an extremely pummeling and heavy with hasta la muerte at number 35 wild nothing brings some really awesome catchy indie pop and dream pop songs with some nice fiery guitar leads some catchy hooks I'm really liking how pleasant and sweet this album is at the same time and at number 34 an album that to me is essentially thrash metal on steroids it's black breath with sentence to life and number 33 definitely my favorite post-punk album of this year the Holograms LP the self-titled LP that they put out on captured tracks a nice surprise from that label I ma'am just one catchy song after another yeah it's not bringing anything new to the table but just a ton of energy and some catchy songs on this thing at number 32 the even's comeback after about six years of no new albums and comes through with another solid set of songs drums vocals baritone guitar strong lyrical messages while yeah stylistically it's not exactly a surprise the songs on this thing are very well written and there's a really tangible energy to the playing between the guitar and the drums on this thing to that I enjoy at number 31 glistening glassy neon colored electronic dance tunes on the lone LP galaxy garden and at number 30 an album that kind of snuck up on me I already knew I enjoyed it quite a bit but I ended up enjoying it more it grew on me Hot Chip in our heads I mean these guys are just writing again some great electronic dance and pop music I'll say now what I said in my review I think what these guys do is just so beautifully universal that it's it's difficult to deny and number 29 it's a solid combo of indie rock post hardcore and I mean like old school in Iraq not like the new poppier side of indie rock I mean old 90s indie rock on the pile album terrific and at number 28 kind of another pop punk in indie rock throwback the Cloud Nothings album attack on memory at number 27 one of my favorite mixtapes to come out of the south it's big crits forever in a day and coming in at for that 26 Action Bronson and The Alchemist with rare chandeliers a nice just boom bap II catchy exploitation film lyric referencing hiphop mixtape that freakin rules number 25 we are halfway through this thing with the new high on fire LP Denver nice mystery it's a really awesome sludge metal album I mean I think this is their darkest effort yet and one of their heaviest so far to this album is so pummeling and relentless oh it's almost hard for me to return to it because it's just so badass and just be sponging at number 24 a very very catchy and enjoyable set of indie electronic pop songs from I am am I Who am I with her debut full-length studio LP kin and 23 are really perplexing and challenging noise rock album from white Suns the album sin you this album really kind of came out of left field for me it's on load records I mean it is greeting it is abrasive strange and and uncompromising it's quite the trip at number 22 another very uncompromising album but in the punk rock and post hardcore category from Loma Prieta i/v and another band that embraced hardcore on their new LP converge with all we love we leave behind at number 21 we're at number 20 we're and in this spot is an extremely dark dancey and sexy album from Matthew dear oh beams man this this album gives me dance gasm it does it gives me dance gazans like I dance when the South was on and I just get like a and at number 19 the second full-length LP that this band dropped this year it's Death Grips with no love deep web I was maybe a little on the fence at first with the production choice that they made on this LP but as I listened to it more and more of course it ended up growing on me and I just really ended up liking it a lot now I'm just kind of sitting here excited for where the band goes next at number 18 it's an extremely long and ambitious progressive metal album hidden under a black metal veil it's the new crownless LP years past matter in a 17 a short album but in my opinion a very emotionally potent album from soap and skin narrow I mean I just love what this Austrian singer-songwriter brought to this handful of tracks I mean tracks that just and her voice I mean oh the end speaking of unique voices an album that I did review positively and it did actually end up growing on me very quickly and and maybe the delay partially had to do with how damned impenetrable this album is it just kind of goes back to what I've said in my review of this album this music is really for people who love to watch the world burn in at least a musical sense the new Scott Walker LP bish Bosch at number 15 it is the thoroughly enjoyable new spiritualize album with sweetheart sweet light lots of very gospel influenced garage rock and psychedelic rock tunes some of which are drawn out - very impressive lengths with lots of detail and emotion on top of it really liking this album a lot and number 14 it is killer Mike and LP coming together for a very unlikely pairing with awesome results on the LP rap music at 13 easily my favorite black metal album of this year knock misty and with silent machine 12 Billy woods with history will absolve me a really strange mysterious and hard-hitting hip hop album with a ton of tracks hitting upon numerous topics this dude has a very dark gritty ass personality while a lot of the songs on this album may not necessarily be catchy they are very challenging and unsettling and what's even more unsettling is our number 11 spot swans with the seer an album that to me felt kind of disjointed I actually thought it was more disjointed than soundtracks for the blind but now I actually kind of feel the reverse this album has grown on me quite a bit and what brings all these tracks together has become so much more apparent to me I mean it's just really one long twisted and very cohesive ride this album of the seer all of the seer I've seen you know I see it now I see it out at number 10 it's the new add solo album control system another album that grew on me a little bit more I love this LP love it I don't think absol is for everybody certainly his earlier output didn't resonate with me all too much but as an emcee as a lyricist I think he has a ton of personality and he really lives up to that label he puts into one of his hooks abstract asshole yeah on some songs he totally comes off as a prick others he's kind of thought-provoking and strange or just really not making much sense at all at number nine godspeed comes back with a vengeance on Alleluia don't bend ascend at number eight lots of very short painful powerful piano songs from perfume genius on put your back into it and at number seven bad bad not good just kind of breathes life into maybe what could become a new wave of jazz with BB ng to a lot of covers of hip hop songs and even some James Blake covers on this thing along with a handful of originals that are all just really cohesive well performed and very enjoyable at number six another jazz-influenced LP one that I loved and grew on me a little bit more I mean I loved it and I loved it more the new self-titled Portico quartet album I love that these guys have maintained their jazz style but have incorporated way more electronics into the picture and actually have started kind of improvising with all these sounds they have introduced into the recipe and it just has some amazing results it's not exactly hard-hitting or anything like that it's much more soft calming sort of mind massaging music I really find it terribly interesting at number five definitely easily no question hands down my favorite singer-songwriter LP this year Fiona Apple with the idler wheel I'm not gonna say the entire title Fiona really outdid herself on this LP and she did it without any major radio singles or anything like that I mean she just got to her weird roots and wrote a series of just really great painful catchy and and poetic songs that are just enjoyable to listen to again and again and again at number four my favorite rock album of this year don't bodies natural history damn these guys bring together that sludge metal that punk rock and they do it away that kind of feels like a caveman party hosted by Andrew W K with all these noisy guitar riffs and sort of funky weird strange noises and loops I love the grooves on this album the hooks the guitar leads are great as well I mean there's not a single thing I really hate about this album while it's not my favorite of this year there are very few things that I could say would make this better another album that needs very few if any improvements at all the new onda throw pika LP self-titled this huge ambitious multi musician Latin music project put together a great set of tracks that not only embrace the old world of Latin music but incorporate the new world of music out there as well bringing on elements of ska music reggae music hip hop - on some of these tracks to make a really multifaceted variety filled and just talent filled album with some great playing solos songwriting arranging - this is just one of those projects that came into play with a huge huge plan and just all those ambitions realized at number two another amazingly ambitious album but coming from these genre of hip-hop this time it's Kendrick Lamar good kid maad city great-great concept album coming from Kendrick well yeah section 80 did have a concept to it he really went above and beyond with making a concept album on this new LP and he did it with great beats great lyrics the songs had even more variety I love how he sort of has a different personality with almost every single track as you follow Kendrick through the story he's not just a narrator commenting on a bunch of different things he's an actor inside of these songs and the emotions that he writes down in his lyrics and plans to convey in these songs really come through and sir just goes to prove that Kendrick Lamar's not just a rapper he's not just a songwriter he is an actor in his songs as well and a very phenomenal one at bat number one number one I didn't want to say it how do you want to say it because then everything will be over I don't want it to be over I want it to last forever forever one of those your face wanna give you kisses Death Grips [Laughter] Death Grips the money store noisy tortured detailed the stomach-turning hip-hop brach industrial whatever the hell you want to call it it's a lot of different things gotta calm down kind of take it easy there's not much more I can say about this LP that I haven't already said in reviews comments lights of places I just see myself enjoying this album for its songwriting its aggression its uniqueness for a long time to come and that's pretty much my favorite 50 albums

5zhnhnespGA,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for yet another list in the midst of last week my favorite singles of 2012 this list consists of not just willy-nilly tracks that I've picked from albums that I've enjoyed throughout the year it is officially released singles and promotional tracks from albums that struck my fancy that's just my reasoning behind doing this list it's the same reasoning I use every year alright let's let's get into it [Music] yeah and number 50 Oh number fitty starting off with number 50 that's where you should start off um Grimes oblivion though I was not huge on the grindz album a lot of you know from my review oblivion is really catchy I mean it's the catchiest song on the entire LP I mean it makes me bounce around brings a smile to my face I do enjoy oblivion at number 49 one of the spunk eeeh Strax I've ever heard this band put together how do I know from here we go magic didn't really love that album all the way through either but that one track really stuck out to me at number 48 it's heavy drums ha horns great singing from the David Byrne and st. Vincent collaborative track whoo and at 47 the pop project rye with its single its hit single open hopefully hearing a little bit more from that project next year considering what has come out from it so far has been pretty freakin good and number 46 my favorite little B track that I heard all year that's right little B on this list I own swag and at 45 zebra cats with I'm a read another oddball rap song and talking of oddballs number from the vestal it's the single that are Stevie Moore did covering the vaccines post breakup sex a nice little loaf I take on the indie rock song that was catchy to begin with but now is just kind of fun weird eccentric and kechi on top of it with this new single we go dark on our number 43 spot with the anti single scott walker's epizootic s-- one of the weirdest songs i've heard all this year definitely not a single single but a single all the same and staying dark on our number 42 spot it is square pusher with dark steering yes Tom Jenkinson's like hey you know what I could totally fool with this dubstep thing and keep it square pusher he does and it's awesome at number 41 the incredibly moving it for first aid kit their hypnotic harmonized twin voices are just really at number 40 joint Orbison and vodka collaborate on the track mercy man I love the groove that this track hits toward the fish and at thirty nine nine it is Dirty Projectors with gun has no trigger not my favorite album from them but certainly a great single from it kind of a single that wasn't really all that hard-hitting to me at first but the melody on this thing really hooked me and in stayed stuck in my head and a 38 we stay with eccentric indie pop with the band alt-j breezeblocks and number 37 we have Danny Brown with the very personal grown-up at 36 Action Bronson with the cymbal hilarious track awesome hard-hitting great lead into his new mixtape and at 35 it's Joey badass and Capital steez set it right with survival tactics gritty hardcore New York hip hop from these really young kids who I'm hoping do some good things next year and number 34 the extremely badass and hard-hitting fertile green from the new high on fire LP and at 33 Veronica Falls comes back with another heart-melting semi wintery single my heart beats at number 32 coming off one of my favorite indie pop releases of this year it's wild nothing with the crack shadow I love the strings on this track they really add a lot of color make the track so poppy so catchy and at 31 UK singer-songwriter Michael Kiwanuka with with with the track home again an album that again didn't love all the way through but a standout single from it I think that this guy has a lot of chops and a lot of emotion as a singer-songwriter at number 30 we get even more emotive with the angel olson song the waiting a great track from her new LP halfway home and after that 29 I am in my omi with my favorite track from her new LP Goods 28 King cruel rock bottom this kid hoping he kills it in 2013 gets a full length album out there and this song is definitely proof of his potential I mean his voice is so deep and just emotive and energetic I love the rhythm guitar on this song the drumming the song hits a nice speedy pace rock bottom great track coming after that at 27 definitely one of the catchiest courses I've heard in a post-punk song in a while Holograms ABC city at 26 the blazing post-hardcore opening track two new converge LP aimless arrow man aimless arrow man I love Danny me I love those guitar intervals on that track and at 25 coming off the new lone LP crystal caverns 1991 the most electrified video game soundtrack song that you may hear this year at number 24 we had the hilarious catchy and playful magnetic fields with the song Andrew and drag and a 23 easily my favorite song off in the new Jessie where LP wildest moments number 22 is the first song I heard from this LP has an amazing sparse strange beat and a great feature from Rob Marciano it is Billy woods with the song body of work at number 21 we go deep dark and sexified on the new Mathew dear single see and at number 20 we're done with the 20 spots the soap and skin track voyage voyage from her LP narrow it's actually a cover but a wonderful and very mournfully interpreted cover at that at number 19 my favorite track off of the new Mars Volta LP Z and two knots I think one of the most explosive choruses that these guys have ever written and at 18 LP the full retard oh man yeah I know a lot of people are kind of busted up that I didn't pick the video for my videos list but this is just too good a single to not make it this high on the list I mean the vocal sample on that track in the future there's just nothing about this track that is an awesome catchy hard-hitting memorable here the band at number 17 has me extremely excited for future material thanks to this single Holy Ghost with it gets dark and at number 16 its Kendrick Lamar with swimming pools great track from his new LP what sort of seems to be like hmm is he going to go poppy with this album but then the whole concept came together the sections the vocals the storyline everything and I mean the song just ended up working and perfectly coming in after that at number 15 we have Sharon Van Etten with the song Leonard a wonderful track from her new LP again didn't love this album all the way through but proof of how awesome Sharon Van Etten can be I mean boils down to this track at number 14 we have a single from perfume genius the track hood maybe the most tear of joy King songs he's ever written off his new LP put your back into it and after that at 13 an amazing single sized come back from Conor Oberst and desaparecidos with the track back cell I mean a slap in the face to the music industry at number 12 we have Cloud Nothings with my favorite track off their new LP stay useless and coming in after that and number 11 the absol track featuring Danny Brown terrorist threats oh the flows on this track the message on this track just how crazy and nutty it is the beat the singing this tracks great from beginning to end to me I mean one of my favorites on his new LP and there are a lot of songs a lot of very good songs on control system via number 10 we are number 10 and sitting at number 10 is actually Frank Ocean with the track pyramid while I didn't love Frank's new album all the way through thought it was a little disjointed thought some songs paled in comparison to others this track to me is really in a place I hope he goes in the future not only is this song multifaceted it's very progressive and long for an R&B song but Frank's emotions here his energy I mean it's just a standout moment on this LP and for him to just kind of take a concept and really turn it into something this long and this detailed is very impressive I mean again something that I hope he delves into a little bit deeper on future releases at number 9 easily one of my favourite rock singles of this entire year dinosaur jr. watch the corners not only does this song have my favorite music video of the year but it's it's definitely one of my favorite dinosaur jr. songs hands down I mean J Mascis is guitar solo on this track great his vocals his lyrics the melody he's singing awesome the groove that he's playing when he sort of shifts in and out of that didn't he in the drum though I can go on and on about this track but fantastic song number nine number eight eight eight it's actually Fiona Apple with every single night love this track it's one of the best on her new LP I mean Fiona comes back with a vengeance on this album and proves herself to still be incredibly relevant creative I love her singing on this track I mean again another song I can go on and on about number seven it's owned a throw pika with the track punk garrow's Sony Darrow coming off one of those creative Latin music albums to drop this year yeah a Latin rhythm section to it but the guitar on this some of the effects it's so weird and psychedelic and off-kilter and yeah not only does this sort of weird ambience to it make it unique and interesting but the songwriting and the playing is really great as well I mean great song great album at number six easily one of the most moving hip hop songs I've heard in a while McLemore and Ryan Lewis with the track same love I mean an open embrace of someone coming from the hip hop community to people who are homosexual and yeah while the song is important from a sort of social perspective it is a great song I mean the storytelling is very personal it's very detailed it follows a very nice straightforward narrative the hook is amazing the instrumental is great especially the piano on this track mmm our number five track it's hard it's bubbly it's got a baby in it hits tonight with the track buggin off of their new EP love that track and after that comes the opener to the new killer Mike LP at number four big freaking beast yes not as meaningful as deepers political as Reagan and it doesn't really have that awesome beat change up that the song don't die as however I mean the verse from big bun on this the verse from t I compound that with an awesome southern style quirky ass beat from LP and just killer Mike coming in right from the get-go and killing it all these things make this my number four favorite track of 2011 coming in after that number three gorillas with do you thang featuring James Murphy and Andre 3000 and I don't mean a little radio edit version I'm talking about my third favorite track of the year is the long 13 minute version the epic 13 minute version of this song that's my favorite another long song comes in at number to spiritualize with hey Jane I mean awesome track I love it this new album of theirs really gets back to just that long experimental sort of just really drawn-out ambitious angle that some of the spans best albums aim for and here we are number one my number one favorite song of 2012 Death Grips the fever III I love the refrain on this song easily one of the catchiest keyboard riffs I've heard in a while I mean Zach Hill the drum programming on this track just the beat it's awesome all the sound effects all the noises it's just so hard hitting powerful MC ride does oh I was already tired more hours do it collectively if I just but you all together and that's it it's my whole list my favorite tracks of 2012 singles promo tracks whatever you want to call it now let's call it a day shall we what were your favorite tracks from this past year give me top 5 top 10 whatever and if your

n9zSSPCazBs,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd it's time for a list my favourite EPS of 2012 lalalalala hope you're well hope you're doing well damn it damn damn damn damn another video in the midst of lists week celebrating my favorite this year let's just get right past the BST please alright at number 15 my 15th favorite of this year Shalom OHS vacation EP Shalom oh electronic music producer came out with a full-length album last year that I thought was quite enjoyable worth mentioning one of my favorite albums of 2011 and this year for sure this EP had a few great songs on it that I liked it some really good remixes as well one from Nicolas jar - definitely a collection of tracks worth checking out if you're into subtle beat oriented electronic music he kind of took a little bit of a left turn incorporating elements of future garage and in a few of these tracks and it turned out pretty good at number 14 the self-titled shizune EP these guys are a Japanese post hardcore band and this EP of theirs is fiery passionate melodic loud energetic and enjoy hobli just making words up and number 13 the Kulpa d EP and EP from an electronic music producer who brings together elements of really speedy jittery footwork rhythms with african music there were actually some really stand out electronic music tracks on this EP it's out now an era broadcast check it out at number 12 it's Skrillex with bangarang I you know have been known to dabble in the brostep the dubstep the Wow while jittery lots of really bright flashy harmony lines coming in out of nowhere really kind of all over the place I know that you know a lot of people who watch my channel and just people who are underground and indie music fans in general have much hatred for Skrillex but I really don't even care and you know it's it's not that big of a deal and I will prove it to you oh I've listened to Skrillex forgive me Lord for I have listened to scribbles well alright at number eleven is this Danny Brown OD EP picture disc features tracks such as baseline wit Danny has spent a lot of time this pass you're not releasing any big projects but putting out a lot of weird excessive just very over-the-top party rap tracks with just a lot of vulgarity and he is just nastier than a lot of people could even hope to be I mean you know if you're competing in that Lane Danny is like already 500 miles ahead of you but the little collection of tracks instrumentals on the other side it's an enjoyable EP at number 10 tight little collection of post-punk tracks on the lower EP walk-on heads I really like all this awesome post-punk that's coming out of Denmark and Sweden right now I mean good stuff and we go hardcore punk on our number 9 spot the EP that the band certs a put out shortly after they dropped that tour EP that I reviewed very positively yeah look them up look them up at number 8 definitely my favorite hip hop EP this year a free EP a free P from shad Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness this EP just you know pretty much plays towards shad strength comedy a lot of just wit he's a very smart funny funny funny guy and good with lyrics too and he picks good instrumentals I mean he's got a fun-loving but thoughtful personality at number 7 another free P from the band revocation tetra drew drew drew tetra a touch and not Genesis how could anything that has that name not be good if you're looking for some hard fast meddle with a lot of personality I definitely wish I reviewed this bands 2011 album when I had the chance sorry and number six more metal with maybe one of the most ambitious projects I've heard from this band so far angle aux Faustian echoes EP a twenty one minute long song that really is worked into several different parts and is inspired by most there's a bit of a storyline kind of interjecting in the midst of all these sections in the song a lot of the melodies are very rich and straightforward and memorable like they usually are on Agalloch albums and it's a good project check it out number five daniel rossen of good is lee bare silent our Golden Mile yeah you know I wasn't really that huge on the grizzly bear album that came out this year but this EP is a nice little collection of tracks and showcases Daniels power as a songwriter I mean his voice his melodies and his guitar playing with nothing else accompanying it are just very masterful at number four the new death spell Omega EP drought man these guys mixed together there's so many extreme metal styles and they do it with just so much virtuosity and songwriting Power Man I mean you know even though this is just a short collection of tracks they are not throw aways I mean they are damn good songs good recording quality too and really showcases the speed and the detail and the brutality of this bands playing and number three our our second EP that was actually from 2011 on this list yeah the Skrillex EP is also from 2011 it came out just before Christmas I didn't move and this EP came out in 2011 too but I didn't actually listen to it until it's reassure earlier this year on jag jag you are the band box again it's actually in here than oxygen Oh take the kids off Broadway they actually have a full a new full-length album dropping in January these guys in a really awesome way sort of aerial pink like way mix together the sounds of bands like the kinks the animals Velvet Underground the Rolling Stones it's actually pretty awesome with some good songwriting too and lots of sonic and instrumental play you know really kind of working over some large choruses some organ playing two horns it actually kind of reminds me of artists like Richard Swift but with a little more ambition and eccentricity at number two burial kindred II PE I mean the this is some of his longest and most ambitious material yet I love the progression on these tracks I love the beats and how he kind of altered them subtly as the tracks were progressing on here the title track is great especially the ambient interludes on that song the dude just has a knack for not only rhythms but textures and soundscapes too and it really makes his very beat oriented songs not only you know kind of danceable but very beautiful to do and number one my favorite EP this year as if it wasn't already obvious with some people who watch my reviews on the regular tonight tonight' self-titled tonight tonight Hudson Mohawke and Lunas bring together some awesome beats on this EP and not only are they just bang and bang and bang and I mean bass heavy really strange and kind of unique when it comes to the samples and the sounds that are being used in these beats I mean the sound of like what I think is cars crashing babies cooing bubbles popping quick little vocal edits PJ PJ I just loved what these guys did on this EP for all five of the tracks yeah it's it's one dimensional a lot like that Skrillex EP but it's around for such a short amount of time that it's you know it's quick in-and-out it's like ooh BAM Oh awesome awesome awesome awesome we're done how tonight does on another EP or a full-length album that remains to be seen will cross that bridge when we get there there there there just shake your booty to it just just shake your booty to it just shake that booty and that's all you got to do that's all you got to do shake that booty alright that's the list that's list what were your favorite EPS of this past a year and shout out to poor Lily on their three songs EP that was pretty good too and yeah that's it that's a thank you for uh thank you for watching thank you for watching love you you're the best anthony Fantana eps forever 
z6nHxoqkFOI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a list of my top 25 favorite music videos of 2012 this is our inaugural video for my favorite favorite favorites list for this year we're going to talk about music videos next video EPS singles and then albums albums and yeah basically excited to do this entire list this is gonna be awesome just been a great year for the needle drop me I'm happy to have been making videos for this entire year for you guys and and yeah you know that's that's it psyched and OH Cal to chesta in honor of this past musical year this past year for the needle drop has volunteered to put together some kind of video montage of just like just this this past year I guy I guess so let's watch that okay stop stop the video stop the video stop stop this thing stop this thing stop it okay alright well properly mo numero uno this is just puppies this is this is just our puppies this is that's it so well the problem is my friend for the past three years none of the videos have been about puppies well maybe the channel is in need of a change maybe the channel doesn't need a change maybe you need to focus on a Chester here oh come now don't be that way come in good man command did you work hard on the list don't you want to tell the people the list I made to me in my 25 favorite video is my 25th favorite video of 2012 is Lauren's weigh me down this is a very interesting video featuring a lot of digital pixelized animation fitting the very moody electronic instrumental very well and kind of tells an interesting tale of not fitting in the box in a world of conformity it's good that's a good day see it's good yes my 24th favorite video is Action Bronson 's the symbol which is off of his new mixtape rare chandeliers it's one of those videos that comes along every so often where an artist embraces an exploitation film aesthetic and there's a lot of campy silly cartoony violence as well as Action Bronson tasting cocaine and saying that's delicious it's very comedic and Fitz action Bronson's personality perfectly that's wonderful okay you're good you're good you don't need you don't need I'll see you later all right thank you for helping me believe again my 23rd paper video of this year here we go Magic's hard to be close which the title of the track is actually a sort of funny and fits in perfectly with the theme of the video which is about three guys getting stuck in an elevator for what seems like many many years but at the end of it it sort of you know watch it my 22nd favorite video of this year title fights secret society this video is certainly a lesson never break a little girl's heart even inadvertently the results will be bloody my 20th favorite video of this year with no question it is Krispy Kremes the baddest not only was this pretty much the video that launched the comedic rapper Krispy Kreme to where he is today but I mean it is just an amazing piece of visual hilarity with lots of gun pointing and boogers it's it's great if you have some kind of phobia of cats surrounding you and lip-syncing to lyrics then my 19th favorite video will give you nightmares Orbital's wonky my 18th favorite video is a strange little dance between the two main characters of this new album that they kind of created together st. Vincent and David Byrne who my 17th favorite video is an interesting effect sort of using a double camera taking the footage melding them and you know having them in the middle and sort of conjoining them and having some really interesting you know off-kilter video footage because of that JJ doom governor it's so funny how a neat little trick kind of makes an entire video pretty interesting my sixteenth favorite video the number ten film from the ziggurats film experiment project where they sort of gave many people a small sum of money to create video for various songs off of their new LP actually we'd love to give a shout out to that entire project because this is not the only good video from that project this is my favorite from the project featuring a man kind of wandering through the woods he comes across a Fox friend that Fox friend sadly passes away but yes do look up that entire cigarette filled experiment project there are a lot of interesting videos in there to say the least LeBouf dong number 15 and my favorite videos of 2012 is easily zebra cats I'm a read with Ongina red fox god I love this video the first time I ever saw it first thing that popped in my head what is this crap however after having watched it numerous times after that initially being intrigued by its badness I guess but then kind of being sucked in by just how strange and eerie and minimal it is this song and the video to me I mean are just really a pair my number 14 favorite video of this year is the Darwin DS video for the track free hoping that this dudes next album will be good but I really do like this video it's a funny set of like double triple quadruple takes on a certain situation it's sort of like this one occurrence happens but you're seeing multiple sections of it play out over and over and over in different ways and it's got some really nice and interesting editing tricks in it too that I like my number 13 favorite video of this year vitalic stamina definitely one of the strangest videos I've seen this year kind of details the exploits of a detective sort of trying to solve crime I guess of this sort of fantasy weight-loss drug that maybe in fact does the opposite and kills people it's it's kind of weird and intense my number 12 favorite video this year Fiona Apple every single night while at first glance this video may seem like a random barrage just you know sort of footage and shots from just a whole slew of different things they all connect in very strange and subtle ways that once you watch the video again and again and again and once it all kind of hits you with like oh that's you know all kind of weird at number 11 I'm putting all J something good which is to me the most immaculate video that they put out all year just puts visuals - the very slow dramatic and man really romantic death of a bullfighter and the very end where you're sort of seeing the bull through that hole you know what I'm talking about if you've seen it you see the bolt through the hole it's eerie and number 10 Cloud Nothings fall in this is a very funny and just you know exciting to watch video where the band the director that they work with is kind of making a play on you know sort of those old 50's black-and-white synchronized swimming sessions where you have all the ladies and sort of rubber head caps and they're diving in unison it's it's a really creative take on this you know motif at number nine Danny Brown Krone up I loved seeing this little kid sort of play Danny Brown tear it up sort of go through the emotions of sort of showing hypothetically how Danny kind of lost his tooth and this kid just like man he was a firecracker in this video he had a ton of energy and personality I mean he just mimicked Danny's motions and energy perfectly on this video I loved it at number eight Square pusher dark steering this is a beautiful video I mean just a really dark piece of eye candy I love the way the camera zooms in and out of focus I love Tom Jenkinson the helmet the backdrop of lights it's like a giant epic monolithic light bright that is of doom light bright of doom not only does this next video get number seven but also wins the superlative for most cardboard used out of the entire twenty five lush life's main alia this is a hip-hop song and many many many many of the words in this song were cut out in giant cardboard figures that are just sort of shown throughout the track on people's heads sort of floating and flying down from the sky it's pretty awesome the effort the the physical you know crafting all this cardboard physical effort that went into making this video and it really paid off into something impressive at number six this is the only band to show up twice on this list Cloud Nothings again with the track no future no past I mean just one of these videos that for some people it's gonna be boring it's going to be uneventful but for me it was intense it was dramatic to see this guy sort of floating on his back over all this kind of terrain throughout the song and such a long song to and seeing him get progressively more worried and just upset just sort of not knowing what's going on and then toward the very end to see you know that image at the very closing of the video chillin at number five my fifth favorite video here the very excessive violent and kind of hilarious big beast from killer Mike LP is awesome in that video the chasing is great the part where he is in the convenience store and he's sort of you know ends up being the good guy and saving the day though there are points or it seems kind of disjointed and the the sort of zombie strippers toward the end are just like this kind of seems like thrown on top even though it is a little all over the place it is hilarious and just fun to watch again eye candy another piece of eye candy a beautiful piece of animation but coming from another angle Flying Lotus putted boy strut actually one of my favorite videos of last year was a Flying Lotus video to also add fantastic computer animation this is like a series of little robots kind of running around eating each other growing shrinking breaking flying doing all sorts of crazy crap and it's just kind of mesmerizing to see what all of these little itty-bitty machines do all over this short video I mean I just love the detail in this video it's just awe-inspiring the animation on this short film number three I mean my interest in this video the reason I praised it really and maybe it comes from a sick place maybe there's something horribly wrong with me watch the video if you're yet to see it and decide that for yourself but liars brats I mean in the short span of time that this video that it was on it just completely ruined any childhood emotions I had toward Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd I mean you there's essentially a part where you're seeing these computer-generated characters of these characters doing some pretty absurd and and vile stuff my second favorite video of this year one of the longest and most epic videos to be released this year spiritualize hey Jane I freaking love this video it's a very abrasive video I mean it's not like you know it's not just like blood and gore it's not like gonna make your stomach turn or anything like that but it is racy and deals in some very deep sexual and familial issues so yeah and my number one favorite video of this year just without question is actually dinosaur Junior's watch the corners not only is this one of my favorite rock songs of this year and the video features Tim Heidecker Tim and Eric though I do love Tim and Eric I don't really feel like this plays that large of a role for me in this video because it's not like Tim is playing this comedic or silly or funny role I mean he actually is one of the more serious characters in this video I mean for me what I love about this video is the concept this girl falls in love with this guy at this job where she's working at the grocery store and his face is sort of blurred out like you're watching like a cop TV show or something like that and someone didn't sign the release after the episode so they had to blur their face out and you know at first I wasn't exactly sure why this guy's face is blurred out but as the video progresses the concept becomes kind of clear and as they get sir more blurs you're gonna see it when you watch this video it's an interesting concept and when it finally hit me I was like oh that's actually pretty awesome so yeah I mean the the cinematography is good that acting is great but you know just that that concept with the blurs on the faces actually mean have it becomes apparent has the video moves that's what really kind of got me hooked into this video and got me watching it again and again and made me really enjoy it just the most out of any video that I had seen this year let me know what you thought of this list what were some of your favorite music videos from this past year what would you remember what was your number two boys our number three four five feel free to put your list in the comments I will look and and that's it and that's it man first first video yes 2012 yeah thanks for watching Anthony Fantana videos favorites forever 
tXGSh8nk2b4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review miguel kaleidoscope dream oh wow wow wow thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you stop it stop stop stop stop Miguel is a California R&B singer-songwriter and guitarist and this is his sophomore full-length album would where he has undergone a pretty significant overhaul of his image and musical style though Miguel's first full-length official commercial release came out in 2010 I mean he's been making music and has been kind of buzzing around the industry for a little bit longer than that one of his first big music video singles get your hands up came out years ago where he was kind of playing toward a lot of commercial R&B sounds and messages he kind of did this the same for me on his debut LP as well with songs like pay me and to the moon tracks that to me had a really kind of typical feel to them it wasn't really an album that resonated with with me all that much even though the song quickie is actually pretty cute however even though Miguel has dabbled in the commercial side of contemporary R&B there has always been kind of artful undertones to what he's doing I guess he also had the mischief mixtape which was definitely a little more out of the box than his debut he's also made guest appearances with blue his other project Johnson & Johnson and he was actually on below the heavens too so there's clearly this side of his persona where he is willing to walk a less commercial path and now with this new wave of artists coming through kind of diversifying the world of R&B like how to dress well and weakened Jesse we're as well as the satisfaction and especially Frank Ocean there's definitely a much larger fan base out there right now for R & B alternatives and I'm sure being a music fan Miguel is conscious of that as well as being an artist and wanting to experiment and take artistic control of his projects and the will to do those things is actually resulted in making kaleidoscope dream a pretty interesting contemporary R&B album kind of a futuristic hybrid of R&B along with elements of hip-hop electronic music funk and rock and even though it wasn't totally floored by this album as a whole I do actually think it does have some great songs on it and a nice style to it too plus Miguel is a pretty great singer I actually loved a lot of the lead melodies and the course is on this LP there are moments on here with the vocal melodies especially on a song like do you are just heart melting I love the fat bass line on that track it syncs up with the kicks from the bass drum perfectly and I really dig the fact that Miguel adds some guitar into that track along with some other songs on here too it really does bring a different flavor than one would usually hear in a new R&B record it's not just an extra instrument their tracks on here where the guitar really feels like it is the foundation of the song to continue through tracks their moments on here like the song use me I mean easily one of the sexiest R&B songs I've heard this year the sock is actually kind of kinky I love how they're elements in the lyrics that you know refer to degrading the person you know singing the song the the person who's narrating this story but it also kind of goes into the dynamics of that relationship to kind of have someone use you and sort of give yourself to that person physically it involves some trust like is kind of said in the lyrics doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo it's a catchy little melody and I love the track don't look back to it explodes on the hook one of the more climactic songs on this entire LP glossy scents that are just very heavy with atmosphere all over the course there Miguel definitely has production at some points on this LP that's more ethereal or maybe even psychedelic than some other R&B artists but still now that I'm kind of talking about the sound I feel like this atmosphere is sort of a double-edged sword while it does bring Miguel a kind of unique quality to a lot of the songs on this LP I can't help but feel like the sound is slightly off with much of this album I'm not really finding like a lot of brightness on these tracks just not a lot of sonic brightness these tracks to me are consistently cloudy and kind of muddy and dampened a lot of the instrumentals on here feel really Hollow it's not like there's a lot of beef to them I guess for example the opening track on your adorned a great song and a track that is well deserving of its Grammy nomination but to me the instrumental especially in the synth department is kind of underwhelming everything feels really buried and back behind the beat which isn't even really that loud to begin with and Miguel to me his voices is a little too obscured on that track for me to feel maybe as moved as I should be there's not really a lot of contrast in the beat - as the song progresses and there are a lot of parts to this song but sonically it all kind of feels Sammy Sammy I guess that's not even really the best example for me the title track on here the bass line to me while it's very kind of poppy and has a nice groove to it and is really up front actually reminds me of like the bass line from Eminem Slim Shady track there's like this string slash synth interlude that pops up toward the bridge and as soon as it rushes in it just feels like nothing it feels like nothing is coming through it's just so damp and just so kind of lifeless you know overall I did like this album I feel like it's got personality Miguel writes songs with a very strong sense of melody and he can be pretty funny too like on tracks like  his mine and he brings variety across these tracks as well the song arching point there's a very strong like 80s rock vibe to that song coming through with the guitar and the singing and the song where's the fun and forever as well as the end of the second track on here they both feature melodies that have just really strong psychedelic pop feels to them but again consistently the instrumentals that put action on this thing feels so opaque to me and it really kind of keeps these songs from having the the emotional rush to me that I feel like they should it's just not very exciting for me to listen to this album because the instrumentation feels so flat so I'm kind of feeling like a strong six on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan Oh Miguel forever [Music] [Music] 
bUCxHEPzjmE,hi everyone my needle traps Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comment thing kind of a reaction to a message that somebody sent me on YouTube actually it's a question that I've gotten before asking me how long do I ever go without listening to music honestly because of what I'm doing here and just the consistent and just the consistency with which I have to listen to albums in order to you know do reviews on them on a regular basis I don't really have you know much of an option to be like no I will not be listening to any music today plus I mean you know even if I didn't have to review an album I'd most likely be playing some vinyl or something like that so I mean you know personally no I don't ever really get tired of listening to music I don't really ever go that long without listening to it but even if I wanted to could I possibly because I mean music was the thing that a long time ago if you wanted to hear it you had to go out and listen to someone performing it either singing it or playing an instrument or a full band or something like that whereas these days music is just so ubiquitous I mean music is pumped out of speakers and restaurants and stores it's playing out of car windows as you're walking by on the street TV and radio are filled with music even on non-commercial music stations whether it's in jingles or just in bumpers or theme music music is embedded into numerous websites loaded on to many more basically what I'd like to know is how often do you come into contact with music every day when you really think about it when it comes down to those points where you're voluntarily you know subjecting yourself to some music or when you're just kind of running into it when you go out or you're surfing the internet where you're just around the house would even be possible to completely avoid music in your everyday life without making some kind of huge change like I don't know moving out to some kind of desolate wilderness area and living in a cave where hopefully you can find complete silence and it also kind of begs the question is it a good thing to be bombarded with something so often and that's all I want to know thank you for watching do the best lists coming soon I love you brother 
9F0z05m0oM0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review POS we don't even live here POS is a producer and eclectic rapper from Minnesota he is several full-length albums deep this is his latest and over the years POS has kind of become one of hip-hop's best-kept secrets this dude spits a lot of well written conscious lyrics with anarchist undertones the storytelling is usually pretty good sometimes coming from a very personal angle dealing with his philosophy on life or experiences when he was younger and he has some creative beat choices too on his albums he's not afraid to hop on a track that has a strong rock flavor or a strong electronic music flavor or a beat that is as skeletal as the instrumental on the track de la soul's which just kind of sounds like a sample of an upright bass with a little bit of rhythm he's also not afraid to directly reference and sample punk music as well like on the track Savion Glover from his last album never better I mean he takes a lyric and a song samples straight from a Fugazi track on that song now POS has been pretty successful in his solo LP zan ever-better has easily been his biggest most popular project so far but all the collaboration and different musical projects is also kind of spread the students name around as well like the rock band building better bombs where he is the lead vocalist and guitar player for the group also letting his vocals to the pop soul outfit games and of course he founded the alternative hip hop supergroup known as doom tree that actually had an album release last year as well no kings and he is not afraid to put interesting feature credits on his albums as well Craig Finn of The Hold Steady appears on one of his full lengths lending vocals and even on this new LP he invites Justin Vernon Bon Iver on for a hook to sing with an auto-tuned voice of course there are regular features on POS albums like astronauta lists a lot of his doom tree cohorts too and some of the production credits on this LP are interesting as well Andrew Dawson who has done production work for guys like little Wayne Kanye and Jay Z shows up on here as well as artists like Boys Noize and laser break both of them bring some pretty distorted buzzed out hard-hitting electronic instrumentals and as far as POS goes lyrically and his personality wise he still brings that same restless feel to his lyrics and his messages however overall I don't feel myself enjoying this album nearly as much as I did never better that LP was a pretty great accomplishment 16 full tracks with a series of different stories and emotions and instrumental flavors the slightly rough presentation and recording made it kind of gritty all the variety was just really surprising the album was as eclectic as him whether it comes to the very smooth and racially charged out of category or these somewhat brighter and kind of pots and pans sound in the production on the track optimist on we don't even live here I feel like I'm getting roughly the same angle from POS once again but it's kind of groomed and and simplified maybe for like a wider appeal the track bumper is a pretty good opener got me excited for what was to come I love the really driving drumbeat it feels like a rock song just like kicking off a rock show with a huge anthem or something like that there are these just squawking synthesizer phrases soaring over this beat calling out like a siren just kind of some call to arms it felt familiar like I had heard him do this before but kind of in a good way it felt like a bigger take on the sounds that I usually hear coming from POS however the rest of the LP doesn't really bring the the message or the sound or the sonic attitude that I guess I was hoping for the track your stuff is fun it's catchy but it doesn't really bring much more to the table other than random acts of violence I mean some of the lyrics and the title would lead me to feel as if I was listening some kind of anti materialism song it's kind of like I'm mad break things but still 10 points for the christopher hitchens reverence and the track how we land is I mean just straight up it's it's a pop song with a pop hook with Bon Iver singing on the track that's a very haphazard auto tuning and the way that his melody resolves toward the end of the hook that he's singing sounds exactly like something off of my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy sounds exactly like that and the only thing about the song I really do love is is his rapping he's a very sincere emcee a very thought-provoking emcee and he does get me thinking but I can't help but think about an album like I don't know Lupe Fiasco's lasers it just kind of feels like I'm hearing this revolutionary interesting speak but the sounds are nowhere near as interesting I mean for me this beat in this hook could be flipped into a number of different commercial pop songs again POS brings an awesome message on the track they can't come to me it feels kind of like a self-portrait of his popularity his underground status also his philosophy his perception of the world around him but it all just kind of feels cheapened by this very light bland middle-of-the-road beat another example the song weird friends where I love the line where he says we're into weird me and my friends we disappear when the lights hit but the beat in the hook on this track with the loud blaring electronics it's just obnoxious it's just some really weak break beat electronic music and again I mean POS continues to rap over hip hop instrumentals that are not typically considered hip hop instrumentals I commend him for that you know but just the instrumental itself does not appeal this album is a verbal renegade but just not an instrumental one there are some spots on here like the track get down which you know our poppy are catchy in some respects kind of a club tune it definitely does not bring the young black terror attack that POS spits out in the lyrics but him and Mike on that track and the fact that the beat has a good groove does make it catchy does make it enjoyable but it's just not a reflection of just the unique and kind of uncompromising personality that I usually get from this guy overall this album to me feels less personal it feels more out sourced in terms of instrumentals and I'm sure some fans are going to appreciate the evolution appreciate the change I just didn't like it that much I mean still lyrically personality-wise I think this dude is here there's no reason for me to not want to check out his next record the lot of the beats are just lost on me with this one I'm actually feeling a strong five to a light six on this if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana POS forever 
rJLVNSw3hDU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the self-titled roomful of teeth album this is a really interesting project slash vocal group that involves eight different vocalists one director Brad wells and about two dozen different singing experts and composers coming together to all make the music on this LP happen and these singing experts that I mentioned come in and help fine-tune techniques of certain singing styles to bring some real variety to this album everything from more theatrical operatic stage singing to Tuvan throat singing and yodeling there are some moments here and there on this LP where room full of teeth does kind of sound like you know a regular choral group but they are completely open to making lots of weird percussive noises with their mouths or with their breaths they'll sort of break out into busy stints of talking to kind of bring another dynamic to a track or going to really gruffer or noisy vocal freak-outs - I mean the whole concept of this album on paper just kind of sounds like some you know chorus kids wet dream however I do feel personally that room full of teeth does have an appeal beyond that because they are musically just in general pretty experimental out there adventurous and just fun to listen to however I do feel like that dependence on vocals that this LP has can't kind of be you know a speed bump for some people because I'm sure there are individuals who maybe don't want to listen to nothing but singing for over an hour straight listening to any single instrument for that long for a lot of people I'm sure can kind of be a drag however I do think on these tracks on this album roomful of teeth does a great job of displaying the power and and the versatility of the human voice their earners I mean some of the deep bassy lows and extreme highs that these people hit with their voices as well as some of the throat singing noises that are displayed on these tracks sound so otherworldly it doesn't even feel like I'm listening to a voice and especially when they're taking some of these throaty or singing sounds and making a drone or making kind of a nice repetition with them it becomes kind of hypnotic or even when they're saying like a lyric or just kind of a phrase and repeating it kind of chanting it it becomes sort of chilling or cultish there are some lyrics here and there on this LP a lot of these tracks are based mostly on just you know singing but but lyrics do come into play imagery of of rotting fruit or an angry ocean or a particular moment that grabs me really moves me is this lyrical spot where you hear the line son over and over there is no subtlety and death it's like a hurricane that moment in the song particularly is really powerful it's heavy it's overwhelming not terms I would normally apply to a choral group the very skillfully executed vocal styles on this LP along with the pretty detailed compositions are just a great pairing for some of the abstract imagery that these words bring to the table and I do find it pretty interesting that the lyrics do sometimes circle back around to subjects like death or geometry I think there's some talk of like points and sides and things of that nature and there are some real stylistic differences between these tracks too it's not just one consistent flavor throughout the entire thing the third track on here along with the song quiz Sasha they both feel distinctly foreign the last of those two has really manic manic chanting on it and it's actually a track on this LP that is composed by merrill Garbus of all people from tune-yards there's some more chill down moments on this LP like the song know where you do kind of actually get a repetition of the word know in the background behind some more operatic vocals atop and these chants of no no in the back actually become very entrancing the same goes for all the humming and number three of the four pieces piece the humming pops up all around the mix panoramic Lee in a way that's disorienting but kind of calming too there were some other ideas and song concepts on this LP that really impressed me too I like the story that was being told on the track the orchard which kind of seemed to be about taking this tree and stripping it of everything that you could possibly use it for it to the point where maybe it's destroyed the vocals on that track seem so dramatic and and theatrical if I don't have some gripes with this LP there are some compositions that feel a bit simpler or a little more tame than others the differences between the way each track is composed among you know all the composers that are brought into this album to make it work these stylistic differences are very apparent for the most part like the track know which does kind of have this operatic vocal and the song sort of seems to thrive just for that with some pretty simple vocal accompanying the same goes for the eighth track on here which just kind of seems to be a yodel style song with some very simple singing in the background I wish the arrangements the vocal arrangements around this lead vocal were just a little bit more ambitious and some of the lead vocals themselves like on the twelfth track here can feel a little too studied you know not as a motive as moments like the orchard and you know the few talking spots on here where you do have everybody in the group kind of but I know that they didn't really do much for me kind of took me out of the mood of the song it didn't seem so weird or gripping or out there that it really moved me or had me interested but that's that just this is my take there are musical elements in here that I think could be enjoyed by people who are tune-yards fans or Owen Pallett fans or even Dirty Projectors fans overall I think this album is just produced and recorded extremely well it doesn't seem to be edited too heavily for the most part what I am hearing on this album seems like it could easily be performed live by this eighth person group it was a really adventurous unique in his bold and again fun album to listen to feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana room full of teeth forever 
DtTUPKKeU8c,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review dragged into sunlight Widowmaker my needle drops dragged into sunlight is a UK metal outfit that has been turning heads since the initial release and vinyl re-release of their LP hatred for mankind it's very powerful album originally released in 2009 and it is a very heavy album it's a very real album it's a very tangible album as tangible as the guts in your stomach on the cell PU Everly pummelling Death Metal double bass drums as well as some Tom playing that is mixed really really high with some extra bass on it so when these times do get hit there's a bit of Rumble behind them and on top of that you have a lot of grimy ass riffs caked in dry blood over this and very nasty disgusting vocals along with some pretty memorable guitar leads and there are some spots some surprises like some pretty clean chorus vocals on the track i aurora this album breaks your bones and beats your soul really with a pretty nice combination of sludge metal doom metal some death metal as well I would say these guys take a bit of influence from nearly every extreme metal style to just make this very grim portrayal of Sonic ugliness the band is finally back with a sophomore full-length LP they are once again on prosthetic records in this new LP of theirs Widowmaker consists of only three songs all of them long lasting 15 minutes about 12 minutes 13 minutes not that much longer than some of the tracks from their last full-length LP but still it's a bit of a different angle for the band to be relying simply on their longer songs and kind of delivering all these tracks like one full three part piece and that is not the only way dragged into sunlight is kind of broadening their horizons on this album the opening track which is the longest on here is not even remotely as abrasive as anything on the band's last album and intentionally so this track is actually a very open spacious dismal and and barren guitar piece with some extra noises and effects very quietly orbiting these guitar chords it's a very tortured chord progression and eventually some piano actually comes into play adding a little bit more texture to the recipe and the song overall really plods along during these 15 minutes it could have used a bit more progression a bit more some highs and lows the song especially meanders around the point when the violin eventually pops in still I actually think the music perfectly depicts the very kind of negative outlook that dragged into sunlights music usually has it took a little bit but the intro eventually kind of grew on me and I think the idea of doing an introductory track like this is a great idea some of my favorite extreme metal albums actually incorporate quieter moments and interludes or even Fulk just to kind of bring some dynamics to the table the next two tracks on this LP though are pretty much business as usual for dragged into sunlight but this time around there's definitely kind of a newfound clarity to this recording that dragon of sunlight is working with which could be kind of a double-edged sword on this album I think it's taken away just a little bit of flavor from dragged into sunlight style but now there's actually kind of room for dynamics and subtleties on these songs like the violin on track one actually weaves itself into some pretty nasty grimy riffs on the second track too and I liked it on this album the band is sounding a little thicker a little heavier and bacey are not just noisier and the drums are now kind of mixed in a place that makes sense and while this track is OK I wish it hit some of the top speeds and some of the intense moments that were on Dragon sunlights last howl it really would have broken up the the sameness of all these mid-paced and very slow and riffs especially since musically a lot of them feel so similar now another thing I didn't really call me with this LP it's really my least favorite thing when it comes to dragging them to sunlights music it's something that I hope would have changed on this LP their use of vocal samples whether it be before their songs or kind of laced into the middle of them while there are artists that I think use vocal samples like this in a really interesting and kind of creative way the books or Godspeed You black emperor this to me just kind of feels lazy I'm just kind of hearing this vocal sample thrown over a riff and they just kind of rock it out for a little bit while this vocal sample plays and it just doesn't really sound good or interesting it's not like they're playing to the sample it just takes me out of the mood of the song no matter how sadistic or sick or poignant the band thinks what is on that tape recording is now the third part on this LP the closing track is even slower than the second song with these endlessly drawn-out just apocalyptic riffs and these riffs do build up to a pretty nice heavy explosion something I was really looking for a climax and there's some nice Tony Iommi ask well I love how that's thrown in there but yet again on this track there's another very underwhelming guitar interlude before the band comes in once again and and kind of crushes it there's not really all that many surprises on on this track having already heard the second track however I do really like be very twisted and dissonant and sour guitar leads layered over one another toward the end of this track a really gruesome part of this song that really stuck out to me overall there are plenty of things on this LP that I think are more commendable for dragged into sunlight there are more musical flavors there's more variety however I don't really think the band brought the energy the intensity and just the tension and the riff writing that they had on their last LP still I liked what this album had to offer and I look forward to what they're doing next I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this album if you've given a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana dragged into sunlight forever 
yGrlhEmZZVc,"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Scott Walker pish-posh it's it's hardly the time or place for that Scott Walker is a singer-songwriter who's easily had one of the most interesting trajectories in modern music the man has thrived in numerous musical decades sometimes not so successfully or artfully but still thrived all the same in the late 50s scott Walker's younger self sang upon a lot of teen pop and surf rock singles but in the mid to late 60's he really made a name for himself in the world of lavishly produced baroque pop with a lot of solo singles some album releases with his trio the Walker brothers as well as for cult classic full-length albums Scott one through four and these four LPS of Scott's are pretty impressive achievements in terms of baroque pop instrumental II they are very explosive and emotive and also refined the production stayed crisp and clean and then awesome thanks to Scotts sticking with John Franz as a producer and the arrangement stayed very consistent and ambitious thanks to guest arrangers like Wally's stop Peter Knight and red guest of course Scott singing also made these albums great his baritone voice really had a lot of power and personality behind it and Scott had a hand in picking some great songs to sing on these LPS as well across these four full-length albums Scott covered an albums worth of Jacques Brel songs but after the release of Scott for came the 70s and the musical landscape was shifting this was not a particularly pretty time for Walker this decade brought on an extremely commercial set of soft pop adult contemporary and pop albums his lack of success in the music industry around this time actually even forced him to get back together with the Walker brothers who were kind of on hiatus since 1968 but they eventually broke up finally in 1978 however before the trio broke up they actually released a somewhat experimental album titled night flights which was actually surprisingly out there for the Walker brothers embracing elements of New Wave as well as our pop the track from the album shout out is very fast and danceable with some fiery guitar playing the beat on that track and just the the speed of it reminds me so much of something the Talking Heads would do on an album like fear of music and another track off of this LP the electrician is just like in a lot of ways the baroque pop that the Walker brothers used to toy with but so much more twisted and shadowy with Scott Walker's vocals actually sounding kind of insane over this very heavy and an orchestral instrumentation Scott Walker was still active musically but his output dissipated a little bit his next big full-length solo album was climate of Hunter that came out in 1984 and it was kind of an art pop LP weakened by a bit of a t chic however this LP still marked a moment of artistic freedom for Walker and was an essential stepping stone to the much more experimental stuff he would be putting out in the future which brings me to Walker's 1995 album til at this point this is when Walker started releasing big full-length solo albums in in like decade-long spurts he had other projects like some soundtracks that he had worked on but these solo albums looms this album tilt is is a uniquely dark LP on this album Scott's baritone vocal is is noticeably aged but still emotionally powerful and on this track scott sings over an array of different sounds that that would probably be a surprise to fans of Scotts baroque pop stuff scott sings over some really dark moody string arrangements some noisy and dissonant art passages as well as some drones and then dark ambient soundscapes Scott went even deeper down this rabbit hole in 2006 with the LP the drift where he experiments with a bit more noise a bit more repetition like on tracks such as cue and the vocal sound even more aged kind of actually strained in a sense but purposely so the Scott would sound like he's a ghost haunting his own music Scott's past two full-length solo LPS have really put him on a path to strangeness and this new album bish Bosch it's the first time in decades he has put out an album within this ten-year gap that has been separating a lot of his LPS and you know just let me say right off the bat to kind of intro talking about this album it is bottom line straightforward strange it's stumped there's so much so that I was actually kind of left standing in awe of its senseless confusion for for much of its hour-long length let me say before I continue it seems that no matter how disjointed or senseless and album seems someone will always come out of the woodwork to say it means something oh it means abcdefg it means all these things here are all these deeper meaning filled meanings but seriously no joke I'm telling you Lou Reed is a more coherent lyricist on Lulu after listening to this LP I actually wanted to kind of sit back relax and have a nice chilled out listen to trout mask replica oh this is unsettling kind of shock value let's try all these things kind of music for people who want to just kind of watch the world hmm and Walker certainly sets the world ablaze and dances all on top of the ashes when it's done burning out and he rubs them all over himself sexily as he prances about this LP is filled with a lot of very profane and and odd lyrics about genitals and blowing up bullfrogs with straws protein eyes eyes falling out of their eye sockets and dangling on the face again there's just a lot of shock value to these tracks yeah it's not always gory yeah it's not always completely incoherent for sure all the songs on this LP are uniformly dismal it's kind of easy to see that there are some common threads that bring all these tracks together on bish Bosch but this is clearly an LP that triumphs through difficulty and inaccessibility I think when this album actually gets great and interesting is when it creates some weird hybrids and clashes and mishmash 'as of different musical sounds and styles that you wouldn't really find together and yet despite throwing all these flavors in together at once it all ends up sounding pretty dark and actually nasty even though Scott Walker may throw a land rhythm into a track with no warning whatsoever it doesn't necessarily change the whole mood of the thing it still stays because on this LP you have Scott Walker's aged croon some heavy distorted metal guitar riffing heavy strings drums that I think may sometimes be acoustic and played live but a lot of times electric sequenced some sharp organ along with the sound of knives sharpening dogs barking Christmas bells jingle jangling some Airy drones as well acoustic guitar ukulele however I wouldn't just call this album pure randomness it's not just insane unpredictable masturbating there are a lot of spots that actually do come off as pretty intense and meticulously crafted like the rock drum groove and the dissonant guitar and the really quick speedy bassline on the track phrasing toward the end along with the mantra whose true life any heavy blood-curdling strings during the first movement of the track sir , a flagpole sitter which is the album's longest track standing at 21 minutes the moment in the track at 6:45 where Scott Walker's like screaming at the top of his lungs with this weird chorus effect on his voice it's really just Oh chilling it does something in here to me that makes everything shake and feel really weird it's it's a it's a climax I guess you could say from reeking gonads to a shrunken face to Greeks King bears to Roman numerals to greasing poles this track is just one weird thrill after another something I'm not sure I would admit I like publicly if I were not doing a review and even if I would admit it it would certainly be a long time listening another track that stands out to me is these songs the track has these weird sequence drums along with some drones that kind of get repeated and switched out with this weird MIDI horns and phrase it switches back and forth you see things kind of repeating throughout the track and it brings the song some congruence though still it is pretty strange and the spot toward the end of the track where Scott Walker's singing take that accidentally in the bulks who is just hilarious and the thing is you know should it be hilarious you know I don't know there's the there is truly no handbook for enjoying an album like this it kind of is what you make of it either you have the wherewithal to stand it and the sick curiosity to keep you kind of enthralled with it or you don't if I do have a complaint about this LP there were songs on this album that I felt didn't really come off as that chilling or that shocking or perplexing they either did not overwhelm or have much of an element of surprise when I first heard them or they kind of lost that as I listened to this album more and more and more like the track dimple which is atmospheric but kind of uneventful or the opening track on here which does have some twisted sounds on it but is a little too repetitive for four minutes and the track pilgrim which does have some weird and some strange percussive loops but it's a little too short and underdeveloped to really kind of catch my ears in the midst of all these kind of heavy and strange Giants looming around it to put it simply I would say that this album is not something that you would traditionally enjoy and if you don't like it I don't blame you because it's it's not a very appealing album and purposely so however I didn't really find it to be that unappealing I guess you could say when it comes to freak shows it's not the freakiest of them all because there were good handful of tracks on this album where I kind of laid sort of unaffected by what was going on on the song and overall while this LP is pretty well recorded and there were some musical moments especially the rushes of strings in the second track that I thought were pretty awesome I feel like I'm basing my enjoyment of this album mostly on just simply its its weirdness which I think can be kind of a double-edged sword depending on how much of it you use when you go into making a piece of music I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh pish-posh forever [Music] "
hnUlcgPPjbc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the all rare occasion of a list of my top favorite 10 favorite top 10 favorite Rage Against the Machine songs ever this past month was the year anniversary of this band's debut full-length album and in honor of that there was a special a deluxe edition released with demo versions of tracks from the LP a zigzag zigzag sure you know there are other groups out there who have done and still do a hybrid of hip-hop music and rock but Rage Against the Machine really was kind of a perfect storm of politically charged rhymes passionate screams from Zack de la Rocha really progressive and inventive guitar playing that was very sonically manipulative from guitarist Tom Morello I mean his guitar playing was just so out there for that time that pretty much every rage album came with liner notes that had written somewhere in there that every sound on this record was made by vocals drums and bass and guitar just to assure fans that all these weird strange experimental and psychedelic sounds that they were hearing laced into these songs were pretty much being made by Tom Morello's guitar playing Tom Morello is definitely a student of guys like Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix the band had tons of smooth groove lot and very interesting bass lines and their drummer Brad Wylde was as equally skilled a rock drummer as he was a drummer who could just hop on top of a hip-hop or funk groove too even though a lot of groups in the 90s and the early 2000s combined elements of rock and hip-hop a lot of these artists since then have kind of fallen from grace to the point where the the idea of combining rock and hip-hop has become a little bit of a mockery but Rage Against the Machine is kind of like that glimmer of light in the style they were easily the best group to do it the most innovative group to do it so I'm just basically going to lift off my 10 favorite Rage Against the Machine seong starting with the song ashes in the fall a song from their 1999 album the battle of Los Angeles this song has a really kind of eerie almost Stanley Kubrick s guitar melody bbbbb that kind of repeats over and over and over in this really strange way there is a very tinny tone to Tom Morello's guitar and I absolutely love Zach's vocals on this track his chillin narrations about food rotting in the grocery aisle it's very unsettling stuff as well as some shots at religion in the lyrics to their lines in there about factory doors closing around the same time as school doors close and jail cells opening up it's it's it's dark it's just one of these songs that do something that rage was great at doing and it's kind of taking this mantra toward the end of the track and building it up higher and higher and higher to something really intense just a really climactic ending my ninth favorite track from Ray Janis the machine is easily the song Maria which also comes from the Battle of Los Angeles this song opens up with these layers multitrack layers of droning high-pitched guitar notes it's really strange and it's a nice show of the kind of ambition that rage was showing in this sort of new studio setting that they were working with on that record I love the quiet build up before the band breaks into the monster chorus riff and that was just something that rage was great at writing a nice monster riff that rocked the chorus and the lyrics on this thing were actually quite interesting about an immigrant woman who was brought over the border to really kind of slave away in a sweatshop Zacks lyrics really paint a grim picture of this woman's life working in this sweatshop and the thing is a lot of people kind of critique Rage Against the Machine as being a little too vague about their political or societal criticisms and sometimes that's totally not the case while the lyrics are yeah really symbolic and very poetic if you want to know what the songs are about you could have read into the lyrics a little more actually read them in the liner notes in the CDs or records that they sold you can see them live or Zack de la Rocha is giving away you know the plots are just you know the meanings behind some of these songs too number off of the album evil empire wind blow definitely one of my favorite tracks from rage and and one of my favorites because the interesting meld of styles I hear on this song while there's definitely a strong grimy hip-hop influence on the verses and are really awesome just tremolo guitar pick melody from Tom Morello there's a really psychedelic guitar Lee that plays over the chorus with a lot of effects on it I mean to the point where just sounds acid soaked the guitars are just so colorful and overwhelming great tune number seven off the band's debut the song know your enemy awesome track from Rage definitely one of my favorites of theirs and kind of straightforward in its message just really about knowing the world around you just basically getting sick of complacence with the status quo politically there's a snide line on the track where Zach dealer worker says land of the free whoever told you that was your enemy and there's a great ending on the track where Maynard from tool actually lends some guest vocals and really has a nice singing texture to rage against the machines music that that isn't usually there number six also off their debut killing in the name another iconic track of theirs one of their best grooves and riffs and of course the the lyric you I won't do what you tell me comes from the track and yeah it is kind of overly repetitive but the thing is the song is loaded with all of these mantras basically about questioning and rebelling against Authority those in power again that's kind of the underlying theme of Rage Against the Machine number five also off of evil empire down rodeo down Rodeo Drive where all the rich slick multimillionaires are hanging out I mean Zak drops some really just cutting lyrics on this song about being around people or confronting people who haven't seen a brown person since their grandparents bought one there's another line on the track about fuck the G ride I want the machines that are making them basically taking control of the means of production again Rage Against the Machine was not a band who hid their politics behind vague terminology my fourth favorite song from Rage Against the Machine ever easily the opener to evil empire People of the Sun which is a bit of a historical look back at basically the European takeover of various Mexican and Latin American cultures Aztecs Mayans instance right from the opening line Zack de la Rocha says from 1516 minds attacked and overseen the song has a great bass line great drum beat Zack sounds extremely passionate in his rapping and really it's one of the best songs that ever touchdown on the subject of colonialism my number three favorite track from Rage Against the Machine bond track the opening song to their debut LP and you know it's just the guitar and bass intro on this song that really impressed me and is a great introduction for this album while the song basically it is a great tune and does depict imagery of twisted realities and and then burning flags to me I just like the blend of rock funkin and hip hop that comes together on that track number two in my list of favorite Rage Against the Machine songs ever bulls on parade definitely their biggest single big big biggest single the first song of theirs I ever heard and I mean just again iconic riff on this track banner Brandt banner a nice little bass solo as well near the bridge and while this song doesn't have a specific political topic it is an awesome rapid fire critique of libraries getting turn to rebel the Pentagon the military-industrial complex in the hook on this track chilling the way Zack de la Roca just says it through Nash teeth and finally number one what is in my opinion the best Rage Against the Machine song the closer to their debut album freedom which to me just embodies what raging as the machine is all about it's multi-phased a lot of riffs and parts go into this track and again huge gigantic climactic ending and to me the the very last lyrics of this song kind of embodies what Rage Against the Machine is is all about freedom yeah right which basically spells out things are not what they seem period that's basically my top 10 favorite songs from aging as the machine rages music and their political message still stands pretty strong that's both kind of a testament to the great music they wrote and the the little progression our world has made in terms of fixing a lot of the issues that their music had once addressed just raging as the Machine per ever 
P0mflpv5y4A,hi everyone Anthony fan tan and Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're at the start of December finish of November that means I have to make a video talking about some of my favorite releases from this past month oh my we'll be fine recently I reviewed the new Angel Olsen album halfway home a really good Fulke alt-country and full rock record fronted by the one and only angel olson an up-and-coming singer songwriter who's really showing a lot of promise and has a great voice hmm I would also love to point your attention toward the pile album dripping kind of a vintage 90s indie rock throwback with a bit of post hardcore mixed in and quite a solid record with some really good songwriting not exactly anything new but very fun and enjoyable all the same next the new Action Bronson and Alchemist album rare chandeliers a surprisingly great mixtape kind of thrown in at the end of the year here a really colorful wonderfully produced hip hop album that is totally cartoony funny clever going down kind of a exploitation film route for hip hop it's enjoyable listen and free so I mean you really can't go wrong the new evens album the odds which I enjoyed quite a bit more than I actually thought I was going to when I reviewed it Ian MacKaye and Aimee Farina just kind of stick to their guns and put out another great record of a very catchy kind of motivational socially aware songs and that baritone guitar man and those vocal harmonies man they get you and finally the new captain Murphy album duality a really kind of eccentric awesomely produced hip hop album I wish the lyrics were a little better a little bit more interesting but still the beats are fantastic and what they do with vocal effects and manipulate Asians are pretty interesting throughout the album and of course captain Murphy actually turns out to be Flying Lotus I mean the breadcrumb trail is kind of there you just needed to kind of wait for him to actually admit it and now he has so now Flying Lotus is also captain Murphy what do I think about that I'm fine with it I mean you know not gonna lose any sleep the mystery was fun while it lasted all right those are my favorite records from this past month most notable records in my opinion from this past month if you've given any of them a listen what did you think of them and what were your favorite records from this past month alright now I'm just gonna be working on my favorite records over the year and that's it and that's it all right I love you have a good day or night or morning forever 
J6Nh88VeQO4,hi everyone Anthony fan tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for yet another vinyl video guys actually going to put my timer on here 10 dang minutes of talking about my records we're sort of going through this alphabetical order we're getting there we're getting there this much left and a little bit down here just a little bit see this a little bit that's all that's left it's all it so if we're going to slam through this y'all alright let's go we last left off with Sun but we passed by Sun and we're actually going into the band super heavy right now which is kind of a musical supergroup featuring Dave Stewart of the Rhythmics Joss Stone pop and R&B singer and Mick Jagger I interviewed them all so Damian Marley they are ramen I interviewed them last year as a part of a YouTube thing and they gave me this record giving this copy of their album that came out last year you know a lot of mixed reviews on the LP and I was in a fan of every single song on it but still interesting little memento that I most likely will not let go of you know just because part of an experience really all right let's see next Swan Lake you know not a favorite record of theirs for a lot of people but definitely a record I think is really good kind of all over the place because you do have three different singer songwriters on this record kind of doing their thing and kind of converging and easily one of the ugliest record covers on the face of the planet but some fantastic songs from James Mercer Dan Behar and Spencer Krug especially on paper lace which is one of my favorite songs Despenser's ever written and what else on here heart swarm is fantastic as well there's this one point and that track where a Dan Behar is like you know in PES springtime in Paris for that piece of  like it just makes me laugh my ass off every time I think of it but still I love the song wholeheartedly alright this is easily one of the strangest records that I own and have run across and an album that I totally bought years ago simply for its record cover the band's name is this robot Kills I have not really found any other note of their existence other than this record and there's a man with a seersucker jacket a bad tie aviator glasses a turban some kind of neckerchief in a Hawaiian shirt with a cowboy hat and beard weird gigantic eyed unicorns and another man with a cape unicorn paper mache head and some kind of a burgundy suit and the album title is the over the phone lie detector test la with Jesus Christ live or live with with Jesus Christ and it's really an assembly of songs that range from like punk rock noise rock to like weird electronic pop post-punk pieces it's it's strange and you know the liner notes come in here just photocopied just photocopy the liner notes and this is the thickest record I think I've come across this is a 220 gantt gram record not just a 180 gram but a 220 gram record there's actually a note of it here on the liner notes saying something like yes 220 grand vinyl kill a man with it and it says that you should sell it here for $8 although I think I might have paid a little bit more than that but still a very strange album I mean I'm not going to necessarily call it the most experimental music on the planet but it is a weird kind of freaky rock punk electronic record this robot kills if any of y'all are watching from the band good job on that record I mean you know if I've owned and sold and given away a lot of vinyl and that is one record that is stayed with me on next Thundercat the Golden Age of Apocalypse and jazz fusion here that is especially influenced by some of the smoother eighties variations of this music I've reviewed this record give it a very positive review came out on a brain feeder records and I even saw Thundercat live over itself by Southwest this past year and he was fantastic great live nice thick pressing too while the packaging isn't totally uh you know glitzed out brain feeder did a good job on on getting this record together you know get a nice nice package together tonight Hudson Mohawke munis gave this a rave review earlier this year just five tracks but an amazing hard-hitting bangin colorful eccentric and fun five tracks it is I actually spun this when I did a little DJ set over at red scroll records recently again pretty simplistic packaging but it works and thank you work records for putting that out torch a little CD of Neanderthal in there like a promo sleeve CD this is a the return illipe II just returned all in return not in return on thing about something else in return EP this is definitely my favorite thing the band has ever done the Florida sludge metal sludge pop band I like this little CD that they threw in there let me try to get it out ah it's a little a little ten inch disc but you know a little bit larger got artwork there featuring the members of the band at the time and this is easily the heaviest thing the band had done um and I just love the packaging for this oh and I believe this is a actually colored orange green orange yellow a orange and um man some of the riffs on this thing hey Vee really day what they did with the packaging on this and you know sometimes I even actually see this at some record stores you know for use you know for a pretty good price if you see that you know you're into the heavy stuff you're gonna some rifts pick that up toxicology conjure and command gave this a pretty positive review last year nice grimy thrash record with some very subtle black metal influences actually a yellow splatter vinyl I believe came out on relapse very nice no some of you may remember this from my review oh my god it just won't go in the sleeve I just won't go with the sleeve there is there is this perseverance diligence you know gets it in there just don't give up just have a goal envision it just make it happen the undertones this is actually record I remember I bought used online which is something I rarely rarely do but I really enjoy this record I just wanted to own it and it's actually a promotional copy not for sale I believe it's a radio copy of their of their debut album on sire includes such hits as teenage kicks and knows this one I'm going to get a teenage yeah family entertainment girls don't like it male model here comes the summer so yeah enjoyable record nice a you know the undertones are a band that had some great songs but they didn't get really really popular I personally think because when it came to punk bands they weren't really the punkest of the punk they were more a power pop band and the thing is a lot of those groups that kind of set on the fence and work quite so Punk you know work so much that extreme but still wrote good songs didn't quite get as famous in in retrospect you know in the larger scheme of things because they weren't exactly fitting in with the schtick they didn't exactly define the style they kind of toyed with it a little bit you know and weren't exactly like you know punk pioneers or punk Godfather's or anything like that you know they just wrote good rock pop rock songs with a little bit of a punk veneer a little bit of that energy whose pecs actually another punk group from Israel I believe shouts out to Israel right now I wish you the best I just wish that whole situation wasn't as dicey as it currently is Palestinians as well everybody be safe but boos Beck's side a the band actually I believe sent me this vinyl after I had you know that they sent me their SoundCloud I actually liked what I was hearing it came out the year before they actually sent it to me which partially you know kept me from from reviewing it but I bought a copy for myself I actually bought a copy for um intern Chris at the time too and definitely check these guys out who's Beck's very rockin the energy Vangelis the original soundtrack to Chariots of Fire actually found this at a on flea market for $2 Polydor records you know in really really good condition for when it came out and the sleeve is a little beat up so surprised that the record looked so mint you know if you really need to soundtrack for running real slow pick that up um / - dad gave me this he sort of had it he's had out he had it extra this is a a Velvet Underground compilation of previously unreleased recordings you know a lot of their songs like let me see I'm sticking with you which kind of became a cult oh we're to finish with this which kind of became a cult classic that was released through this compilation she's my best friend you know which I believe of Montreal had covered at one point and um stephanie says which is actually one of my favorite Velvet Underground songs alright that'll be our vinyl video for now we're definitely into the V is getting into the W's after that so yeah stay awesome I love you Anthony fan tanto vinyl forever [Music] [Music] 
qrfnaR4adiI,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review woo block self-titled this LP is a collaborative album that was originally intended to be kind of a joint venture between Rutan clan and d-block Jadakiss sheek Louch but it eventually just kind of got whittled down to ghost and Luke and I'm sure because of that many fans reacted thinking you know this project didn't even reach its original ambition how could it possibly be good and you know even though sonically sound quality wise it's kind of like around the level of a mixtape it is a little rough around the edges but still this project kind of ends up being a somewhat gritty no-bullshit pop album and I'm actually surprised this project turned out this hard as many of you already know the 90s was was kind of a golden age for hardcore tough-as-nails hip hop and in the late 90s early 2000s that's around the point when a lot of new york gangstas became the Lammers east coast hardcore hip hop started getting poppier slicker more sterile production you saw this incorporated on wu-tang albums like iron flag with singles like boozy and rules collectives like Rough Riders and d-block who eventually signed with Rough Riders The Diplomats 2 and the slickest of them all in my opinion the thing is in the 2000s the East Coast was putting out a lot of trashy poppy recycle pop rap that was very forgettable however through this time guys like Ghostface did stay relatively hard and awesome with albums like fish-scale even though he did kind of give away with ghost Dini however this breed of pop rap is a trend that d-block never really let go of with their solo stuff and collective albums two styles p and Jadakiss and sheek have all put out some pretty homely albums i would actually take eight diagrams over albums like no security any day I would actually even take legendary weapons over those LPS and if there's actually anything I can compare whoop lock to it is legendary weapons because both projects are not really true blue wu-tang albums but more a compilation of wu-tang related efforts or you can just call it what it really is and it's basically a hip-hop album spearheaded by ghost and Sheik and all these D block and wu-tang members just happen to kind of come along for the ride and the features on this LP actually stick pretty strictly to those guidelines Jadakiss shows up for a few verses styles P shows up for a few more Raekwon has a few Method Man has a few inspected deck and masta Killa actually show up on here and GZA who probably should have had more verses on here shows up for one - his contribution of the track driving around is especially awesome and Erykah Badu is actually featured as a guest vocalist on that track - now I mean what this album basically has going for it the best thing it has going for it is the rapping it's the cadence it's the flow it's the energy it's basically the chemistry that these guys have having known each other for so long and admiring one another's work that's not something you can just get by just throwing random collections of rappers together and on this LP it definitely shows that experience pays off in a pretty big way the opening track on here is a smooth piece of soulful boom bap that is titled crack spots stories and one by one Ghostface sheet Jayda and Raekwon paint this really vivid picture of exactly what is said in the title title title title title easy women empty bottles foods everywhere people are pretty dirty dressed very badly there are fiends outside the door it's a track that is very gritty very rated-r but it's actually got kind of an element of comedy to it too and the track guns for life is pretty much work play about gunplay which conceptually has been done before like on tracks such as my buddy but I actually like the beat on here a lot and I love some of the lines that these guys are dropping like ghost face with the diet of lead and the line that sheep drops about having his gun since it was nine and now it's 22 but it thinks it's 45 it's funny at least for me and the track driving around is a nice cool down point for this LP one of the slower more emotional songs it samples a moody passage from the verse of the sho'nuff must be love song from the band heatwave it snatches a vocal sample from the track of the singer singing driving round and I like that that vocals actually worked into some of the lines in the rapping I love it when that stuff happens interaction with the instrumental so to speak and the song is essentially like a very dark and dingy depiction of where they're from gunshots abusive preachers and GZA just drops this monster verse with this line about what's the key to life then he drops a line about a car ignition and then he paints this picture of him driving around and kind of crossing paths with this base head he's asking for change he throws him some dollars he happens to have an Obama pin on his lapel and he forecast that the next four years will essentially be the same for him and the lead single off of this LP stick-up kids given the title at this point what do you think it's about Jadakiss comes off grimy as hell ghost faces dropping this funny line on the hook about his grandma praying for his victims and I love the line sheet drops about not even needing a gun to stick some people up that you just smack them the beat sounds a little dated but still the track comes off really tough it's hard as the pavement but still that's one of the big issues on this LP overall the beats sound really really dated like the track take notice the beat sounds at least half my age stylistically at least and with the hook on there saying where the hood at and just the melody of the hook it just sounds like it came from 2002 the track coming for your head has these really kind of tense fluttering strings in the background and some of them sounds synthesized but they're really quiet behind everything and it just kind of takes down the personality of the instrumental and makes it feel really muddy kind of I guess inconspicuous the track hauling together just has these kind of sloppy ham-handed orchestral hits you know again they're just a lot of tracks on here that feel really kind of bland kind of vague because of the instrumental like the second track on here - even though lyrically things are going pretty well Cappadonna at the end of that track maybe puts in the hardest amount of effort into his verse than anybody on the entire LP I mean he is just wrapping his brains out the track do it like us the beat on there also sounds really old the hook sounds kind of poppy as well it's just not a song that flows all that well for me and eventually as I listened more and more and more to this LP you know the subject matters get kind of redundant and the entire LP admittedly in the grander scheme of things is kind of a redundancy I don't really see anything extremely new about what whoo tang and d-block are singing in a lot of these verses but still they're so enthusiastic they're rapping really well they're so charismatic it kind of makes the redundancy not that big of a deal I still thought this is a pretty effective collaboration that fans will like even if it does tread a little bit of water I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing if you've given to listen what did you think loved it hate it why what should i review next thank you for watching anthony Fantana blue block forever 
hFP3nE2MB0E,hi everyone Anthony Phan Tiano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review code orange kids love is love slash slash return to dust this is the debut full-length LP from the Pennsylvania punk outfit code orange kids they've been building up to this point with a series of very hard-hitting EPS and earlier this year they even had a bone breaking split with the band full of hell and now the dropping this full-length LP on Death Wish Records which is a pretty big start for any band of this style and code orange Kids is is really one of many hardcore punk bands out there right now bringing elements of sludge metal into the fold lots of Basie slow heavy riffs on this album interrupting sprees of punk mayhem as well as blast beats influences of post hardcore seemed to kind of seep into the chord progressions of some of these tracks and there are even elements of shoegaze on here as well I'd say in the interludes Code Orange Kids has definitely proven themselves worthy of attention for two to five songs on their previous EPS but we're getting ten tracks on this thing and remaining interesting and engaging for any band that goes this hard and is this aggressive for that amount of time can be kind of a challenge which is why it's important if you're going to go the distance you've got to bring diversity oh I get really sad when sang sound the same to me which is why when you make music think of diversity well the big massive distorted guitar riffs all over this LP if you've got a HiFi stereo system it's going to make it Rumble and two members of the band Jami I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly and Reba both who have vocal duties on this LP they are so fierce all over this album their screams their vocals very throaty not like deep low kind of scary 30 like teenager fed up with everything on the planet throaty Code Orange kids takes those moments and does a pretty good job of breaking them up as well as actually bringing a recording that is more hard-hitting than the stuff that was on their previous EPS the track flower mouth which is the opener to this LP and kind of the lead single starts off with this heavy bass riff there's all this guitar feedback in the background eventually that all kind of breaks away just to a bunch of floor tom drums you're playing this romping rhythm a different baseline entirely comes into play then a riff introduces itself that starts playing until the end of the song until the band decides to go really slow and then deliver a very kind of calming guitar outro and that's a lot of change in just 2 minutes and 30 seconds I mean this band does not go on too long without changing gears changing the riff just changing something and while yeah change in progression can definitely make a track engaging in this particular case I actually felt like it broke up the momentum of the song and at no point did it really feel like things got going the track liars slash slash trudge is this moment where things kind of quiet down at first you get these reverb guitars that sound pretty quiet and these distant scream vocals kind of obscured behind them eventually the band goes into something heavy and yet again we get another quiet guitar moment this time with female vocals but again distant obscure it just kind of felt like several different ideas that happen to make it on the same track in a sense I kind of feel the same way about the song colors into nothing which at its start with some more very serene reverb guitars feels like maybe a bit of post-rock but once another rhythm guitar introduces self and a drum part none of it actually feels like it's playing together the instrumentation gets a little more cohesive toward the end of the song there's actually some clean singing again kind of hidden behind the guitars it actually makes the track maybe a little less engaging than it would have been otherwise the song nothing there at the halfway point of this LP is actually the first song that really kind of knocked my socks off and made me think like yeah this is what I've been looking for some awesome riffs speed just hitting a nice groove and a lot of guitar leads wailing against this riff adding some melodic personality to what Code Orange Kids is doing I would actually say overall the entire second half of this LP is way more consistent than the first half the song choices love is love is an absolute sludge metal fest where the band takes these riffs and builds them higher and higher and higher and brings more and more tension and intensity until it just blows up climaxes tour the end of the track and a closing track on here one of the longest songs on the LP went over pretty well and showed me that Code Orange kids can't stretch a song out if they need to it was just loaded with these soul-crushing and emotive post-hardcore chords that I think a lot of sputum would would definitely get into overall I just thought this was a somewhat engaging somewhat solid sludge core album it's a style that I feel myself getting more and more kind of familiar with more and more used to so I kind of looked for the bands that continued to release in this genre to find ways to define themselves in it and I'm not really sure if Code Orange Kids does that I mean there's not much on this LP that they didn't already do on their EP stylistically and I felt like the vocals maybe could have used a bit more diversity as well considering the fact that there are two vocalists on this LP the screams sound in my opinion very similar and the clean singing which which was a nice and interesting addition would have really kind of brought the album a little something different if they had come to the forefront a bit more definitely give it a listen it's worthwhile for the style and might be enjoyed by anybody who dug that Loma Prieta album that birds in row album two that came out earlier this year what did you think of this help if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I ravine xed Anthony Tino forever [Music] [Music] 
kbmrV7CIa28,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review teams Wildwater Kingdom a Manchu Sri is a New York rapper and a member of the semi comedic and always clever hip-hop alpha - racist he has in fact my favorite member of the group and yeah even though stylistically is kind of in lockstep with - racists other MC cool ad in being funny being kind of goofy I find him to be way more focused hard-hitting kind of straightforward his voice and historically the passion and the energy that he puts into his rapping there's the cadence of his rapping just has me standing at attention his voice has some some presence to it and he brought all these characteristics to his debut solo mixtape neighbor jackets that came out earlier this year which I loved and that tape had some great production from Mike Vinita one track after another lots of Indian and Middle Eastern music samples crunchy dirty hard-hitting drums really great inconsistent features from big baby Gandhi Danny Brown action bronson of course cool lady and there was a good amount of variety on the LP - there were tracks that were very playful silly ridiculous kind of tongue-in-cheek like women and others that were sharp and very critical like NYC cops now wild water Kingdom is the second full-length project the hymns is dropping this year and his wish to be prolific is is definitely admirable but he's is definitely presenting a slightly different side of himself this time on this tape and that is very apparent right from the instrumentals Keim's does not have mic finito as much on this tape as he does guys like Harry fraud who has done production for Action Bronson but he has done instrumentals for artists that have more of a mainstream style as well like French Montana he's also got instrumentals on here from keyboard kid who is notoriously known for having beats that are a little more ethereal than what the average producer is putting out and because of this term that Eames is taking with the instrumentals the overall feel of this tape is smoother glassy ER there are just lots of rippling atmospheric cloud rap waves on some of these tracks they're even tracks on here like third thing which has this Skippy siren-like Club worthy electro synthesizer phrase that is just nice for the dancefloor I would say the hook works within that context too it's pretty surprising that he was really able to do a 180 with the instrumental feel of this project there are a few beats on the back end of this tape that are a bit dirtier most notably the track that has childish gambino on it but even the title track to this thing feels like it lifts the sample from the soundtrack to a water stage and a Super Nintendo game and overall I wouldn't actually say that I mind the instrumental change on on this LP yeah I think the beats on here do have a wider appeal than what was on he was last tape but still it does have a flavor to it in my opinion it's actually he's versus and his hooks that kind of drop off with this tape and it may totally be intentional to kind of fit in with the atmospheric vibe to fit in with the watery vibe that I guess comes with the title but he's energy level is in my opinion much lower than what was on neighbor jackets and yeah if you listen to - races tapes their album and he's neighbor jackets as well you will find spots where he was find himself kind of toned down but on here it's kind of just one track after another of that where he's feeling pretty lacks maybe a little blunted and maybe even a little giggly at times he's really down to that kind of cool ad level of energy on top of the energy being a little bit lower a lot of what he was saying on these songs it's like haphazard filler raps and they don't even really feel that funnier or entertaining to be honest there are a lot of tracks on here they have a very strong clear and an interesting topic like you got on neighbor jackets it's like heme is linking one stream of consciousness thought to another in his verses and you know that actually isn't as random as I'm making it to sound because if you've heard Nehru jackets if you've heard - races other projects you already know the lyrical territory heme typically travels through and while it's not necessarily a terrible thing it's hard to stay excited about that when he's audibly less enthusiastic about it and when he does kind of get up the energy to just really kind of put some force behind his versus vocally you end up getting a hook like on the song killing time where it's essentially him repeating over and over I'm bored I'm bored I'm bored I'm bored a lot of spots on here come off as just taking up space and like the title of the track killing time lyrically there are some laughs here and there but I wouldn't say it's as strong as potent as what I've heard on previous projects though I do appreciate hims experimenting instrumentally like I said maybe the best thing about this project I think he incorporates a little bit of dubstep in the beat with the track Deepak Chopra some dub reggae influences come through on the track half pint and the song soup boys actually incorporates a little bit of acoustic guitar in the instrumental this is definitely something worth downloading for - racist fans because you will come away liking at least a couple tracks from this because it's not like he's really falls from grace he just kind of treads water in kind of a really lethargic way I'm actually kind of feeling like a strong five to a light six on this project kind of indifferent toward it if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana teams forever 
f0D9IyyeEEU,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review macintosh plus floral shop macintosh plus is the pseudonym of a music producer from america and macintosh pluses latest release along with a few others are currently being celebrated as the dawning of a brand-new genre and yes I understand if you're skeptical given the inconsistency of the last three new genres that we've had like C Punk witch house and chill wave but this new genre is vaporwave vapor wave vapor wave that Wow yes it does sound ridiculous however let's not slag a piece of music simply because of a term thrown onto it because some music fans or music writers are desperate to feel like they're on the cutting edge of something if vapor wave is in fact a genre and does end up being recognized seriously as a genre then it's it's most likely going to just become a sub-genre of plunder phonics sample based compositions songs that take pieces of other songs to build those songs however I'm being told that the artists that are falling under this category of vaporwave are stylistically different from guys like DJ shadow avalanches negative land girl talk as well as John Oswald the man who coined the word plunder phonics and I guess primarily what makes vaporwave different from other plunder phonics styles is its source material many projects in this genre of music that are most notably found on the beer on the rug Bandcamp page stick pretty passionately to using samples from smooth jazz incidental music from maybe commercial television shows from the late 80s late 90s contemporary R&B maybe even adult oriented rock new age music and synth funk as well like the kind of sounds that Brian Eno was creating for Windows back when he was creating the Windows sound and maybe it's music that you've had contact with if you've watched funny videos or TV commercials on everything is terrible calm or even seen a few sketches on Tim and Eric awesome show great job if you're at all familiar with those last two things you know that this kind of music is is constantly made a joke of by a lot of people however there is a growing post-ironic desire to listen to and and wholeheartedly enjoy this kind of music which is just the weirdest thing to me not that it's not enjoyable but it's funny that in the internet age you can pretty much find and listen to anything and almost anything can find an audience and there are plenty of other artists that have made use of the sounds that vaporwave consists of for their own musical gain artists like Neon Indian for example maybe Arial pink as well and and especially an artists like James Ferraro now vaporwave takes this kind of music and manipulates it cuts it loops it maybe pitch shifts it as well and specifically in the case of Macintosh plus it's almost like a chopped and screwed version of all these genres in the source material so again stylistically theoretically not that different from other plunder Phonics artists it really relies heavily on the kind of music it's sampling and the vibe that it gets from that and that vibe consistently from track to track on this LP is smooth synth-heavy kind of sexy the second track on here is a slowed down version of Diana Ross's your move with a few choice grooves in the song cut and looped over and over and over and over until Macintosh Plus finally decides to kind of give up the chorus and the end result with these really vocals crooning out it's just a combination of sweet and eerie it does have a good and kind of interesting sound to it but I have to attribute that more to the songwriting and the way the song was produced as opposed to how the sounds were manipulated because how Macintosh Plus edits a lot of these songs it's it's kind of boring it's it's really uninspired it really lets the song do all of the work it's not like taking a song and turning it into a new song it's really kind of like making a slowdown dance edit of the very same song that you're editing around the middle point of the track there's some slapback echo it gets super slow toward the end but there's really no hint of some very creative loops or cuts on the fourth track Macintosh Plus kind of lets the sample the song rather do the work again it's a revision of the pace song you need a hero which again has a likable sound but is not impressively assembled it's not until the third or fifth track on this LP that McIntosh plusses editing skills actually get used to make a different song out of its source material on track three there are a lot of Skippy loops and edits to kind of build some original grooves out of the samples there's some deep bass and really silky smooth synthesizer and macintosh plus repeats some pivotal parts of these beats in the way a DJ would if the song were being cut live but I really have no assumption that anything on this album is being done on the fly and on the fifth track here all of these synthesizer loops all these piano sounds are taken off of a track and looped placed over one another and just kind of repeated reverb was thrown on top and it becomes a bit of an ambient piece but honestly it was a little underwhelming the only more ambient style piece on this album that I thought was really impressive was the seventh track actually like that from beginning to end the layers of synthesizers on that track got really ethereal and I like the way the saxophone kind of melted through it if anyone is going to be impressed by this LP it's most likely going to be people who have not heard the songs that are sampled on this album first because by sample-based music the editing the looping again just the execution is is really underwhelming leaves a lot to be desired there's nothing on this LP that wasn't done better on an album like OneNote Rick's point numbers replica or Daniel o Patton's other project Chuck Pearson's echo jams Volume one which samples a lot of the same kind of music and is actually way more bold with its editing and it's looping and it's stretching of some of the songs that it uses aside from being underwhelmed by most of these tracks there were a lot of songs on here that I did not like it all like the opening track where it's basically one section of a song crashing violently into another section that just sounds terrible and just incongruent and on the bonus tracks that come with the latest edition of this album there is a horrible stretched out version of I only have eyes for you the the zapf cover I actually find sample-based music to be pretty interesting I think the possibility is truly are endless but Macintosh Plus is is not even trying to explore a lot of those possibilities and and that's my number one issue with this LP I'm actually feeling a decent too strong for on this album certainly it sounds nice it has style but there's really not much there in terms of how its assembled if you've given this a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what should i review next and that's it Anthony Fantana macintosh plus vaporwave forever 
nakdorPK09o,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review angel Olson halfway home angel Olson is an up-and-coming singer-songwriter whose name has been making rounds in the worlds of alternative country and contemporary folk oh the hill is Salem you see the fungus angel has been performing live with artists like Bonnie Prince Billy and her talent has earned her the ear of Emmett Kelly of the Cairo gang whose production and guest instrumentation is all over this album and the influence of those two artists is certainly on this LP sonically and stylistically when you compare this LP to Angel's last big project strange cacti I mean it's it's like night and day on strange cacti angel came off as just a loaf I guitar strum ER with a unique voice that was really really swallowed and reverb and now this new record is a quaint quiet and very emotive mix of folk and alternative country with angels very bold voice pushed front center yeah it's it's kind of a familiar formula structure style but angels personality does not get lost in the process of making a much more accessible record and that personality primarily comes from just angels voice there is a serious twang to how this girl's sings and I don't necessarily mean an accent I mean kind of you're getting these other kind of notes in the back of her throat as she is singing some of these ballads it reminds me of like a lot of old classic country songstress who had kind of a sharp yodel to their singing and angel definitely has that but she draws it out a bit more I would say she actually borderline abuses it on some of these tracks but it is for a reason and it pretty much to get this earth-shaking emotional impact which on some tracks it sounds like she's at the peak of an emotional meltdown or on other tracks like always have strange she really kind of sounds like she's delivering a quiet sob and on the song you are song toward the beginning of the track angel has these very quiet subdued monotone almost narrated indie folk vocals and despite the excessiveness at times the vocals overall are just really well sung well performed captivating but what makes these vocals even better is the poetry that angels delivering with them sometimes I love when she sings about just does does just as desire like in this one particular line where she sings I want to be the bed you mess or on the refrain of the track the waiting where she sings that she's looking for someone who was going to run to her door and love her without hesitation someone who's going to sing to her right away not just talk or the track can't wait until tomorrow which is actually a pretty interesting to me because of how just obsessed it is with this person just how in love and fetch you a tit it is with the person it has in mind singing that I can't wait until tomorrow because it's another chance it's another opportunity to get to know you and the song Miranda actually kind of tells a story I haven't heard a songstress sing about in a while anymore these days it's a song about a girl losing her lover because he is a prisoner going to jail though angel does kind of stopped short of pining because this person's being locked away toward the end of the song it almost feels as if she's kind of realized this person isn't the great person she thought he was and she's like whatever you're going to jail see you later but there are moments on here where angel does drift off of the topic of like romantic relationships in a very enjoyable way like on the song lonely universe where she recollect it's very painfully this instance where she's a young girl in dealing with a family member who seems to be suffering some kind of mental illness really losing their mind their memory guessing from the lyrics alone I would have to say maybe it's her mother she's singing about losing this person the ambulance is coming but she has to get dressed for school and and go to class right after this if I have any issue with the lyrics there are some moments on here where angel does get a little too wordy with her lines and the lyrics don't really fit into the meter of the song or the flow of the song it's like all these words getting thrown down or jumbling like badly placed Tetris blocks most notably on the end of the song Miranda or the last third of safe in the womb if I do have a big issue on this LP it is the instrumentation it does get the job done on a lot of these tracks and it does provide some variety the track the waiting is really the most tightly knit instrumentally song on this entire LP it's got a nice groove to it that you could that you could really saunter to you know I actually kind of envisioned the guy that she is singing about losing it over just kind of strutting by like he's hush she's just going gaga and I love the really awesome harmonized guitar leads on that track as well as the background vocals it's nicely put together peace of poppy Foulke lo the universe is easily the longest song on this entire LP goes past seven minutes but not only does the story and just angels voice and her emotion keep things very engaging but the instrumentation evolves as the song progresses in the story kind of gets more intense the instrumentation really gives angel a great canvas for her to just dump her emotions upon but songs like Miranda and and safe in the womb the instrumentation is just kind of flat generic the chords just aren't that amazing the guitars aren't embellished that colorfully if at all and the closing track on here the tiniest seed while I do like the lyrics I do like the background vocals and angels singing the instrumentation surrounding this track just makes it sound like a very basic run-of-the-mill all country waltz though the performance of the instruments on the sky opened up isn't all that exciting I do like the fact that the song is pretty much one trumpet short of a spaghetti western and the song free feels like a vintage piece of pop rock that the Everly Brothers would have played overall I like this album quite a bit it's got very good singing personality songs variety but you know I just wanted a bit more performance and melodic fire coming from the instrumentation I am still looking forward to whatever she does next though I hope the improvement from this album turn next is as great as what just happened from strange cacti to here if that's the case we're gonna have a great album coming down the pipe I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it hate it why and what should I review next angel Olson halfway home 
jEZ5gdmUa4w,hi everyone Anthony fan tanno here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Bad Brains into the future this is the latest full-length album from iconic DC punk outfit Bad Brains a band I remember being huge into back when I was sort of in the midst of my punk music phase in high school though I don't really want to call it a phase because I guess I'm still going through it or maybe I'm just not as huge into the band as I used to be I pretty much parted ways with every Bad Brains album I've ever owned except for the full-length debut which I still firmly believe is is one of the greatest punk albums of all time but I will say that the band's later releases did show them being a little bit more ambitious incorporating elements of metal funk and dabbling in a little bit more reggae - which really made albums like I against I kind of a mishmash a little inconsistent but still albums like that are filled with with some pretty great songs that should be checked out by fans of the Bands earlier stuff however I am not really sure if into the future is an album that first-timers should go to maybe it's more an LP for hardcore fans who have already been hardened by one studio letdown after another into the future is unfortunately just one more difficult pill to swallow and to me it's it's kind of insane because the band is still an extremely reputable live act it's the writing and in the playing and the recording that has really been suffering especially on this release those things are just not the band's strong suit right now and I wonder if they ever will be again I mean the sound just the sound generally of the recording of this LP is off it becomes apparent right on track 1 that the guitar tone is is really brittle it's thin it's flat it's kind of boring it sounds like guitar be played through a practicing with some really cheap distortion pedals there are some really sloppy finger drags across the strings on some of these tracks that I feel like are made even more audible by just the bad recording of the guitar and the execution of some of these riffs I mean is is really lethargic sometimes one track out here earnest love is actually pretty slow pretty heavy and the sound is a bit thicker on that track of the guitar and it is kind of passable in that one moment but for the most part the guitars on this record are extremely underwhelming for a punk album the only other moments that I feel like the guitar actually works or sounds alright are on the more reggae styled spots now aside from the guitars the second biggest issue on this LP for me is vocals from HR who I mean to me is is just one of the most enigmatic singers in in punk music if you look at these older Bad Brains records and still live he has quite a bit of presence he has a very kind of strange demeanor to him that that makes him an interesting performer but in the studio especially on this record that presence does not come forward and it's unfortunate because while I was not huge into a lot of Bad Brains later records I did think to an extent HR was getting a bit more interesting like I against I that I mentioned earlier though that record is you know kind of inconsistent some of hrs best vocal performances in the band in general are on that record with him exploring metal vocals more soulful vocals just soaring passionate high with this really weird kind of nasally vibrato but I definitely do think on this record vocally he has lost some power some focus to and after tuned on this album he has an extremely weak grip of the melody that he is trying to hold on to with his voice but it is still very apparent that he's just trying to sing is his brains out he is trying to go hard on some of these songs he is writhing he is fighting his flailing but so many of the shots just aren't landing and because I feel that way none of the ad Libs or just vocal narrations on some of these tracks go over all that well to me like I'm a song fun I guess it's just slightly irritating to kind of hear Bad Brains get indulgent with some of these tracks when the basics of what they used to do really really great aren't even there on this LP again to go back to these more reggae style tracks that come in toward the back end of this LP these are really the only songs that I feel bad brains does have that foundation down it's present it's well executed the groove is there for the most part the playing is there the energy yeah the MCA dub does get a little bit repetitive a track that is actually lovingly in tribute to Beastie Boys member MCA but still that track has a very nice sound to it a nice vibe where the sound boom falls short again is with the songwriting the title track of this record comes in with a really generic riff hrs vocals are all over the place and he has these falsetto vocals popping up in the background trying to provide some other sound but they don't sound great either and the song does have kind of a decent pace until it just breaks into this melodic interlude that feels so messy and blobby it just kills the momentum of the song this long popcorn that comes in right after has this really kind of bad rap metal refrain about Rasta Girls and the spots about going round and round ran around I mean lyrically it's just very off and the song youth of today in terms of just the riff writing and hrs vocals they feel like on completely different planets with this song it's as if the band just took some random instrumental track and just some leftover HR vocal take and just threw them together there are these weird breaths that kind of pop up in the song occasionally to I don't know what they're doing they're kind of coming in rhythmically but they don't add that much to the song and they do not feel all that equalized and the song ja love which also gets pretty repetitive is kind of like this electronic reggae infusion with this revving synthesized bass that feels a little bit in tribute to dubstep if there's anything that I can say that's positive about Bad Brains and this LP aside from a future that are tolerable it's that not many bands can successfully and sincerely embody so many styles of music from reggae to punk metal funk but still those other things I mentioned the performance the songwriting the recording they're just not there with this LP and they ruin so many potentially decent songs I'm actually feeling a light two decent three on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Bad Brains into the future forever you 
lMMpw5VCywc,ha hi everyone Anthony fan tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Tim Hecker and Daniel o Putin instrumental tourists Tim Acker and Daniel o Putin aka OneNote Rick's point never are both relatively successful musicians when it comes to the genres of experimental music ambient music drone with projects like Ford and lo Patton and Aiden Baker and Tim Hecker under their belts surely collaborating is not brand new territory for them however in the case of this collaboration instrumental tourists I mean the music here should prove to be especially interesting because at this moment in time Hecker and lopatin are putting out some of the best music of their respective careers when I came into this I was basically expecting some really gripping combinations of ideas and influences to kind of collide and possibly create something altogether new however I do have to say that if you already are familiar with the music these guys have made individually then what is on this album most likely will not be a surprise and in terms of weaknesses I gotta say the execution on this album or the execution of the music on this album didn't really bring the emotional explosion I was kind of hoping it would this album kind of churns out one weakly improvised electronic piece after another with very little direction or purpose a lot of what occurs on this LP kind of meanders and in a really unrewarding way despite not having the very clear and straightforward patterns that is usually in pop or rock music I typically find Hecker's pieces to be pretty sharp pointed kind of have a clear path to them and as far as Daniels work goes especially with return 'el I have found his music to just be really kind of soothing I get a mix of those two worlds together on this LP and sometimes it feels great sometimes not so much the track vaccinations for Thomas Mann is this song that I feel like really is kind of coming from that Daniel side of things it just circles around and around and around this really drab set of chords and they're played out with this really cheesy vocal effect on the sense it feels like a really bad synthesizer preset some of the musical embellishments toward the end of the track sound great I do like how the song grows and gets thicker and kind of becomes warm and enveloping but I'm just being surrounded in this sound that I don't really think is pleasing at all to listen to I actually feel the same way about the Trank ritual consumption too and the song whole Earth task and maybe my least favorite track on this entire LP has these pretty interesting cycling tones that that really do feel like something I could hear Tim Hecker creating but over that like I said earlier weak musical synth improv that sound kind of silly and the song intrusions totally just caught me off guard as being just especially ham-handed and just kind of thrown together I mean I'm kind of hearing these jutting shots of distortion popping in and out it's as if Hecker where Daniel is wiggling a quarter-inch jack in and out of a broken amplifier I like some of the synthesizer beds in the track and I do like that the track gets kind of pretty toward the end but still it just kind of gets off to a start that has me very uninterested in what the song is eventually going to bring you know and those are kind of low points for me on this album the rest of what's on here kind of moves from moderate to great though I will say much of what is on this LP is pretty indulgent glitchy I think the only smoother track on this album that really kind of stopped me in my tracks was gray geisha the song is filled with these layers of synthesizers that feel glossy futuristic like I could float on them and then there are these pan flute melodies and the pan flew a lot like other sounds on this LP sound like they're kind of like a synthesizer preset but still the reverb they're soaked in and just the the texture of them in general feels pretty nice it's an enchanting song however the other side of this elk moving away from that smoothness our tracks that have Daniel au patents trademarks since combined with Tim hackers just penchant for dirtiness filth distortion static you're basically getting moments of eternal mixed with that apocalyptic feel of rave death like the song uptown psyckadeli oh the first track off of this LP and maybe my favorite kind of feels like a long-lost radio transmission gasping on its last breath the song has these multiple phases of deterioration and the synthesizers that are floating in between this distortion this static actually sound pretty beautiful and they really lighten the load of the track a little bit these synthesizers are just beautiful on this track and they kind of flutter here and there and it sounds like there's kind of like a synthesized acoustic guitar that shoots up all over the mix as well that that adds a nice texture and the song scene from a French Zoo feels as if daniel is collaborating with Tim Hecker in a moment of harmony and ultraviolet a really hauntingly beautiful perfect track that is chilling and and quiet as well you know overall this album is just kind of all over the place stylistically which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if I didn't also feel like it was kind of all over the place quality wise as well I can't help but feel like a lot of the tunes if you could even call them that because for the most part they feel like motifs I can't help but feel like they're kind of thrown together or not really all that well groomed or developed some songs like uptown psyckadeli you do feel like they got a bit more attention while others fall a little short or even very short but still the upside of this LP is that it truly does feel like a collaboration if you're familiar with the work of Daniel and Tim already there are tracks on here where it really kind of feels like an even collaboration and even combination of both of their Styles their songs where Tim's influence feels a little bit more prevalent and vice-versa they definitely explore multiple sides of their musical personas and kind of connect them in in weird ways like Lego blocks I'm kind of a strong five to a light six on this LP if you have given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Hecker low patent instrumental tourist forever 
tJOg8o3iqzY,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a common thing kind of a response to a message that somebody had sent to my youtube channel I this video is about getting your music out there I'm not a famous musician I don't claim to know everything that famous musicians do know and this is certainly not a video about how you should be making music or how you need to be doing business as a musician but there are quite a few people out there who make music either semi-professionally or are trying to get to a semi-professional or professional level but don't quite know how to get started when it comes to sort of getting their music out there connecting with people so here are four things that could possibly maybe get you going in that direction on the right foot if you are completely new to the music game and just getting started or you are yet to really kind of gain a following making music you have to understand that there are already a plethora of musicians out there who have stepped over this threshold before you not only are we counting bands that are long dead and broken up because for the most part their music is still readily available for people to listen to at their leisure but there are a lot of new musicians out there right now working as hard as they possibly can to grab the attention of music listeners and these people are making music of all shapes and sizes most likely no one is going to be running up to you begging for you to make music for them because of this you have to reach out to music listeners that means putting your music and your musical project on as many platforms as possible so that people can connect with it I'm talking about YouTube whether it's music or a music video a Facebook fan page a Twitter account SoundCloud Bandcamp tumblr maybe a music streaming service like Spotify and there are websites like MySpace that are still functional when it comes to being able to have a music page and get your music out there although for a lot of people who are in the music industry today it is a little kind of outdated basically use sites and social media platforms to put your music out there where it is incredibly easy for people to share it with their friends or followers if they happen to like what you're doing and if for whatever reason all the sites I just listed have become completely irrelevant then you need to gravitate toward the sites that have replaced them no matter what age of music you're talking about connecting with people has always been the goal if the means of doing that alter then you have to alter yourself if you're going to continue engaging new audiences there's certainly a romance to the old-school way of doing things and there are artists out there who have gained large followings and are able to kind of just kind of keep them at their doorstep without really going outside pushing themselves into that social media realm too hard but the thing is releasing an album with absolutely no promotion behind it whatsoever or putting up xeroxed show Flyers on telephone poles doesn't really have the pole that it used to once you have your music available for people to listen to on the internet then you must reach out reach out to music communities forums blogs find their email addresses use the social media sites that I just told you about to reach out to people maybe even try to get a small sum of money together and apply to be promoted by some kind of small music PR firm no matter which avenue you go about it make sure that when you're trying to reach out to people about your music you are polite you're concise and you are understanding that not everyone is going to like your music not everyone is going to want to blog your music not everyone is going to think very highly of what you're doing but if the door you're knocking on does not open then move on to another door that's kind of the beauty of the Internet age there are more doors than ever you may want your music to get popular but you have to remember that this industry is an entertainment industry it's a service industry this industry is about giving people what they want not just getting what you want if you're not making music that people want to hear or you're not making music that is furthering the artform then don't expect to be successful and I'm not saying you have to make music that is very poppy very simple kind of appeals to the lowest common denominator or something like that I'm not saying you have to dumb things down right now there's all kinds of music out there that is successful and there are all kinds of people out there willing to listen to it what I'm saying is that you have to care about connecting with people through music whether it's through interviews or just talking with them or performing live or making music for them to listen to right now making it in music and being able to maintain your spot on the top once you do make it is becoming more and more difficult it's actually kind of like about a hundred or so basketball players around a hoop trying to make a jump shot all at once balls are bouncing off of each other a lot of shots are just bouncing off the rim if you go in people's music listening options today are enormous and the music that you're making is just a drop in the bucket and the thing is even larger artists who have managed to gain a pretty big following are really only able to muster a couple months of hype if that behind a project before everybody pretty much moves on to the next album artists performance or music video that's kind of being tossed their way everybody right now is jockeying for ears and and very fickle ears at times and you know being able to kind of maintain the attention of those ears requires creativity maybe some experimentation patience hard work and and vision or maybe just like a buttload of money if you have that and you're willing to spend it I'm sure there are plenty of people out there willing to take care of at least some of those things for you the last thing here maybe the most important of all of these things that I mentioned is make music make content if you are trying to make a living or a semi living off of being a musician then you are a content creator the music industry is not what it used to be most likely you will not be getting famous off of your first song and if you in fact do end up getting famous off your first song you may have a difficult time pleasing people when you actually try to follow it up don't just make one thing and then get hung up on it when people don't like it or it's not being promoted all too well or yada yada yada yada no matter how much hard work you put into it move on to the next thing continue evolve keep creating cooking one meal or even ten meals does not make you a chef and in that same regard making one song or even just an entire album doesn't necessarily make you a worthwhile musical project that is going to see success into the years and not to say that your efforts aren't worth something I only say that because there is just so much music out there today don't expect the success of a track or an album to just carry you on into oblivion increasing the amount of people that will stick with you into your next project and just follow you means quality and consistency and when people actually do finally stumble upon your music and they love what they're hearing the more tracks you actually have already made for them to immerse themselves in the better if someone finds out about one album of yours and they completely love it and you already have four other albums that they could listen to after that then but like I just said you have to be putting your best into those releases as well now if you're making music consistently and like I just said with quality and you're putting it out there on social media you're reaching out to people and if you are fortunate enough to actually get let's say even a hundred people to be hardcore interested and loving what you are doing then you have a lot more than you think you have people this group of people is extremely invaluable to you because if you make music for them that they love the share culture that we live in will then have them sharing the art that you've just made with their friends with their family they will wear their love for what you do on their sleeve they won't be champions for you they will want you to be successful and with even a small group of hardcore fans you can get a little more ambitious with your projects you can do Kickstarter campaigns you can try to sell the music that you make to them you can print vinyl or CD releases that they will only have access to for purchasing you can make better music for them with better recording quality you could play live for them if you make the right moves with the group of fans that you have so far then the sky is is kind of the limit however I will say that these four points that I just brought up are really just you know a simplified version of what you really need to be doing there are other factors that I didn't even mention at play here can you even write music all that well or what is the economy like those are issues that you're either going to have to tackle yourself or discuss with other people but what I hope this video has done for you is kind of highlighted the way in terms of how to get started when it comes to getting your music out there what you can expect and just kind of the mindset you need to go into when releasing your music to the greater online public I wish you the best of luck thank you for watching this video I hope hope hope hope hope it has helped maybe a little and happy music making anthony Fantana questions comments things forever [Music] you 
DNzZfBfBjoU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the latest LP from socio-political rock duo the evens put your swag in a big political rap 99% hybrids don't hate cause they hate it cream organic sweet and sour the power hybrids a 90% man would even say to that I mean he's right it's right about everything it'll reassess my life I don't know this sucks the evens are drummer and singer Amy Farina and singer baritone guitar player Ian McKay and between bands like teen idols Minor Threat Louis the warmers and Fugazi both of them have plenty of DC underground rock experience under their belts however with just an incredible amount of consistency the evens is really becoming one of the most notable moments in both of their careers and the project is yet to falter even on its third full-length LP the odds the evens have pretty much been shaping themselves to be one of those bands that fine Tunes their sound with each release not really one of those groups that kind of shoots for rapid progression with every LP and I wouldn't really say an incredible amount of change is is all that necessary for the evens because their sound is is relatively stripped-down simple straightforward and gimmick free as it is sure the bands use of baritone guitar does make them stick out but I wouldn't really say it's as much a selling point as the band's message and and songwriting just the intimacy of their recordings which has always kind of been the focus from one album to another typically on an even's album there is very little in the way of extra instrumentation or effects pretty much it is vocal harmonies drums and baritone guitar and that baritone guitar if you're not really familiar with the instrument is kind of like a regular guitar but it plays a lower register of notes kind of like a chubby guitar and when it is strung furiously by Ian MacKaye on a number of these Tunes the sound is actually quite farty but the thing is it works with the tone down direction of this band even when they are just playing furiously on any track on any album the sound remains very kind of low and and round I would just be calling this music fault if it weren't for the fact that this baritone guitar was electric and plugged in this thing is just some weird middle ground with rock and full and kind of post-hardcore that only a guy like Ian MacKaye could function within in a way that actually produces gray music now it's been a while since the evens have put out another full-length LP especially considering that the very first two albums from this project were just within one year of each other and even though we are getting this album now they even certainly do not sound like a band that has taken six years to put this record together because Farina and makai very naturally begin from where they left off the only real negative right off the bat with this LP is that there are some moments where the evens do kind of feel like they are treading water musically some riffs do kind of sound way too similar to older even's riffs for comfort in my opinion this help he does not start off as strong as it possibly could have with tracks like King of Kings and I do myself not bad songs but like I just mentioned a little too similar to other even songs have already heard for me to really kind of get excited about them despite the fact that I do like the lyrics however it's not long before the evens actually start presenting some songs that do take some risks for them and come off as distinct in song and subject like the song wanted criminals which kind of has this mess of horns that pops up occasionally in the background or at least it feels like horns it's kind of a new texture for them but it's the song subject and just the the writing and the energy behind the vocals that really ends up gripping me it kind of feels like it's about everybody becoming a deputy but after that nobody really to arrest it kind of seems to me like some commentary on snitching and just the prison system it's kind of a weird satirical fantasy with a really huge climax toward the end the evens kind of pushed themselves out of their comfort zone a little bit more with the track wonder-why which is an instrumental jam not really my favorite track on the LP but certainly a nice try with no instrument really kind of playing lead on this track with the baritone guitar kind of being mashed away at from one section to another in this song it doesn't really enthrall me all that much but the drum solo that amy Farina plays toward the last part of the track is really quite awesome and on the track competing with the till the evens actually kind of try to branch out a little bit instrumentally by bringing in these schmaltzy kind of crappy sounding keyboards that kind of are trying to replicate a piano and what sounds like a little bit of horn in there too it's very kitschy but kind of for a purpose the critique on this track gets personal making fun of venues that really put money over music and the outlets don't even work which sucks tracks like broken finger and warble factor actually bring in guitar riffs that are very very few gauzy esque however they don't really make me miss Fugazi or or anything like that they actually sound quite thrilling in this more toned-down manner and on a ladder of those two tracks amy FreeNAS vocals are just really fiery and attention-grabbing i mean she is just such a passionate vocalist on this LP and it's just got me running through these tracks again and again again because she does come off with a lot of conviction on most of these tracks now the last third of the selfie is actually where things get really great I love an album that ends strong the track this other thing the evens kind of take a risk with this work II funny little intersecting guitar lead that sounds pretty kooky but is actually one of the more interesting transitions on the entire LP and the song Let's Get Well is is really the best ballad the evens have put together I actually fell in love with the line about shaping our shapers or shape despite them but either way we end up on the cutting board this LP is freakin solid just another great offering from the evens I'm feeling a light a decent 8 on this thing what do you think about it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you eat it why what should i review next anthony Fantana the evens in Makai Amy Farina the odds forever 
aVCMiepR6wA,hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review captain Murphy duality oh listen to captain Murphy he'll make you feel really dirty please don't hurt me it's captain Murphy duality is the debut mixtape from this super anonymous rap person or group I'm not really sure in fact most people are not and those who have worked closely with this project have been pretty tight-lipped in terms of identities people like super producer Flying Lotus and Odd Future member Earle who were both featured on a track of this tape but that has not stopped them from kind of landing on the short list of possibilities in terms of who captain Murphy is people have also guessed that captain Murphy may be weird West Coast MC 0 or even Tyler the Creator or maybe even just some random member of the brain feeder collective or some just unknown person however that last one I I wonder how plausible that really is considering there is kind of a budget or at least some manpower behind this project considering the visuals very high-quality colorful visuals that have been getting attached to some of this projects videos plus the fact that guys like Earl and Flying Lotus are within close collaborative reach and the connection this project has with Adult Swim in sampling its content the name of the project captain Murphy and the fact that one of the first tracks out from this project was featured in Adult Swim's singles collection and even though Flying Lotus on Twitter has openly denied that captain Murphy is some rapper that is already well-known using some kind of alias I can see why guys like Tyler and Earl have not just automatically dropped off this list because the similarity and rapping style is kind of cannae much of the time captain Murphy kind of seems to be thriving in the same lyrical vein that they do just a lot of lewd rhymes about wee dicks sex coupled with some kind of weird goofy Knick Knack references to anything and everything it's it's all pretty disjointed all kind of a dee dee some of you may get meaning out of these songs if you try to dive deeply enough into the lyrics especially out of the more slow and straightforward tracks like The Killing Joke or the song that pops in at the 5:30 mark of this very long mp3 file where they're kind of rapping about this world where they get away from the everyday grind of the world with these two girls that they met at the end of a show which does kind of come off as sort of poetic until the point where she says I'm a virgin and he's like I can smell it wha-ha-ha-ha-ha there are a lot of kind of goofy maniacal laughs all over this thing there are moments like that where some kind of small picture is being painted but for the most part I feel like Captain Murphy lyrically distracts from the fact that there really is no narrative no clear congruence in terms of just you know wow this is a story this is a concept it's kind of one non sequitur after another but the non sequiturs are a little limited to pretty much what would only be interesting to just like some young dude which in a way kind of becomes its own overarching theme but not really and you know the the real lack of an overarching theme on this tape is is actually somewhat disappointing especially when you consider all of the clips of sort of how to be a cult leader instructional video snippets that kind of interject from one section of the album to another it would actually be pretty cool to hear some songs that kind of touched on that especially since it is these audio clips that make a lot of spots on here pretty eerie if you are a hip-hop lyrics purist most likely this album will not be blowing your mind in terms of verbiage there are some verses on here that are pretty nice especially the last verse on the track The Killing Joke where it sort of painted that captain Murphy is this dark who character but also the Joker this aggressive chaos loving fiend but still even as this album is kind of chasing after these MF DOOM esque sound collages and and villainous musings it's not like this album comes off as incredibly deep for the most part I think lyrical purists are going to be listening to this album and kind of feeling like the moment on this mp3 at 2540 where the song kind of fizzles out these bong bubbles introduced themselves and who was rapping on the track just now kind of giggles to himself and just as stupid and even though this album lyrically and narrative Lee is disjointed and just all over the place that's not to say that the one guy or several guys maybe in captain Murphy cannot rap they're actually quite good rapping they've got some tight flows a nice sense of groove and of tempo there's a lot of assonance in their rhymes while a lot of their lines do not make a whole lot of sense in terms of a story they just kind of rapid-fire one internal rhyme within a line after another to the point where it kind of becomes dizzying the only point where the flows get kind of sloppy is when these guys try to rap especially fast but I feel like in a way captain Murphy is kind of conscious of that like one of the opening tracks to duality Mighty Morphin for skin we're toward the end of the track he kind of goes this rapid-fire flow and it just kind of ends within a bit though the album does have this villainous kind of outward image it's generally silly and entertaining the kind of album that would reference a shaman eating ramen in the parking lot or dancing the dougie with the devil in the moonlight the production on this tape though is a completely different story for me it's actually kind of makes this album palatable it's colorful it's kind of dark and moody it enhances the cartoony nature of the vocals and I would actually say to an extent it is psychedelic it reminds me of artists like Quasimodo and Shabazz Palaces and I wouldn't be surprised if Flying Lotus have produced more tracks than just between friends on this tape while the lyrics can be fun these beats and these effects all over this tape really kind of take precedent in a way at least for me because especially in the last third of this LP captain he isn't really offering all that much that's new in terms of concepts plus a lot of these verses on these tracks can be kind of short not really all that wordy and these songs themselves that these verses are in tend to last about one to three minutes each if there are in fact lyrics in the track and it's not just kind of like an instrumental moment or another sound collage it's actually kind of a barrage of little songs but it actually ends up feeling pretty consistent because the beat style because of the rhyming and how creatively and interestingly they are segwayed with not only these snippets from this cult leader instructional video but some really awesome beat changes in segues I actually think some of the beats on this tape are some of the best hip hop instrumentals I've heard this year like the really soulful funk vibes coming off the song Mighty Morphin for skin there's some awesome heavenly background vocals on that track too there is kind of a weird snappy take on boom-bap that comes in right after with a little instrumental that has kind of these strange muddy dark and moody guitar arpeggios matched up with this repeated trumpet interval and the moment on this tape that starts around the five thirty mark when that rush of instrumentation comes in with the tinny guitars some of the drum rolls in there along with the keyboard playing it just kind of feels like something straight out of the late 60s early 70s the introduction to a nice piece of psychedelic pop possibly in fact a lot of the sounds on this tape feel like they were lifted from the 60s or 70s which is nothing new for hip-hop production but it ends up feeling just a tad bit darker than you would normally expect something to use that kind of source material and that is helped out especially by a lot of the vocal effects that are on this LP for the most part when captain Murphy seems to be rapping on these songs there is some pitch shift stuff going on with the vocals to make them a few levels lower sometimes the production pitch shifts two sections of vocals lays them on top of each other for a pretty strange effect as well and that keyboard sound what is it like a Celeste on the track between friends the Flying Lotus produced just that did gain that plinky metallic melody on that track it's eerily beautiful and just the similarity of that track just textually stylistically with other beats on the south now that leads me to believe that maybe just maybe Flying Lotus might have made another instrumental or two on this thing the only instrumental to me that really felt out of place is when these guys kind of hopped on an instrumental from that new tonight EP that dropped earlier this year and I just didn't really feel like it kind of fit in with the flavor of this LP and didn't really kind of go with the strange cartoony and kind of blunted feel that this tape brought so far overall I actually liked this tape I thought it was very creative very animated kind of one chamber after another of weirdness I loved a lot of the instrumentals I love the way that they brought these tracks together that could have seemed very disjointed but because of how they were linked very logically and very interestingly this project flowed really well the only thing that I wish came about on duality is that captain Murphy created a lyrical world that came off as deep and as interesting as the instrumentals and just the overall sound of this thing sometimes captain Murphy does sort of succeed at creating kind of a world around this character but sometimes especially on a track like Killing Joke where he kind of makes this jab about I'm anonymous you'll never find out who I am it just feels really gimmicky and goofy I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on duality if you've given it a listen I imagine some of you have what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan oh captain murphy see you lab forever [Music] you 
1X9VpeohkLY,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Hollie Herndon movement holly is an experimentalist a sonic adventurer and electronic avant-gardist and a laptop er and even though this is her debut full-length her musical adventures far precede the release of this project from studying for her electronic music masters at Mills College to actually spending quite a bit of time in Europe to immerse herself in techno music culture as a DJ and all of these experiences translate into some very perplexing sound scapes by widening experimentations and a few odd dance pieces that when you bunch them all together they create a pretty bold short somewhat disjointed but pleasing album this LP is seven tracks long thirty-six minutes in total a few of these seven tracks are about at the one or two minute mark and the album starts off with maybe what is one of its most abstract pieces the eight minute song terminal the song begins with these waves of white noise disappearing and reappearing in this sort of rhythmic matter then it kind of goes from these very slow waves to these fast flutters from the left to right channels as this progresses some very fat deep dark subterranean bass tones kind of start rumbling in the background and then this vocal sample kind of pops up and starts scaring away on this tempo that wasn't completely clear until they had kind of introduced themselves and the song evolves into just this dark heavy electronic epoch that is unapologetically digital as I listen to this piece I just think of like an ultra futuristic city where where nothing is sort of biological or living or breathing there are a lot of electronic artists out there right now in newer styles of electronic music that are working so hard to kind of incorporate a lot of acoustic sounds into their compositions or just natural sounding textures but there's something also to be said about what Holley is doing with her music which is just sticking to the colder and more calculated side of things the more robotic side of things and this is done without wavering as she introduces her own vocals and guest vocals on to some moments with these tracks it's just that the catch with Holly of introducing vocals and her pieces is that she manipulates them so heavily that they actually become a part of her very digital vocal compositions this is most notably done on songs like breathe and de la toe where vocals are taken on both of those tracks and just transformed until they're just glitchy shells of their former selves and to me these are two of the most gripping moments on the entire album and it's kind of funny considering how the song breathe really doesn't have anything obviously musical about it maybe a few tones kind of ring out here and there especially toward the end but what the song is really about is just taking the sound of breathing just this sound that we live with until the day that we die and twisting and bending it with all these layers and reversals and pitch shifts and weird edits and distortions to the point of surrealism to the point of being unbearably eerie and on this album Holly also toys with one of the most appealing things about electronic music in general that is the dance beat the track on the selfie fade has these very cold house rhythms hanging in the background with a lot of synthetic base and just synthesizer tones that feel equally electronic aside from the groove of the song which you know does kind of get my head bobbing the only thing that is remotely human about the track is Herndon's vocal which is kind of prominent in the track I do actually think she buries it a little bit among the other sounds in the song and she obscures it a bit too with a very heavy tremolo effect which makes it difficult to hear what she's saying if she is in fact saying anything but still her voice doesn't seem that strong whether it is because of the mix or just her singing in general even though the song is one of the most accessible spots on the album that is something I do wish was kind of louder on this track but overall I love the progression of this track she definitely knows how to build and continue a song in this style and keep it engaging the way the groove shifts around the 250 mark is a really nice change the other main dance oriented piece on this track are the songs control and the movement again with these two pieces together Holly marries very strange weird vocal effects with some danceable beats and these vocals that that Holly is manipulating she shifts them into all shapes and sizes throughout this track even though there are all these vocals around the track I feel like they aren't really placed into an interesting pocket within the song they kind of pop up and swirl around the synthesizers and the beat chaotically as opposed to kind of enhancing what what they're doing in my opinion at this point I would definitely say that Holly has my attention in terms of just electronic music and experimental music I would just love to see another release from her in the future with more material and more cohesion maybe something a little more conceptual but who knows that sort of thing may come out naturally if you were to do an album that was twice this albums like I'm feeling a decent a strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what should I review next counter chesta anthony Fantana Holly Herndon forever 
nga4paDJ6c0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review goat world music alright yeah these guys are a swedish instrumental experimental and psychedelic rock band who pretty much where their influences on their sleeves when it comes to the title of this debut album of theirs while this collective is a rock band at heart they kind of lilypad from one musical culture to another as they transition from one Jam to another across these nine tracks the band moves from tribal drum circles to Afrobeat grooves to what kind of seems like very windy desert rock that would definitely fit the bill of a band like tonari when to an extent this band is able to paint some musical portraits of foreign lands with not much more than guitars drums vocals with a little keyboard and saxophone added on as well however this fans approach to world music isn't exactly authentic or rootsy or anthropological in nature in fact it is pretty gentrified with lots of guitar distortion elements of psychedelic rock and this modern indie band lo-fi style recording and I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing these guys are definitely taking these influences and twisting them to their own slightly punked-out whims I'm just saying I don't think world music purists are gonna see much use in this record the angle that this album will most likely see success with are with people who are into Garage and psychedelic rock and are kind of seeing this element of African music or middle-eastern music through in as kind of an interesting piece of novelty I personally would not call myself a world music purist but I do think the way that this band incorporated a lot of these foreign elements into their garage and psychedelic rock is is kind of flimsy I don't want to say these guys haven't listened to a lot of world music because of course I don't know what they have her head now listened to but to me a lot of tracks on here whether it's because of a lack of musicianship or just a lack of experience are really able to move past the musical stereotypes of the genre or the style of music that goat is trying to infuse into this mix of psychedelic and garage rock take the songs let it bleed and disco fever for example two tracks on here that are clearly influenced by afro beat and and really kind of embrace the genre tightly to the point where the band's psychedelic rock influences aren't really at the forefront but when it comes to afro beer just generally African rock the rhythm guitars the beats the vocal melody - it's it's all pretty generic there's nothing electrifying about what they have written on these tracks or really how they're playing them together I don't really get a lot of fire from hearing these guys play these songs out and kind of jam them and the thing is I don't really feel like they do either because if they did they would certainly string these songs out longer than just kind of an average length wouldn't they I mean the longest track on here is just under eight minutes and it's the last song and as this track kind of pads itself out its delivering all these very kind of lazily improvised organ notes that don't really add up to much however I do like the ending of the track which is pretty explosive with the theme melody of that song and the opening track it's really one of the more ambitious parts on this LP just you know kind of ambition I was showed up a bit more however I will not say this album is completely underwhelming or uninteresting I do think the fusion of influences and just genres that go has put together on this LP is a pretty good idea there are moments on here like goatman they have some pretty strong wah guitars and fuzz bass some chanting and African drums to me the track works so well conceptually that it just feels like these styles of music were meant to be together the song go ahead kind of ends up entertaining me for similar reasons despite some slightly flat singing and the track goat lord is is actually kind of a piece of psychedelic folk very mystical actually slightly pretty ethereal spacious it's kind of the album's cooled down before the very burning closer overall I mean I was pretty indifferent on this LP to be completely honest I was excited at first because with just the mix of sounds that I was hearing but as I do further into this album just the lack of musicianship and just musical ideas had me just feeling very cold and because that's not there this album merely functions on some interesting sounds textures and just the novel idea of just these two musical worlds coming together and that does work to an extent but just not so far for me that I ended up liking the LP I'm kind of feeling a strong two decent five on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana go bro 
6FEm1bx7_mc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd it is time for a vinyl video going through my collection we plowed through the last one we're in the essence now we're getting to the esses and as promised puppey mick person AKA nori nori to pup love you we're uh we're housebreaking at the moment still trying to get this puppy housebroken we haven't had a lot of accidents you know we've we've been creating the puppy you know making sure you know get that newspaper down get those puppy pads down keep things clean keep things sanitary you know get her outside on a regular basis but still any advice any suggestions greatly greatly appreciated because the faster just pokes out broken the faster I don't know you love getting pet you love getting love all right enough puppy time we are getting into extreme stuff right here will not really extreme screaming females what if someone is watching their TV is a great indie rock slash punk slash post-punk LP female fronted the band is still kicking um a lot of people want their new stuff I'm not really heavy into the new stuff to me they're older stuff is is a little more interesting it's a bit harder and um I guess the other word that I'm looking for is maybe produced a little bit better as well I guess uh there's just not a lot of surprises for me on the newer LPS though you know that they're still listenable they're still good they're so good I can see why people are still into the band you know they certainly haven't faltered or started making terrible music I just prefer albums like this and Power Move you know as well I actually like the from what I understand the band's front woman also does all this art for the band too and I like how you've kind of got these weird portraits that go along with every single song you know story-wise you know it's not like it's not like you know you get lyrics you get a picture and you know the lyrics are great and the lyrics on this album are very audible I actually do find it pretty interesting that we get a we get kind of a painting with with each with each song Shabazz Palaces black up kind of a you know an LP that I have that I love but I don't typically show sticking out here because it just helps black you know although you can't see it right there there we go Shabazz Palaces looks good although I do like the the insert cover on this it's very nice in this car itself is like kind of you know it has kind of like this plastic feel to it it's not like you know it's it's it's got kind of a velvety feel to it but um I do like the insert I like this picture I like that face it's kind of like futuristic but also kind of tribal it's weird I have a song listing there full of some of these song titles that go on for like 10 sentences very nice pressing of the record good job Sub Pop on this one not only with bringing the band into the fold but you know just putting out a good pressing so birju's American Water David Berman man hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly you know of course malkmus as well on this LP not really much to say about the packaging but really I mean the record great verbose indie rock with kind of an alt country twang to it great album back in the day when I used to make old videos you know my older videos I used to use them the song random rules is like my theme song before you know that wasn't cool to do because copyright slit EP I wish I had a spy girl and on vinyl one day I'll own it I mean you know I'm young I can you know it'll happen one day just got a search just got a you know make the effort go online buy it but I but this EP is pretty decent definitely check it out if you haven't uh if you only heard spider land the EP is pretty good the EP is pretty good black touch and go records Simon and Garfunkel Sounds of Silence great full album very quaint quiet poignant beautiful folk album I definitely do not think Simon and Garfunkel get enough credit for you know kind of a making the kind of music that they did that I think is is very influential today in a lot of ways but still I don't think that credit gets do you know Simon and Garfunkel is not hip for a lot of people Chris Capello and I you know in turn Chris aka have talked about that on several occasions snake-oil Connecticut psychedelic rock and just instrumental rock band hey puppy hey baby she's like

I mean it's it's dark it's it's dark you know try it out try it out this is the the second Sun album I bought there's actually a live album Dom Kirk this is a piece I want to continue through this there's a piece that was actually commissioned from them I believe and you know like it like I said a live performance in this church area and there are spots on here I believe where there's like organ involved with the the the music I mean it's it's it's a pretty heavy Pease not really one of the most varied albums that they've ever put together you know it's it there is some redundancy in terms of chord progressions on these tracks but just like the concept the live performance they really put their all into this live performance in terms of just you know creating a sound and just this live recording in general I mean it's a great live recording it sounds just as great as it would in the studio with Sun I mean you know you wouldn't necessarily know it's a live recording you know not not in the way that you know live recordings can have kind of imperfections to them I mean you know it sounds live in the sense that it's so much bigger and much more gargantuan just kind of enhanced by the room that they're playing in um so yeah I mean great great listen great experience of drone Doom live Sun and that's it all right we're gonna get back into this at another time thank you for watching the needle drop and puppy and vinyl forever [Music] you 
1GyJexedwEU,hi everyone Anthony Fant pano here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Action Bronson rare chandeliers and The Alchemist Action Bronson is a New York MC who I have been relatively silent on over the past couple years in terms of reviews mostly because I've up until this point only thought he was just kind of okay plenty of people have compared his earlier work to guys like Ghostface Killah but my issues with his music really kind of went a little bit further than that beyond the ghost phase thing his music to me in general kind of felt just murd in 90s hip-hop nostalgia with no real focus outside of just kind of making his music sound and feel old-school lots of boom bap beats tight wordy flows rhymes that are violent and braggadocious projects like dr. Lecter and Bon Apetit really kind of had me feeling just short of being really impressed and while in my opinion action bronson in what he would rap about and just how his sound was working out felt kind of one-dimensional I would visit in with every project that he would drop after that and I could sort of see in a way that he was progressing I mean since bon appetit he's been releasing stuff pretty prolifically from his tape with party supplies his album with static Selecta and he's easily had a couple dozen LP tape and single features since then to appearing on tracks with guys like him and Smoke DZA rock Marciano and large professor apathy wrecks and mayhem Lauryn basically all this networking has made him pretty embedded in the East Coast underground hip-hop scene he's been building a narrative a personality and a name for himself improving on his flow in his lyrics and working more conceptual songs to his hard work is paying off and he's even attracting years from the west coast in the process most notably on this LP where he gets guys like schoolboy q evidence and of course the alchemist who produces every single instrumental on this tape not only that but I do think rare chandeliers is the best project bronson has put out so far The Alchemist beats on this tape are incredibly good and action bronson while he is still very brutish and braggadocious his usual rhymes about money drugs sex and food are so overblown that they become kind of outlandish ly hilarious except for maybe a moment of introspection like eggs on the third floor to kind of head into the instrumentals on this thing they're just great The Alchemist is not reinventing the wheel but he does a fantastic job of setting a certain kind of sound bed underneath action bronson it's got this boom bap hip-hop style combined with the kind of instrumental rock and soul as well as funk that would usually soundtrack a 70's action film or like a grindhouse movie like with the phat Basie beat the quick baseline and the soaring string sections on the title track or the track the cymbals which has this just really awesome guitar solo flowing through out it there's this warm bassline this pretty epic background chorus with some nice old-school vintage reverb on it the song the beat sounds like a back alley fight in like a Charles Bronson movie the track Sylvester Lundgren has some very sharp hard-hitting drums with some eerie tones kind of hanging very sparsely in the background it feels like a little bit of Rizzo worship and the jazz fusion melody and just syncopated rhythms on the track 10-10-10 demolition man it's just pure ear candy melodic beauty catches my ears right off the bat the introduction of the track eggs on the floor is this very ominous it's very spacious I love the way the piano and the guitar Kings are twined on that track and there's you know kind of like a little bit you know it's percussion in the background a little bit of triangle sort of reminds me of another track on blue chips that I loved especially because it didn't have a heavy beat in the background you have action bronson riding the tempo of the track but just to hear him over a track doesn't have a strong hip-hop rhythm to me is sort of breaking a rule feels a little unconventional and I love how actions lyrics on that track feel very paranoid very introspective it really fits the tone of the instrumental and the instrumental for bitch I deserve you has these really pretty piano embellishments I love the way that the horns feel very moody on that track as well and it's just one great instrumental after another for sure you're gonna have favorites but I don't think there's a moment even one time on this LP where he falters in a big way now as far as Action Bronson goes most of his lyrics on this LP go toward painting the picture of just this vintage powerful ass-kicking dude basically a dude that is living within and able to do whatever he wants in his own exploitation film fantasy money gets stolen salads get tossed there's puke on the floor there big meals being cooked a four year old boy is is getting sucked with by a prostitute and enemies are getting merked it's kind of cheap but very self-aware about it cartoony in a way and though a lot of what action says is kind of thrown in there for a cheap thrill where he actually ends up impressing and you know I kind of came to the realization that you know it is cheap thrills but it's not done cheaply is in just the vivid detail Action Bronson goes into when explaining some of these situations painting some of these pictures like in instance on the title track where he's doing a backflip he lands on one foot and he has a gun like ready to fire or a moment on another track where he's got a duck he snaps the neck puts it on a plate roasts it snaps his fingers then a waiter comes pours the wine it kind of paints an extravagant picture that to me I actually think Rick Ross in a lot of ways tries to paint but Action Bronson comes off so much more entertaining and charismatic and and funny he doesn't really take himself all that seriously on this LP and I think he looks for the listeners to either but still despite that he comes off as being very real and authentic because even though yeah it's just make-believe on this album he says a lot of what he says passionately like as if he really would be doing these things if he could sort of live out this fantasy in real life and pretty much all the features on this LP I can't really complain about any of them they all bring and enhance the gritty aesthetic everybody from Rocky Marciano to schoolboy q mayhem Lauren evidence Styles P Sean price and more I guess one more thing I want to note about this LP is that some tracks on here are kind of two-parters there can be this beat change that comes out of nowhere and totally switches the track up so in a way you're kind of getting two shorter songs within one song some of these transitions go over well some don't a few songs on here just around two minutes and I wish they were fleshed out a bit more kind of brought to a head but still most of the songs on here do have tight choruses tight verses they're catchy memorable have a lot of personality and I like the overall theme that Action Bronson is able to execute on this LP but in short I mean if you look at this cover you pretty much get auditorially what is on this cover if you want to hear this cover then listen to this mixtape and that's it I actually think this is one of the best mixtapes I've listened to all year period I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing what did you think if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana action bronson Eno forever [Music] 
cOlx2JNEe0I,hi everyone Anthony fan tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review vessel order of noise vessel is the pseudonym of a UK electronic music producer he is on the ever-growing triangle records which is pretty much a safe haven for producers that really prefer vast and open atmospheres in their music and on his debut full-length album mr. Sebastian Gainsborough aka vessel finds himself really kind of in league with this labels sensibilities but still managing to kind of hammer out a niche of his own bringing together elements of ambient music as well as IDM minimal techno and dub and let me tell you this album is dark not dark in a sort of dreary sad kind of way I mean dark like being thrown into a room where it's just so black in there you can't even see your hand in front of your face maybe in this very black dark room your eyes can adjust a little bit after peated listens and you could sort of make out shadows of some of the sounds on this record but still for the most part this album is like visual deprivation but kind of for your ears no matter what style of electronic music vessel seems to be kind of chasing after on on a given track with this LP the sounds are consistently murky and spacious chock full are just textures writing sequenced beats some of these tracks are just really wide really open difficult to kind of wrap your head around one of my favorites on this LP is like that stillborn dub the pattern on that track just has so many gaps in it it's kind of difficult to tell whether or not there's even really a pattern there at first and there are some tracks on here that are filled with sound not so spacious kind of just throw a lot at me such as the track images of bodies which isn't one of my favorite songs on this LP there are busier songs on this album that go well but this particular track the grooves and the sounds kind of swirling around it seem a bit out of sync either that or just the sound was kind of laid on top of the groove feel trivial like they're not really adding that much to the progression of the track there is actually an album that this help he reminds me of in a sense that Carter too devoid album transverse that came out earlier this year and while that in a way is is much more of an industrial outing this album kind of builds its tracks the same way it finds a groove it finds a beat and then just surrounds it with weird out there sounds although I wouldn't say the sounds that vessel kind of puts on top of these tracks are the weirdest I love that vessel creates just these throes of nothingness and just Berenice and then finds way to kind of inject some beauty into that it's sort of romantic in a way but still this is a very cold-blooded album even the tracks that have some pretty punchy beats come off as rather stony but still it is those moments where vessel kind of puts a glimmer of light into the abyss that makes these songs kind of darkened ear candy like the bouncing synth notes on the track leash which I hope I'm pronouncing correctly leech or the muddy strange bassline that comes out of nowhere on the track to moon dub however I don't feel like that magic translates with every track like with those songs I mentioned earlier there are moments where I do feel like the noises that vessel surrounds these tracks with come off as you know rather random and don't really add much to the narrative of the track and there are songs on here like - Moon dub that I feel like could have been so much bigger so much more well-developed a lot like the song Court of Lions which to me it's a song that comes in toward the end of this LP one of the most developed songs on this entire album really multi-phase the track kicks off with these metallic feeling rhythms with poly rhythms riding them in this bassline that's though it's like a thirty-second note bassline eventually everything kind of Peters out into the nothingness it kind of disappears it's like swimming and hanging and then it just kind of flies away into the nothingness and then all of a sudden this new baseline introduces itself and all of these heavenly scents of various shapes and sizes just come enveloping the rhythm and it's quite beautiful and then again there are songs on here like plain curves that to me what you hear toward the end of the song isn't really all that much different than what you hear at the beginning of the song and while the beat and the textures are cool I wish there was a little bit more development there still a majority of the tracks on here are pretty enjoyable if you are into music that does kind of enjoy a little bit of nihilism to it possibly a little bit of freezing cold darkness and despite the fact that there are a few potholes here and there all these songs do fit into a well groomed and conceived style that is also well produced and just filled with some really interesting sounds feeling a strong six to a lay seven on this what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what should I review next and that's it thanks for watching vessel order of noise forever 
p_dtw1AgXZE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd with a hoodie and it's time for a review Rat King Wiki 93 Rat King is a New York City hip-hop four-piece with two MCS Wicky and hack and two producers Sporting Life and Tom Mullen and these guys are an alternative hip-hop outfit a bunch of teenage dudes bringing a modern sound and style that is kind of adventurous a little left-field to that gritty sound and aesthetic that people love about New York hip hop a lot of sharp crispy drum machine beats combined with samples that are just looped and manipulated backwards and forwards ad nauseam and special they kind of become these chaotic beds of sound together these crisp beats in this strange sampling style totally creates the grimy urban landscape that Rat King thrives in though I will say to an extent the instrumentals are a little bit basic while there is some noise in some chaos going on it's not like you're hearing layers and layers and layers of sound it's quite straightforward most of the time the only track that really came off to me as being especially detailed and and kind of glitchy is a song comic which in its groove actually kind of had a grime quality to it now as far as and seeing flow lyrics go on here while hack does appear at some pivotal points on this LP for the most part when you give this a listen you are going to hear wiki and on pretty much every track here he spits raw and relentlessly for the most part shooting for one of those freeform lyrical styles where you can just jump from one topic to another at the drop of a hat though a lot of these lyrics do kind of come down to similar themes money evil the city violence and wiki does come off with a lot of energy and just flow he can really kind of hold his own against these pretty simple beats especially on tracks like wiki speaks and pretty picture I think older hip-hop fans will definitely pick this kid up and here a tallied quali like flow and cadence on a lot of these songs and I will say that not every song here comes off as being completely freeform there was a track on here that did kind of feel like a weird phone conversation between him and a friend of his six four six seven oh four two six one oh so I'm trying to sex for sex ring ringing hello food is this is this a restaurant yes what's your most popular thing on the menu all the way causal one do I know you you sound you sound really familiar you sound like I know you no don't don't know yet see you later overall I do like the style of sound and the energy of Rat King but where this album seriously is lacking and I mean seriously seriously lacking it is in songwriting and it is in focus a lot of these tracks don't really come through with a concept and because they don't they tend to sort of meander I feel like wikis enthusiasm only goes so far when I'm not really hearing a lot lyrically that's kind of stopping me in my tracks Wiki certainly does not come off as a cheap lyricist you know he's not pulling a bunch of silly shots and just throwing a bunch of dumb lines out there he feels passionate about what he says it's just that it all kind of feels cluttered and it doesn't really come together in such a way where it packs a punch this is really a growing problem on tracks like piece of I think the most focused track on here was the song comic which was pretty great in terms of just its energy and how it exploded but the song took about a minute to start and it only lasts for about two minutes after that and once it does get going it becomes this pretty exciting barrage but there's really not much more to it than that to be blunt I do enjoy the potential of this project a lot I think Rat King has style and when you sitter that their first big label releases on Excel recordings if the label sticks with them there can be a lot of push behind this band's next full-length project I am finding plenty of things to admire it's just that on the tracks here which you would imagine because the brevity of the album the band would kind of jump in jump out with something really quick snappy entertaining but that just didn't happen for me despite the just relentless energetic rapping which actually comes to the point of screaming on the song comic for the most part I might have liked this a little bit but I really kind of feel like maybe I'm kind of indifferent toward this I'm feeling kind of a strong five to a lay six on this if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next thank you for listening Anthony Fantana Rat King Wiki 93 forever 
zYx3RYer3V8,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Deftones koi no yokan Deftones are a california rock band and one of the few to be considered in league with the new metal movement of the late 90s and early 2000s but are still taken pretty seriously in the music world and in retrospect their music was much more well developed and less hokey than a lot of their imitators who sort of came out of the woodwork once songs like change in my own summer hit the airwaves for sure Deftones had a heavy modern radio metal sound but they mix that with some very atmospheric beautiful and an ethereal elements as well kind of bouncing back and forth between these two sounds on any given song now the band has kind of become one of those groups who has one awesome amazing album white pony that is constantly compared to every single thing they do afterwards and while the self-titled LP the band dropped in 2003 did not live up to the success of white pony it really didn't live up to it for more than the reason that it was not white pony I mean the usual amount of melody and just harmony and sonic Beauty that the band brought to the table wasn't there Deftones for sure we're trying to go heavier but they're really not one of these massive heavy badass bands in my opinion however in my opinion the band bounced back big-time with the album Saturday night wrist maybe my favorite Deftones LP post white pony Deftones were sounding as heavy as their self-titled LP but just newer more modern production had them sounding more lush than ever I mean that beautiful more atmospheric side of the band just got bigger and better in my opinion chinos vocals Tino Marino vocalist frontman the way his vocals are mixed on LP the way they soar over the rest of the music just kind of gives me chills I mean to me the band's sound just grew to a galactic level on this album and they started incorporating some some elements of music outside of alternative metal the sounds of shoegaze as well as post metal post rock - I thought and I would say art rock - there were spots on here where I thought man has Deftones been listening to some Radiohead while this album is still you know definitively a Deftones album not something that I think is going to win over haters you know it certainly sounds like a Deftones album on the surface they were definitely working to just add in other elements and make an album that I thought was much more mature its albums like Saturday night riffs that really justified the admiration that Deftones God as they plow through the 2000s you know because when it comes to alternative metal and when it comes to new metal it wasn't the the jump the FOB riffs and the vocal delivery and just the grooves with the catchy choruses that made the genre bad what made the genre terrible and and still is that many of the genres all-stars kind of refused to change and grow and evolve and when some artists did try to change they went even Kitsch here by trying to hop on the whole rap metal bandwagon now even though to me Deftones were sounding fantastic on this LP Saturday night wrist wasn't a winner for every Deftones fan definitely not their heaviest in their catalog and some people do like them sounding heavier which is where kind of diamond2 eyes comes in which is by no means a bad album to me it's it's kind of the LP that their self-titled album should have been while it does come off much more straightforward much heavier much more riff oriented it does kind of have a certain level of finesse to it that I thought the self-titled record lacked but now with the band's new LP I kind of feel like we're getting a bit of deja vu here back in 2003 when the band had a really hard album coming out shortly afterwards they put out a much more atmospheric ethereal and experimental LP and now we have koi no yokan which in comparison to its predecessor like Saturday night wrist is much more atmospheric kind of ethereal but only a bit though while this LP is definitely not as heavy as diamond dies as far as Deftones atmospheric or more experimental side goes this LP doesn't really bring anything new to the table now that wrists and diamond eyes are under the Deftones belt it kind of feels like Deftones as usual the LP opens up with the track swerve city which is this song that to me dishes out one of the most basic riffs that I've ever heard this band play there's nothing really extraordinary about it and the song kind of glides effortlessly from verse to chorus diverse with really no detail or tension or build-up the song romantic dreams is even more lacking in structure the verse and the intro is pretty good it's moody it sets a tone chinos vocals come off as very passionate but then this riff just comes out of nowhere that changes the entire feel of the song it really comes off as very pasted on and the chorus on the track is even more out of place the track in tune sees Deftones taking a kind of ethereal I'm aspheric approach slower it's a little more valid like melodic I do like the chorus on that track but still that song and and another track on here like graphic nature which is much more hard-hitting one of those Deftones tracks where you get kind of a weird quirky noisy riff that has a strange groove to it then it slides into a very smooth chorus while these tunes are by no means awful it's really just kind of Deftones by the numbers at this point and the song rosemary while I did like what the band was trying to do with that track definitely do something slower break things up it's the longest track on the entire LP there's a beautiful synth scape kicking the track off but as the band transitions from kind of one slow blobby moment to another the track does kind of lose momentum as far as highlights on the self he goes certainly the track leathers stop me in my tracks really one of the most hard-hitting and energetic songs on this entire LP and the way the riff goes and the lyrics the screamed vocals feel against that riff it's got a strong post-hardcore vibe to it I really am and I really do think the track may have the best chorus on this entire LP I love the vocal melody on this tracks the song poltergeist has an extremely memorable riff to it that just sticks in my head really I mean came out at me on on this LP as I listened through numerous times in the song tempest while at first does kind of feel like your average Deftones song and it is a bit quieter there are some just surprised explosive moments that really kind of catch me off-guard even as I listen to the track again and again and again it's it's a nice shock not to mention the track has another solid course and the song gauze has another solid chorus as well no no no nice down tune riffing on that track and what I like so much about that particular song is that yeah while it is catchy it is straightforward there's a bit more detail in the song structuring on that track and to go back to kind of the complaint train the closing track on here really just kind of feels like another one of those stereotypically very quiet closers that you know wasn't particularly beautiful or pretty or even felt like a closing track it just kind of felt out of place on the rest of the LP because of how sort of underwhelming it was you know while this album wasn't terrible and to an extent I did like it I feel like the Deftones at this point on this album are kind of in a very comfortable spot definitely not working to do what they usually do and that is find some interesting ways to fuse other styles of music and just new sounds with their metal stylings again I feel like this LP goes back to that Saturday night wrist territory but this album kind of ends up being less expansive less atmospheric it's sort of the middle ground between wrists and diamond dies which may please some fans a lot but to me those two records are are great and are totally representative of that more ethereal and just heavier side of Deftones for the band just make a record that feels like it's in the middle I don't know you know those extremes aren't there because of that because those aren't there the excitement is sort of you know tamp and I'm Fiona light to decent six on this LP what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and that's it I hope you're well thank you for watching Anthony Fantana Deftones forever [Music] 
HZswTkpdlfs,hi everyone Anthony fan tanno here in ow Internet's busiest music nerd and it's I'm psyched I'm psyched I'm psyched to be reviewing music for you guys on a regular basis Jessica Pratt self-titled Jessica Pratt is a San Francisco singer-songwriter who takes a pretty vintage approach to writing and recording fault music is Pratt's drug of choice and you know even though there's quite a bit of fault music out there today modern fault music Pratt's I guess sort of approach to it just sounds completely alien to the fleet foxes and the bony bears and the Mumford & Sons stylistically and emotionally Pratt clearly comes from a time that is before the loudness war and digital recording techniques and the internet though revivalism and bringing back older trends and music is quite in vogue in the Internet age so then when it comes to that Pratt's aim is really basically contemporary folk in the 60s artists like Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell and Pratt brings a very simple skeletal raw and and warm album in this style this LP is pretty much guitar and vocal with the occasional background voice or sort of vocal guest and Pratt carries this very slow patient and pretty theme throughout the entire album now I just mentioned the vocals let me go back to them they might be the most original and interesting thing on this entire LP something that despite the simplicity of the music on this album may come out and grip you and make you think hey hey hey hmm hey Jessica's got a very light voice there nasally voice it's got kind of this weird little vibrato on it hey it's actually quite lovely kind of enchanting maybe in kind of a joanna newsom sort of way but not as strange or as alienating the opening track of this LP lays out this canvas a very gently finger picked arpeggios over which pradd just Oh dishes out these Pleasant vocal melodies just brushing them with finesse left and right and even though the makeup instrumentally of this album is simple I like that Pratt does develop her vocal melodies her vocal melodies are anything but simple and kind of summersault do backflips swell in volume fall down there's a lot of detail to the way she sings over these guitar arpeggios now the lyrics that Pratt is singing duralee come off as terribly direct on this LP she's not really the most urgent of storytellers but nonetheless comes off very sincere and emotive and the things she says and sings about for the most part Pratt relies on disjointed visuals of summer days and dragging her feet across a parking lot Hollywood rivers mirrors roads lovers it's like a calming friendly personal and welcoming word salad or sort of like a cherished compilation of experiences that practicing's about very fondly and handles like mementos now this LP from what I understand is kind of a compilation of recordings that were written and created over the past five years so this album doesn't really come off as a wholly conceived collection of tracks however despite the the sort of sany sany sound songs do stick out and it is just a testament to Pratt's ability to song right that that actually happens Jessica does drop off little melodic or lyrical quirks in each track that does kind of at least make them stick out enough to feel like I'm progressing through the album like the booing vocals at the start of the track half between the Jessi which is strange song title the track streets of mine has Jessi reaching into her falsetto and to me it's it's really one of the more straightforward tracks chord progression wise on the entire album pretty catchy and over the bridge there's an interesting chord change that on paper I wouldn't think would go over that well but she really pulls it off with some finesse and one of the final tracks on here titles under pressure has this finger pick pattern where Jessica basically throws in this heart-wrenching descending bass melody that I imagine she's pulling with her thumb is she's going along with with this song and it is just it's it's a standout moment on the LP for me as far as negatives go on this LP there are tracks on here that do kind of pale in comparison to others there is kind of a lack of Sonic variety like I mentioned earlier because this album isn't really conceived as a holistic piece and some of the moments on here that do kind of break instrumentally the consistency by throwing in like another vocal or something like that like the closing track dreams the extra vocal on there it's not even really performed all that well and it just kind of makes this song feel weird plus a lot of similar finger picking patterns are used throughout this entire LP and there are even some moments where they're just some glaring mistakes like right at the beginning of the song Kaspar which I mean really kind of has the song off to a sort of shaky start I have to say Jessica Pratt on this LP does kind of just play the guitar except ibly you know the guitar playing just kind of does what it needs to do if I were to hear more releases from her in the future I would love to hear just a bit more Flair from her playing I do think there is a pretty strong foundation here and that kind of has me excited while I am not in love with this LP if things into the future get kind of fleshed out and built upon instrumentally production wise as well Jessica Pratt could be you know kicking butt kind of feeling a like decent seven on this LP what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why what should i review next and that's it thank you for watching I love you Anthony Fantan oh Jessica Pratt forever 
XtGC_QIIHnc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the third self-titled installment from the band Crystal Castles oh hey Danny don't be an asshole Eva good review - that new great still cancels oh it's catchy Crystal Castles is an electronic music duo from Canada Ethan cath is handling production and Alice glass vocals and lyrics although I'm sure there's collaboration coming from both ends during the creative process I have been enjoying and following Crystal Castles since they put out their debut full-length album and what I have always liked about the duo is that they typically bring a pretty wide array of sounds and influences to their releases there are typically elements of synth pop experimental music lo-fi music dream pop synth punk as well as shoegaze and house I just loved the variety of electronic flavors on that album as well as the quirky personality the catchy songwriting and instrumentals in kind of the the left-field direction of just the music itself now the band's sophomore LP people seem to enjoy much more on the hole but I just was not as big on it there were some huge singles on there that I enjoyed a lot but there were also a great deal of tracks that made production choices that I just did not care for at all and the songs that I liked I I think I liked a lot mostly because they had elements that just reminded me of tracks from the debut album even though I did like the album to me it still kind of felt like Crystal Castles was in the midst of a developmental stage but on three I feel like Crystal Castles finally realizes exactly what tracks from their sophomore album work kind of hinting toward and you know I welcome that change for a band to make the same album over and over and over again it just gets boring however I can't really say I'm favoring the direction that Crystal Castles is heading in on this new LP either a lot of the songs on the selfie feature overly simplistic beats that just do not really have that much personality when it comes to groove or rhythm especially Tambor I mean some of the beats on here did not make me nod my head in the slightest especially the track infection which was just laughably basic and the track telepath just kind of feels like a rehash of two or three other songs on this album I know Crystal Castles previous material wasn't exactly known for its complications but at least those records had kind of a fun personality to them fun is not necessarily in the in the cards on this LP not because Crystal Castles wanted to make a bad album but they intentionally shoot for something a bit darker on this release but end up creating something that is a step down in in flavor production however still the direction that Crystal Castles moves in with this LP it is well-intentioned I do think the band ended up making their most cohesive album yet Ethan Kaif clearly was trying to produce a lot of these tracks in a similar way in terms of the way they felt the way they sounded the way things were positioned in the mix however I just think it ends up making this album feel kind of redundant one no look to my review of the track playing that was released before this LP the track starts off with an OK driving beat it lacks an interesting melody and tries to mask that with these pulsating bright high-pitched synthesizers that are just Banshee blaring over Alice clases vocals which are just obscured to death with with reverb the track wrath of God plays the same hand and so does the song sad eyes although that song has a much more bouncing melody and ends up kind of feeling like a darker take on like a 90s piece of dance pop I do feel like previous tracks like baptism and Celestia did kind of pave the way for the material on this LP but I just don't see how obscuring Alice glasses vocals even further on this new LP enhances Crystal Castles sound again like I said in my review of plague this just kind of reminds me of Grimes but with you know a different kind of synth and beat set but I mean honestly after listening through to this LP I much prefer Grimes what just kind of further acts me about the reverb and just kind of positioning instruments in the way that it makes things more obscured there are some worthwhile melodies on these tracks the tracks pale flesh and affection despite the beat on that track that I don't really care for do have catchy melodies that do get kind of crushed and suffocated and sloppy bad production it kind of sounds like a really great detail drawing that was violently finger painted over by a group of kids and just kind of smudged sonically especially that sweet melody change toward the end of the track sad eyes over the bridge though yeah you can hear and it's obvious it just feels really dampened and kind of underwhelming because all the repetitive and less interesting things are pulsating as loud as possible up in the front I think the song transgender as a worthwhile melody as well and is definitely example of a track on here that Crystal Castles structured pretty nicely with it with a pretty long slow and enchanting intro the choruses really explode on that track and there's a lot of momentum behind the beat I don't think Crystal Castles stopped writing good electro pop tunes I just think they stopped producing them well this album to me is just another piece of proof that reverb has kind of become the new Distortion it's being sort of overused it's sort of being used to replace musical ideas and while it does make a lot of tracks on this album sound pretty heavenly glossy big and epic it's not necessarily so interesting that it works as the primary focus of an entire album take a listen to the second to last track on here mercenary while it is texturally Pleasant musically it's extremely bland I think the only song on here are true we truly loved was the closer which was actually a big heavenly piece of dream pop actually pretty gorgeous some sparkling sounds hanging suspended in air on this track there was a nice atmosphere around it and the way Alice glasses vocal melody felt it had kind of a lullaby quality to it which was very fitting for a closer overall I just did not like the production moves again on this album I think Crystal Castles is kind of just moving toward an aesthetic I don't really care for at all I seriously think this album contains all of the potholes of Crystal Castles too but basically doesn't have the really massively strong singles like not in love and baptism to kind of carry the whole thing while there are tracks on this album I did like none of them were the singles and the ones that I did enjoy I just you know wasn't really enjoying them so much that I would return to this album solely to hear them honestly I am feeling a decent too strong for on this LP what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Crystal Castles the heats coming on forever [Music]

h7nbd-Cg-CY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review brian eno lux hey hey brian eno is a producer multi-instrumentalist musical philosopher tinkerer songwriter and one of the godfathers of ambient music I've enjoyed his music for quite some time maybe not as long as others considering what are considered to be his best albums or released before I was even born however his contributions to ambient music as well as art rock and art pop are very long-standing and can be felt on many modern records including new LPS from MGMT Coldplay he's worked with other great artists like u2 and Laurie Anderson Devo Talking Heads his forward-thinking approach to music production and just music in general has permeated so many levels of music today from the obscure to the ultra popular and as this dude ploughs through his 60s he still puts out records and when he does people pay attention like in 2010 when he put out small craft on milk sea which was a collaboration with these guys and last year you know had a collaborative LP titled drums between the bells which was kind of a an album of ambient pieces featuring poetry from Rick Holland now with this new LP Lux even though Brian Eno has been releasing material that does have elements of ambient music within it this album is truly a return to his roots in this genre on this LP you just have four long-form ambient tracks reaching the 18 and 19 minute marks and these four songs just hand out one moment after another that are just very pretty they are very patient lush musical pieces that when you listen to them they really have the appearance of a starry sky or like a gargantuan mural because listening to music like this is is actually a lot like staring at a painting you know when you think about it when are you actually done staring at a painting when are you finished is the end of the painting there and even though the four songs here because of the nature of music do have a start and a finish this isn't really the kind of stuff you listen to for progression or momentum instead it's it's the musical stillness that Brian Eno creates on Lux that is so inspiring it's the musical equivalent to just everything freezing right there being suspended in air now Eno has done this on previous albums to various degrees the very beautiful and infamous ambien one music for airports is a prime example on this album Brian Eno kind of pens his ambient music philosophy in the liner notes and there's the LP Apollo which is a collaborative album where Brian Eno kind of explores the the darker drone e're and and more eerie sides of ambient music ambient for kind of goes down a similar Road and the LP discrete music kind of sees Brian Eno leaning in that ambient direction with some modern classical elements too however at this point Brian Eno breaks no new ground whatsoever with this new LP and to me that's kind of a letdown in a slight degree the only surprise that I found to be on this album is that Brian does bring in quite a bit of instrumentation to kind of make Lux happen yeah there's piano on here but as far as I can tell I'm also picking up scents and strings and guitars surely instruments you know has worked with before by find an interesting that he creates ambient pieces with all of these instruments together and finds places for each of them without coming out with a clearly patterned song surely everything on here works in tandem and there is a progression that can be followed if the listener decides to dive that deeply you know what's going on here and sometimes the instruments do work together to create a very obvious shift in mood the song Lux number three on this LP especially at its start does have a slightly sour and darker tone to it only slightly though nowhere on this album despite shifts like that does the music here kind of pull the listener out of the the stargazing mindset it's something that can be enjoyed musically or or text but only at a very very slow pace really the darker and earier side of Brian's work with ambient music does kind of get left out in the cold on this one as if the the cover art didn't already make that kind of a parent wrong I guess I just wish this album took advantage of the potential for ambient music in 2012 as opposed to just kind of recreating the 70s especially considering the the psychedelic directions that are that are possible and ambient music that have been explored by Eno before most notably on his collaboration with Robert Frick no pussyfooting I'm not going to say anything on this album really came off as as being bad I actually liked the first track quite a bit and that slightly darker turn on the third song did catch my attention and I do think Eno's mission on this album is very apparent and he completes it but he creates a mood on this album that if you're a fan of you know you know that he knows how to conjure this mood already at this point I'm sure it comes as natural as his shadow which is why you know I'm just kind of hmm okay okay all right and if it means anything to you I have found is previous ambient works to be a bit more evocative I'm kind of feeling a strong six to a lay seven on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantino Brian Eno forever 
bZtoB_Jf5CY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Bat For Lashes the haunted man bad flesh backlashes is an English singer-songwriter Natasha Khan and this is her third full-length LP and over the course of her career she's been known to bring her indie and art pop sensibilities together with electronics acoustic instrumentation and some pretty refined arrangements along with a very theatrical presentation and ultra emotive voice and in a pretty 80s chic and all of this stuff has gotten her a lot of praise and comparisons to people like Kate Bush Bjork Siouxsie and the Banshees however I think more and more she's been working to kind of progress past those influences a little bit and come closer to something of her own and while not completely realized in my opinion I do think this LP is the closest she comes to that after cons kind of skeletal debut album she created the LP two songs which is really like her most succinct LP kind of hand delivering a lot of very catchy hooks and she kind of brought a plethora of different sounds in there two tracks on this LP would feel pretty dark and rootsy like the song sleep alone or could even be very synthetic and dreamy like the single Daniel this album brought Cod to a new level of popularity and it's because she struck a really great balance between being artful and accessible meaning tuneful and and kind of strange but still the question comes up after a successful LP like this where exactly do you go next would con just kind of get poppier I think that would have pleast some fans and attracted more in the process possibly but I am happy to say that con and in longtime co-producer David Costin really had ambition and and curiosity get the better of them on this LP for this album Bat For Lashes brings on a much bigger array of guest musicians to make this LP happen and co-producers and it really shows up in the instrumentation on this album there's just a wider array of sounds and adds to the element of mysticism that's always there in Bat For Lashes music in a big way a lot like the intro and the verse on the track horses in the Sun they're very tribal drums on this track spectral background vocals some very weird acoustic Tambor's murky ominous hums and there's really twangy instrument in there too maybe a hammered dulcimer not sure definitely Kahn has kind of taken it to the next level with sound her and constant together with their Co producers do have a great appreciation for texture on these tracks and they use that to really make this album a journey make one song sound vastly different from another however I wouldn't really say back for Lashes has improved her songwriting game on this LP really added that much detail to it or that much adventure to it and I'm slightly let down by that because I did like what signs I was seeing of progression on this LP so far and I do think that this poppier approach that Natasha uses on many of these tracks worked so much better when she was working with a more synthesized sound on two suns and you know I do get that it's artpop it seems strange it seems out there but still underneath it all it's still you know poppy music and it's great the artists like Kahn can make music that is adventurous without it also simultaneously being marginalizing but I just don't think that she always reconciles these two sides of her personality all the time despite the extreme increase in production value on this LP a lot of the drum machine sounds that Kahn uses on this album feel kind of tinny maybe a little cheap in a way I'm sure it's an intentional juxtaposition but it just feels very awkward throughout many of these tracks which instrumentally especially with the arranged instrumentation feel very smooth and Swift and just effervescent effervescent and the drum machines just really kill that vibe however I would say those moments aren't plentiful it's not like that's most of the LP there songs on here like winter fields which start off with some very chilly woodwinds grow into very triumphant strings and while the vocal melody and the cadence of Kahn's voice do say Bjork to me very boldly the passion and the great chord progression in the song I mean is definitely there the pit orchestra percussion in the very subtle 4/4 beat in the background of that song I mean sound fantastic as well the song Laura another favorite of mine on this LP feels a lot like a very somber piano ballad that would sit nicely in the midst of like a glam rock album or something like that the hook melody is great I love the way it just flourishes the verses are nice and just dark and moody but just the the very high level of just drama and instrumental ambition on this track just makes me wish the song built into so much more I mean a lovely heavy climax at the end of that tune would have been great to me to not use this instrumentation to really build the song into another direction is kind of a missed opportunity in the song oh yeah could have had a much better chorus with with better lyrics as well and the track a wall feels a bit out of place and that it just kind of feels like a track from two suns one of the only tracks on this LP where I feel like calm kind of threw a left hook was on the title track where there's this surprised group of male vocals singing together in unison Natasha Khan's vocals just kind of fly-in in a very just loud passion to display its ear grabbing and she's singing against what sounds like a very glistening combination of synths and strings all this militaristic instrumentation grows underneath this and it's very tight it's very righteous very melodic kind of reminds me of some of the better moments off after clients parades that track to me is big that track to me is lovely that's not really a feeling I get on this album again until the very spacious closing track I thought most the songs on here were very good I love the vocals the production the instrumentation certainly con where's her influences on her sleeve but to me that's all right on this album the bigger issue to me is that the songwriting could have definitely been bigger more ambitious and that's all I got to say I really liked what I heard on here for the most part I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this LP what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why what should I review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana Bat For Lashes forever you 
tCcwnP9IPs4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the secret Eggman ding it translates to Lamb of God these guys are an Italian band and if you're going to make an accurate guess as to what kind of music is on this LP I would go with the album cover not maybe so much the title these guys are on Southern Lord Records this is their second full-length LP on the label I believe and they are one of many bands that around 2010 the label started supporting who were taking a much more heavy sludgy and metallic approach to hardcore punk but the secret separates themselves from bands on that label and other groups going down the same road like nails and black breath all pigs must die by presenting a pretty occult image as well as putting elements of noise in their music and most importantly black metal because there's definitely no question as to where the band is coming from influence lives as soon as the opening track hits as soon as the track geometric power hits just the guitar tone the speed at which the guitars are being strummed the mournful chords the way they resolve the sound is very black metal and it's just pumped up with this immensely loud distorted overbearing production style vivid and I think ultimately that's where this LP really impresses even though the heaviness and the speed and just the very consistently extreme vocals kind of drown out a lot of details I myself was slightly jaw dropped at the the sheer swiftness and intensity and ferocity that the band plays the track daily lives with which is just a 55 second song that ferocity that aggression it really is an asset on this LP that makes these songs just a truly blackened gauntlet of hardcore tuna CH nothing but fire blood raining from the skies corpses while I wouldn't say it's the most listened or punishing album on the planet it certainly is trying to be the king of that hill for 2012 and it certainly comes close to that if not you know totally does that with the blast beats speed headband riffs and vocals that sound like you're kind of getting a branding iron shoved into your eardrums however despite the volume speed aggression all that good stuff that you know I love and have brought up as as just very positive points with this LP and LPS and other reviews compiled with the fact that I am such a sucker for black metal chords I can't really say that I was impressed with what the secret brought on this LP in terms of songwriting certainly more listens reveal that there are real differences between these tracks the track heretic temple is maybe the slowest and longest song on this entire LP the band really hits riffs and chords and lets them ring out and in sort of a doom metal type fashion trying to create an atmosphere but it's not really something that actually ends up happening everything about the way this band sounds is just too overbearing to sound kind of atmospheric and really the song just feels like a slowed down version of what every tune before it has kind of been doing the chords in this track and many other songs are pretty generic as well as the guitar intervals this album does not have much of a melodic personality the secret is way more appealing on the following track which is blisteringly fast yeah the aggression there the speed is there but the riffs that the band uses on this song to kind of segue from one very high-powered moment to another feel just very deja vu as do the extremely DB influenced drums and the very kind of on dynamic vocals to take the track obscure dogma for instance which has a very slow just heavy sludgy introduction you think that with almost every song flying by at the speed of light black and light the band would use any slower spots to make a serious melodic impact to really make something stick in the listeners head but right here it doesn't happen there's no good or unique or interesting melody and the riffs feel pretty generic as well a lot of the tracks on this album just the album in general to me feels a lot like the closing track it hits hard it's fast it has that hardcore in black metal element it feels very exciting but it ends up kind of being like a hot bath that slowly grows colder and holder because elements like progression and and melody just do not really make it into the recipe certainly this album reaches an almost inspiring level of abrasiveness but I guess I was just looking for more for sure this band when it comes to music it's much more at a physical exercise than a mental exercise it's just got kind of a certain appeal to it and for sure I mean I would put money on it that these guys would freaking slay live if playing in person is is even half as intense as listening to this album is you know just on some headphones overall I'm kind of feeling a light to decent five on this LP what did you think about it if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana the secret forever 
68yux0jIEn4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review the third full-length LP from New Jersey punk band titus andronicus local business that's what I like to hear Academy meaning affecting GDP would even talking about what are you talking about I'm going for president Oh Cal thinks he's a presidential candidate vote for me and we'll get America back to the future I hate Cal Church esta with every bone in my body I first heard of Titus Andronicus the same way many people did back in 2010 as the band released one of the most ambitious modern Punk influenced albums the monitor was in an overblown album for sure but it was still a sincere and pretty inspiring tribute to America's history and the Civil War a huge record for underground music and the band in general so early into their career and surely before local business even came out I'm sure people who didn't really like the band were kind of hoping that they would flub this album and even people who are huge fans of these guys were maybe biting their nails wondering how they would follow the monitor up however it's not like local business would have been the first time a band followed one acclaimed album up with another and I would say that it's especially possible for Titus Andronicus to achieve this feat considering how ambitious they've been on their past releases plus the group has a serious knack for writing some really life-affirming music however Titus Andronicus does go through a bit of a lineup change on this LP and many other painfully apparent adjustments as well because really cruising from the monitor to local business is in my opinion a bit like driving your car 90 miles an hour and then just suddenly slamming on the brakes the biggest issue for me on this record is sound it is sound what happened to the on this album what happened to titus andronicus is production in general the guitars on this LP feel simultaneously too clean to have a grit but really too muddy to feel bright many of the drumbeats on these tracks are pretty buried really the details in these drums being destroyed by their very low and consistently muddy mix throughout this album and as far as the vocals go on this LP from Patrick's tickles he doesn't even sound like the same guy on this album his vocal performances on titus andronicus his previous two albums were much more gruff but here he's kind of started to favor a much more wimpy vocal delivery which for sure does have an appeal I do think emotionally he's not holding back on this album and he does come off a bit less aggressive that's gonna do well for some people but I think performance wise he kind of lacks the focus that he had on previous two albums with his voice really going all over the place so yeah the sound overall on this album is pretty crummy and the performances vocally and instrumentally are a little loose and to me that really suffocates some of the punky are more straightforward tracks on this album songs like foodfight and titus and dronicus versus the absurd universe those tracks in my opinion just sound really weak on energetic and kinda ridiculous the subpar production also kind of makes the band on the song The Electric Man sound like a generic bar band the production at best on this album kinda just gets the job done and that's pretty much it it keeps a lot of these songs from becoming the electrifying anthems that they could have been but if you can get past that I think there are a lot of things to enjoy on this LP because for sure Titus Andronicus does not let down in the songwriting department though people are gonna notice a more straightforward approach here as well Titus Andronicus still presents that same fight for life energy in their folk Punk indie blend that has made all the previous stuff so appealing even though Titus Andronicus does shoot or something fiery and fast and energetic on a lot of these tracks there is very clear Bruce Springsteen and Conor Oberst influence permeating these songs as well garbage truck a lot these tracks as I said earlier feel pretty anthemic not only because of the chords and the melodies on them but the very sharp socially aware lyricism as well like the opening track where Stickles is basically singing in the opening that at this point they have established that everything is worthless kind of a nihilistic point of view and the third track paints this really kind of ugly portrait of a traffic jam angry commuters and accident a tow truck first responders as well a lot of these tracks do come off as being kind of politically sharp and critical as well a lot like in the same way and Andrew Jackson jihad song is and a lot of these tracks come together with rousing hooks and piano backed bridges and big chorus vocals maybe some harmonized lighter waving guitar leads as well it's just weird for me because I feel like Titus Andronicus still displaying that same energy that same desire to just make something that people are gonna react to in a really strong way emotionally with music that makes you want to stand up and scream because you're fed up with the world and kind of you know strike you with a little bit of beauty like the chorus vocals on the song in a big city though I was pretty just turned off by them at first I can say that overall the performances on this album for a punk record are acceptable the songwriting and the melodies are there the energy is there as well as the style I just think Titus Andronicus really missed the boat on this one with the sound and the production if that had been rectified I could have seen this record as being another great LP for Titus Andronicus because really this album in a lot of ways is the slightly simpler approach that I wish the band could have taken on on the monitor but that's just that's just my point of view I did end up liking this LP didn't love it feeling a light too decent 6 on this thing but what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what it Anthony Fantana titus andronicus forever 
u3ebepStQyc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review on er found in decay the latest studio LP from neurosis roses you're getting pretty romantic there we both speak English in English is your first language and yet you miss interpret more than half of the things I say why maybe I hate count your chesta well this is neuroses sis's sis's tenth studio LP and they're a California band with a career that has just been too long and too essential to modern metal to accurately sum up in a single review but over the course of their career they have showcased a pretty diverse set of influences starting off with the metallic hardcore of bands like which showed up strongest on their early releases and as they progress they started incorporating elements of sludge metal doom metal drone and noise ambient music as well they also started bringing in elements of acoustic instrumentation arranged instrumentation piano strings brass experimental rock acts like swans were certainly a reference point and definitely as neurosis was growing and making their songs more multifaceted and lengthy progressive rock was definitely an ingredient in the recipe as well this led to neurosis is putting out some pretty diverse albums like a Sun that never sets and in times of grace increasing the amount of contrast between some of the slower more quiet just softer moments and the heavy parts in their music Plus as the band was increasing some elements of folk music in their Tunes frontman Scott Kelly was kind of blossoming not just as a metal frontman but a bit of a singer-songwriter as well changing up his vocal style in the process to this very overly gruff growls not afraid to just put out there as the pandas maybe playing something quiet or very forlorn at this point in the band's career they're pretty much simultaneously sticking to their heavy mid-paced progressive sound and looking for different ways to ever so slightly tweak it and on honor found in decay I did get the sounds I was expecting but I did end up kind of wanting more this is definitely one of neurosis most basic albums so far which is not necessarily an insult on this LP neurosis kind of four goes the extra instrumentation the arranged instrumentation that made previous releases such a journey you do get the occasional synthesizer adding some texture behind some of the walls of guitar sound and the closing track on here does have some strings on it but for the most part of the band writes some pretty lengthy metal songs with kind of a loud soft dynamic to them suddenly changing from one to the other in a way that reminded me a lot of MOG wise early work but most definitely with a different emotion too instead of exploding into something epic and triumphant when neurosis just blows up it's it's very dreary and the way the drumbeats move against this very low-end guitar distortion it feels kind of tribal there's something inherently funky about the chord progressions and the melodies that neurosis works with on a handful of these tracks Wow the way that riff kind of repeats into oblivion it just feels so archaic and kind of ritualistic and neurosis definitely goes on to enhance this funky flavor with a bagpipe interlude though I do think this LP makes this album a bit less intense for a neurosis album there's most definitely something kind of refreshing about the more straightforward and less obtuse direction that neurosis is taking with this LP because it's led to some of these tracks feeling kind of catchy like the opening track we all rage in gold however this new direction has also led to this LP being one of neurosis least diverse album so far by the third track on here the way the band is specifically writing songs on this album becomes kind of obvious especially if you've enjoyed most of their past material and what experimental and ambient moments do show up on this LP feel purely ornamental and don't really add that much to the composition of the song bill that much tension for the song like the introduction of the track bleeding the pigs where Scott Kelley is morbidly musing over these very murky echoing tones and the way he's just delivering his vocals on that track just the whole aura of this section of the song feels more campy than it does authentically dark or dramatic plus the digital drone hanging behind all these sounds as the song is building just feels really weak as well however once the track progress is a little bit more and these harmonized guitar leads come in in the song really turns into a dirge it's great and that's really the extent of my issues on the cell P though I didn't love this album I did think it was pretty good and could definitely be an album enjoyed by both fans and newcomers because while this album in my opinion Dena Mays it did meet expectations and as far as the newcomer thing goes it's not nearly as alienating as most albums in this style though I wish neurosis brought a bit more variety across this full hour of music I did think a lot of the tracks on here were legitimately great blends of just heavy sludgy doom influenced metal and folk music too with some tracks like casting of age is getting pretty psychedelic toward the end I'm feeling a strong six to a lay seven on the cell P what did you think of it if you've given it a lesson did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana neurosis forever 
UJOEzTGkfoc,no here internets busiest music nerd I was told that was funny and it's a Sunday afternoon busy household washers washing lunches lunching planes are flying cars are driving puppies are puppy and I am questioning I'm kind of wondering whether or not you the music listeners of the present care about audio quality because right now we live in an age of convenience where a lot of the ways people consume their music isn't exactly of you know this high audio quality standard really bad mp3 downloads all over the internet YouTube streams listening to the music on either very small cheap earbuds or maybe like your laptop speakers which don't exactly you know translate the music to you in the most accurate way possible and of course there are loads of artists out there in numerous genres recording their albums in a very low fidelity way sounds may be distorted over modulated muddy so with all of these things kind of impeding upon the audio quality of the music that you listen to but still not really seeing a drop-off in the amount of people listening to music these days does audio quality really matter to the average person anymore there are certainly some trends pointing toward people caring about the audio quality of the stuff that are listening to artists uploading their music on to YouTube in a 720p video so that you get better quality audio from the YouTube stream sites like Spotify that allow people to stream music for free while either showing them advertisements or sort of taking those advertisements away when they subscribe they're offering better audio quality and of course there has been the resurgence of people buying vinyl again and a lot of people now are starting to favor flack which is another way to download and then sort of store your music on your computer digitally like an mp3 but you're getting higher quality audio without it taking a as much space on your hard drive and of course there are modern music recording styles that are very prominent in certain styles of metal and mainstream pop music and hip-hop music that sound very clean it's funny that we live in a time where all of these separate audio trends are occurs plenty of electronic music and indie music that favors texture as well looking for some sounds in their recording to be kind of damaged or muddy or just kind of grainy in order to gain a certain characteristic and there are entire genres whose roots are you know kind of based in lo-fi and just bad quality recordings like black metal and grindcore so for you is there such a thing as something that is too low Phi the audio quality is too bad I won't listen to the music in this way because I'm not really getting the full fidelity that mp3 is not a high enough of a quality for me personally because whether you think about it or not sound quality is kind of important you know just as it is important in a video for a lot of people to have you know good quality visuals but still again in the medium of video especially on the Internet these days there are plenty of music videos there an example of this people using 8 millimeter film or just grainy video to kind of get a certain aesthetic in the visuals that they're putting together of course when it comes to pictures sites like Instagram are really hot Polaroids of course are coming back and are really trendy when it comes to taking photographs you do have people favouring mediums of visual and sonic properties knowing that they are of a lower quality than what they can get somewhere else but because of the aesthetic that comes from that medium they they like it so in your opinion is this audio quality standard going away and will it end up hurting music end of the future or will it help it let me know what you think Anthony Fantana audio quality forever [Music] 
mQ8HrwwyEig,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd doing another vinyl video where I am tripping through my entire collection alphabetical order because people were curious and have to set my alarm because we're only doing this ten minutes at a time so we could do it raw alright last time we left on of Montreal's compilation in the gladiator nightstick collection and here we go of Montreal cherry peel band's debut album this is actually not a favorite for a lot of people who hopped on to of Montreal with albums like Sun Lanting twins and you know the album's mixing I was after that however this is really one of my favorite of Montreal LPS I prefer the band's older stuff when they were showcasing a stronger Beatles out influence psychedelic music influence as well as like influence from vaudeville as well everything disappears when you come around hilarious song and another song that I actually love off this album Tim I wish you were born a girl interesting love song right there I like the packaging on this LP - it's sweet just like on the gladiator nightstick we have a record in a plastic bag within a sleeve I think it's a good album and by the other of Montreal stuff I have unfortunately is on CD I don't have any other other that I don't have any other of Montreal vinyl used to have some lanta twins on vinyl but I remember selling that um got a little Yoko got a little Yoko got this from my buddy Brian there's Sean believe that Sean and this is a season of glass these are the glasses John Lennon wore the day he was killed a little bit of mourning on this album but there are some good tunes on here including Dogtown and nobody sees me like you do Yoko Ono acquired taste with the vocals and there's actually a great Yoko Ono cover that of Montreal those on a collection of tracks I need to uh I need to look for it now because I brought it up like a Dumbo I felt like smashing my face through a clear glass window off of the bird who continues to eat the rabbits flower actually like this quite a bit and actually liked this a lot - this is actually kind of a record that details the the crumbling of a relationship the record is the bedside drama a petite tragedy there's an awesome song at the end of that album it's easy to sleep when you're dead really very nice song um New Order's debut LP actually new order is one of my favourite bands period hands down period and this is an album that they came out with right after of course Joy Division had to disband and reform and you know on this record there's still a strong influence from the you know dark and kind of New Wave music they were making in that group but um here uh yeah I mean that this the the influence is still pretty much pouring in on this record they would move past that and start producing albums like power corruption and lies you know until a little bit later so even though this is not one of my favorite new order albums it is the debut it is great I just prefer the other stuff and I have pretty much all of it on CD and for I do have all of it on CD you know other new order vinyl unfortunately Phil Ochs I March in anymore actually when my favorite folk albums of the full curve Idol in the 60s fantastic record honestly Phil Ochs was an amazing an amazing topical songwriter tons of anti-war songs on this song on this record some of them you know very serious and sad some of them funny some of them clever tracks right here we have a song about Kennedy being killed I believe that was the president if I'm if I'm correct and really my favorite song on this entire album is here's to the state of Mississippi where he was basically saying about racism segregation and the Jim Crow laws down there during that time there's really just nasty line on that song where he sings if you you know were to drain the rivers you'd see the bodies like you know on the riverbed it's really a dark twisted song and at that time he was coming out with music he saw himself as sort of like a musical reporter you know telling people the truth through his folk songs alright the pains of Being Pure at heart debut record these guys are like an indie pop and rock band I'm sure a lot of you guys have this record already this is actually one of the first albums I reviewed still love to this day still very catchy very easy sweet saccharine lovely record you know not the deepest and most meaningful record you over run across but it's a fun it's fun listen however this is a more deep and meaningful record that you will run across if you try to run across it Pink Floyd's animals look up the pig behind this album cover there's actually a pretty funny story as to the progression of this album cover and how they tried to get that pig there and yada yada yada but yeah this is actually maybe my favorite Pink Floyd album I know people up the wall as do I which I have a copy of here I'm yet to rotate into my collection but this this may be my favorite I just love the long winding progressive songs on this LP the gatefold ain't bad either let's get a look at the vinyl here and here we go the the lyrics to the songs Les Claypool with with his band did actually pretty nice cover of that album not exactly you know it's it's you know kind of like a slightly uncreated note for no cover but you know they did it they did it well alright Pixies Doolittle unfortunately the only Pixies I have on vinyl all the other Pixies stuff I have is on CD but you know if you were if you had to have one Pixies album on vinyl Doolittle would certainly be a contender so many great songs on here let me read off some afore yeah you know great kind of like a indie rock band lolll love you that one's okay that was good I see where is it hey one of my favorites mr. M I am I missing I'm only seeing where the other oh the other ones are on the front the D base err yeah love that track and wave of mutilation man I don't listen to this all the way through in a while um bossa nova might be my favorite Pixies record they love that song love Ally and love a lot of songs on that record but Doolittle check out this LP doesn't see it this is a 4ad kind of newer reissue I believe it's like one of the newer pressings of the record it's not like an old-school original [Music] and this is actually a little hard to come by a 12-inch single of such great heights janta how to remix on their album version Postal Service DJ downfall persisted beat remix with the album version of the district sleeps alone tonight analyzing hard to come by but I don't know how many I don't know how easy would you probably have to go out to discogs to get a copy of it actually got a free copy of this from Sub Pop years ago when I bought this record and the initial pressing of this album was funked oh it was up for a lot of people the entire D side too had just had tons of static on it and so they repress the album and unfortunately it was it's on white vinyl it's on white opaque vinyl which you know is fine wine I was good you know white vinyls cool pulling everything just the issue is uh I'm in the C and D side of the record but anyway the issue is that the original pressing that that got screwed up was a clear vinyl pressing and much thicker in in weight as well so a lot of people including me had to wait on that pressing um to come through in order to actually get their record but this album just actually went platinum um these are some pops sold enough copies of this record for it to become platinum just recently and I mean such a great freaking l.p just wonderfully catchy and just colorful bubbly and and fun to listen to indie electronic Tunes fronted by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie another band that I like but you know the this album really helped kind of skyrocket his career in Death Cab for Cutie I mean this is really you know one of those records in was that was this release in the early 2000s yet 2004 this is really one of the records that got released in the early to mid-2000s that wasn't record that caught on some noticeable that caught on noticeably in the mainstream especially with such great heights that tune really had some you know some transcending qualities about it you know in terms of Oh being able to catch some ears outside of the indie sphere but uh next Prince let me come back alright that's it for this final video I love you I hope you're well and continue to stay awesome anthony Fantana vinyl forever [Music] [Music] 
QurcyHLpCEQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review pile dripping pile is a Boston rock band that formed around 2007 and they're fronted by guitarist singer songwriter Rick McGuire and this may be the first time you're hearing of this band but this is certainly not their first record there are two full-length albums that preceded this one this one and the first of this band's albums while it did carry on the indie rock sound that they are currently working with now it was much more of an acoustic and folky edge to it now at this point in Pyles progression with dripping the band is fully electric guitars based some acoustic guitars mixed in occasionally with these tracks as well as synthesizer and even though the band's overall sound is is louder more distorted beefier McGuire's singer/songwriter biases are still there in the focus on melody and storytelling with a lot of these tracks albeit some abstract storytelling for the most part so while yeah these guys are certainly still an indie rock band elements of alternative rock and post hardcore as well pop up on this new LP which is kind of me using genre label code words to tell you that this button sounds Mack the money oh this is my favorite time for music dave's band their red hat silly peppers County on the crows the Melissa Lachlan and Coolio then Coolio well pile certainly does not take any influence from those artists at least on the surface what influences are obvious on this LP is stuff like the heavy Rivage of Fugazi or shellac the emotive and slightly wimpy ballad jury of a band like Built to Spill the aggressive instrumental and and vocal freak-outs of a band like modest mouse and for sure pile takes a page from the Pixies playbook and really just riding that loud soft dynamic across many of these tracks just kind of give them a rollercoaster ride effect despite the fact that the sound here has Distortion aggression guts a lot of these tracks just do not lose their their sense of melody and harmonious nough some of the embellished guitar chords that that play along to a lot of these tunes are pretty impressive as well and if that's not enough to win you over a lot of the courses on these tracks are just explosive sonically and emotionally and what would a great rock album be without some catchy vocals which totally come into play right on the song baby boy where McGuire's creams on the hook those baby tape won't grow except he sings it better however by contrast the very next track has much more of a folky feel to it which really shines through on the beautifully executed fingerpick guitar chords on that track with these lovely background vocals singing over it run away it's really catchy I just wish the verses weren't so mumbled vocally kind of weary I'm sure that emotion was intended to an extent but the vocals just seemed mix a little low on this track and some other tracks too and while I'm on the vocals that's really my only major issue stylistically with this band the vocals don't have a ton of character to them I would say it's not like I could pick this guy's voice easily out of a lineup I think but there is sincere and just genuine emotion on a lot of these tracks I mean just explosive explosive performances especially when he does reach into that range of his voice where he is screaming at the top of his lungs with just all of his might it's kind of impressive to contrast the sweeter and more acoustic spots on this LP like so hard you have a song like grunt like a pig which is this heavy heart riffing attention-grabbing song with a groove in seven the band works out awesome Lee and it's on this spot in the album where McGuire's vocals actually really grabbed me because he sounds manic on that track the closing track on this LP has another funky intro but it contrasts it later in the song with another explosion where McGuire is coming through with a very confident fiery vocal delivery and I love the opening lyrics to this track where you sing about trying to keep up by running in place there's a significant change in sound and emotion on that track and I like how the music for the most part matches what McGuire is doing vocally the band really accommodates these mood swings with song structures that typically step out of that verse chorus verse style because what mark is feeling really kind of depends where he is in his story so do expect guitar interludes on this album quiet spots like I said explosions and some weird segues most notably on tracks like prom song and the Browns there are moments of straightforwardness on this LP like the song Steve's mouth which is kind of this somber acoustic track where the vocal delivery actually in a way reminds me of the silver Jews however the obtuseness of the lyrics do not say that to me where McGuire is singing about this guy Steve waking up sitting on his head weeping and that's another thing about this album I mean while it is an energetic rock LP it is subtly obtuse and I like that the slight sense of confusion I get from this LP does kind of keep me coming back for more and does keep me guessing however I wouldn't say the barrage of different ideas and any given song isn't necessarily the best thing all the time I mean the track the Browns to me actually kind of gets bogged down in this kind of stuff and loses a bit of focus in the process I mean overall this LP is just a great no BS rock album with an amalgamation of established styles and sounds but you know the songs are there the emotions are there and the performance is is there between these guys as well I do wish the recording didn't feel so slightly low fie and tattered it does kind of a lot of these tracks feel Sammy Sammy on the surface but as I listen to this album more there was a lot of magic here for me feeling uh I want to say is strong seven to a light eight on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana pile forever 
IIwrQVPYaLk,love you ruff you ruff you Rob you'll hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review blackmont super rainbow Cobra juicy black Mott super rainbow is a neo psychedelia project - in the early and mid 2000s helped to usher in a series of new trippy strange and psychedelic sounds the band's music featured a lot of electronic beats with a funky attitude phaser phaser Ezard synthesizers and heavily manipulated vocals with a heavy vocoder effect on them that had kind of a simultaneously warm and chilling quality to them with a touch of robot and black not super rainbow had some pretty low phi and quirky beginnings but they eventually refined their sound for the LP dandelion gum the recording sounded better the synthesizers and the vocoder vocals were so much more lush heavy vibrant and there were some other instrument movement mental sounds making it onto this LP - some moments kind of felt like I was listening to woodwinds but still even at black moths super rainbows creative peak with dandelion gum and eating us the band remained a group that I loved more for their sound than their songs consistently black moths super rainbows music has featured very repetitive beats with with kind of unimaginative sequencing and the rhythms never really meld with the instrumentation for something really this roll or something that features an incredible amount of energy or momentum and a lot of the melodies feel kind of haphazard even though black moths super rainbow has a potent style they have a sound that you expect I can't help but feel like at this point it's kind of a crutch just because of the sheer lack of variation not only black moth super rainbow albums but just black moth super rainbows discography I mean even frontman tobaccos solo stuff has elements that are painfully similar to what he's already doing in black moth super rainbow black moth super rainbows biggest alteration to their music has been just the sound quality of the music that they're putting out occasionally a sound or an instrument will pop up that you haven't heard them toy with quite yet but the songwriting style pretty much remains the same I mean even the band's approached titling songs has remained somewhat the same either a track has a title that feels kind of like a candy-coated fantasy or to some kind of weird word association like snail garden or caterpillar house or dark bubbles now as far as Cobra juicy goes black Mouth super rainbows pretty much back to their old tricks but with a few sonic surprises here and there the track windshield Smasher has some very fuzzy distorted garage rock guitar on it actually a couple other tracks on this LP do as well including I think I'm evil and hairspray Hart the track like a sundae has one of the most sugary melodies on it that I've ever heard the band toy with and it sounds incredibly borrowed and it's almost like to a fall that they play with a melody this sugar ease and their music sounds so sweet to begin with I mean it sounds like a melody taken from some bad 70s pop tune that people from that era are still trying to forget today and the track we burn starts off with this heavy drumbeat and this stringy just twangy acoustic guitar that totally reminds me of something like I've heard on a BEC album or two and the song gangs in the garden the vocoder sound changes on that track significantly to something that actually feels a bit more like Daft Punk the groove on that track feels pretty Daft Punk as well actually quite a few beats on this album feel a bit different for black moths super rainbow they back off of it from the typical hip-hop sound that their rhythms feature and switch them out a little bit for some rock and pop and just dance music rhythms but still despite these different sounds for black moths super rainbow it's all just kind of window-dressing for me once again with Blackbaud super rainbow the be sequencing leaves a lot to be desired especially the sound on some of these beats with this LP for example the track hairspray heart starts off at this rhythm that feels incredibly just dull bland thin flat and repetition kind of becomes another issue for black moths super rainbow when a song for them is underdeveloped what they do is they just kind of take the second half of the song the next verse and chorus and pretty much make it identical to the first half of the song sometimes not even bothering to change the lyrics set in the second verse because of stuff like that black moth super rainbows style and vocoder vocals overstay their welcome pretty quick because there's not really much else to concentrate on or enjoy or react emotionally to and the guitars that I said were on this LP those fuzzy distorted rock guitars that that pop up occasionally they are recorded just kind of crumbly on here they just sound so brittle again I mean I'm just not feeling anything new from black Mouth super rainbow on this LP despite the fact that I keep liking their sound on the surface below the mask there's just not a lot musically there for the most part it's just the same vocals and and song structuring that you've been hearing for the past several albums which wouldn't be bad if there was a certain level of development to these things but consistently there's not sometimes I even think the vocoder vocals are there because they're trying to obscure just how unappealing some of these lyrics are as well again I'm a fan of this band sound I like the sound I just get tired of the style because there's not really much else there but the style and that's just all I have to say you know I like that the band has you know a unique mmm I'm feeling too light too decent five on this record what did you guys think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana black moth super rainbow forever 
ruUkn7A1nQs,me me me me hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the soft moon zeroes the soft moon is the musical project of Luis Vasquez this is his sophomore full-length LP and I'm really loving the influences that go into this album and the style it adds up to alright in comparison with the soft moon's debut LP this album is much more gothic ly tinged directly referencing some of post-punk and new waves most tortured artists enjoy division Bauhaus suicide I would even say from the texture the sonic textures in some of these tracks throbbing gristle could be an influence as well if you listen to this LP you're pretty much going to get a bunch of leather-clad dance rock songs that are kind of repetitive and for the most part instrumental and between the 10 tracks on here Vasquez creates some pretty awesome groove based atmospheres that authentically sound like they are coming from the era of music he's mimicking the song machines certainly earns its name I mean the track sounds like an industrial dance party on a strobe lit factory floor all the rhythms just are clanging and banging there's some very dark and murky synthesizer and bass on this track too and the gate is adjusted to on the drums to kind of get a big sharp sound in a way a perfect combo of dancing and darkness perfect for the Halloween party you just had however I find it difficult to kind of go go through this album track by track kind of looking at each song and talking about what it does differently because you know despite some tempo changes or just different shaped grooves nearly every track on here shoots for pretty much the same mood dance darkness vulgar to rock post-punk synthesizers lots of texture which isn't a bad thing consistency typically enhances an album and this album definitely has that consistency when it comes to sound the quality of the grooves that are being put out there and emotion however where this album seriously and I mean seriously lacks is in the songwriting Department I mean the attempt to write a song isn't even made really pretty much every track on this LP for me kind of feels like a really good goth rock song that never quite gets started I mean the groove is is certainly there on all of these tracks but it's not like any of the variations that Vasquez throws into the mix instrumentally or all that like that interesting and as I'm listening to these songs my mind is just constantly drifting thinking about man how great would it be to have a very dark deep dramatic vocalist on these tracks and maybe kind of a chorus or verse kind of you know coming after some of this groove Ness and I realize that there are some people are going to take the instrumental and repetitive qualities of this record and just say hey you know Anthony this is totally coming from a krautrock thing but in a way I kind of disagree because my favorite artists who are in that genre when they would be repetitive when they would be instrumental would kind of do in more of a a jam like way certainly noise is an example both however I mean the sounds the instruments on this LP don't sound like they're being played live or in a way that that creates chemistry or just kind of has an energy to it to me a lot of these instrumentals sound like they're just copied and pasted just kind of taking chunks of riffs and just looping looping looping looping them over and over and over either in a bedroom or a semi-professional studio and that really sucks the viscera out of a lot of these grooves and makes them kind of uninteresting to listen to for more than two three or in some cases on the Selphy for minutes and that issue is certainly universe on this entire LP I mean I'm really caught by the sounds that this album is putting forward but once I try to dive in you know I discovered that this big dark murky body of water was in fact just like a puddle there are just a lot of things that weren't on this LP for me I'm kind of feeling a strong 4 to a light five what did you think of it if you give it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the soft moon forever 
E1q-nvvu58A,hi everyone one Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's the end of October fall is in full freakin swing the leaves are falling the landlord's lawnmower just stopped and like usual at the end of every month I'm going to talk about some of the album's that impressed me over the past 30 days and let me tell you music freaking blew up this month man not only did I go back and kind of catch up with some records from maybe a few weeks ago maybe a month ago or so that I didn't get a chance to review I wanted to review and then ended up loving and there were just a lot of releases this month that were in freakin peccable so let's just start off with what I have reviewed this month links to reviews and songs from these records are in the description box description bar description thing of this video and yeah wait go for one the new Deerhoof LP breakup song deer hoof comes through with yet another surprise eccentric colorful playful little indeed noise pop record and it's an album where it's it's pretty much like their first electronic album incorporating not only electronics and beats but synthesizers samples MIDI as well to just kind of make these songs come together and it's not really a huge stylistic change for Deerhoof though it is different sonically for the band they use all these instruments and sounds to kind of come together with the same quirky strange and very angular pop stylings that they typically do all jay a creative little art pop record with some eccentric vocals but very well written songs I took a while to kind of warm up to this LP kind of waited around for the American release to come up until I really kind of dove into it and gave it a decent listen yeah at the end of the day while it's not going to be one of my favorite records of the year this for a debut album is extremely extremely impressive next Godspeed Alleluia don't bend US and the Canadian post rock band's first full-length album in about ten dang years and I was absolutely impressed by it from the start and I mean you know these guys did a comeback the way you should do a comeback though I you know wish that the album wasn't so chock-full of older material that is now being recently performed and released I'm just hoping that they're kind of getting some of this stuff out of the way for a new album just consisting completely of original and brand-new material but still considering that a lot of this stuff on this LP is older it's still awesome two 20 minute monster tracks two drones on here as well it's an intense and uplifting as well as epic listen next Death Grips know love Deep Web definitely a very noticeable sonic change for Death Grips on this new record kind of stripping back a lot of the noise stripping back a lot of the samples using a lot of electronic drum sounds on here turning the sense up and letting MC ride do his thing up front and center with some more audible lyrics if for some reason you're yet to hear of Death Grips and you're just looking for some strange experimental and just out there hip hop give it a try it's free album download it next tame impala loner ISM if you're talking psyche rock you're talking psychedelic pop this is easily my most favorite record of the year I mean the sounds on this thing so lush so colorful the songs are pretty solid on this LP as well which is to be expected from tame impala the beatles influence does dampen things a little bit but the production and just the playing on this thing is is so good it's it's just kind of mouth-watering how just wonderous a lot of the sounds are on this P next converge freaking all we love we leave behind a solid solid great stellar metalcore record with strong elements of post-hardcore shining through on a lot of these tracks converge definitely tone their sound down a little bit on this LP just sounding a lot less noisy and cacophonous to bring some clarity into the fold while I don't think people are going to be celebrating this record on the level that they have Jane Doe this is certainly a high point for the band next creme Riggins alone together a great great collection of hip hop instrumentals from a guy who has collaborated with Madlib J Dilla and has been just making hip hop and is also a jazz drummer making hip hop for years it just so happens that he's you know coming out with his full-length debut now it's a collection of 34 little tidbits some of which are just strange other funky some jazzy soulful bubbly experimental I mean the guy is really a mad scientist when it comes to production and finally the new Bad plus album made possible these guys are a musical trio blending elements of rock pop jazz jazz fusion experimental music and on this LP as well electronic music with some synthesizers strange electronic glitches and drum machine beats occurring slowly throughout the lot of these tracks and for me on this album the viscera is there the composition is there just the performance and the playing is there I wish the sound wasn't so thin as it tends to be so bare as it tends to be on a lot of bad Plus records but man I mean this this impressed me in a big big way and that's pretty much a rundown of my favorite records from this past month a lot of albums I mean more than I usually end up mentioning at the end of a month and man this is this months just been chock-full of music and I didn't get to review everything I wanted to review but what were some of your favorite records from this past month what did you love what did you hate and let me know let me know Anthony Fantana October forever 
hWxnq5EYbZU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's Halloween Halloween Halloween Halloween review the bed plus made possible these guys are a musical trio that has remained difficult to accurately categorize over the years puppies blending elements of experimental music with jazz rock pop and doing cover songs of modern and mainstream classics long before the dudes and bad bad not good we're doing Odd Future reinterpretations now I first remember stumbling upon these guys in college hearing covers of theirs like Black Sabbath's Ironman or Nirvana smell like teen spirit and that did catch my attention and I was able to you know kind of get into other covers of theirs at the time or just they ended up putting out later from blondie Queen Interpol Pixies I'm pretty sure they covered David Bowie as well and despite the fact that I've always liked the idea of the bat plus and have been I guess consistently impressed with their musicianship I always thought their covers really overshadowed their originals and their cover songs never really stuck with me past the novelty of the first couple listens however recently the band has been working more and more to kind of stand on the merits of its own material instead the LP they put out a couple years ago their last album never stop was their first full-length LP to feature just originals and one of their albums prior to that suspicious-activity actually only featured one single cover a cover of the Chariots of Fire theme written by Vangelis and this new LP goes down that same road only one single cover ended is the last track the paul motion song Victoria which is really one of the most obscure songs the van has ever revised and I actually think the bad pluses recent focus on original material has kind of revitalized the band because not only are they playing with some pretty refreshingly experimental ideas on this album but there are actually elements of electronic music that make it out of this LP as well through the sounds of synthesizers drum machines and some weird experimental glitchy electronics as well and even as there is a lack of covers on this new LP the band continues to blend genres rock pop jazz avant-garde jazz free improvisation as well as progressive rock - the track pound-for-pound opens up with a beautiful melody I mean gorgeous melody it's a track that is just contemplative and very moving and I like how the wonderous lead melody on this track slowly gets embellished more and more with some nice chords be some electronics kind of bubbling subtly in the background along with some acoustic drums it's a delicate song but the band takes a complete 180 on the next track seven-minute mind and does something completely hard riffing rigid a lot less fluid because this is a multi-phase track the band just all of a sudden changes shape groove and sound all over this track and right after that this long really liked that which I mean is not one of my favorites on this LP but still very good meanders a little bit at its beginning because of this kind of free improvisation moment that drags on just a little but still the band's chemistry their kinetic energy on this their performance keeps me on the edge of my seat and the suspense is certainly well worth it at the end of the track when the band busts into this kind of militaristic musical mood with with these kooky sin thorns kind of soaring over these drums that are just really tight and Stern the song wolf out presents even more riffs and works in a time signature so odd I would need to listen to this track a dozen more times to accurately count it out however I don't really feel the impulse to because the band plays in this odd groove so fluidly it almost makes me want to dance to it the tracks sing for a silver dollar and for my eyes we are kind of slow burners with chords that just work better at this pace very dramatic and Ethan hi verson plays his piano so well on these tracks he really shines with this piano not because he's soloing intensely but he's just playing so emotive ly benign but both tracks kind of had these thematic chords the beginning and end of the songs and in the middle have an experimental weird interlude kind of an obvious formula but still the interludes in the midst of these chords are pretty thought-provoking the first of which is kind of glitchy experimental electronic the second of the two is much more serene ambient the track I want to feel good part two though kind of throws a monkey wrench into the works a surprise if you will it's really one of the most traditionally sounding jazz songs on this entire LP I mean it's actually kind of hokey and just upbeat in its mood because of that and I think it is pretty smile inducing maybe not so much for me because you know I'm a depressed downer soul but the song throws yet another experimental interlude in the middle which does kind of make things a little refreshing and the band does make these happy happy chords sound a little stranger as the song progresses so they definitely experiment definitely do something that's you know oh you know they did that huh and one of the final tracks on this LP in stitches is a 14 minute long monster and the band totally justifies this length with one cohesive piece not a multi-phase song but one extremely focused track that actually starts very quiet and builds climactically toward its end and has maybe the most intense playing on this entire LP as it builds I mean just drums piano bass just freaking out man in terms of performance and songwriting this LP is there I mean it's definitely hard to just say oh it's jazz because there are spots that do feel like rock there are spots that do feel upbeat and poppy but if I did have to say there's something I kind of hold issue with on this album it is the sound though the drums and the bass and and and piano do come through very clearly they're very raw they're very bare skeletal all these extra elements that bad plus adds the mixture the drum machines the electronics the synthesizers for the most part they sound kind of tinny kind of flat I wish they had a bit more beef to them I wish they had a bit more volume to them and sure these things do help the bat plus make a different and new record for them but I would definitely be interested in hearing these sounds kind of if it brought up a little bit and rotated into the foreground because I think there's a ton of potential for the direction the bat plus is moving in on this LP not to say that that potential isn't realized in a sense on this album itself because I am feeling a light to decent 8 on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the bad + forever 
2Ad2VVgVBnc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for you review Mack DeMarco - this guy is a Canadian singer-songwriter who I first heard of in 2009 via the band makeout video tape which wasn't exactly a project that churned out very hard-hitting music I mean for the most part it was lo-fi indie rock and pop that did have some remarkably catchy moments on songs like Baba Vanga and of course heatwave which was really one of the bigger music videos that the band had released and after that I actually kind of lost touch with Mack DeMarco and makeout video tape as the project continued on to release more collections of tracks and as Mack DeMarco went into the solo material realm this year at first I didn't even realize it was the same guy but right now we have Mack DeMarcos - which is actually the second full-length LP he dropped on capture tracks this year and funny enough both of these LPS have noticeably different personalities the album he dropped earlier this year Rock & Roll nightclub the overall sound of this album is is pretty much like the awkward image of Mack DeMarco itself on the front cover of him applying crimson lipstick it definitely shoots for something sleek and sexy and nocturnal but still it's a regular bro putting on some lipstick creepy and a lot of the tracks on here just slow deep-voiced pop rock tunes that do get a little monotonous over the course of the album but still the LP is pretty sexual pretty funky there's a lot of stringy twangy electric guitar all over this thing and Mack DeMarco himself brings quite a bit of character with his vocals and the album - pretty much follows suit with its cover as well in terms of its its sound this is this hits album is way more breezy more fun loving it just does not have hair in the world and the guitar tones change a little bit on this LP 2 2 2 2 I mean this LP is jangle spangled which is an angle that a lot of people on capture tracks tangle with this album I think will appeal to some people because it does have kind of a character to it I mean this LP to me really feels like some dudes slow-motion prancing in a dimly lit bar to like a local band playing some real smooth jams it's kind of a sound I'm slightly indifferent toward in a lot of cases but some of the tracks on here do have hooks that really really pop and the very 20 just tinny guitar tone that Mac DeMarco plays with on a lot of these tracks is certainly attention-grabbing as well and the vehicle for a lot of sweet solos melodies and leads on this album the track cooking up something good is a great opener for this album a funky little opener the groove of it just kind of makes me think of like old school like New Orleans funk music it's a track that's danceable yet quaint and I love that squeaky little rhythm guitar on the on the track to the track freaking out the neighborhood is much more sleek much more sexy has a fiery groove too and a nice guitar lead at the intro of the track it's something that sounds like it could have been dropped in the late 70s early 80s and there is a strong Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti vibe on this track on the track Oh - Viceroy there is a really impressive sheen on the guitar and I love the way the arpeggio the interval that's always being played during the verse on that track it just bounces baby theme and though the verses are kind of slow and plot along the song really blooms on the hook with this guitar Lee and Mac DeMarco continues on this track and a lot of tracks on here - emot-- his lyrics in a very kind of tired slightly apathetic and lazy manner and while sometimes this can make it difficult for me to connect emotionally with a track it can be intoxicating as well and nowhere is it more intoxicating than these synthesizer back my kind of woman and despite some cliche lyrics it's really one of the sharpest tunes on here the synth arpeggios on the hook and then in the singing as well my kind of woman and the guitar on that spot of the song - I mean it is just a killer combo a nice recipe but that's really it for highlights on this LP for me the number one issue I have with this album is pretty much highlighted on the 1 minute and 42 second instrumental track Boza it's just kind of a little guitar piece with bass drums acoustic guitar and electric guitar and you know though it is pleasant to the ear it's also kind of bland and unmemorable there's nothing really truly distinct or or brilliant about it unfortunately and without at least a very good hook on one of these tracks a lot of songs here can come off as being bland and unmemorable or highly borrowed especially in the case of the the last track the acoustic clothes are still together my way certainly nothing terrible on this album and it does have a sweet personality does have a pleasant sound but when it comes to writing and playing it does get a bit dull however I would say Mack DeMarco does bring enough variety to make a listen through of this album pretty easy and just nice overall I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Mack DeMarco forever [Music] 
wA8kYFNE5IU,hi everyone Anthony fan tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review mr. Andy stopped luxury problems there's a storm outside and I'm sort of you know just doing what I do in the storm because I don't have anything else to do in the storm other than wait it out downtown this guy is a UK electronic music producer who has been added a lot longer than he's been kind of buzzing on the Internet this guy is a good handful of singles EPS he has a full-length album as well toying with minimal techno as well as electro but recently he's been gaining attention for his extremely spacious and textured approach to the genre loads of effects make it onto this LP to the point where it's not even really so much about the sounds or even the sequence they come in but more how much Andy can manipulate these sounds into something that feels rough glossy bouncy as well as ethereal and even though there are a lot of different shapes and sizes to the sound set on this LP pretty much every song here adds up to a pretty stylish kind of minimalism that I think is going to appeal to a lot of people the tracks on here definitely have some chilling qualities to them the song expecting is very kind of droney has a very ambient and stormy quality to it while it is quiet there are elements of just Rumble and distortion to the lower frequencies in this track I mean it's it's easygoing but it also has an edge and there's some pretty ambient intros to these tracks too before the inevitable beat or pattern comes in some pretty vivid stuff especially on the song hatch the plan which has kind of a sour dissonant quality to it it sounds like Andy took sounds from a horror movie a bunch of crickets outside making noise and like an air conditioner and just compress them on top of each other until they became this somewhat monolithic eerie thing you know that that sounds a lot more interesting than I just made it sound overall to me listening to this album is like walking through a mall where every single store is a clothing store and white from floor to ceiling and all the clothes are expensive European and don't fit me and for some reason every store has several fog machines just keeping a dense hazy white layer over everything and that's not necessarily a bad thing that's just kind of his style while a lot of songs out here do have kind of a murky feel to them they don't so much branch into the otherworldly category for the most part in this album and be stopped stays very in touch with civilization a lot of parts on this LP or even dance floor worthy like the very funky sleepless one of my favorite tracks in this entire LP and the song up the box toward the end of that song there's a break beat the nd stop chops up and places carefully until the song kind of ends so yes definitely more in touch with civilization unlike another dump techno classic Porter Rick's biokinetics which has much more of an ambient kind of mind-numbing application to it and this could also be compared in the same way to the pass me by EP that Andy start released last year which had much more mind-bending sounds on it was way heavier much more abstract this new album kind of follows suit with the EP Andy put out after pass me by which was much more straightforward with its beats and it sounds a lot less strange but still kind of having a potent sound to it a personality Andy Stott definitely on this LP tries to find more of a balance between the minimal the experimental and the palatable like with the track numb which is the opening track here and maybe one of the best on the entire album which has a very kind of minimal simple four-four driving beat that's very kind of in the background very bass very quiet this track builds most of its magic with a female vocal sample that is looped in various ways and lay heard throughout the track with these vocals and a very quiet deep bassy synthesizer kind of intertwining as the track progresses in a very beautiful way and the song lost and found to where Andy stock takes another female vocal cut which has kind of an operatic quality to it I would say I mean it's very kind of refined or at least it feels that way and while it does kind of span over the groove sort of awkwardly at first Andy cuts it up and finds interesting ways to work it into the beat as the song goes on and I love the way the groove lurks on that track and this voice just kind of becomes this beautifully piercing thing just shining right through this this very dark atmosphere however there are spots on this LP I'm not very into at all like the song hatch the plan while I do like the intro on that song the vocal sample that he uses on that track and and Andy Stott sticks exclusively to female vocals samples on this entire LP though I'm pretty sure that they're all not being sung by the same person because this track has a vocal sample that does not feel well executed at all like it's just technically not good singing and the title track feels the same way to me as well although I do like the beat behind that song a little bit more despite some haphazard synthesizers kind of bouncing their way through the song and the song up the box while the breakbeat toward the end of the track does make the track pop out among the other seven on here the whole breakbeat quality of the track does kind of interrupt the overall feel of this LP not only that but the execution of this breakbeat kind of comes off really really mild still not a lot of issues I did not enjoy this as much as the EPS that I heard last year which I foolishly admit I did not review because I was just but definitely give this a listen if you're looking for some minimal textured dub techno with elements of ambient music being worked in some drone as well and I would definitely say that especially with the vocal samples on here and the execution of the reverb on these tracks especially with the last song on here Andy Scott has been listening to some modern dream pop I think people who are fans of dream pop with female vocalists could most definitely get into a lot of tracks on here because there is a serene calming yet kind of barren sensibility to this album overall and feeling strong 6 - Ally 7 on this LP if you give it a listen what did you think about it did you love it hate it why and what should I do next Anthony Fantana Andy Stott luxury problems forever 
-tfzOugUmCA,hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comment thing food-for-thought thing basically a real quick thing that kind of irks me when I hear people discussing music most specifically musically then that they do not care for this notion that there is a real version of music in a certain genre you know oh I most specifically hear this used as such that's not real hip-hop that's not real Punk we listened to real rock music I've even heard this phrase used in in the case of that's not real dubstep and what kind of bothers me is that yes it does come from a positive and kind of well-meaning place for some people some people just want to be jerks and and sort of crap over other people's taste in music but some people do want to use this in a positive way kind of a enforce a standard when it comes to a genre of music that they love however when I hear this phrase use to me it feels like it's just kind of got such a stupid ignorant impact that I'm surprised music fans perpetuate it but again back to the standards of quality you know people if they hear hip-hop music as incredibly crappy lyrics or you know uses instrumentals that are kind of a more of a trendy sound you know people come up and sort of qualify that's not real hip-hop and they'll sort of name off five or six classic hip-hop records which are you know if you're in the hip hop or undeniably good however still that real hip hop qualification is there and the same goes for punk music as well fans have been chastised for being too squeaky clean or to poppy or corporate or just not having the right ethos and again people throw these real standards on genres of music because they don't want things to totally go to crap however I think that this you know notion of what's real in a certain genre also kind of stamps out creativity too because if somebody is doing something different maybe something people don't quite get on the first go-around maybe something that's kind of progressive or experimental yet they're trying to stay within that genre or that genre is sort of a main influence for that artists certainly right away so people are going to tag it as that's not real but come on let's let's let's think about this here let's not totally just you know close our minds off from new ideas because artists over the course of their discographies certainly evolve and genres do too because the thing is what punk means today doesn't exactly mean what punk meant in the 1970s in terms of style and and sound and R&B of the 50s does not really sound a lot like R&B of today - there's a noticeable amount of contrast between electronic music that came out in the 60s and electronic music today as well as metal that came out in the 70s and in metal that came out today and I'm sure you could take any album in those genres that was produced today and possibly show it to somebody who is a fan of those very same genres twenty thirty in some cases forty years ago and maybe get some negative reactions like you know this doesn't have a B C and D this has all this new crap I'm not used to this is a real metal if you don't like a piece of music let it be on the merits of the music itself as opposed to what categorization it finds itself falling into and that's it and that's it I said you're the best I love you thanks for watching questions comments things prayer [Music] you 
1Qy-Gs9hMq0,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh yeah the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Chelsea wolf unknown rooms a collection of acoustic songs Chelsea wolf is a darkened songstress who I first heard last year through her album apocalypsis and on this record Chelsea pulled together a pretty diverse set of musical stylings everything from neo folk to ethereal wave to moments that to me flirted with the idea of doom metal she's clearly influenced by a lot of different things and ambitious enough to chase after every single one of them when putting together an album and despite the fact that stylistically this LP is kind of all over the place what is the common thread throughout all these tracks is just this overbearing sense of darkness and Chelsea Wolfe beautiful yet haunting voice however Chelsea is going for something a little bit different on this new LP of her verse something that is explicitly stated in the title a set of acoustic songs and I'm kind of weary about this label worried about labels such as these in general because it kind of makes me think okay like the artist is going on this trip to acoustic town but they're not staying like they're just visiting or there's something kind of unnatural about they're staying in this place which is why they had to label it specifically as a set of acoustic songs like Oh spoiler and whether or not Chelsea actually returns to doing acoustic albums in the future there is kind of a lack of devotion that is very obvious on some of these tracks this thing overall is a pretty short collection of songs and a good handful of the songs on here despite the fact that they may bring up some great sounds or some great melodies do feel a bit unfinished may end like the track the way we used to which has this very repetitive vocal line that starts right at the beginning of the track eventually gets layered with multi-tracked vocal lines on top of that as it progresses but as far as the verses and the course of that track go it doesn't really stand out or feel all that develop I guess it's memorable not really anything else that happens from beginning to end the track appalachia ends kind of suddenly just with no warning whatsoever and I kind of feel like the song could have gone on a bit longer and while the track boyfriend is one of the longer tracks on here in one of my favorites it kind of hits a brick wall too as soon as it reaches its ending anything and the track our work was good doesn't even really get started it's just kind of an idea and then it fizzles out however that is kind of the extent of my negative views on this collection of tracks because I do love a great deal of what is going on here and there's no reason it can't be enjoyed by fans or just people who are willing to kind of take it for what it is or are looking for a female singer songwriter with kind of a dark edge and an acoustic aesthetic for me maybe the biggest highlight on this entire LP is the opening track flatlands which is the longest song on here and maybe the most developed there's an acoustic guitar on this track that has a bit of a twang to it some soft soft vocals delicate string sections that interject beautifully on the choruses and maybe maybe maybe some very subtle and just mixed low synthesizers on the track too not to mention a very very steady and subtle drumbeat kind of keeping things up from behind and I love the vocal melody on this course I mean it's as pretty as it is dreary and the lyrics of the song are pretty awesome as well chelsey kind of stating her preference for flatlands simplicity just barren miss and the twang of the track you know kind of reminds me of of a desert setting for sure and it's funny because Chelsea describes this place of nothingness where she wants to be but she asks the listener or someone she has in mind to come along with her and the track spinning centers I love of how Chelsea changes up her vocal delivery a little bit on that track it's whisper quiet eerie quiet and the vocal melody on there to me feels like inspired by a piece of very archaic folk music I mean like something centuries old in a sense and the strings on this track they're all over the place just like on the opener but they're not playing some heavily arranged piece or just kind of like laying along with the chords of the track they're kind of like adding these high-pitched wines just very subtly very quietly throughout the song adding some weird and kind of unsettling textures and the track boyfriend is easily the slowest track on this LP and it's got this acoustic guitar phrase that is just sharp and dark it's weird because I think of this guitar phrase and I think of how heavy it would sound up rubber played on like a distorted guitar through an amplifier and while I am thinking of that what catches my attention is just how spectral Chelsea's voice is and toward the end of the track the synthesizer introduces itself into the mix but it is mixed loud into the track and it's just really heavy low-end Basie and the melody that it's playing in difficut s-- something that feels so gothic and I don't mean like industrial gothic I mean like candelabras crows cobwebs architecture it's just really chilling just very icy and the track hyper oz toward the end of this LP is an auto heart ballad that features another standout melody maybe one of the more memorable ones from this entire LP despite being such a short track overall I thought this was a very good collection of songs I just thought it could have used a bit more development I mean that's all you know a few of the tracks on here really could have been longer could have used just more sections more parts and I just would have loved to have heard more acoustic songs from Chelsea because the songs on here that that work work really well and you know while in a way the title here does imply that we may not get another acoustic album soon I will most definitely be looking forward to any acoustic songs that do happen to make it onto any album that Chelsea puts out in the future all right feeling that a light decent seven on this unknown rims collection of acoustic songs what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Chelsea wolf 
akZkPoJwEek,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review hoax third EP these guys are in Massachusetts punk band and this is obviously their third EP dad and this EP is four tracks adds up to about seven minutes of music and these guys don't really play at the speed that you would normally expect a punk band to play however tempo is not really where hoax kind of makes their mark with this collection of tracks what is on this EP are just mid-paced punk rock songs that are filthy I mean caked in filth some very abrasive sounds on here very fuzzy distorted grimy aesthetic though I wouldn't say totally low five because there is some you know you know you know you know push in in the lower frequencies of this record and the drums despite the guitars sounding so distorted and just so kind of brittle do come through pretty clear but really together the guitars and vocals swallow the entire mix in just this brittle haze of noise it's like the whole track is on fire and the vocal performances on this EP are just vocal chord shredding like my throat hurts when I think of singing like that and the emotions that the vocals are delivering just the the music in general is delivering just come off so hateful there's like almost no reasoning with it although I wouldn't necessarily say the tracks on this EP are just like blind hatred at all from what I can gather from the lyrics on a track like like like discipline the rage is a bit more calculated than it sounds but still what the sounds here are I mean despite the fact that this EP is clearly coming from more of a punk perspective hoax manages to present the wretched vocals and just the noise smeared sound that I would expect more from like a classic noir we black-metal demo as opposed to a punk EP but still unlike black metal there's not really a big sense of darkness for me on these songs it's just a lot of frustration a lot of fury and that can kind of make the sounds here kind of invigorating it first like oh you know senses are going to heighten everything so loud everything so intense but in kind of a negative way I do think it makes this EP drag on a little bit feel longer than it actually is because I don't think hoax presents that many angles to it's aggression on on this EP a lot of the riffs on here are consistently sludgy and mid paced with a few noticeable changes in speed here and there the moments where things speed up a bit but a lot of the riffs on this EP kind of rely on the same intervals and the groove on feels a lot like the groove and the vocal delivery on pretty much on this EP it's just one note aggression and Rivage and I feel like some people may attribute that to a lack of ideas and you may be right to an extent I mean the band's second EP is certainly hard-hitting and loud and distorted just like this EP is but with a few things tweaked sonically but I'd like to think of this collection of tracks as being more like an undying devotion to just this kind of sonic assault and that Sonic Assault does resonate with me I do like the sound of this EP it's what initially got me interested in this band and it's you know what made me want to review this EP but there's not really much in the way of song or or riff writing that really kind of caught my attention discipline is really the only song that to me lyrically and just kind of like riff wise is memorable overall I liked this EP thought it was decent I would definitely be interested in seeing where this band goes if they were to take their sound into a different studio with a different kind of recording and do something full-length style I'm feeling a decent strong six on this EP if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan oh hoax brother 
hm7iZ7pfdS4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the eleventh installment in my vinyl series where i go alphabetically through all of my records we're getting into the O's in a second so only pop this on ten minutes unedited we are going raw go through these albums when we last left off we started with my Mount Erie Records vinyl right here for the LP lost wisdom which actually features a Jew lead Warren and Fred Squire along with Phil elrom of Mount Erie otherwise known as the microphones unfortunately no I mean microphones stuff on vinyl I just have my microphone stuff on CD but right now eerie stuff I have on vinyl this lost wisdom album it's a white little album it's a beautiful little album if you haven't listened to this album lost wisdom quaint just very pretty a kind of dreary acoustic singer/songwriter album and the cover itself then it kind of comes in the you know if you're in the Mount Erie do yourself a favor get some of the vinyl if you have a record player because the packaging is usually pretty awesome when it comes to fill albums stuff I mean the man puts a lot of effort into his packaging gigantic poster wilderness gigantic poster here and down here actually the lyrics are written very Title II finally it's that a word let me know be it be a friend alright this next record is black wooden ceiling opening this is an interesting little album actually comes with a CD it's a 10-inch kind of like the lost wisdom the the cover itself is a post this is a this is the CD I slipped in a little little case another white print I believe yeah another white little piece of white vinyl that Phil put out and there's a nice insert with it and this EP is basically Phil taking a handful of his songs under the Mount Erie name and doing a electric not just electric but like in a hardcore punk style like he has hard hitting drums and guitars behind his you know very kind of shy vocals that usually sings with and it's it's pretty interesting that's an interesting lesson that I think a slipped by a lot of people including Mount Airy fans and the third LP that I have from that here is dawn which is a short not short but a collection of short kind of disjointed acoustic motifs musings and and songs that I think Phil had written sort of like yeah 2000 and 2002 2003 while kind of it's like isolation or semi isolation in Norway there's a bit of an interesting portrait book that comes with and all the way or it's just kind of pasted on the front doesn't make for the most interesting cover but this is pretty enthralling music I've never heard an album where it's just one man singing acoustic guitar and yet it is just so so strange you know so kind of otherworldly I guess you could say alright you know not that hasn't been achieved before but I'm just saying you know I understand if you're into that kind of thing if you're looking for that check it out do not miss the am album very creative and yeah I'm just gonna say creative creative metal band that uses black metal is kind of a foundation but experiment into other things and uh messed up the corner here like an idiot dropped it like a dumbass but the records are still in great shape I believe it's actually kind of like a dump gatefold you guys know I love my gate folds double vinyl although I don't know if this record is actually so long it needs to be on to records I don't know but uh yeah kind of like a Oh black on white splatter thing going on here which I like a lot you know I like that design you know I like the design aspect I like when you get a cool color what Pokemon's nerd war the Hermit that the human survey yet and the evaporators present busy doing nothing this is actually the new evaporators LP gnar doir had sent this to me himself thank you Thank You nard warrant for for this album and actually uh you know if you're if you're in the market for a new evaporators LP do check this out the evaporators album ripple rock except the name of it I used to have it on vinyl like when I was in high school and I loved the hell out of that album like listen to it tons and tons awesome awesome fun crazy punk rock songs and on this in this vinyl package actually kind of comes an interesting calendar a quote-unquote punk rock calendar that even branches into a 2013 and with an interesting collection of photos it's a punk rock calendar but there's a picture of James Brown in there putting in a James Brown was Punk and this is actually a collection of tracks that features a lot of guest contributors and singers including Andrew W K Sage Francis is on this LP -

Z7wMOFelXjY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review pig destroyer book burner these guys were DC metal band and over the course of their 15 or so year career they have penned a few of the most notable releases in the genre of grindcore tara fire prowler in the yard of course with every LP extremity is pig destroyers calling but also variety has has played a very important role in their progression to the release natasha sticks out in the band's discography which combines elements of dark ambient music drone noise sludge metal as well and it is just one big long piece the album phantom limb saw the band increasing their Riviere side with elements of death metal and thrash kind of seeping their way into their grindcore stylings and the LP is prowler in the yard and tera fire were just pretty much varying degrees of production quality breakneck speeds noise and vocal abrasion with the occasional detour to kind of slow things down and just break the monotony of the extreme fast and just ear piercing sounds all over these albums tracks like grave dancer sour heart piss heart and star belly and if you're looking to get into grindcore though there are classics that precede these albums tear fire and an Prowler are not bad places to start simply because they have cleaner and leaner production styles that feel a bit more modern and as far as you know just the grind core aesthetic goes there pretty meat-and-potatoes albums as far as this new LP book burner goes pig destroyer while i do feel like they are hard they are heavy they are in your face fast and furious I don't really think they're reaching for that nether that next level of extremity or at least that next interpretation of it you know grindcore consistently is a thrill-seekers genre and I just wasn't finding in edible amount of thrills on this LP honestly there are just rifts galore on this LP and while it does make a catch here maybe easier to listen to they're very mosh friendly riffs nowhere near as disorienting as stuff I've heard Pig destroyer view in the past and you know while I do love a good riff that can get a pip going maybe some this fly moments like the start of the diplomat or the end of the track Eve or the beginning of the track valley of the geezers the slower riffs on these tracks just strike me as something that like a second-rate metalcore band would play and I'm not saying that pig destroyer has gone metalcore on this album it's just that you know that's what the riffs feel like to me and that's all times I do like the slightly more beefed up production sound that picture-story brought on this album it's definitely added to the heaviness and and the thickness I mean it's really a proper sound for the kind of riffs that Pig destroyers writing on this album I just don't really think what they've written has all that much I guess originality or just flavor distinction to it and you know I feel kind of silly and ridiculous picking for standout moments on an album where pretty much every track is trying to be as aggressive as possible but very few spots on this album Wow me in the way that you know for example the forty second title track on here does which in its very short time span kind of goes through about four or so movements if you would let me call them that and they're to some awesomely syncopated guitar riffs the drums are just right on top of them at the very end of the song that are pretty catchy and the track Baltimore strangler has a really tight syncopated introduction as well that just gets me going gets me excited but once that riff that heavy ma out kind of riff comes in and the drums are playing behind it in the groove gets going I feel like I'm on a teacup ride at the carnival bobble I kind of feel like I'm listening to a less intense version of you know the heavier grindcore stylings of napalm death on the album enemy of the music business again grind core is not really the kind of genre one goes into searching for nuances it's just more about the raw power in the ferocity and certainly destroyer has that the vocals on this album are great they just swallow the mix there so oh they're just so throaty they're just so evil and the inclusion of the band's new drummer Adam Jarvis has been great for this album there are moments on here where I don't really think he saves any of these mosh friendly riffs that I feel like are being cranked out on this album maybe what he's playing on the drums kind of falls behind them on interestingly but when the band is blasting when the band is making an interesting change on here he is they're enhancing what is going on the introductory and outro spots on the track Machiavellian are as intense as they are detailed and the opening blasts that Jarvis plays on the introduction of the track white lady are just absolutely manic all in all on this album Pig destroyer still has that level of aggression that while it isn't anything completely new it is captivating they retain that essence of grindcore that you know if you're not into this genre if you put this album on for 30 seconds you're pretty much going to be turning it off so there's definitely not any question that they have gone soft album they just kind of toy with a style of riff writing that I don't completely care for it feels kind of tacked on it feels added on to their usual style I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next and then Fantana pig destroyer forever 
zjJprluULvI,"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review three three three in the middle of infinity 3 : 33 is the mysterious music production outfit I've been kind of enthralled with since I first heard about them in 2011 via a couple of releases first 10,000 days and live from the Grove and what was on these albums were basically beats rhythms just beat music but the sounds were just incredibly low Phi especially the percussion is really distorted loud kind of over modulated but working outside of these rhythms that would be thrown into these tracks were very clear elements of drone dark ambient music and the grooves that were being played by these rhythms weren't so much you know head nodding or anything like that you know not really something that's gonna force you to want to move really instead kind of setting a pace for the very moody atmosphere all the other sounds are kind of you know creating and though 3:33 does pretty much present the same sound and style on this new LP there are some noticeable improvements for one in comparison with live from the Grove there is a wider frequency of sounds on here the bass is really low it's really heavy resonant I especially feel it on on some of the drone ear tracks like par-5 though a lot of the sounds on here can be very low can be very over modulated and that makes this album sound great on speaker it doesn't make it that enthralling of an experience though on headphones but to kind of continue about part 5 of in the middle of infinity there are these metallic jangles in the background along with this rhythm and just these these drone ear sounds it's very hot kind of looped into the beat and the rhythm is much more subtle and quiet on this track in comparison with other songs which have just more hard-hitting drum Tambor's this is just really kind of hypnotic and calming however the more hard-hitting tracks on here like part three of this LP aren't bad either for sure the drums on that track are just pounding just they're so dirty they're so distorted and they're consistently selling every single track here the drums on this LP maybe be played live but then they're taken and sampled and then placed into the song there are all sorts of miscellaneous sounds and noises kind of cluttering in the background and there is what sounds like a tubular Bell looped into the beat here and it's really eerie this track a lot of tracks on here kind of really like taking a rhythmic elevator to the underworld and I love part eight on this LP as well not a hard hitting track more like a drum circle occurring in this very windy barren wasteland there all these psychedelic sounds echoing in this panoramic fashion in the mix of some fat synth drones as well on that track is just heavy this LP is just consistently dark heavy textured just quality sounds on here those very obvious positives come with some very obvious and negatives as well and these are things that I think this project has been consistently lacking in all of its releases though this album has intrigued me the most thus far for one sequencing I mean the rhythms are not really that interesting for the most part a lot of the times I just kind of feel like they're getting the job done 3:33 doesn't really change them up or progress them in any way whatsoever they just kind of loop them until you know they've gotten a bit stale and the thing is a lot of the songs out here function with with nearly the same formula it's like unmistakable moody intro featuring tones and/or drones or some kind of sound effect the beat hard introduction may be kind of a messy or you know hazard edit introducing the drums and then that kind of continues for a little bit maybe there's an alteration with the tones then the beat just cuts out mysteriously with no warning whatsoever the tones just kind of hang in the atmosphere for a little bit then the beat kicks in with no warning whatsoever and then the song just kind of finds a way to fizzle itself out and I'm certainly not trying to say there's no ambition on this album the forty one minute closer has that and that track is really one of the reasons I got intrigued enough by this album to want to review it because even though I'm not completely in love with it a lot of you guys may be very into this in a very interesting way 3:33 stretches out there ambient limbs on this track and and builds a multi-phase piece with this white noise kissed intro and then it sort of subtly moves from one idea to the next not a lot of heavy rhythms in this spot but some very spacious and droney and dark noise scapes that are very unsettling in a way I mean just really begging for some kind of horror movie dark nocturnal forest scene to sort of be caught on camera so that it can set itself to that again I like 3:33 style I just kind of feel like there's a lack of development in the terms of detail on a lot of these beats if that was there I could see myself being way more impressed with what's going on here I didn't love a handful of the tracks on here and nothing on this album really hit me as being terrible for sure I'm kind of feeling a decent strong six on this LP what do you think about it if you've given it a listen do you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana 333

w_6tcxol2J0,hi everyone hi everyone Anthony Fantan Oh serious business this is the internet the Internet Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review cream Riggins alone together this guy is a multi-instrumentalist producer and drummer predominantly in the genre of jazz well despite the extensive jazz background of this mr. man on this LP hip hop is his calling you could say it's actually been his calling for quite a while now having his creative hands in production for artists such as common Erykah Badu the roots slum village a group which of course is home to the infamous J Dilla who's very sample heavy colorful and textured approach to hip hop production has made him pretty much a legend in underground rap circles and that is well that creme Riggins drinks from two artistically as well as contemporaries such as Madlib and and countless other artists too I would actually say so countless that there's a bit of saturation when it comes to hip-hop production like this and with artists out there such as Flying Lotus and all those people in the brain feeder collective as well as clams casino Lex Luger and Death Grips I would throw in there too it's just a brave new world of hip-hop production the sound artists like J Dilla worked with can seem kind of old hat at this point and to an extent that may be true but Riggins brings a myriad of instrumentals on this LP between about 34 tracks and they've all kind of got different characteristics to them and if you just kind of sit back and give this LP a chance I think you'll hear what is happening on this album is pretty well executed impressively so this LP is just one of those moments where execution and in great grooves transcends familiarity transcends style and even to an extent originality and even though this is Reagan's debut LP in 2012 keep in mind he has been added since the 90s guys like mad lib and J Dilla are and way peers fellow collaborators not just influences while Riggins doesn't have the extensive back catalogue and the influence that these two artists have in a lot of ways he's pretty much cut from the same cloth because in a lot of ways he approaches beat production with that same mad scientist mindset his music just has the sense that he would die for that ever long pursuit of all sounds fat smooth and punchy like most beat LPS of this style a lot of the songs on here run from about one to two minutes you know short tracks but as I've said before when it comes to albums in this genre I don't really mind being abrupt if you're throwing a lot of material at me and in the short amount of time you'll light yourself you're able to make an emotional impact able to kind of create a strong mood and I will say that Reagan certainly has the power to do that despite the fact that maybe this LP is a bit more disjointed than most albums in this style simply because yeah you may have a two or three minute track on here but it may go through a couple phases from beginning to end just a bunch of NPC sculpted mood pieces and motifs built of jazz funk and soul samples with the occasional bit of live instrumentation to so I really kind of feel like I have no choice but to go through this LP just kind of mentioning some instrumental highlights the track round the outside kicks off the LP with just a really fat analog synth Wow Wow Wow and this track just has a rush of rhythm from the kick drum to the snare a bunch of hand percussion to I think there's like a triangle to some italic sound in there too and it's a nice group the track mugie fuga comes in later it's a great song as well and just kind of has this farty little punctuated synth phrase and it gets a little eerie with the what sounds like a flute hanging in the background and the keyboard that sounds a bit like a harpsichord definitely the most Halloween fit beat out of the whole bunch and the song Stadium Rock certainly lives up to its name with these heavy rushes of drum fills and and guitar in between these shots of very distant background vocals kind of singing in unison oh and the song alto flute doesn't really feel like it has a high-pitched alto flute on it actually feels like a low-pitched woodwind kind of playing this very hypnotic phrase as there's this rolling kick drum on the track that is just kind of mind-boggling to me in the song Esperanza one of my favorite beats on here has some acoustic guitar and there some flute as well and it's just got this like you know sweet lovely little melody it reminds me of love but like love gone sour like I totally just want to write a bunch of rhymes about falling out of love with somebody to this B and the song harpsichord session is is quite literally a live instrumental jam with Kareem Riggins and and some other players for a few minutes and nice as well and that's just the first half of this LP which technically is a bit of an album in and of itself because this album has been released as separate twelve inches as well titled alone and together and together they are kind of like a CD compilation alone together so the second half of this LP does have kind of an intro track does have an outro track just like the first half does it follows the same kind of disjointed path and is chock-full of the very same variety consistency and element of surprise that pretty much makes the first half of the LP so good although I will say the for ending tracks of this LP especially the closer J Dilla the greatest get pretty ambitious as far as negatives on this LP go I mean it is heavily steeped in that J Dilla beat production tradition like I said Corrine Riggins comes from that school of thought nothing mind-blowing Lee knew on this album but if you are an appreciator of collections of instrumentals I think it will be difficult to listen to this and kind of disregard it as nothing special because there's certainly a lot of great musical ideas here great grooves creativity I wish some songs lasted longer of course there are other tracks on here namely Esperanza for example where I do feel like I'm in love with the track more for the sample then what Kareem brigands actually does with the sequencing of the song like hey you know you really letting the sample do all the work here but still I did love what was going on with this LP just a nice nice cross-section of jazz sounds and hip hop beats grooves rhythms along with the occasional touch of Moog or cork synthesizer just bring another interesting texture in there feeling a light too decent eight on this LP what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what should I review next and that's it creme Riggins alone together forever 
VUUxtEQLAiQ,hi Bert hi everyone Anthony Fantana here thank you for watching Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Kendrick Lamar good kid maad city the student is a compton rapper this is his sophomore full-length album the follow-up to last year's section.80 which is one of my favorite hip hop albums of 2011 and it's a conscious hip hop album that does not sacrifice grape flows production catchy hooks stellar wordplay and personality in the process of developing a very relevant and this is a socially aware message and it does this through a series of short stories in the tracks lyrics that kind of come together thematically by the end of the album though Kendrick has a lot of great qualities as a rapper what I thought was so awesome about section 80 is how conceptual the album was and that was a characteristic about him and his music that I just was hoping he would not let go of as he kind of went into later albums and I'm actually really happy to say that being conceptual is one of the artistic personality traits of Kendrick that has gotten stronger there are a good handful of tracks from this album that had been released before the release of this LP including swimming pools backseat freestyle Compton the art of peer pressure as well but none of it really makes total sense until the entire albums being listened to from beginning to end just kind of standing back getting a glimpse at the bigger picture of things as far as lyrics on this LP go they're just on point track after track after track none of the flows really feel elementary or anything like that and though some songs may feel a little more shallow on the surface than others it may depend on the kind of character that Kendrick is playing on the song for example the track backseat freestyle you've got Kendra kind of wrapping very braggadocious Leo over this banger beat about is growing as big as the Eiffel Tower it is just completely over-the-top ridiculous if you're familiar with this kids music it's just really out of character for him but if you look into the voicemail messages occurring after and before the track and the music that comes before and after the track it becomes apparent that Kendrick right now is in the backseat of a car chilling with his friends just kind of being as loud and obnoxious as they are as they're all hanging out together right after backseat freestyle you get the track the art of peer pressure which is kind of like an internal monologue with Kendrick where yeah he's hanging out with his friends and he's having you know this good time on the outside but in fact he's kind of doing all this stuff that is out of character for him whether it be doing drugs running up on people robbing houses things he wouldn't normally find himself doing if he wasn't hanging out with people who see themselves successfully living this gangster lifestyle and with this track it becomes even more interesting and ironic that on backseat freestyle how he's rapping about how he would love all this money and power living this lifestyle he's as far away from that as one could possibly imagine good kid maad city is pretty much a story of love lust violence the violence that you're surrounded with kind of sucking you in the violence you're surrounded with tearing your family apart and finally the realization of where a violent path can kind of bring you in life which is where a song like real comes in toward the end of this LP and pretty much every track on this album adds to that narrative like the track poetic justice which is kind of like a love song Kendrick sees himself and like this love fantasy with this girl that's mentioned toward the beginning of the album sharain but at the end of the track Kendrick ends up getting jumped by two cousins of hers at that moment Kendrick kind of sees himself violently snapped back into a harsh reality after seeing hey you know like living this life isn't really so bad things are going pretty well I'm in love I see money coming my way which is kind of another fantasy Kendrick sees himself in the midst of on the track money trees right before poetic justice after these two songs it's two of the grittiest tracks this entire LP good kid and mad city that become really sobering the first of which Kendrick is talking about the death of his uncle he's talking about racial profiling for police officers and the track mad city takes a look at that same violence but for more of a retrospective angle with Kendrick kind of rapping about a younger version of himself and on that track he actually takes a completely different inflection with his voice rapping where his voice is cracking like this whether it's from emotion or maybe even puberty if he's trying to be a younger version of himself either way it's just really chilling and the old-school sound of that retrospective angle is embraced even more as there is a beat change toward the middle of the track you do get some self-aware spots on this album where you have Kendrick kind of rapping about his current self outside of this storyline like bitch don't kill my vibe where he's kind of rapping about his fame and sort of where he sees his artistic vision going as he gets more attention on his music and sort of how his message is ultimately what's going to be most important to him and the song singing about me is really one of the most interesting songs I've ever heard where a rapper is is literally writing about his art and his career in such a way where it's impacting the people who listen to it or the people he raps about I mean he literally does verses on this song referencing people who kind of work inspirations for music on this album and his previous LP - in a way the song is kind of like another layer of narrative to this album itself it's kind of like an epilogue in a way and the song Compton the the closing track to this LP it's kind of like a celebratory song just talking about the area where this story takes place it's kind of like the song that if you really do take this album as being a story it's it's the track that really kind of plays as the credits are rolling now as far as the production goes on this LP it is sonically inconsistent but I do think overall it's great but the reason I say sonically inconsistent is that you know the sounds on this LP change up as much as the scenes and just sort of the moods of these tracks do you know that the sounds most definitely fit the story Kendrick is trying tell her where he is in the progression of this tale the opening track show rain is just really nocturnal it's really dark and it's completely fitting for what kind of seems to be a night drive to his girlfriend's house you know going to meet her talking about being with her what brought him up until this point and basically the point at which he is about to get jumped and then just kind of cuts the song backseat freestyle is perfect for the braggadocious rhymes that kendrick spits over that song and is fitting for the outward personality that he has as he's doing these things he finds to be very outside of his character the song is basically a portrait of that face that people put on when they want to be hard they want to fit in they want to be perceived to be tough the best the greatest but the other side of that song is the art of peer pressure and the beat on there is really spacious very quiet it's meant to sound as internal as the thoughts that Kendrick is spinning all over that track the thoughts that he doesn't really want to express because of the people that are surrounding him money trees poetic justice sound really dreamy really fantasy sonically there's like this oasis there this place you want to be but good kid maad city just kind of like I said earlier snap things back into reality they're much darker grittier hard-hitting I believe the track swimming pools was the first to drop from this LP it's a song I wasn't totally hot on at first but it has totally grown on me it's got kind of a synthetic vibe to it synthetic drums betta keyboards and there are a lot of traps style high hats going out there at the track it feels really smooth kind of watery like you could dive into it just like the metaphorical swimming pool full of alcohol that Kendrick is rapping about that you know people figuratively used to kind of douse their pain douse their sorrows basically deal with this terrible situation surrounding them in a really unhealthy way and I love the sound of the Just Blaze beat on that closing track Compton I mean the horns on the track sound fantastic the talkbox vocals at the very end are nice too again the sound of the instrumental is just always really logical in terms of what's being said in the lyrics and I love that you know in just the sound quality the music of these instrumentals are great to some feature some pretty nice piano pieces some string pieces as well nice background vocalists and the features on here pretty great too not they're spending the best verses of all time but what I love about this LP is like the beats Kendrick is very careful about placing certain people in certain places so that it works j-rok is in a perfect spot on the salim dre is placed perfectly on this LP too with the track compton of course and even drake finds himself fitting nicely into this album I mean stylistically Drake and Kendrick are two very different artists and yet Drake fits like a glove into the love song on this album every emcee helps Kendrick not really tell this story directly but they further the feeling of the song with whatever they're saying as far as hip-hop albums go and just albums in general this this thing has almost everything I look for you know has a great concept great lyrics great instrumentals sound I think the only weak spot that Kendrick has on this LP something that continues to kind of be a weak spot for him are just the hooks but I have to admit that this LP is a nice improvement hook wise over what I heard on section 80 poetic justice has kind of a corny vocal on the hook the song reel where you know cutting I'm really really real the hook is just really really just vapid while I do like the sentiment of the song I really kind of feel like no forethought went into that chorus and there are moments where Kendrick is singing on here in this really weird inflection it's kind of robotic and while it did hit me as being pretty strange at first it really grew on me pretty heavy by my third or fourth listen to this LP I'm really impressed with this LP I mean I love it I think it's fantastic I think Kendrick has made his profound quality you know that quality that he has to bring a strong message to his music even better you know he's he's evolved that he's brought it to the next level and yet he's done it by not being preachy not beating listeners over the head with some kind of you know cause very direct message he's done it through allegory anecdotes a combination of fiction and nonfiction that if you listen to it hard enough to get the bigger picture get the narrative and just hear the story it's most likely going to have a bigger impact on you bbbb I'm pretty much feeling a light to decent night on this album what did you think of it if you've listened to it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana kendrick lamar good good good good kid maad city forever 
gmM4mXdYuho,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's a bitter little and it's time for an album review blue and exile give me my flowers while I can still smell them obviously this is the hip hop duo consisting of blue who is an MC and a little bit of a producer in exile who is a producer and a little bit of an MC and what this album is is a project that they originally teamed up for last year they put it up on Bandcamp leaked it and in the state that it was it was a pretty rough and unmastered listen but now in this new recently released version you're getting an actual mastering process done here the track list is tweaked a little bit which I'm happy to hear I'm sure a lot of people that heard this LP are going to enjoy this remaster a lot more but still the rule of thumb for many is going to be the last project that these two put out together below the heavens which is easily one of the most essential hip-hop albums of 2007 I mean just really conscious charismatic rhymes with some great production that flirted with soul boom bap sounds as well jazz and when it came to a subject matter blue was i but when he had a more freeform song going on he was interesting as well because of his energy but after below the heavens came other projects for blue and man last year last year last year was a weird year for blue blue signed to Warner Brothers to put out his next LP no York they wanted to kind of hold off on the album release kind of became a botch situation leaked the album himself and no real opportunity came up to kind of get a proper release date and promote the album in such a way where it would be heard outside of people in blues a media fanbase now this album that blue leaked no York had a lot of very subdued rapping on it forward-thinking beats some of the hooks were very horribly crafted and the whole ambience of the album wreaked just blunted swag but it was still a pretty interesting LP that I think deserved a little bit more attention than it got on top of this New York situation blue was releasing a group of projects that were just very low Phi horribly recorded messily put together unfocused and this LP was one of those projects the lack of mastering just made it not sound all that great and it was just an overall lack of lyrical fire and energy coming from Blu on this LP again like New York very subdued now I am happy to hear this remastered version but still you know I wish I was getting that same level of energy and same amount of effort from Blu as I heard on you know below the heavens there are some tracks on here that come forward with a very obvious theme or topic like the song were out of life where Blu is rapping about I don't know I guess basically raising the bar for himself personally there's also a great line on here where he's rapping relationship slaveship we got to raise the and the track a man which is one of my favorite songs on here is a song where he's kind of philosophically in pursuit of his heritage his roots but also kind of divulging what he believes is his personal take on religion but I'm sad to say that most of the tracks on here are horribly unfocused when it comes to just a narrative now not to say that this album doesn't have a theme I feel like pretty much all the rhymes that blue spits on this LP are very you know self oriented and very personal not self oriented in a braggadocious way he's just kind of divulging little bits of his personal life now him growing up his youth his ideas experiences his feelings it's as if Blu had a family photo book of his entire life and instead of going through it page by page and sort of telling listeners about the story as it goes he's kind of pulled all the pictures out cut them up into little bits and then kind of reorient them as a collage a lyrical collage now as far as the production goes on here it is as subdued as who is there are some tracks on here that do have kind of a bit more gusto to them namely the song that features a great verse from fashion but still things are toned down on this album it is a much smoother LP and Exiles production reflects that though the beats are still great the track ease your mind easily has one of the the cutest beats on this entire LP that's very plinky piano and the song money has one of the most cutting beats on here but it's kind of a small beat it's like a baby hip-hop party there's a tight groove some Skippy vocals and some DJ cuts horn samples as well and the song good morning neighbor has this you know beautiful day in the neighborhood sampling as well as a song seasons that has a Tom Waits vocal sample in the freaking track which actually goes over pretty well I did like the cell peak quite a bit I think blue right now is kind of on this rough lo-fi tip at the moment that I think works really well for some MCS that have a very kind of gritty persona to them but blue doesn't really have that at his disposal which is why I think a lot of these low fight projects just have not panned out to be something that great for him I mean the only thing that has made this album good is the little bit of focus that has come with the tracklist tweaking and the remastering though I do think a lot of the personal musings that blue on this album has to say are pretty interesting he doesn't really approach them with any urgency whatsoever and it does make me tune out at times even though I you know do like the instrumentals and I do like a lot of what blue is is putting out lyrically I'm feeling like a light - decent seven on this LP what did you think if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan Oh blue and Exile forever [Music] [Music] 
K-VeGR63e78,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets hahahaha busiest music nerd and it's time for you review Daphne jaw long it's it's a dude Oh Daphne as counter Chester just found out is actually the pseudonym of longtime electronic music producer daniel Smith aka caribou aka Manitoba and listen to this album and I'm like in my head what's going on here what's going on here two of my favorite electronic music producers this year caribou and for Tet both release albums that are comprised of simpler more straightforward tech house songs and more of a compilation style considering the fact that there were tracks released long before the release of this LP that were singles that was even a track off of this LP that landed on a split with four tet and i do know that these guys are our conscious admirers of one another's work so I mean what's going on here are they in competition are they competing right straightforward kind of boxy tech house songs scene who does it better probably not you know probably not but I would like to pretend that they are yeah so yeah basically on this LP daniel Smith works with the robotic repetitive and subtly progressing sounds of techno and house building these songs on a variety of textures synthesizers and samples and overall this LP is a real mixed bag not a lot of obvious connections between these tracks other than their sort of genre consistency but still fun for the ride for the most part there's some great sounds and samples on this LP for one the big fat synthesizer on the track yes I know and I love the sole sample on this track too even though it is a very repetitive sample you know it's kind of a short loop it does make the track pretty catchy and it is a standout section of music to put into your track I mean the the female vocal on on this particular sample is a emotive the second track takes a bit of a lighter approach with a lot of hand drums in this problem it actually kind of feels like a combination of of Afrobeat house with a lot of psychedelic synth swirls just surrounding the beat the track light is another mood change on this LP while it is still a tech and house song and does have a straightforward rhythm it's really bubbly and kind of quirky and has these kind of glitchy since popping up all over the place it actually kind of reminds me of the popcorn song but grown up matured gone to college made out with some girls took some shrooms you know pass a few classes you know like had some experiences and the closing track on here has a rhythm that is actually just awash in some very calming and and nice synth textures it's like a wall many of these tracks push some pretty irresistible grooves as well some of these grooves are harder than others but what really makes some of these tracks awesome are just their detailed progressions daniel Smith is a meticulous producer and it shows on these tracks to me electronic dance music especially when we're talking stuff like this that does have a strong repetitive element to it it's kind of like a game of chess you know in order to stay in the game you think about a lot of your moves ahead of time and I have to say I don't really feel like he approaches these tracks with that attitude for a good handful of the songs here in a way he does kind of throw caution to the wind for one the track pairs has one of the least interesting grooves on this entire LP it's a bit dinky what the synths are playing it's it's kind of Elementary and there's this moment in the track we're just out of nowhere there's this synthesizer that comes in emphasizing the groove it's like a dentist drill piercing straight into my ears not only because it is a very sharp sound but for whatever reason it is mixed like twice as high as all the other sounds in the entire track song Zhao this guitar sample in it that when it is played in full it doesn't really find its way into the groove of the track it kind of dances around the groove like in a game of musical chairs and just cannot find a seat to put its acid and the song spring this has a kind of sporadic approach while the beat is repetitive Daniel Snape has the synthesizers popping up all over the place that at times can be just as sharp as some of the synthesizers that I heard in pairs and it's fast like this where I just kind of feel like you know the sounds aren't even that interesting the patterns that they're playing with aren't even that interesting as well their randomness isn't so disorienting that you know it's it's kind of glitch me out or made me feel something it just becomes this thing that I'm sure is fun for caribou to execute but it's not really that fun for me to listen to and again the sense on that spot and a lot of spots here are just mixed so loud they drown out everything else or they become kind of ear piercing but still it's it's enough to keep me from from loving this LP which I was originally really looking forward to Fiona light too decent six on this what do you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan oh ja long daphne forever 
_JtSBVS1GkA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Between the Buried and Me the parallax to future sequence these guys are a North Carolina band and for their five previous albums for this one they have been combining the aggression the vocals and the ridge of metalcore with elements of progressive rock as well maybe some melodic musical passages some noodley guitars very technical playing it's essentially metalcore with finesse it's a game plan the band has been working with for a while now and in the process of using this game plan they have turned out some pretty notable albums such as Alaska and colors now in 2009 with the LP the great misdirect the band diversified even more even incorporating moments that kind of felt like very Lounge jazz ish with vocals that were really hamming it up over the top and overall the band was starting to incorporate progressive elements that really started sounding a bit like Dream Theater now this new LP is the follow-up to an EP the band put out last year and I guess you can say this is the band's most ambitious album yet when it comes to modern and very tightly produced metalcore getting fused with just about everything but the kitchen sink the riffs that these guys play on some of these tracks are getting more complicated the songs shift suddenly from one idea to another the band really makes this album follow a narrative sonically and lyrically sometimes incorporating vocals that stand out as being incredibly theatrical when compared to stuff on their last album they even have a title track on here just track in the middle where you've got some spoken word going on as well Between the Buried and Me really on this record are they're showiest and and cam piaced yet everything is just emphasized for dramatic effect and you know I can acknowledge the personal strides that Between the Buried and Me make on this record all day but that doesn't mean it appeals to me necessarily because to be honest I think the band's more progressive edge was executed much more tastefully on their past few albums quite literally a lot of tracks on this LP are just a barrage of ideas just being thrown one after the other so quickly it's hard to keep track of them however a lot of these ideas whether they're riffs or drum beats are so similar in scope it kind of feels like the track isn't even really progressing I think the biggest and the first violator of this is the track layer ghosts to rest this track comes blazing with blast beats and and riffs that hit grooves that I'm sure between the Barrett and me needed Texas Instruments calculators in order to work out mathematically with a lot of these riffs being backed up with this organ flavored keyboard and when this stuff gets old over the course of this 10-minute track the band works out this segue and then goes into this slow-moving melodic passage where you have all these clean vocals soaring over the music and while I don't necessarily take to you know clean vocals in metal like this like a duck to water I do have to say I mean these vocals are suspecting to me I mean really the wimpiest clean vocals I've heard in in modern metal and what's worse is that throughout this track the band kind of distracts from the fact that there's not really that strong of a song to this track by ooh we're going to stop and take a little detour to like circus keyboard land and to go further on the vocals I mean yeah I'm not really big on the cleans but I'm not huge on the screams either with this LP I mean I feel like on this album specifically for Between the Buried and Me the scream vocals are very flat and unvaried the screams are loud but it's like there's no body to them they sound the same on almost the entire LP now the track extremophiles elite the next lengthy song on this album kind of follows the same formula as as lair ghosts green all these riffs all these drum parts very dense very detailed then in the midst of it all you get this vibraphone solo the track closes out with another melodic passage and it just all becomes a blur for me no matter how many times I listen there's some very tiresome and kind of corny spoken word in the middle of the LP kind of bring the album into its second movement the only track I liked on the first half of this LP was astral body it's actually a track I loved it's a tastefully put together piece of progressive metal where the Vans guitar heroism and and they're very tight playing actually adds up to something inspiring with these building guitar leads just layering some nice harmonies on each other Beni Mayo Brown all these syncopated rhythms and great and colorful chords being laid over these riffs in the process this track comes together fluidly and it's exciting because it comes together fluidly a lot of the other tracks on here especially the lengthier ones feel like musical slugfests where the band's just throwing out any idea that they kind of came up with off the top of their heads and wrote down trying to see which one stick and just which ones don't now the second half of the cell P is a little bit more enjoyable than the first I felt like a lot of the longer songs at the spawn the album weren't as gimmicky as the tracks prior incorporating solos from instruments you usually wouldn't expect in a metal record despite the fact that there is stuff on this half of the record like a 12 bar blues solo and a flute solo I do think that these songs rely a little bit more on the merits of their songwriting as opposed to just the the barrage and detour tactic that the band has been using up until this point and while I am catching more memorability in fluidity with the latter half of this LP still I mean the lack of variation with the screen vocals the cleans that are not really sitting with me all too well plus the fact that the band's very monotonous and technical Rivage combined with the production here has made a series of metal that just has no excitement or viscera for for me personally this LP to me listen after listen after listen just gets more and more tiring which is weird because it's like only an hour you know for me personally it's not really a lengthy piece of music you know I just wasn't feeling this LP not for me gotta say it's not for me even though you know this is a new record for Between the Buried and Me this is the first time they're sounding exactly like this I'm just kind of flabbergasted at how a band can just basically make an album that is so dense with musical ideas and phrases and riffs and melodies but not one of them comes off as like feeling refreshing or new I'm feeling strong three to a light four on this LP but if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and I know that there are people watching who loved this record I would like to specifically hear from you as to what about this album moves you or if it sticks out to you and in the band's discography and a positive or even a negative way let me know Anthony Fantana thank you for watching Between the Buried in me forever [Music] 
bZHECvXQsz4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and we have to do another vinyl video well vinyl video is this I totally forget I don't even remember I'm just lost lost in the world alright let's continue going through my collection we last left off on Matt MOS in the m's and we're just gonna keep going mc5 check out the jams oh damn you wanna listen to this album one of the best live rock albums ever I mean mc5 there are instances of people saying in the past that they pretty much throw a lot of political you know phrases and words into their songs just to kind of you know appeal to people and you know be be you know kind of shocking or something like that and their studio albums we're never really good as this live LP but I mean some great songs on here including kick out the jams come together freakin rocket reducer number 62 there is a freaking Sun rock cover on this album as well that it's just noisy heavy hectic I mean this is just a badass live rock LP from back in the day man look at those dudes some heavy dudes and the this is one of those older pressings of the album where if you listen to it before kick out the jams when he's like you know instead they edit it out so he says it sounds like he says brothers and sisters instead but it sounds completely different like it's a terrible at it doesn't even sound like he's he's saying it naturally so yeah this is like one of those edited versions but um but it wasn't like that's like a hairline scratch across the record but still nice pressing of the record that's a good condition moving on John McLaughlin an electric guitarist check out John McLaughlin man this guy was a monster guitar player still is he's still freakin alive he came out with an album last year I think I mean I wasn't really into it not really into the new direction but back in the day when jazz fusion was you know was pretty hot this guy was was easily one of the best especially with with Mahavishnu Orchestra but this is a solo LP that he did where there's a lot of great guitar playing on here as well I actually got um this copy from my my buddy Brian shoutout to Brian loving Brian I'm taking good care of it I'm not beating it up or nothin all right MGMT congratulations with an album cover that that I'm pretty sure is like it's supposed to be like scratch off like you can take a quarter maybe that's as scratching a little bit right there but I haven't scratched it I just haven't had the desire to you know have the cover scratched or even just sort of make the mess that it would probably create if I took a quarter of this and I just sort of like scratching up the cover congratulations a lot of people did not like MGMT's direction on this LP and I can understand why you know I mean they're really just kind of like a pop band before this album and a lot of people because of that had already decided that MGMT is not their thing and MGMT's fans who are pretty much looking for another pop album didn't really care for the more experimental in psychedelic direction that they took on this new LP but I think this record is actually pretty good I mean it's an interesting psychedelic rock and pop record yeah there are some tracks that I don't think really are that well developed you know here and there where they try to over shoot their you know abilities a bit with structuring a track you know kind of making something a little bigger than life but man there are some great freaking singles on here including the closing track which i think is just a fantastic closing track in general you know for disclosing tracks period misfits records misfits legacy of brutality a lot of you know b-sides on here maura compilation really than than an album where Eagles dare she Halloween American Nightmare static age TV casualty hybrid moment some of my favorite misfit songs on this LP great collection nothing really special about the pressing as well as you know this record nothing really amazing about the president 12-inch single of die die my darling we bite mommy can I go out you know tonight there's Danzig Jerry Doyle Robbo as well as me my favorites missed maybe my favorite misfits record earth ad I have walk among us but not on vinyl sadly Queen wasp on here devil lock Metallica does a pretty badass cover of a track off of here and this is a little teepee this is a compilation I know it's an EP from The Misfits we are 138 Bullet Hollywood babble-on attitude horror business teenagers from Mars last caress a lot of these tracks ended up on static age that ended up getting put out later but our business did not actually make it onto that that little thing and I don't know why and this is actually one of the records that the misfits put out on plan nine marketed by cherry-red before they jumped to Caroline when they start with and I believe this is like an older UK original pressing there's not even like a label on this record you know this doesn't even list anything as being on the EP but um if not earth ad that this is this is definitely my favorite collection of misfits tracks it's short sweet brutal gruesome and hard-hitting many of the classics misunderstanding human behavior old baby this is actually a misfits punk band this is actually a bit of alt-country in default a record that a personal acquaintance of mine made you know coming across that may be difficult but uh again you can look it up old baby misunderstanding human behavior five-track EP the print is on this side and hopefully you can see the other side in the camera on the other side there is an etching of what looks like we get in it you know we're kind of getting at horses there's an eyeball in the middle there's people riding the horses so interesting edging on the other side of this record the songs are pretty decent production is good you know got that all country twang to it moving on jazz dialogue the matter jam that the modern jazz quartet or yeah the quartet there but quintet here now quartet quartet quartet quintet quartet quintet quartet quintet featuring freakin one of my favorite jazz artists Milt Jackson I love jazz vibraphone just love the sound of it and there's some great tunes on here so I mean if you're looking for some you know modern jazz vibraphone jazz then look this up this is actually another record that I'm sure maybe you know even some jazz fans are not really gonna dig I dig it though the thing is a lot of jazz artists for one reason or another started combining their you know music or just their performances with orchestral arrangements which did not sit well with a lot of people that you know just love listening to straight you know quartet quintet trio bands doing some improvisational music and there are improv on here as well as orchestrations and this is one record that I have come across where you know you are hearing previously established hits from the span including Django but you know as well as other tracks but the I guess orchestrations are actually implemented pretty tastefully you know so the modern jazz quartet and the all-star jazz band you know you're hearing some extra instrumentation in there but it's put in there tastefully I got it for five bucks and replay records and Hamden good place if you're looking for some some older stuff Mogwai live LP I bought like the deluxe package when this album came out I got the CD the vinyl the shirt you know the download of the digital movie live show that they did this I'm just not crack and open right now because I have a CD if I want to listen to it was listen to it on the CD yeah I know everybody likes better vinyl sounds better you know and I do agree for the most part but you know and I don't really have a reason to crack this open since I have been listening to I know it sounds like I'm just saying you know live with it so I can't open it really but but if you are looking for a live album I mean that's a hell of a live album and proves that Mogwai is just a powerful live act felonious monk something in blue I can't remember I got ahold of this did I buy this or did someone give this to me um blue sphere hackensack criss cross something in blue nutty yeah it's a Gershwin tune on here I can't remember the heck I got this here my last time I looked at it I know I had it out in a video once but a Warner Brothers Records felonious month was a monster man it's a good condition I definitely must have looked at it before I died oh boy we're gonna finish with Macduff felonious monk something in blue actually I have a few other monk compilations Brian - Volume one is blue notes stuff which is great that's another record label I know back here when I brought up John Coltrane record I mentioned impulse had a lot of great jazz records 50s and 60s Blue Note - if you're looking for some great jazz that came out of that era look up Blue Note but this is a great collection of tracks from felonious monk and a lot of cuts - on both sides of these records I mean a really kind of comprehensive compilation and it doesn't cover everything he's ever done but you get a lot of essential tracks on there if you can find those compilations for cheap but you probably can alright looks like next we're gonna be looking at some Mount Erie but that's pretty much the end of this vinyl compilation video thank you for watching another one coming out soon Anthony Fantana vinyl vinyl happiness forever hello [Music] 
D1KwGTAordE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd I laugh because life is good that's why I laugh doing a question comment thing here and what kind of sparked this question common thing or this this rant is somebody sent me a block of text I got a block of text that I'm about to read you though it had been kind of thinking about doing something like this for a while this is kind of in the catalyst so here is my catalyst I don't know if you patrol your comment section but there are far too many lewd obscene vicious attacks on reasonable comment posts maybe it jives jives with a musical taste that favors hip hop and Punk humbly I admit that I do not know or I wouldn't know in any case it definitely has dragged down the level of discourse know what really kind of bug me about this comment is that this sort of behavior drives with the hip hop and punk crowd so I have to ask is it okay to guess the character of people or the quality of character of people based on what you think they listen to or what you know they listen to like if you enjoy hip hop you must be this way and if you like Punk you must be that way and if you listen to singer songwriters and acoustic music then you must be this other way and you know so on and so forth I mean if music were a race I would pretty much just say that's racist but music isn't a race so I don't know what I would say that is skrillex fans are dumb and they only want to hear drops Juggalos are a gang in their drug addicts and buh-buh-buh-buh-buh people who listen to hardcore music admitted a really angry and violent and I'm just going to say straight up do not assume the content of one's character via musical tastes even if your comments are well-intentioned and that's it and that's it I love you Anthony Fantino character music forever [Music] [Music] 
P0RZxerD8m4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review John Frusciante pbx funicular intaglio zone John Frusciante is a guitar player multi-instrumentalist producer and a studio musician who has collaborated with many great artists contributed to their projects everyone from the Mars Volta to wu-tang Johnny Cash George Clinton the guy has a pretty long rap sheet but I know him best through his work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and though he was separated from the band for a time due to some some pretty intense drug addiction he contributed to some of the band's most seminal work and helped them progress their sound with albums like Stadium Arcadia however I am a relatively new listener when it comes to his solo material which I wasn't all that familiar with until maybe just a few years ago when some of the viewers of my show as I was mentioning that I am into progressive rock music that I am into psychedelic music oh are you into John Frusciante have you tried his stuff and you know being suggested albums like the empyrion and curtains I was pretty impressed by the the great guitar playing the passionate vocals the progressive song structures as well and I really like this dude's adventures nature when it came to what I was hearing outside of these albums as well it just seemed like John Frusciante was pretty versatile creating music on his own that is not only fooling with synthesizer pop and alternative rock but progressive rock as well psychedelic rock ambient music as well so in a way it's no surprise that John Frusciante would be dropping kind of an electronic music album with this new LP which he teased toured with the letter letter e P which had everything on it from synthesizer pop to our Peggy ated synthesizer odyssey's bright beats rap verses from some impressive guest rappers the EP was pretty short but chock full of ideas and flavors with kind of a rough recording on it just had kind of an unpredictable personality I didn't know completely what to make of it I just knew that the possibility of all these sounds coming together here was pretty interesting I got to be honest I feel like something went horribly wrong in the process of doing this kind of stuff short style on the EP - bringing it to a full length because this album has added up to one of the most uniquely unpleasant listening experiences I've had this year keep in mind before I get into this LP I want to say I don't think John Frusciante is just naturally bad at electronic music I mean he's put out electronic style music before especially that collaborative LP he has out with Josh Klinghoffer a sphere in the heart of silence so despite the electronic experience this for me is really just kind of coming out of left field overall I have to say this album sounds exactly like what I would imagine to be demos that Trent Reznor made before the pretty hate machine like before he even musically knew what he was doing I mean the sounds of this LP overall are just very very demo quality the sounds are crummy and not that I'm afraid of lo-fi albums or low fine music or anything like that but what bugs me the most is that all the influences all the various sounds on this album that wouldn't normally be together on a track all seem to be piled on top of one another really haphazardly the guitar tones all seem really kind of thin maybe unequal eyes maybe less equalized and they should be the vocals for the most part all buried track after track and for the most part they're not even performed well John Frusciante gives some of the most ridiculous vocal performances of his entire career on this album moments where he's doing falsettos that are barely holding on to pitch moments where he's screaming I'm just going I mean literally moments on this album I was laughing at what he was doing with his voice I don't know if he meant it to be comical a lot of the synth tones on this LP are very bland very generic and the break beats that he throws in one track after another are just really run-of-the-mill could have picked him up anywhere and he doesn't even really treat them in such a way where they have an interesting Tambor or anything like that occasionally they will be sped up maybe some distortion will be thrown on them but really overall boring boring boring break beats break beats have not been edgy since like the mid to late 90s and not that I think John is is trying to be overly edgy I do think he's trying to be somewhat experimental on this LP though and maybe it's experimental for him you know this certainly new ground for John but in general this is not really opening my eyes to any kind of brand new concepts or anything like that I mean certainly this album is experimental in the sense that everything was just kind of thrown together in a sense to just kind of see what happened with absolutely no effort or refinement or afterthought and though I do think some artists and albums bands can totally do that and come out ahead um this to me doesn't really you know even scratch the surface of what something wondrously experimental jaw-droppingly experimental could be I mean there are spots where I feel like a tune to a song or just a melody can be nice but the performance the vocals are flat the sounds surrounding this song are so awful that I can't even stand it the track here say has all these like acid bass lines that to me sound like John just learned to make bass lines like this the day before he made this track and the vocals he sings throughout the song are just barely on pitch the track bike has all these free jazz like drum solos going all over the place that's kind of invigorating but over that you've got these really sour synth chords that aren't even interesting and least some break beats coming later and throughout this whole mess John is just singing with some of the goofiest vocals a track guitar sounded like somebody's dubstep demo on soundcloud with some wonky guitar soloing over which I did kind of find semi-interesting and the beginning of the track mistakes was really catchy but toward the end when John is screaming it just sounds terrible again kind of like a really awful Nine Inch Nails demo just because something doesn't sound pleasing at first doesn't mean it's really deep or experimental again there are a few moments that I find somewhat appealing or I think could be appealing if they were just rethought groomed just a little bit but to me listening to this album and trying to find things that I like is like I don't know picking through a field full of like bloody corpses trying to find survivors and you know the stench of dead bodies is just like bothering me so much I don't even want to try to sift through it certainly I think some fans will be entertained by hearing John kind of indulgently give his creative side the shock treatment really kind of jumpstart that random side of his personality but for me this just was not interesting at all I'm feeling a really like a light decent too on this album but if you've given it a lesson what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantino john frusciante forever 
MzLUol6iVUA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review converge all we love we leave behind come come come come come converge is a Massachusetts hardcore punk band and thanks to the band's metal music in fusion ambitious songwriting experimentation as well as somatic albums and poetic lyrics they have been one of the most successful and longest-running bands in hardcore punk music languor than Green Day created the bein greenie no not not as no not not as long as it's a great day converge just continues to engage entertain and sometimes even surprise fans with one record after another and converges influence on the current musical landscape branches outside of just their records as well the band's lead singer Jacob Bannon is the founder of Death Wish incorporated record label that has put out many great albums in punk music and its subgenres and guitarist Curt blue is a fantastic record producer has been behind the boards on numerous records that have been reviewed on this channel trap them nails high on fire crowler talked torch black breath now in my humble opinion which you should only take as seriously as you would like to converters approach to this style of music to me has always been very abrasive kind of atonal at times noisy chaotic a little sporadic between the heavy walls of guitar distortion the relentless drums and Jacob bannon's deafening growls converge can be kind of overbearing especially when you consider Kurt Baloo's production chops have brought the band into slightly heavier territory on their past two records however all we love we leave behind production-wise kind of brings a surprising change for me to converge as music at 38 minutes this LP is one of converges shorter LPS and it's a collection of tracks that I think are much less cacophonous than a lot of the bands of recent material the production on this album is just refreshingly transparent and yet still hard-hitting and an adrenaline pumping and this newfound clarity that converge has to its sound is apparent right from the first track on this LP aimless arrow it's a track that opens up with some very newly guitar intense drum fills when the verse kicks in the guitar start playing some very harmonious chords and Jacob Bannon comes through with this very clean kind of impassioned vocal delivery which has kind of a post-hardcore vibe to it something more I would expect from one of the bands that Jacob Bannon has on his death wish label it's not the most hard-hitting of intros for converge but it is a great intro and and one that I think signals the the change that this record has going on and I really love that I can get a grip of the lyrics on this track which seem to be about a person who is abandoning people that need this person love this person to kind of live for themselves live selfishly though trespasses and tender abuse also have elements of harmony to the guitars as well not as abrasive as previous material converged still comes through with both guns blazing on those tracks I mean they're much more hard-hitting the double bass drums and the ridge on trespasses totally reminds me of black breath while the second of the two tracks that actually takes the post-hardcore influence that they sported on the first track and brings it together with some blast beats really kind of a power violence that's this thing and the track sadness to come right after those has this awesome tap guitar line and I love how in the track it comes off as not being overly technical it's just really invigorating along with the guitar solos and the leads that are all over that track as well keep in mind this track is around three minutes longer than many songs on this LP and I love how the band is able to take this short span of time and write a track that just is so hard-hitting so fast so in-your-face but has a lot of details to it from what the guitar is playing in one section there's a segue there's a verse you know it's just not wham bam thank you ma'am though the energy would kind of transmit that the track empty on the inside kind of breaks up the flow of the album by bringing a slower track into the mix heavy sludgy chords just really breaks me down and after the intro which i think is pretty badass there's kind of a spoken-word thing coming in and i don't know maybe it's trying a little too hard to be dramatic it wasn't really completely feeling the lyrics on this part of the track it sickens me to say that this is the only way there are some moments on this LP where I have difficulty extending that poetic license but when lyrically converges on I mean they are on like on the track sparrows fall where I think the band puts out one of the most haunting lyrical mantras of this entire LP don't live as the echo but thrive as the sound and the song vicious Muse later on the LP you know considering the the title of that track I think Jacob banded in it and it perfectly captures the concept of a vicious Muse the track of glacial pace one of my favorite songs on here also had spoken word toward the beginning but that felt even more buried than than what I had just heard there's some pretty progressive changes from one point to another on this track the song is four minutes and 30 seconds totally justifies its length and there's a fantastic climax right toward the end of it but maybe the biggest surprise on this entire LP is another song that I loved a lot coral blue I was kind of off-put by it at first because of the chorus it's got this kind of really harmonious let's all sing together at once kind of quality to it and with the sludgy riffs behind it it actually reminds me of something like Baroness would do the song works a slow pace it's almost ballad like in a sense and I love the lyrics on this song talking about swimming out into see to see what Carmel would bring for me as if karma had something against you I mean it would pretty much take care of you right there but then singing about how they're drowning bodies all around obviously our narrator is not drowning so I guess karma doesn't really have anything on the title track of this LP Jakob Ammann comes with cleaner vocals on this album once again kind of bringing that post-hardcore vibe back into play and it's a passionate track to title this album after I mean really a track that to me sums up the the whole feel of this album yeah it's hard-hitting yeah it's abrasive and in-your-face and yeah it's ferocious but it does have a very strong emotional side to it as well if you read into the melodies the chord progressions and the lyrics and then the sludgy sludgy closer on this thing it is a great track though I do wish it was you know another one of those long drawn-out experimental bits that converge does tend to throw out the end of its albums um still I do love the rips in the chord progression on that track as well I mean you know much more creative and has a much stronger melodic sensibility than most bands you will find in this style of music as it goes it goes like there are moments that yeah this is pretty much what I expect from converge this is converge it does have a flavor of its own apart from the other LPS even if that flavor does add up to something that is a bit more straightforward than the band usually is I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this LP what did you guys think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I do next Anthony Fantana converge forever [Music] 
adyBTyBBOTM,hi everyone Anthony Fantan who here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review that I'm sure on some level no matter how much I prepare and listen I will truly never be ready for Godspeed you black Emperor Alleluia don't bend ascend God speed is a Canadian post rock outfit also delving into the sounds of experimental rock ambient music drone noise and this is their latest LP their fourth full-length album that you can get hold of and it's their first LP in about ten freaking years the band took a hiatus in the early 2000s shortly after the release of their album Yankee uxo however in 2010 the group got back together with a mostly original lineup and started touring again really with no warning whatsoever so it would be pretty fitting that also with no warning whatsoever in the midst of getting back together in touring they've been assembling this new album right under our noses and selling it to fans inconspicuously at some recent live shows and why why the why the mystery you know godspeed has just kind of continued to be a band that takes great pride in the fact that it has always in at least some way worked outside traditional music industry standards it kind of goes without saying that this album has a lot to live up to with the exception of maybe yankee uxo which i know got some mixed reviews upon its release nearly every project godspeed has ever put out has been very beloved influential and in genre defining and there is of course the ten-year gap factor on this album but if any band is naturally equipped to make such a comeback it is Godspeed larger than life music is kinda there thing long winding somewhat cumbersome at times songs that are equal parts joyously noisy and melodic with don't bend ascend at it's very start I wasn't incredibly impressed for me it was kind of an inconspicuous beginning for her God speed LP there was no oar depressingly dismal melody this track didn't even really start off with a gripping vocal sample and it kind of began with a drone that I think would breeze by most years if God speeds name wasn't tagged on to it however what this track evolves into over the course of its 20 minute runtime is spectacular the drone thickens with guitar distortion and all of a sudden just flying over the drone they're just like these plucked string sounds maybe it's a guitar but they're just so sharp and and sour and metallic it's like metallic birds flying overhead in a flock migrating away from the impending storm it's just really gripping and it shows that that God speed has not lost its its touch when it comes to creating a very cinematic soundscape the drone starts building up into something else snares arise out of the fog of noise some downstroke guitar chords kind of reveal themselves and tension just starts growing guitar leads eventually develop and give way to loads of other sounds heavier drones whales squeals feedback and strings I mean God speed creates very masterfully a very menacing wall of sounds the band heads full throttle into string sections and drum fills the pace is really picking up and the track eventually just becomes this hectic jam with a Middle Eastern melody and groove the band is just seamlessly flowing through different levels of intensity as the track continues every once in a while a new melody gets incorporated in the last five minutes of this thing are especially heavy and and awesome with another melody change along with some strings and ninjas some heavy I mean I know this tag does not necessarily get thrown on to Godspeed but I mean this to me is just like an ideal combination of just orchestral subtlety and beauty combined with just a rock sensibility and just Middle Eastern flavor of this track it's so fitting to kick off the start of the cell peak considering it's one of the more war-torn parts of the world right now and it's kind of weird thinking that this track because of its flavor is just as relevant as it would have been had it been released around 2003 when it was originally conceived it's no secret at this point in the promotion of this album that a lot of the material that is on this record god speeds been kind of sitting on it for a while it's just that the performances of these pieces that you're hearing on this record are new but still God speeds aesthetic remains very potent they just continue to be a sonic revolution against political and social injustice and what's crazy is that they've been able to maintain this very socially aware image while not having lyrics or a vocalist and still maybe even without all the very kind of elaborate packaging that typically comes with godspeed albums the message is is incredibly clear in this music in the same way rotting fruit brings fruit flies people who feel disenfranchised or other people who sympathize with those people are going to create art that reflects that and between the soaring melodies and the noise and the intensity and just the thickness and the ambition there are very obvious elements of dissatisfaction in God speeds music of idealism both hope and loss what else could the band be sound tracking maybe I'm thinking about it too much now after the opener on this LP you get three more tracks from God speed another the third track is one more 20-minute epic and kind of separating the first the third track is a six-minute drone and ending the album off is another drone slash ambient piece now the first of the two drones kind of separates the two monster tracks on here maybe it's a bit of a I don't know a dip down from the first track kind of Len things cool off before we jump back into the third song for another 20 minute ride I guess in that respect it does add to the flow of the album but I didn't really catch any logical melodic connections or thematic connections between these three tracks listening to them one after the other it just kind of felt like a bit of a bookmark oh you're over let's wait wait intermission still that doesn't change that what godspeed does on this track their helicopters saying is is very nice and again masterful the way that they've just intertwine all these droning and just kind of screaming and wailing elements into something that is so intense the band without a beat without a clear melody or just a pace a momentum is able to just make things so with loads of dissonant strings kind of piling on one another as the track progresses a synth melodies introduces itself toward the end of the track too there are just a lot of things to pick up in this track considering it's just a wall of sound god speed just brings a lot of detail and just it's all swimming freely throughout this ocean that they're conjuring with their instruments and you yourself are kind of free to explore it at your desire now the second of these two ambient pieces strung like lights actually liked a bit more it did have a bit more direction progression to it than the second track the track just has this really tattered muddy and just desolate beginning and it eventually climaxes very nicely the track is really subtle in its build of course the the climax is chaotic and the eerie synth sounds that are kind of left behind after all the instrumentation disappears very eerie however I still can't help but feel like this is a bit of an anti climactic closure I guess kind of cut and dry compartmentalized to continue we drift like worried fire the third track on here I mean just as great as the first and the song kind of works in two movements both of which had very interesting progressions to them though they are a bit similar the first movement has this very dreary plucked violin melody with these weeping guitars the sounds that they're making are almost something that would perfectly soundtrack a sci-fi film from like the 50s or the 60s however when this violin melody all the guitar sounds fade away the melody ends up being repeated by a guitar and still dreary continues continues continues and as strings and more instrumentation surround this melody it actually ends up sounding uplifting not darker or depressing at all and I love that God speed with their instrumentation can just take the same exact melody and just mood change the entire track just like that with one instrumental phrase or idea leapfrogging over another until the song gets louder and louder and heavier and heavier and just more intense the track eventually climaxes and right after there's this lone beautiful gorgeous violin melody just so rough it's like the sound of crying but like tears of joy now the second movement of this track starts off dreary like the first but ends up sounding kind of positive and inspiring once again but in a different way I mean once the brighter half of this movement comes along the track really picks up speed picks up pace they're just hammering on these harmonious chords the tension again is there but it's kind of a tension that puts a smile on my face and the fact that they're able to jam out these two musical parts that have you know distinctions but also parallels in 20 minutes is just so impressive still I can't really shake the idea that this LP is a collection of tracks that the band kind of assembled in in the best way that they could and even though I don't think the parts when put together in this track listing really make chemistry really make an explosion I do think each part separately at least is extremely impressive and then creates a record that goes over much better than most comeback albums not that that justifies anything it doesn't but still when it comes to long time Godspeed fans and and even newcomers to the band presents the intensity grit beauty melodic sensibilities and high-level ambitions that have always made the band great hopefully soon we'll see the band again back in the studio hammering out an album that is brand new from front to back but in the meantime this is great and very enjoyable listen one that I was pretty satisfied with I wish there was more material on it but still I'm feeling a strong a tool light 9 on this album what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I burn you next anthony Fantana Godspeed [Music] 
r3K4-d_XQaw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Macklemore and Ryan Lewis the heist macklemore and ryan lewis are a seattle-based hip hop duo this is their new full-length LP and easily one of my most anticipated rap albums of this year between the vs. EP that they put together and some of these singles that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis had collaborated on prior to this album I mean so excited in 2011 when they put out the track wings and had a music video for it I mean one of my favorite rap songs of the past few years and my favorite music video of that year it's a track that lyrically delves into the pressures of fashion and sneaker culture everything from how much the sneakers cost to people actually getting killed over them and with the production on the track the the heavy beat the strings the horns the piano the kid chorus singing on the hook it's a really powerful song the live instrumentation on that track ain't a lot of tracks on this LP actually takes you know the tunes here to like the next level I also love the single same love that they dropped which lyrically delves into homophobia gay rights religion stereotypes and misconceptions the tracks gots a nice piano and the beat and a beautiful hook from Mary Lambert I mean easily in my opinion hip hop's most passionate song on this topic and if there's one word you can kind of sum mclemore up with it is passionate I mean he raps with so much conviction on almost every song that he's on and sometimes it's almost to a fault McLemore does tend to get a little overly emotional on some of the songs here and it's almost as if nothing strikes them as being sappy or overly sentimental and you know yeah you could even say corny McLemore can be corny and yeah it can it can really ruin some songs on here for some people I'm sure but it also makes him eager to rap about topics rappers normally wouldn't rap about or even be a little bit more vulnerable than your average rapper - that's true for the track swings and same love and it's true for the song thrift shop - which is kind of a party track like an attack on fashion and attack on trends and really expensive clothes with a catchy ass hook the beats got a nice groove to it and it's even got this like funky little horn sample that's totally like straight out of let me clear my throat or something like that that's what it's shooting for in my opinion and I like that McLemore can basically make a fun upbeat track that is catchy that is charismatic but also is aware the tracks in neon Cathedral and starting over are really vulnerable tracks personal tracks about addiction and alcoholism maybe the the former of the two is a little bit too dramatic for my taste with McLemore rapping directly to the bartender but the second of the two songs that sincerity again is there and it's an amazing track I mean I love the instrumental on there I like that basically the content of the song says that you know kicking a drug habit is not as easy as it seems and also goes into the details of how a relapse may affect your personal life and the people around you the track make the money has this great story about you know sticking to your guns being yourself making money being you don't change for the industry or don't change for a paycheck I mean every track is told with detail there are some quotables they're funny lines they're moments of poignancy as well I mean McLemore is an impressive lyricist on nearly every one of these tracks he has a great flow on nearly every one of these tracks and I could really praise almost every single song here for having a story having a concept and really being clear and following through however the fact that he does that what the content actually is doesn't always appeal to me like the song thin line where I do think McLemore does overstep that boundary of being emotional where he kind of details this crumbling relationship wanting to jump back into it because maybe it seems like there's nothing else better to do or hey this is us this is our best option we've got to make this work and Buffalo Madonna drops what is easily the worst and most amateur Li written verse on the entire album it's so short I don't even know why it's here and the track whitewalls McLemore is kind of rapping about you know tricking out a Cadillac and how backpack is that and it just seems so out of place on this album it seems like he just threw it in there to you know not be beating people down too much with a message throughout the entire LP and schoolboy q actually has a guest verse on this song and he feels even more out of place than the song itself plus the ultra poppy beat on this track is just outright obnoxious and to me overall that's what this LP kind of fails to me with some of the instrumentals and when this album fails with an instrumental I mean it fails hard I mean it's like a faceplant into the cement teeth or smash noses broken like the track gold what is happening here I mean I like the message I think Macklemore is pretty funny on this track especially with the shot at the Golden Girls toward the end of the triangle not a shot but just a reference to and the part where he's sort of kicking over the kiosk in the mall but the instrumental on this thing sounds like something I don't know Miley Cyrus would be on sounds like a Radio Disney song which is maybe something the track intended to mock but I don't think directly copying is the same thing as mocking and there are some hooks on here that to me sound exactly like just overly flowery and dramatic hooks with guest singers with very clean voices that would strike me as something that I would hear on like a Shady Records release like the opening track or the song awake the track make the money has a really really strong Kanye vibe to it I mean like something straight off of my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy except maybe not as you know impressive and can't hold us has kind of like an electronic Lee and the track Bom Bom which lands right in the middle of this LP is an instrumental it's just not that amazing to listen to I mean the sounds are pretty but there's just really no moment' into it there's not like one spot at which I felt myself bobbing my head to it and there's a spot where some horns just kind of swell in all of a sudden playing a phrase and it feels like their synthesizer horns I mean they just have this really kind of flat unpleased quality to them even the closing track on here has a kind of country twang to it with the banjo licked chorus that has these big group vocals on it singing about Capitol Hill and PBR and McLemore actually kind of raps at a few points on this song with the flow as if we were listening to an old school country song where you have the singer you know kind of having one of these narrative moments where he's not so much singing is just kind of telling the story so far just really kind of giving an inner monologue or some perspective on what he's singing about it's a clever idea and one that could have gone over terribly but actually sounds pretty decent on this album I mean much better than a track like Gould instrumentally so while there are great lyrics on here and just well-intentioned stories and topics I don't get why McLemore and Ryan Lewis on a good handful the tracks here dumb things down instrumentally I'm feeling a light too decent seven on the cell P what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I bring you next Anthony Santana McLemore [Music] 
WGnt3mMpEZE,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intercalate Hong centre Internet's busiest music nerd and we're doing another one of our vinyl videos going through my vinyl collection in alphabetical order ten minutes unedited raw truck drives by someone dies I vomit on myself we're gonna keep going we're gonna keep going where the Jays now almost there almost to the end and the thing is simultaneously while I am going [Music] simultaneously while I am going through my record collection with you guys I am also buying records and just procuring records in some places and you know so we're gonna have more records to go through after I'm done with this series maybe a once a month I'll do like a a video saying hey here's some records I got this month or you know here's some records that I picked up that I think are worth sharing with you guys to go to the collection left off here Julie division this is a 12-inch single of the track transmission a friend of mine gave this to me he had an extra copy it's in great condition on factory records he wanted me to make sure to tell you guys that it is original issue original issue of this record transmission on the a side and on the B side the B side novelty novelty on the B side I actually this is the only Joy Division I have on vinyl every other thing Joy Division related that I own is on CD which unfortunately is the case for a lot of bands in this collection and not in this collection alright next we have King Khan and the shrines what is I mean this is if you're new to King Commons shrines this is a double LP I hate it when they have double LPS like in sleeves like that just sort of like in the one thing do it gate bald man not to be rough on the record but it is a good thick pressing which I'm happy about and it sounds good even though the record itself is this pretty and pretty kind of grainy quality to the audio if you're unfamiliar with King Khan and the shrines they are a Canadian act they have like this punked-out take on soul music that's just really energetic really fun caught them live once I mean great live show lots of energy lots of laughs um when did this come out 2009 kind of make sure pretty sure was 2009 yeah 2009 King Khan and BBQ show Invisible Girl this is one of my favorites this is one of my favorite LPS of this year when it dropped really kind of fun raunchy garage rock LP in the red records in the red records I like that it's fun it's a fun album you know nothing incredibly groundbreaking but very fun my to Kraftwerk lp's trans-europe Express and and radioactivity radioactivity maybe not one of the most celebrated albums but I like it someone named uber owned this before me um Gilbert but anyway I mean great tunes on this I mean I think Kraftwerk put some of their best tunes on this record but this I mean trans-europe Express if you're looking for old school just experimental groundbreaking electronic music I mean electronic music at some of its roots this is you know where you want to go it's very cold it's very calculated there's not much else I could say about it outside of that you know that that would sort of get you ready to listen to an album like this you know if you're gonna get into this record or just craft work in general expect something cold expect something robotic calculated I mean yeah there there are elements of fun to their music you know check out the album and not the album would check out the track a pocket calculator for example I mean meant to be a poppy track but still you know electronic music when they were making it is not as lush or as hard-hitting as electronic music today so you know expect expect let's settle in you know I've got some Led Zeppelin classics on here I've been doing to get more Led Zeppelin on vinyl but but I never have you know and of course I need to refresh my memory I know black dog is on this LP which is a sign I enjoyed quite a bit rock and roll battle of evermore stairway to have and uh and I obviously have not put this on in a while but you know still what's that one for sweet sweet gatefold I do like my gatefold when to a record store I saw copy of Led Zeppelin's I believe it was but it wasn't it wasn't in the best condition this record is an album that you know it's it's a little kitschy a little gimmicky I've seen some horrible reviews for it but I liked it Jeffrey Lewis twelve crass songs New York anti folk singer-songwriter Jeffrey Lewis covering a bunch of songs from the seminal punk band known as crass Jeffrey Lewis is also a cartoonist and of course his drawing abilities and his abilities to you know pull together narratives with with comics have come together in this you know insert that comes with the record there was actually kind of a story in here as to how he came upon the music of crass and how it had blew him away and if you are familiar with crass and are interested in you have such such a full-length album you know songs on here that I think are particularly good systematic death getting a trick no eating thick it's just a trick as well as banned from the Roxy to the OS of living they do recover on here as well punk is dead quite a few great covers on there you know it's it's a fun album for me alright Loma Prieta man reviewed this album earlier this year I mean if you're looking for some power violence scrams scream oh shiz this is heavy hard-hitting and I don't want to say mind-blowing but it's certainly abrasive and is going to you know take your ability to hear things down a few notches it's going to just destroy your eardrums I love the raised or raised lettering on the back of this and on the front too with the name and this comes in a well this actually is a sweet little insert with it I believe yeah I this yeah this poster is Deathwish poster kind of printed on like newspaper quality paper insert with some lyrics I believe that's what it looks like yeah credits and oh yeah yeah yeah I forgot black sleeve man black sleeve but sweet white vinyl with some streaky miss on there some subtle streak is you know not dirt something that's in the pressing itself I do like white now there's there's an even brighter streak right there white is cool I do like white but you know if you're gonna go streaky maybe some bolder or obvious colors or something it's just saying it's still good packaging it's still a good package loan galaxy garden reviewed this earlier this year very colorful and and fun electronic music double album mice pressing on this from our NS records I love the black sleeves again still no gatefold on this but I mean clean record pressing on this thing these guys did a great job although is this record that long a know if it needs to be a double LP but I mean you know I suppose it helps if you're trying to DJ it and stuff which I'm sure they would love people to do but I just like listening to it at home that's my bag man you guys know I already own this it's been in the background on numerous videos of mine double LP not gatefold unfortunately thick pressing the takin good care of it love it Mad Libs on the back hey man I'm hammering out some beats here that's basically how the whole thing went if you're looking for some good alternative experimental hip-hop of the creative flair look up this album it's all I'm gonna say about it dumain mad lib mad villainy an album that I think is also pretty creative strange an eccentric matmo supreme balloon the only Matt Lewis album I own on vinyl these guys of course have other records that are maybe more worth your time but this is a personal favorite of mine not only is the packaging stellar on this LP I mean I love this image which if I remember correctly is like some kind of drawn adaptation of like some kind of digital colorful computer-generated image of the sound or like the music on this album or something I can't remember off the top of my head but I do love the packaging for this record again I mean just stellar front cover love them Gate folds if Matador put together some nice packaging for this record Oh time to cut it we can finish this we'll finish this a B and C and decide on this not anything too amazing about the printing of the records other than that they are thick you know nice thick record although I do believe the I think the vinyl version of this track comes with an extra song or two if I'm not mistaken so if you are looking into this album be aware of that but basically what makes this album different than other Mathmos LPS is that the electronic music duo usually sticks to samples to kind of bring their songs together make them come to life and this record features no samples whatsoever you know it's synthesizers or just synthesized computer-generated sounds which of course does not sound like you know anything that has never been done before but the way they do it I mean they try to get sounds that feel and actually you know have Tambor's as if they were being sampled or if they came from some kind of natural source but instead it's it's just all synthetic and they have some pretty interesting electronic instruments on on this LP and some pretty strange synthesizer sounds as well despite the fact that there are plenty of synthesizer based records out there in existence this this one is certainly a unique one that is this vinyl video we are going to you know continue from there in the next one yeah thanks for being awesome anthony Fantino vinyl [Music] 
hBKOobrNh9Y,hi everyone Anthony Pham tno ear Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the mountain goats transcendental youth the mountain goats is the long-running singer-songwriter project of jon dar meal which originally started as him strumming his acoustic guitar playing songs that he had written performing them into a tape recorder low fire recordings very rarely did you get extra instrumentation except for maybe on an album when coroner's gambit one of my favorite mountain goat cell peace but now the mountain goats have a fold into a hi-fi full fledged band they've been that way for a while now these date John Darnielle has still been sticking to a lot of the same simple straightforward chords kind of copying them sometimes from songs that he's already written but what really ends up making the difference from track to track with mountain goats fans for the most part are the lyrics the mountain goats definitely continue to be a band that is more about fine-tuning things as opposed to very quick surprise radical progressions even though there are spots in the band's discography that shows some pretty high level ambitions like the track Tallahassee which is a bit of a concept record about a relationship crumbling the LPD sunset tree is the biggest moment yet where John Darnielle gets kind of autobiographical with his youth and the album the life of the world to come is John Barr Neil's kind of perception or just his personal relationship with religion but whether there's an overarching storyline to a mountain goats album or if John Darnielle is just kind of delivering a mixed bag of tracks that kind of have a loose theme to them John Darnielle continues spinning some of the most unique tales in singer-songwriter dumb however that doesn't mean I necessarily feel like this mountain goats LP in particular is really fresh I pretty much now go into every new Mountain Goats LP expecting the lyrics to be stellar the music the melodies to be pretty good and the instrumentation the production making all this happen to have a few potholes here and there now to me this new Mountain Goats album is more of the mixed bag variety with sort of loose thematic connections bringing all the songs together namely on this LP the idea of thriving surviving or as the opening track says staying alive this track kicks things off with a pretty tried and true chord progression for John Darnell and the lyrics urged the listener or just whoever John has in mind to live life to the fullest push the limits past the limits don't care what people say light matches jump in front of trains so what's kind of funny is that John Darnielle reminds whoever this person he's talking to to stay alive whether it's sort of in an emotional way but I kind of interpreted it as hey you know even though you're doing all this dangerous stuff make sure you don't kill yourself in the process on the second part of the song that ends up popping up later on the album that message kind of gets reiterated but more from a I guess survival standpoint there's a bit of an element of danger to the narrative on that side of the song the tracks on this LP kind of alternate between representing the two sides of this double-edged sword the track lakeside view apartments feels way less inspirational with this theme actually kind of sad and depressing with John Darnell singing about about being in the standpoint of someone who's living in this apartment suite with other people who have some serious problems with drugs whether it be addiction or just kind of being in physical danger because of the lifestyle that they've oriented themselves with and you can hear some serious pain in his voice on this track I mean it's just tangible now as I mentioned earlier the instrumentation especially with horns gets a little ambitious on this LP and from what I understand Owen Pallett actually lends some arrangements to this album the song cry for Judas has this beautiful descending horn melody on the the track white cedar has horns behind it that actually makes the track feel like a bit of a funeral dirge and the way they swell it's almost as if you're listening to a bit of musical theater especially with how dramatic John Darnielle tends to be with his vocal delivery the track in memory of seeing has horns lightly kissing delicately played piano chords and the closing track on this LP actually sees John singing over some horns that have kind of a bright upbeat and jazzy feel to them but ironically this track features John Darnell's quietest and maybe shyest vocal delivery on the entire LP now there are some tracks on here that are great there are others that no matter how many times I try to listen to them again and again and again they just don't really warm up to me namely until I am whole and haarlem Roulet the both of them to me actually musically feel a bit too much like very lightly revised mountain goat songs I've already heard the track until I am whole I didn't really care for the production on that song especially with that vocal the background vocal with that effect on it that's very sharp very kind of tinny didn't really work for me and the song Harlem verlet lyrically didn't really feel as concise as mountain goat songs usually tend to be to go back to another track on here that I think is great this T Oz brothers great song on this LP a piano rocker just so much gusto in this track and you know because of how passionately John is singing about the De Aza Brothers begging for mercy for them and just what I was hearing him saying the lyrics made me look them up and like who are the Diaz brothers why does he care and I actually kind of found in a short interview on on Rolling Stone I think that John Darnielle is in fact singing about the fictional Diaz brothers that are briefly mentioned in the movie Scarface you can pull inspiration make up a story with just a shred of information and context and just blow it up into this huge catchy emotional song that actually feels like it's about something really really just urgent to me this was not as memorable or as ambitious as other Mountain Goats LPS that continue to be my favorites but still a solid very enjoyable Mountain Goats LP I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this album what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the mountain goats forever 
f7crV1BXXVg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Oh a little bit of the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review tame impala lunar ism these guys are an Australian psychedelic rock and pop band excuse me and they put out their full-length debut in ER speaker a few years ago which I thought was okay to me neo psychedelia bands can usually be placed and do two categories you have your animal collectives which bring on an entirely new brand of psychedelic sounds that feel nothing like the old world of psychedelic music and then again you kind of have your spiritual eyes which do you know sound new do have a fresh sound but are more obviously rooted in that older world of psychedelic music you know they have a bit of a revivalist edge to their act and I would definitely say tame impala is a member of the latter a lot of the bass lines the guitar leads the melodies and especially the vocals that these guys work with evoke a Beatles revolver era type sound that to me on their debut LP was so distracting it was hard for me to really fall in love with the album despite some good songwriting in great production on this LP you're going to hear very bright lush digital synth Tambor's echoes being soaked on the vocals the guitars end the sense to that just kind of echo into oblivion and pig pile on top of one another into this just auditory casserole rainbow colors rippling water candy binges with no stomachaches or cavities the colors are just so ah oh yeah and one other thing that I remember kind of praising the band on through their last LP a masterful array of guitar tones this band definitely knows understands and appreciates sound there's just no doubt about that and for sure if you give this a listen it will be one of the most colorful and textured neo psychedelia records you've heard this year and the fact that this album is so sound dense may distract from the pretty good songwriting from time to time on this LP may take away from the distinction of these tracks at first however some songs stick out more than others the track elephant for sure which has this really thick rock steady riff matched up against tame impalas usual sounds and to me it kind of sounds like I don't know John Lennon and Paul McCartney collaborating with Tony Iommi thus our synthesizers kick in after the first chorus of the song and that really brings the track into a full-on jam and I love it the track keep on line has these pulsating synth chords that kind of bring the track a quality that makes it feel like it's sun-baked the pace of the track is perfect I love the messy guitar solos that come in as the song just kind of lets loose gets a little more wild and I love the sonic experimentation that they do with voices on the track - as it progresses some voices are just kind of laid with heavy heavy echoes whether they're talking or laughing it gets pretty kuhkaff innocent and though it doesn't sound interesting on paper it totally feels like a vintage old-school psych pop and rock experiment that goes over really well in practice the track like we only go backwards has a really really blissful vocal melody and and drum fills it's just the track is just constantly just crashing down on this just heavenly long spun musical phrase kind of jamming it out it feels like a hook but it's not quite a hook there's a bridge in the song - that's pretty Pleasant it's during moments like this I wish the vocals were a little bit more front and center not so obscured by being mixed low and the track why won't they talk to me with how kind of straight and rigid and in driving the rhythm is behind that track it actually kind of feels like tame impala sort of referencing the strokes in a way the vocal melody certainly feels like maybe a slight play on the track soma or maybe I'm just crazy there are just a lot of sweet catch racks on this LP consistently laid out with landscapes of psychedelic sense and guitar as well as Beatles s vocal harmonies now I don't really hate anything on this LP there were several tracks that kind of underwhelmed me or I wish win other places like the intro track which i think is a great idea I love the loop drums and vocals sample on there and the rushes of synthesizers on that tracker just kind of invigorating the vocal melody is catchy too but to me it doesn't really so much feel like a song as it just does one really good idea repeated into oblivion the track mind mischief was kind of repetitive too with this one single guitar riff that the van doesn't really deviate from that was a good catch e riff at the start but doesn't really maintain my interest for the duration of the entire track and I kind of wish the second track went on longer especially since the guitar Jam leading up to the climax that finishes the song off went over so well but the track kind of explodes and then it's just gone I see nothing but improvement for tame impala on this record to be completely honest I mean the jams that they put on this LP are more expansive there are bolder sonic experiments the band brings a wider array of sounds they're a little bit more adventurous with what they do with their obvious influences and the songwriting is still good just like it was on the last LP overall I am feeling a light decent 8 on this album what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana tame impala oh and um what does count your chest to think if Tim pal is so lonely what why doesn't he get some new friends cow - just uh you need big bitty beep but it's it snap snap plug you blow tourism forever [Music] 
9UMVPr-4WiM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review mellow hype numbers mellow hype is one of the many rap projects or rap artists in the ever-growing odd future collective featuring well-known rappers and singers such as Tyler the Creator Earl Sweatshirt mr. Frank Ocean in an Internet but mellow hype specifically features Hodgy Beats MC left-brain MC handling production as well in 2011 they put out a reissue of one of their previous mixtapes but a lot of fans had already known about the material on that released previously numbers is the first piece of album size material that we're getting from mellow hype in 2012 and you know it's no secret that I haven't really given a lot of Odd Future related projects extremely positive reviews lately because a lot of the material hasn't really appealed to me and after giving numbers a number of listens I have to say that's kind of the same case here honestly I'm just kind of shocked at how little mellow hype has progressed the beats overall are still kind of shoddy or living in the shadow of just another B style Haji beats while he does have flow his cadence and just his his personality still comes off very kind of amateur and as far as substance and topics and just lyrical content goes he's really not that diverse not that clever not that interesting and easily left brain continues to hold the title as the least talented rapper in the odd future collective this album really just kind of starts off with a turn for the worse with the track grill which has these obnoxious hooks all over it with them just kind of spelling out mellow hypes name over and over into oblivion and there are all these trap rap instrumental hi hats throughout the track and there are a couple other moments where the instrumentals on this album embrace a trap rap sound which you know I have nothing against the sound in general but it's clear that there's kind of jumping on the bandwagon that everybody else is as much as odd futures music doesn't really appeal to me there are moments where they do feel pretty distinct I can tell an odd future song when I hear one and this to me is kind of a loss of personality the track 65 is the first instrumental that kind of appealed to me a bit even though the track is executed with the same kind of haphazard synthesizer sounds that many odd future instrumentals are there's pretty sweet jazz chords on this track and there's a nice chill laid-back groove to this song it really kind of makes me think of like the 90s and like riding music but then on this track there's this like hook where Hodgy Beats throws out this line where his flow is as infectious as a herpe and because the hook it's being repeated over and over and you have to think if this is the line that he thinks was so good it needed to be repeated what about the lines that he's actually putting in his verses I like the verse on this track where he's kind of counting down his bars I thought that was interesting but there was nothing really lyrically about this track that grabbed me and with the track Astro that comes right after easily I think the worst instrumental on the entire LP the synthesizer line on this track is terrible [Music] the only person on this entire album that I think does anything with any conviction is Frank Ocean I mean he sings really well on this hook he sings like a pro he sings like he's got something to say and he raps later on the track and he sounds great there too and then Hadji throws out this ridiculous line about other rappers lacking substance but then he just kind of raps immediately after about how his nuts itch I could see this being funny if it were even remotely clever but it's not the track la Bonita comes in and actually actually that that instrumental was pretty good I liked the hand percussion on the instrumental there was some vibraphone sampled I believe and it sound like it was kind of like an accordion in there too however you know the lyrical content again it's not really there I mean the track pretty much comes out throwing all these lines at this figure to Latin woman that I guess you know is being hit on especially by Hadji but you know no girl with any sense would even respond to anything that's being said on this track there are moments where I thought Hadji was pretty humorous on the song and lo and behold left-brain opens the track up and he's actually flowing on this track to the point where I think I forgot it was left brain for a second but then I was quickly reminded because of the lack of interesting lyrics and his head cold cadence that is just prevalent every time he raps I liked what they were trying to go for on the track snare with the little kid's voice on the hook it sounded pretty interesting maybe adding an element of cute to the darkness that they're trying to push forward but the first verse on this track snare I thought was pretty telling and really explained the entire appeal of of this LP with Hadji rapping about being that cool kid with a si average whose mom tells him that he is lazy but he doesn't want to get a job he's not motivated throughout the album he's making all these drug references there's a moment where he's trapping and it's at this point on the album I just kind of feel like okay obviously this LP is not about having a great flow having a unique message or personality having you know some great instrumentals or anything like that it's more about just having an aesthetic a lifestyle if you will just kind of be that young dude who is rebellious but not exactly being all that clear about what he's rebelling against just kind of angry for no reason you know as drug-addled as Wiz Khalifa as stone as Wiz Khalifa but kind of angsty and you know I know from personal experience that being young can suck and can put you in some situations that you that you wish you weren't in because you're in this limbo of wanting independence but also being dependent on those who raised you really a lot of the tracks are just about nothing outside of sex drugs lewd humor and references that would you know appeal to the age and gender demographic that Hadji finds himself within and I think where you grew up has a lot to do with it too because if you're really looking for some truly ignorant aggressive drug-dealing hip-hop then you know it's it's out there in much more potent forms than what you're going to find here you don't need to listen to Hajji beats rap about selling some pot over a fake spooky track beat to kind of get this kind of angle and story you can listen to gucci mane you can listen to waka flocka you can listen to any number of things and get that in a much higher dosage so again kind of wrap things up lack of lyrical content a lot of just bland uninteresting instrumentals that that feel well-intentioned trying to go for something dark a lot of the time but just have no interesting sounds or textures to them for the most part outside of tracks like 65 and la Bonita some of the worst hooks I've ever heard on any hot future release period like the song la flair the hooks on this thing are either so bulky and long-winded that they don't even really translate or they're not even really saying much of anything period or they're so over-the-top obnoxious and ridiculous that they're not pleasant or interesting to listen to on any level the last track on this LP befall is the same spelling pothole that the first track does except this time they're spelling the odd future Wolf Gang kill them all acronym again there are elements of darkness to this LP mellow light definitely does try to come off as more tortured than your average rap act but still is this really that tortured is this really that dark I don't think so I mean let's be honest this cross is turned upside down as more of an act of rebellion than some kind of legitimate socio-political statement they're just trying to get a rise that isn't people which is really what Odd Future is about and hey you know that's fine if you can piss people off and get people riled up that's cool but the only people I knew really get riled up by Odd Future are people who really don't have a clue as to what truly offensive things are so you know I'm pretty much feeling like a strong to to a light 3 on this LP what did you think of it did you like it did you hate it why what should i review next and that's it Anthony Fantana mellow hype forever [Music] [Music] 
q467HO8EEFw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the self-titled album debut from Metz these guys are a Canadian noise rock outfit this is their album on Sub Pop Records and like the title of the opening track on this thing suggests this thing is a headache a skull splitting headache and I mean that in the nicest most complimentary way possible the guitars on this LP are just pummeling massive dissonant contracts here they definitely approach the chaos of bands like drive like Joe but also kind of feature the manic kind of nasally high-pitched vocals screams rather of guy Picciotto of rites of spring or Fugazi their moments that also remind me of maybe that last daughter's record as well for positives the sound on this LP is fantastic I mean just tons of saturation just the riffs get pretty chaotic sometimes with noise hanging in the background it can be pretty ear canal crumbling something I definitely think a place to bury strangers fans can appreciate and these guys really play with a lot of ferocity and I like that they're able to kind of balance that with pulling some some detail into these songs to some interesting progressions to a song segues build ups and breaks maybe a catchy hook or or a potent mood as well the song sad pricks has this blaring riff and the riff just has the sharp dissonance to it that makes me think like man this track is angrily depressed and with the way the vocals feel as they're being shouted over these riffs in desperation it just kind of confirms that feeling the track went blank it has some great riffs to that the sound unlike riffs from the rest of the album and there's this interesting kind of buildup on the track where you hear all these noisy guitar riffs and just kind of things of feedback and just kind of inconceivable noise is kind of hanging around this bass riff that is going on with these four top rolls coming off the drums it's kind of like listening to an apocalyptic surf rock band and one of the last tracks on here negative space has these sharp shots of over some pummeling distorted bass guitar and this track features one of the few hooks on this album with harmonized vocals and it brings a really strong element of catchiness to the track there are some great tracks on here and some really good tracks on here if I kind of separate them out and just kind of look at them as their own thing but as an album I just feel like Metz is not as enjoyable mostly because of a lack of dynamics highs and lows ideas for one a lot of the riffs on this LP work off very similar grooves and feature very similar intervals here too especially the minor third interval which counter Chester will play for you right now you've heard it before especially in a lot of heavy loud rock songs but on here I mean man these guys love their minor thirds I feel like these guys could use a bit of a kick in the songwriting department as well there are plenty of tracks on here like rats and knife and water and get off that don't really deviate all too far from the main thematic riff that kind of kicks the song off and it just feels like the song is entirely about the riff and that's pretty much it you know not really many notable additions around it in terms of noise or sound or a hook not even really especially interesting or catchy lyrics or a vocal for that matter because on every track here the vocals are pretty buried underneath these guitar riffs and further obscured with lots and lots of reverb which is a bit disheartening because that really could have been a chance to add more character to these tracks but instead they're kind of taking it away through mixing and production but I can kind of understand why because when I do catch a whiff of the lyrics on these tracks they're not really saying anything all that distinct or or interesting I'm sure if the lyrics were there these would feel compelled to kind of pump the vocals up so that people could hear them still there is that group of songs on here that I do think are really good the production is fantastic I mean really great stuff I wish there was a bit more detail to it but it is very overbearing for the most part and these guys do have the energy you know again that viscera that which I'm sure a lot of people are pretty much just looking strictly for that when it comes to music that's worded in a punk tradition or music that just has more of a noise rock vibe to it for me because it lacked those other things that just didn't really have all that much remember ability to me even though as I was listening to it yeah I was likeable it was enjoyable I'm feeling the light too decent six on this LP what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next let me know Anthony Fantana Mets forever 
DZNAQAavoC0,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd doing a quick video here listing off some stuff before i get into that i have to kind of say that since i started this channel the amount that it has grown and i guess the the the fact that i've been able to gather a considerable amount of people with this channel kind of just being into album reviews of rock pop electronic experimental music metal and hip hop is well it's just been really fun it's been really amazing it's been really flattering other channels have you know sprung up in the process doing album reviews doing music news related things some of them came together before i was doing what i was doing some of them after it used to be easier to keep track of all of them because the community was a bit smaller but now i don't even know where where many of these channels are because the YouTube music reviewing or discussion community is just growing with so many participants so in this video I hope to maybe turn you on to a few other reviewers who you may enjoy their videos as well as mine for one Sammy Jerusha over at the rocket out blog bring in some reviews with a whole lot of rock music news a bunch of times each week Sammy's my bro we're probably gonna be Bros for a long time but yeah he's an entertaining colorful dude little bit a little snarky sometimes but I love them next denon hip hop these guys I really like their channel I always have fun watching it for the most part I kind of consider my reviews to be a little scripted a little planned out maybe a little I just sort of study eater or something like that but dead-end hip hop which is which is part of the reason I like their stuff is they are just pure visceral reaction you know it's a group of guys getting together talking about albums you know and this in this very kind of forum panel let's argue kind of sense and while sometimes you know things can get a little DeRay because of that it is fun and sometimes exciting to watch their videos when and if given albamar just sort of topic in hip-hop music causes you know an emotional explosion between all of them and sometimes they get down to the nitty-gritty of some very important musical and cultural issues as well next DDOT respect this is a channel that I came upon this year but I've been doing it more and more and more as I've been watching it one video every week occasionally not music related but many many essays having to do with hip-hop and and hip-hop culture music culture just and really thought-provoking stuff these next two reviewers should totally be up your alley if you're into heavy extreme music one cover killer this dude aside for me is really one of the most long-standing reviewers at this point the students been doing it a while he has thousands of subscribers hundreds of videos covering many different flavors of metal he is a little bit more studied than me when it comes to reviewing and then delivering the dude is very well-spoken he's not afraid to just go long when it comes to describing an album and just sort of giving you all the details you need to know the other metal reviewer that I would love to bring up is JD C sound another reviewer who has been doing it for a pretty long time at this point dude is a family man and I love his look classes but the dude's got some serious taste and just like heavy and extreme music I mean when it comes to metal he really loves the more extreme side of things and he is pretty good at describing the dirty sludgy apocalyptic sounds that usually come from from these styles of metal next to dudes who's reviews are not so much visceral you know not a lot of energy there but but very studied very kind of thought-out and yet conversational to velocities in music it's a music form show album review show hosted by two guys Jake and Tom who are very good friends and and that is what really kind of comes through in their reviews the most they really love talking about music they really love discussing the the elements of an album and just sort of what makes it work what doesn't make it work that's what really kind of keeps me going back to VI MTV when they do review an album that I am curious of their opinion on next Rek radio got to give a shout out to Jeff Paul who has had me on her channel a few times she gives a lot of news having to do with alternative rock and pop and does it with her own kind of brand of comedy and hip hop culture TV really if you're looking for hip hop reviews the most straightforward logical and just sort of clean-cut reviews you're gonna come across and in kind of the opposite direction of hip hop culture TV is Nick Bag TV hip hop this guy is easily without any question the rawest hip hop reviewer blogger to just exist the dude's videos are very just like you know there's there's nothing really special about the production value of this guy's videos but he's extremely opinionated loudmouth entertaining maybe not always 100% accurate but he does make some amazing points on a lot of his reviews even if you disagree entirely you know I do find that there are moments where he does make me rethink something or you know says something that I wish I said in in a review I also have to mention album review TV this dude covers a lot of the more mainstream styles of rock music that I don't usually touch upon on a regular basis and and does so in a very kind of calm collected way and maybe the last channel I would love to mention is music worth buying this channel is hosted by two older gentleman who pretty much use their age to give opinions that that feel very thought-out and I guess experienced if there are artists to have a particularly long discography behind them they have you know that hindsight of having up through those errors of music they really kind of remind me of why would ideally like to hear if I were listening to like an album review on NPR or something like that

niiR7Lsq-1o,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review no love deep web the latest LP from Death Grips Death Grips is an experimental hip-hop trio consisting of Zach Hill on drums also known for his work in groups such as Ella and his solo work MC ride on vocals and flatlander and collectively they create some of the most paranoid abstract abrasive and tortured music on the planet my first introduction to their music was last year when they dropped an EP a collection of tracks that in comparison with their next release was a little rough around the edges but still had a pretty definitive sound it wasn't really love at fifth or sixth listen until I listened to their debut album slash mixtape ex-military with the popularity that gained behind these guys thanks to ex-military in 2011 Death Grips entered 2012 with the announcement that they had signed to Epic Records and would be dropping two full-length albums this year in the first of those two which dropped around Record Store Day of this year was the Money Store and to me the money store was much of what I was hearing on ex-military but just like next-level busier glitchy er more fractured and yet more detailed production sometimes a wash and very fat distorted synthesizers on tracks like blackjack or Lost Boys and yet there were other songs on there that were pretty lean pretty punchy hard-hitting and extremely catchy I mean viral hooks like I seen footage the song that in my opinion from from what I can see people reference the most and maybe my favorite track off the LP the beaver and the lyrics to me on that LP became more potent as well just as potent as the production diving further into Death Grips themes of fear schizophrenia excess addiction violence success of the money soar made Death Grips second full-length album of this year to be one of the most anticipated LPS of 2012 and they kind of teased toward it with a really epic marketing campaign kind of sending fans on this internet scavenger hunt filtering through pictures and encoded files that was even a point where some people went to New York at 3 a.m. to hang around a payphone which was ringing it was a message it was kind of weird and all of this just so people could find out background on the new album on Death Grips and get some money store instrumentals but the momentum on this scavenger hunt kind of slowed down but kind of simultaneously death-grip says our label has pushed back our release date we are going to let you hear it the same day the label is going to hear October 1st you are going to hear no love deep web and when I say the label push back the release date I mean allegedly because a lot of you know facts haven't really come out of this whole situation because on October 1st early early in the morning Death Grips through no loved Deep Web up onto YouTube and SoundCloud they threw down a bunch of file sharing websites but it seemed that Death Grips label wasn't really doing anything and the only alleged action the label took was taking the band's website which wasn't even really down for that long and then the label later that day made an official statement saying they had nothing to do with the takedown of Death Grips site which if that is true maybe the takedown had something more to do with downloads or traffic or the fact that their album cover was blown up gigantic on the front page of their site which was a penis leaking their album in the way that Death Grips did certainly brought them 10 times more press than a normal release ever would have even billboards website reported that legally letting people download their album for free put Death Grips at the top of BitTorrent legally downloaded music chart putting them at about 30 million downloads and when you think about you know the line of exactly what happened up to the release of know love Deep Web maybe you could potentially question the I don't know the truth eNOS of Death Grips and maybe some people are offended by that but the thing is I don't really go to Death Grips for the truth necessarily more for the gross amplifications of the darker side of human nature and Death Grips music and their artistic actions embrace that ideology and the thought that they would use their fame to mess with the people that are listening to them in my opinion is completely in line with the ideology that the band has been putting forth through their music to kind of just give a basic rundown of this album I have to say this is Death Grips most sonically stripped-down album but simultaneously they're lyrically darkest and most intense now as far as the production goes on this thing it is way less busy in comparison to even the band's first EP all the way up to the Money Store the samples are cut down to a minimum as far as I could tell one of the only tracks that immediately comes to mind is having a pretty bold sample in the hook there is like whammy there are a lot of 808 drum sounds on this record there are occasionally shots of Zach Hills drums but for the most part you are listening to 808 drum Tambor's and on top of those 808 for the most part are just synthesizers of various shapes and sizes but flatlander assuming that he's playing all the sins on this entire LP really keeps them sounding electronic and synthetic he doesn't distort them doesn't make them sound really gritty or grimy not to the extent that we have heard them on previous Death Grips releases in a way it's great because the production is him back a little bit just to kind of put MC right in the forefront and on some tracks here he just takes the amount of energy that he's been delivering on previous releases and amps it up even higher I mean this LP features some of his most aggressive and and paranoid performances and lyrics yet the track come up and get me has the series of lyrics with MC ride talking about like being locked away in this underground basement torture chamber where he can't really seem to find a way out and he's because of being in this torture chamber where he is going insane he's kind of like accepted death like I'm just gonna die but simultaneously he fears it the track Hunger Games lyrically goes into schizophrenia suffering from it because of not taking your medication and becoming very violent maybe losing control because of it and the track no love is just ah has some of the most stomach-churning lyrics on this entire LP kind of really talking about some pretty torturous acts there's a moment where MC ride perhaps about the person who was the victim here whimpering as he checks his phone there is just kind of like an element of addiction to this abuse that's being painted here and in a way in my opinion it could kind of be like a figurative image of how the relationship works between Death Grips and and their fans in a way and then there is a last track on your artificial death which I think lyrically is one of the more abstract tracks that Death Grips has ever dropped making lyrical references to suicide seeing your own death being watched again and I just love the beat on that track set to this click-clack 808 beat in these very icy synthesizers sound like they would be in like an 80s sci-fi film it's just bringing MC right forward and in a way it's kind of deflated the very just viral hooks that were all over the money store not that there aren't hooks or refrains here it's just that there are a lot of tracks that musically don't explode when it to the hook tracks like little boy or Hunger Games black dice artificial death Stockton to just pretty much have MC ride just going from the verse straight to the course without a lot of change from the instrumentation behind him either a lot of change or just not really the explosion of the climax that usually comes with a chorus in a song with a verse chorus verse structure their tracks on here that are a little more and Houk wise like whammy and bass rattle stars which really kind of sounds like the 80s on bath salts but even those tracks instrumentally are not as hard hitting as instrumentals from previous Death Grips LPS and I kind of feel like in a way this record was a challenge to kind of stick to maybe some more basic elements but try to make a record that is just as frightening as gritty I do think Death Grips managed to pull together some of their best instrumentals so far again the track bass rattle stars which I just mentioned has such a hard-hitting Click Clack beat that I love and just that synth on the track the track no love has its really heavy lumbering beat and the song little boy has this multi-phase instrumental that is always changing as the song moves from one section to another and though it took a little while to kind of grow on me I do like that like little synthetic it could be debate debate there are moments like that where I kind of feel like I'm getting a bit of a dance music element from the synthesizers which did kind of turn me off at first Earth stirs the track lock your doors is really murky kind of hectic sounds like a riot is going on or something like that and really one of my favorite instrumentals on this entire thing has got to be one of the most spacious and that's Hunger Games I mean such a weird like lopsided instrumental - sounds like a mutant there are a few instrumentals that didn't really kind of make it for me completely I thought the track pop had had a pretty weak hook on it even for this LP honestly I gotta say Deep Web that instrumental really did not do well with me though I did think the distorted synth was cool and that same distortion kind of shows up on other tracks here I didn't really get the what look whoa oh that kind of placed through the track and that to me is just like kills mood the very dark tortured mood of the song and I didn't really like emcee rides flow on that track either the pacing of the song was just kind of mmm and I guess as long as I'm complaining bringing emcee ride to the forefront has done wonders for this LP and definitely made it stick out Death Grips you know short but growing discography but with bringing him forward has revealed some lyrics that you know either weren't really translating all that well for me or maybe I just had like a difficult time extending the poetic license that far like on the song world of dogs which has this line where he drops you know I'm dying die with me or the other line a deep web where he says something to the note of I hate myself more than you ever could in that line about being the coat hanger in your man's vagina I'm not sure how much I should read into that and to go back to world of dogs the hook on that track that it's all suicide it's all suicide you know it just seems a little I don't know flat to me but there are some lyrics especially with the last verse with the mountain of teeth and the spitting out the leash that is like epic though I do bring some things up the lyrical potholes on this record for me are very few and far between the production is good here it is interesting here but I do wish it was more colourful of course I do wish there were more interesting sounds but I do feel like MC ride does a great job of filling in that void and that's what made this LP a success to me even though I didn't love it as much as the Money Store there were just a few tracks along the way that I didn't really dig all too much I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this LP if you've listened to it what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it whoa literally no matter Linn old my darling Clement howdy everybody count you're just here telling you for some good country cooking come on down it that's grits we gonna get got lots of grits for you and if you get greedy well give you the gravy the goodness grits in Gainesville we got good country cooking yum-yum that's grits what it what it in but what should I remix and thank you for watching Anthony Fantino know love deep web Death Grips forever you 
_TZBdHjgMxI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review all J an awesome wave LJ is an eccentric indie pop band hailing from the UK this is their debut full-length album and not only is their name alt-j but alt-j is now my new favorite computer command I think the video looks good like this you know I don't think we necessarily have to change it I mean you know this could work these guys came out with their full-length album earlier this year and then they landed a record contract and they also landed on the mercury prize shortlist and they came out with the album on this side of the pond now in the US and the band certainly came into this album with a focus on the bigger picture and I like that because they have a variety of sounds and feelings on this album there are a lot of sounds on this LP you know lone acapella chorus vocals piano twangy guitar leads fat distorted synthesizers strings glockenspiel occasionally some electronic elements adding up to some beats in the songs I mean these guys really kind of not jump around sporadically but but actually blend in a really interesting way elements of indie pop punk rock funk as well even baroque pop and this LP could really have become kind of a mess of senselessness you know not having a really clear concise sound does make it a little difficult despite that these songs can be pretty catchy to wrap your head around an awesome wave and despite the fact that all J does take inspiration from so many places eyes eyes eyes eyes I think they string all together really well with it with a pretty creative colorful and playful attitude mixed with some some very nasally vocals they are a little strange and with the accent that they are being sung with they are without a doubt I an acquired taste you know but I do hear command and range and control of pitch in the vocals but you know honestly my first reaction to this band as well was not all that positive I mean quite literally maybe my first reaction was what is this crap you know I just kind of feel like I'm hearing a lot of similar familiar in the tropes with some very annoying vocals thrown on top and you know it's true the band does travel through some familiar territory I've seen them compared to wild beasts but I think there are other comparisons that that are even more relevant for example Devendra Banhart and ward though the band does have some some comfortable characteristics I think it is they're pretty progressive approach to songwriting that puts them in kind of a lane of their own they really do write tracks that have numerous phases to them and shift from one idea to the next are kind of winding but still remain catchy creative and just loaded with personality the track Tesla is maybe the first track that hits me on the album is being really lovable one of the bigger singles from this LP if I'm right there's a very dramatic piano intro to the beginning of the song and then when the beat comes in the track gets kind of heavy it's equal parts acoustic electronic but still maintains just a really smooth smooth characteristic they're all these kinds of unpredictable spurts of sounds swirling around the music and the lead singer of this band is really just to me a character you know there's a moment in the lyrics of the song when he's like I'm sniffing there's a point later in the album where he kind of does a similar thing with breathing the track breezeblocks that comes in right after is a song that I think is similarly interesting though it did kind of rub me the wrong way at first there's like an opening guitar line that really makes me think of like a sublime song or something like that and the vocals kind of singing semi maybe even sort of rapping over this guitar line also you know ooh but it really kind of grew on me I mean the band does have personality they keep things fun I love how in the midst of these lyrics and in the song you're kind of getting these syncopated drum and piano hits you know you'll kind of get this guitar riff and then Dada Dada and we'll go back into it and I love the layered vocals toward the end of the track when the song really shifts changes up the riff and you're kind of getting these vocals jumping on top of one another these don't go please don't go again it's just character it's just personality it's it's like the band is hitting you with that on nearly every track here the song Matilda is is a very kind of nicely layered lullaby I mean very pretty and the song Tarot is a really well developed closer that doesn't so much jump you into different areas or bring up any huge surprises but it just kind of grows and grows and grows and grows until the point where you're getting this pretty heavy beat with the sound of some kind of plucked string instrument maybe it's sampled and looped on the track maybe it's performed it can't quite tell but it has kind of like a Middle Eastern flavor to it that I like a lie and it's just incorporated tastefully without really kind of taking away from the overall feel to the album when it's it's clearly something coming from a totally different place you know I didn't have a ton of complaints with this LP I felt like the first half of the album was kind of disjointed to me the song dissolved me has a really fat synthesizer that I've heard on another track of this album but there it just kind of feels a little out of place maybe a little overbearing in comparison to the rest of the music and the song to me something good kind of meanders a bit it's one of the softer tracks on here but doesn't really come at me with with a melody I really kind of fall in love with maybe it'll grow on me with more listens or something like that I feel like they had the potential to go even further with their idiosyncrasies and just kind of really build something of their own but in the meantime while that isn't 100% there the band does have some really kind of creative fun imaginative songs every song is just kind of like a toy chest in and of itself don't let the fact that it kind of feels familiar on the surface let it slip by you I'm feeling a light eight this album for sure really one of the more fun LPS I've heard this year but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana all J forever [Music] you 
zZsgsn_fUao,ha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet busiest music nerd and it's time for a review muse the second law isn't it the internet you go on all the time no no no that is that's mu that's mu okay I'm you hi I am you mule is my favorite site on the Deep Web strew Prairie Muse is a band from the UK this is their sixth full-length album the second law and it is the follow-up to the extremely controversial album in their discography the resistance which dropped in 2009 and and showed the band which was once a group with an alternative rock sound with some progressive and space rock tendencies shifting into much more of a symphonic style strangely enough muses really kind of can't be excessive and symphonic approach to progressive rock actually kind of appealed to me for example when I listened to the song survival off of this LP which is every bit as gaudy as a track from the resistance I mean it is redonkulous Lee over the top with piano and heavy riffs and and queen style background vocals the singer in the group Matthew Bellamy delivers his his lyrics as if he's some kind of character in a play you know when I hear that I just can't help but be entertained I mean if you're going to be showy this is the way to do it it's track that when I think of it being performed I see pyrotechnics and I see costumes and of course I also see the giant operatic choral group that is kind of soaring behind the rock instrumentation and I think if Muse stuck with that sound consistently on this new LP they would have had another kind of solid album in that vein but I kind of feel like Muse is in the same position block party is with this new album kind of delivering a batch of tracks that sonically and then stylistically jump around all over the place however in the case of Muse the band has kind of brought themselves into this impossible game of Twister and contorted this project into something that is trying to touch as many dots as possible thereby making a very mangled end product so mangled that you kind of want to call 9-1-1 now this LP opens up with the track supremacy which is kind of in the vein of muses last LP it's a capable opener you know symphonic rock heavy huge over the top I wasn't really kind of having my skirt lifted too high by this track I felt like the strings were maybe a little too Led Zeppelin on the song but it did have me looking forward to what was coming but the more I listened to it the second track madness just feels incredibly out of place and just kind of out of touch with muses usual grandeur grandeur grandi you or it just kind of feels like muse decided to throw a pop song together and it starts off pretty interesting and well-intentioned an electronic style pop love song with with a really kind of catchy hook to it I don't mean what Bellamy is singing but the mum um um um um um ma'am ma'am my man man but the lyrics to me don't say anything about the relationship that is kind of fueling this entire song and I feel like the longer the track goes the more uninteresting it gets to me it kind of starts off as this electronic pop song and then ends up being this piece of soulless futuristic soul the track panic station comes in right after this and to me it's it's really one of the more surprising tracks on the album another shift in Gears it's pretty much everything that was trendy about radio rock in the late 80s and early 90s put together in a room all at once and screaming as loud as it as it possibly can already mentioned the tract survival which I love but the song follow me comes in right after that and I feel like they take my hi from the previous song and totally smash it with a track that actually sounds like it could be maybe Coldplay inspired toward the beginning the drums are rising Bellamy has some pretty dramatic intro vocals there are some electronics bubbling in the atmosphere around the rhythm I'm kind of expecting something pretty good but then dubstep wobbles come in what couldn't Muse have approached this in such a way where it feels like they're not just ripping a bass wobble from another hot dubstep producers track and then just placing it on top of their own it just sounds like somebody else came in and remixed the song for them the track animals is one of the more quiet and dramatic moments on here though it does have a very tight groove to it but the song explores right after that to me is really one of the more interesting spots on the album it's a track that if I were to take it out and just make it stand alone I would love it the instrumentation on this track Rises very slowly very nicely I mean Muse has some talent when it comes to building up a song when they're doing it with this kind of instrumentation for sure and I really like the melody on this track it's got some personality and the way that the song is being delivered a lot like on the track Survival it does have kind of an element of a musical theater to it and that definitely comes out in the lyrics as well where Bellamy is singing about these two people who are locked into this world that they just wish they weren't born and they don't belong here it's a track that I would see working perfectly if it were actually doing what it kind of feels like it's doing bringing a ballad into play where we can kind of have a moment of reflection after all these exhilarating tracks that came before but that doesn't happen here because let's face it there's not really a story so far for this track to add on to and on top of that all the songs before have not been exhilarating it's been an obstacle course of string sections and puke from the 80s and dubstep wobble and basically forgettable Muse moments however the ending of this album you will not forget I promise you it is just a grandiose display of self-destruction right after this track the band washes explorers down with what sounds like a u2 cover on the track big freeze and then the last four tracks man if this were like a gymnastics competition the last four tracks here would basically be the equivalent to a dismount where you break both of your legs the track saved me that comes in I've never really heard news put out such a lifeless momentum 'less song I mean at least when muses being over-the-top and kind of obnoxious which I know bothers a lot of people there's color and then there's flavor and there's personality there I mean this just does not have much of anything as far as emotion goes it's just a grey sky vocals aren't even really as over-the-top as other tracks and not because I feel like they're they're slower quieter songs I mean you know liquid state does try to be pretty hard-hitting it does have a driving tempo but you know it's just kind of a dud but then second law-- unsustainable comes in and you already know how I feel about that track from my track review of it and then after that the band brings in a really forgettable instrumental piano outro with the same kind of you know news anchor audio clips that were playing the previous track and it's just uh I'm just leaving it at that I'm pretty much feeling a light too decent 3 on this LP if you've given a listen what do you think you know did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan Oh muse forever [Music] you 
XbCpkSljxfE,hi everyone and Anthony Fantana your Internet's busiest music nerd a couple days into this a month and this is so crazy I just I just need to hit the reset button on October right now I just need to just slow down a little bit just you know justjust ask a question just pump the brakes for a minute and just ask a question make a comment say a thing maybe touch down on something that I talked about a little bit in the lecture I gave a few weeks ago at Wesleyan University and and a topic that I've been thinking of a lot something that I've been kind of kicking around in my head that was kind of started by a youtube comment as a lot of you know I read the comments on my videos often when I get a chance I respond to as many as possible and I got a comment once that really kind of struck me and and just echoes in my head week after week after week maybe you wrote it or have written it because it's something that I'm sure a lot of people have felt at one point um once I got a comment and it was it was written in such a way where it read Anthony don't you ever review anything for what it is you know don't you ever review anything for what it is do you constantly have to be comparing something to this and to that and to the other thing saying it's better than this it's not as good as this to me that is context context is everything in my opinion especially musical context whether you like it to or not whether you want it to be or not context just changes how you feel about music in ways you cannot even imagine I mean yeah there are various kinds of context and some more shallow than others you know you could like a piece of music because the person singing is dressed cool or is really hot or you can hate a piece of music because a certain group of people who listen to that kind of music or a group of people who that music is made by are people who you know you don't perceive to you know be cool or you don't get along with them or you know you think people listen to brostep or dopes or something like that you know and you kind of like project that onto the music Oh so-and-so's music is okay but their fans are yours you know something like that I feel like if you think hard enough about that kind of stuff you can most definitely subtract it out of how you feel about an album you know if you really do try and kind of mature a little bit and get past age racial and and gender-based barriers of the things of that nature but there are kinds of contexts that are more difficult to kind of erase from the equation pieces of context that you can't even really perceive how they're affecting how you feel about an album or a piece of music which which makes it even more difficult to kind of subtract them out I mean they are so part of your being that you can't even really ignore them what your gender is what your race is where you grew up how your parents raised you what language you speak all of these things affect how you feel about certain kinds of music your political views as well certainly some of these things are easier to ignore than others and I'm not saying that you know all of them kind of pan out into a really obvious way like oh if you're a woman you only like listening to female singers or bands that have female members which obviously is is not the case for everyone who's a woman I'm just saying that more than you probably care to think about it how you feel about an album or a piece of music is is incredibly influenced by the kind of person you are and again that does not necessarily you know add up to the obvious like you know if you really love listening to Death Grips for example that you actually like you know engaging and the kind of you know activities that are talked about in those songs what is maybe most important for me and maybe kind of more what that comment that I mentioned earlier was was talking about his musical context I mean how you approach music and how you feel about an album is of course impacted whether you like it or not whether you want it to be or not by your music listening history if you like so-and-so's new album is going to be impacted by weather or not you heard their previous material and when you heard it how many times you've heard it what tracks or moments on that previous material you liked it actually is also affected by nearly all the music you've ever listened to in your entire life for example guitar solos try to think of maybe the first guitar solo you ever heard that moved you every guitar solo whether I do it consciously or not is going to be compared to that one in such a way that you hear guitar solo oh man that one that one sucks that's a bad solo or wow this one is even better I got a new musical hi out of this as you are going through different albums and artists and genres music that came out during different time periods you're kind of comparing all of them subconsciously in and forming what you know we all call taste which at the end of the day is essentially kind of a personal barometer of things you do and do not like and that can be a great thing that has its pros but it also kind of has its cons because kind of throwing things into that you know dump pile can for sure turn you off to things that you could potentially like for example let's say that for some irrational reason the first song that you've ever listened to that you hated was in the key of D or something like that you know just run with it now maybe there were a lot of things that you didn't like about this track but you just kind of took all of these things corralled every aspect of this song and said you know what this song is bad I don't like anything about this song including the fact that it's in the key of D so just put all this stuff it's crappy it's poop now of course you know hating music and the key of D is just ridiculous I mean who hates music in the key of t but there are lots of irrational hatreds like that that you have heard about before you know that are a bit more commonplace I hate hip hop or I hate rappers that rap about this kind of thing or I hate albums that have saxophone solos on them or I hate hair metal I hate music that's too fast I a country I really dislike music where the singer sings in this kind of certain way you know am i guilty of this for sure you know I'm a human being have I been guilty of this like recently in a revue possibly yeah probably a quick hypothetical example that I could possibly think of is you know if I disliked a certain band or a certain album but a new band or new album comes along that reminds me exactly of that album hi I just did not like it's not something you know I'm particularly proud of or that I like enforcing it's just a reaction that I kind of have you know let's kind of just throw another hypothetical thing out there there is quite a bit of music right now out on the internet that has a very very revivalist nostalgic edge to it you know I'm sure you could find a number of bands on the internet that are taking the sounds of 80s synth-pop and then just really recreating them as if you know the 1980s are today you know the really kind of hardcore into the old analogue synthesisers they've got that studio sound down they're writing the songs like they used to back in the day and it just pretty much sounds like new like synth pop BAM now somebody who is young and is really kind of just completely not in the know with synth pop in the 80s could come along listen to this album and think it's really great but somebody who grew up through that era could have a completely different opinion on this album one that I'm you know assuming that you probably already are thinking in your head the knee-jerk reaction would be oh this is crap back in the 80s we had real synth pop but then again as you can probably imagine there are people who may have grown up through that era and would think wow this is great I grew up on this kind of stuff I'm glad to be hearing it again and of course as we see on this channel every week either just in my opinions or in the opinions in the comments if you bother to read through them there are artists on this channel who I review who are on their third fourth fifth 10th full-length album maybe even more and there comes that situation where you're thinking man I don't like this as much as this album I don't like this as much as that this kind of sounds like every other album they've been putting out for the past three LPS this is the best thing they've ever put out they blew past everything that they've ever released they really grew and again those kinds of opinions are completely informed by what releases in that artists past material you listen to the most the order in which you listen to them the ones you just kind of gravitated toward more emotionally what emotions each album pulled from you and also maybe how familiar you are with the current musical landscape and maybe other artists who are similar to that artist so what is the lesson in this video I have no frigging whoo I'm just saying that whether you want it to be or not context is everything all the music that you've listened to up until point all the music that's ever happened up until this point effects how you feel about certain records again like I said there are certain kinds of contexts that are easier to kind of subtract out of the emotional equation and there are others that are a little more difficult to do that with and I think the best that we can do in in that regard is to just kind of be conscious of them be thinking of them know how they work know how they impact you and and why what context does to expectations for a forthcoming album or an artist in the future is a completely different animal but again I mean I think the best you can do is just kind of understand what those expectations are and do your best to think about what is actually driving you to think in that way other than that I got nothing I got no answers maybe I had a few in this rant I don't know you let me know Anthony Fantana context forever [Music] 
oerGu27kun8,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review Mumford & Sons Babel these guys are a full outfit hailing from the UK and this is their sophomore album and their debut LP brought quite a bit of popularity to the band and they really hit a mainstream peak few bands do who are of the full persuasion admittedly in 2009 their debut album kind of breezed by me I wasn't really reviewing with the proficiency that I am today I wasn't really exploring a lot of things in the folk genre especially when it comes to the more mainstream acts who were signed more major labels plus a lot of the people that I knew personally when when bringing this band up in conversation would just talk about how much they hated what they were doing I never really knew why but when I sat down to kind of listen to this LP in the band's previous album I did kind of get a grip as to why for sure and I have to say it's just mostly because of the band's aesthetic I mean it's very cleanly recorded aristocratic folk music there's nothing overtly rootsy or really even kind of you know common people about it like is is pretty much the tradition with folk music and I certainly don't expect the band to go all the way back and do something completely traditional or or anything like that I mean folk music has certainly evolved over the decades it's certainly become a pop animal to an extent all Simon is is a culprit in this equation too and he appears on a bonus track of this LP and there are even more modern artists who have brought the genre of folk even further than than Bob Dylan Paul Simon and their contemporaries like grizzly bear who have brought things in in quite the progressive and psychedelic direction or even Fleet Foxes whose folk compositions tend to be pretty complex and and have some really heavenly big gargantuous and just ambitious soaring vocal harmonies honestly after listening to this the only thing I can really say separates Mumford and Sons from their other folk contemporaries at least when it comes to indie fold is their absolute lack of risks there's just really nothing adventurous about how Mumford and Sons approach this genre it's almost adult contemporary track after track they just have this devotion to pretty straightforward and accessible songwriting with some semi big instrumental presentations with horns pianos guitars banjo however it's not necessarily a bad thing considering that for the most part the band delivers some decent tunes I would say that simplicity weakness kind of works into a strength for these guys at times because that simplicity leads to catchiness now there are a lot of very kind of cliched romantic lyrics on here about traveling and God and the devil and hope alcohol death love curses and hearts come in several flavors as well including broken cold and what's the other one heavy that's the one and the vocals of marcus mumford are delivering these lyrics with a considerable amount of Sunseri it's funny the stories he weaves can be pretty vague sometimes but he is so goddamn passionate about them now the melodies and the chord progressions on the selfie nothing incredibly groundbreaking for folk music like I said but still pretty sweet and pleasant on the ears the track I will wait has some pretty thematic chords that opens the song up and the instrumentation playing that has a really kind of grand feel to it I mean it's hard for me just not to respond to that emotionally it just sounds so nice and the track broken crown has this kind of dark moody minor toned melody on the cores that that's stuck in my head instantly and the ferocity at which these guys deliver the chorus on this track makes it even more memorable the track ghosts that we knew is is a kind of heartbroken piano ballad in some spots in that song and they track lover of the light in mentally feels like just running over a grassy hill and there's a big tree there and a sunrise is coming up there's just a lot of kind of pretty musical moments on this LP even though a lot of the instrumentation on this album tends to be kind of refined a lot of the viscera comes from the guitar strumming still the instrumental rushes do tend to be kind of exhilarating even if they do tend to be a little Sammy Sammy here and there Mumford & Sons do kind of bring a variety of emotions and and tempos and just feels on this LP I mean there are tracks on here that really kind of create an atmosphere that is very rousing while others are kind of forlorn sad depressing lovesick sometimes even inspiring it's an album that's definitely sweet on the ears but it does sometimes get boring for me when I'm listening to it from front to back though I can't pick a track really any track out of this and say hey you know that's pretty decent I mean if Mumford & Sons came out with another album and just kind of brought a little bit more experimentation in terms of how they write or structure their songs maybe some production or recording with a bit more grit and some lyrics that had a bit more I don't know uniqueness to them I can see myself being really impressed with whatever they do after this but you know if you're looking for an indie folk album a full pop album that is is kind of comfortable something kind of like a rocking chair old pair of shoes warm fire then this most definitely will resonate with you in a big way I thought this LP was pretty likeable despite the fact that I mean I don't really think Mumford & Sons change their formula all that much this time around hopefully there's a bit more adventure on the next LP kind of feeling on a strong six strong six on this album what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next hip knee Pantano Mumford and Sons [Music] you 
9QmHTioUUaE,hi everyone Anthony Fan Tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review after clang piramida oh wait they're clean I really like the wind Sam you saying a bad the phone that rain you'll work home I don't I don't think they ever sang a song about that just a doesn't really strike me as something they'd sing about apparently you wouldn't say I'm about that efterklang is a Danish band and this is their second full-length LP since I was originally introduced to them in 2007 by the album parades which was an incredibly beautiful ambitious and just illustrious Lee arranged chamber pop album that just showed a band with a ton of potential not only did after client have a pretty strong pop sensibility but there were elements of dream pop on this album post-rock electronic music too they have the ability to be theatrical and experimental like Bjork but also very pretty and delicate like cigarettes but but could also pull off something pretty heavy and and dramatic like a climax that is totally godspeed you black emperor inspired now the band's next full-length LP kind of showcased a lineup change and they scaled down a little bit in the number of members and they started incorporating some pop elements into their songs maybe not bringing something that wasn't already there but relying on those pop elements a lot more and to be completely honest from this album is really where they kind of lost me a little bit I did feel that some of the arrangements in these tracks on this album were great they still had a knack for bringing in some extra instrumentation and making a sound beautiful but I just didn't find anything on this LP to be all that moving especially not moving in to get me engaged with it long enough to want to review the album when I was starting out doing this channel and so now here I am sitting with the band's new LP kind of hoping that it's it's going to rekindle that fire it's going to spark that interest again that I had once pretty pretty strongly in this band but unfortunately this LP did not really piqued my interest either and it's kind of a shame that that efterklang did not pan out into something more ambitious than what they had set out to do on the album parades but instead I kind of see efterklang settling into their pop veneer a bit more on this LP which would be completely fine in my opinion if I felt like efterklang was taking their newfound simplicity and translating it into something catchy something memorable something with a bit more urgency to it I was hoping that they would bring a little bit less of a static performance on this album ssssss there's still some extra instrumentation as usual like efterklang brains there are strings on here their horns there's even a really big choral group that appears in a few moments here but a majority of the tracks here have a strong focus on the groove coming from the drums and the bass and whatever kind of theme melody the band has kind of drummed up for the song which is usually delivered by the lead vocals of Casper claussen and I can't exactly say the Casper has changed his vocal style all that much on this LP I mean for the most part it feels the same but without the really wondrous and eccentric chanting and in weird background vocals that have appeared on previous after client efforts his voice just sounds really humdrum just not engaging at all he is just not that captivating of a lead vocalist on this LP and with the the base and then the drum grooves on this and him kind of like trying to fill up the space around that it kind of reminds me of like listening to a Radiohead b-side and I mean like maybe not even be side like a d side with thom yorke's vocals pitch shifted down like a whole octave there are some tracks on here where I feel like after clang is on the cusp of a feeling like I'm song apples which has a pretty captivating chord progression and and groove but the band totally ruins the vibe with what I think are just these really terrible sent horns the track the living layer has really pretty swell toward the end of it but it's like the Vandals kind of gives up on the song after that it doesn't feel like they need to bring it anywhere else and the tracks Edna has a pretty sexy vibe to the instrumentation I thought I just love the the slow-moving groove on that song kind of make my skin crawl a bit but in a good way however the vocals on top of it are just not sensual at all I mean very very lacking an emotion I mean it's like a big illustration of why nice guys never get laid which I say ingest but you know what i'm getting at some tracks feature more extra instrumentation than others but for the most part it's just kind of popping in here they're just add a color a texture nothing really amazing or complex compositionally there are a few tracks on here that did stick out to me like the song black summer which had some pretty ambitious horn sections on it really reminded me of one of the bigger moments from one of their previous two albums but still i mean the spots that I liked I mean really like weren't even that great that I would want to return to this LP just to revisit them but you know if you're looking for a kind of artsy pop record that will breeze by you very gently then this may be worth checking out but for me personally I'm looking for something a bit more gripping a bit more sharp emotionally melodically I mean that's that's where I'm at I'm kind of feeling a light five strong forward to a light five on this LP but if you've given this thing a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana efterklang forever I 
Bois5gUeMQI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Deerhoof breakup song and this is one of those ever so rare videos where my girlfriend is able to accompany me my girlfriend dominique is gonna talk with me to you about this new LP of course she's been invited in on this review because dear Huff is an all-time favorite of hers this is June like and you're definitely near like top 5 a favorite yeah he's a artist I remember I saw them twice in Connecticut before she actually even got to see that I either had class or was working or something horrible but this past March she made some time got to see them in person and you're in the front row and you're in the front yeah up front against the stage house the corner hi dear cuff is originally from California noise pop experimental rock band they've been doing what they do for almost two decades now you know in various lineups and they're really one of those bands that labels you know genre labels don't quite do justice because they're easily one of the most idiosyncratic bands and underground music thanks to the really strong and and flashy and groove driven drum playing of Greg Sonnier hoping for so tell me matsuzaki is always bringing some really kind of strange abstract silly lyrics and and her voice that I don't know how would you describe it I mean it's just so high-pitched it's so childlike I mean I would say I don't want to see anime but it's it's very and of course to finish up the quartet you have Edie and John two guitar players one of the more we added to the group who are always playing some very kind of frenetic just angular riffs that are just so punchy the experimentation always adds up to something kind of playful kind of silly and fun I just always kind of perceive dear hosts music to be like children's music for adults yeah I guess I can agree with that it's obvious something that I know I've listened to while jumping on my bed a few times now dear host latest LP is titled breakup song it's their eleventh studio album and the band of course is doing something new with this LP which is not really to be unexpected at this point they're always bringing a different sound with each LP a different kind of concept rather and this time around they're incorporating more synthesizers some samples MIDI obviously sequence drum beats along with kind of Greg's drumming I really enjoyed it I have to put a disclaimer on this because I can totally go like really fangirl and I'm gonna try not to chew everything about it but I just thought I thought it was really fun and whenever I listen to your Huff it's always kind of like opening up like a treasure chest so like this hodgepodge of like different like childhood memories and glitter and you know all kinds of really fun things this album is definitely a lot more dnc it's kind of like Noah's rock meets pop and pop but what I like so much is that dear ups music to me is usually pretty dance oriented despite you are listening a rock wearing that you are listening to rock instrumentation but I thought was so cool is how it doesn't really change their personality at all you know despite the fact that you are hearing beats on here that you are hearing more synthesizers that you are hearing samples of other things especially with the opening track which is maybe one of the more be oriented tracks on the entire album you're still getting punchy beats you're still getting a lot of noise the guitars still sound like they're being recorded with like one of the crappy microphones known to man and being played through a really tiny like practice amp with like three distortion pedals on it as like like what was one moment to you that kind of stuck out trouble with candy hands it definitely had like this kind of Cuban Samba beat that you know it was really unexpected I think that was the first check I heard he's the first track to drop from that yeah it was clearly one of the tracks on the album that there was a sample yeah you know and it was and there was a track earlier on the album where they clearly sampled another kind of Latin track you know you kind of got a piano in there as well I mean it it feels like dear Huff like despite the fact that is a sample and it is this you know this piece or this I don't know what you would call it this snippet yeah this chunk yeah this chunk of music that you know would ordinarily seem really out of place they've really blended it really nicely I mean it fit in being just as noisy and just as silly as everything else that was going on in the mix you spot that really stuck out to me were two songs that were back-to-back zero seconds pause and mothball to flee karen mothball the fleet where i kind of feel like Darrell was playing with expectations or just kind of their their stylistic shift on this album both tracks to me kind of start off with some really like crappy electronic elements zero has this really HAP hazard like the sizer melody and and and mothball has like another synthesizer melody that just feels ridiculous but as the track progresses you do get some changes and then they both fade out into something completely acoustic the first of which has like these beautiful acoustic guitars and ends off really tender and and the second of the two tracks has that piano moment and all the electronics and just all the noisy spots just all the noisy instrumentation fades away so you really love the track to fly or not to fly I remember the song because it's my favorite track I think I'm doing it yeah I like that one the most I really liked how the can lush and loud and noisy it is the beginning who's just really heavy yeah I don't over modulated and just like a lot of spots on that I would feel like that yeah yeah I like that and I like how he kind of moves into this kind of almost disco you know yeah it was Evan that yeah really kind of come on that's easily the shortest track on the album and and like that like she mentioned it gets really heavy gets really loud that over modulation happens and what's kind of funny something looked like a pattern that I'm recognizing not just on this album of just earcups albums in general I can't feel like this albums is noticeably more loaf I didn't dear hope versus evil deer versus evil to me felt so just like lush and just spacious and like all this extra instrumentation in there just make it sound like pretty and and just rich and clear but before that offend Maggie to me felt really low fie and kind of just like claustrophobic however before that friend opportunity felt really lush but before that runners for felt very low five however despite the fact that this new record feels pretty low five pretty rough around the edges and just kind of like noisy in Dieruff really uses those electronics to you know color in the spots that the drums and the guitars maybe feel kind of flat yum-yum-yum and did you have any major issues with this direction this album I honestly no I think it was just really satisfying to see them experimenting more with different sounds and kind of kind of moving in and out of their comfort so ain't very interchangeably Deerhoof keeps up those eccentric and just unique elements that have always been there with their music and and keeps it fun keeps it interesting you know and as most Deerhoof fans expect leaked leaked leaked leaked I loved listening to and I loved to sit in through this thing and just kind of you know hearing what Deerhoof had to offer next you me to her too and that's it that's that's her little review of the new Deerhoof album I mean check it out you know I I know it's been about a month since been released but you know we're talking about it now because they're too dear of fans and and we like what they have to offer and that's why I've been we've been following them for this long and that's it Deerhoof breakup song reviews forever [Music] 
LBnUyWddjsM,[Applause] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Flying Lotus until the quiet comes this guy is a California beat music producer whose production sits at the intersection of so many things jazz hip hop IBM his music just has a really futuristic Flair that is also combined with an extreme attention to very unique textures and sounds my favorite album of his los angeles has a really dark edge to it it's very rough very gritty very hip-hop influenced but his next LP Cosma grandma an album that a lot of people prefer is is much more jazz influenced very vast colorful Russian and kind of sound scabby with just a couple albums and in several short years he really revolutionized the world of instrumental hip hop and Illustrated where the roots of that genre could potentially go the dude is just a monster when it comes to engineering great and just thought provoking sounds he's lent his artistry to a lot of other albums as well he put on ganja Sufi with his last LP he also lent his production abilities to that Thundercat album that came out last year that I loved he even founded a label called brain feeder records where you have a lot of artists who kind of follow in his artistic footsteps of course not every opinion of this guy is is positive a common criticism of his work and and the work of the people he kind of runs with is that their albums their releases feel kind of disjointed a lot of songs that aren't developed in the same way that songs traditionally are and I could definitely understand that criticism I mean flying lotus and a lot of his ilk you know produce instrumentals that last about a minute or two occasionally branching beyond that before they just kind of jump on to the next thing sometimes not even really bothering to make sure that one instrument to logically flows into the other however sometimes I kind of see it as peering into the personal sketchbook of a really great artist it may not seem incredibly developed or mountainous at times but still very personal kind of raw however when you look at the bigger picture especially when it comes to a lot of flying Lotus's albums things really are not that random Los Angeles and and Cosma grama have had really strong flavours themes and though many moments on these albums are short they are unquestionably methodically produced you know for sure Flying Lotus does not have a style that's gonna meld with everyone but let's just get into this new LP absolutely this album does not have the same gritty hip-hop vibe as Los Angeles right now Flying Lotus is still kind of hovering over Jazz Ville however this album is also not the wonderous Denson and intergalactic planetary adventure that cosmic gramma was either I'm just not getting that same level of acoustic jazz instrumentation whether it be a sample from his deceased aunts harp from Ravi Coltrane from Rebecca Rath this is definitely scaled back a little bit instrumentally Flying Lotus relies much more on just his raw simple straightforward production chops his rhythms his syncopations his synthesizer work and he kind of pulls it all together with a very slight jazz fusion edge this album is longer than Flying Lotus is previous to but it still feels I guess more down to earth and it's become an opportunity to just kind of enjoy Flying Lotus for what he does produce beats that marched to the beat of a different drum travel off the beaten path there you know you're really starting to beat a dead Hertz well if you can't beat them join them he beat me to it I know I know you do have an occasional spot of a very atmospheric psychedelia on this LP like the Thundercat vocalized track DMT and the track hunger which actually features some arranged instrumentation from Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood this thing is definitely not a cosmic granite - that may disappoint some fans but what's an even bigger disappointment for me is that there are no real shockingly new sounds this time around from Flying Lotus there are tracks on here that feel like offbeat bangers with a lot of color and some weird synthesizers that kind of remind me of things from not only LA but but his pattern grid world EEP that came out recently too you do have spacious moments like I just mentioned that do have guest vocalists on them among them are Thundercat Niki Randa Laura Darlington and Tom York - and then you also kind of get these strong noodley jazz fusion style pieces that feel like they could have been blended into that Thundercat LP that dropped last year however despite being very familiar with what a lot of Flying Lotus is doing on this LP already I still can't deny here that a lot of what's going on here is colorful engaging seductive and and well produced this LP kicks off inconspicuous not really delivering the abstract noisy kind of intros that I expect from this guy but the track all in that that it starts with is pretty awesome it's got a nice groove to it the instrumentation surrounding the beat just kind of resembles like a starry night or something like that you've got these plotting synthesizer leads swirling our Peggy ated tones - that are very kind of psychedelic and the effects that are executed on them the track getting there that comes in right after has beauty on it as well that is apparent right from the start Flying Lotus like usual layers all of this just rhythmic mayhem into this wall of sound but Nicki Rando contributes vocals on that track really just kind of pierces through all of it and and sounds fantastic doing it at this point the LP is kind of off to a good start but once the song heaven comes in which has a pretty moody introduction to it that I like but once the track really gets going and then the beat comes into play I just really kind of feel like I've been here before with Flying Lotus and there are other tracks on this LP I feel the same way about the night collar only if you want and putty boy strut too though that may be one of the cutest songs that Flying Lotus has ever produced I'm just getting a lot of deja vu in the middle of this LP not only from flying lotuses work but the numerous artists that he's been putting on for the past couple years who are clearly drinking the same kool-aid however in the middle of the selfie there are songs that I love the track tiny tortures really one of the quietest tracks on here is is one of the darkest as well and enchanting and the title track has it's really kind of that over modulated feel to it the beat I believe is in three and there are these rising courts toward the end of the track that are really just moving and the tracks see through to you which is one of the songs that drop first from the cell P though it does stick out and does have a very nice guest vocal contribution from Erykah Badu I'm not even really sure if the beat on the song the groove to it even warrants or compliments of vocal contribution I mean Erika's voice doesn't really get into the nooks and crannies of that track and Flying Lotus just kind of in my opinion makes the situation worse by layering her vocal takes over each other to the point where they feel kind of hectic and just unpleased to listen to especially when you're getting her singing la la la la la la la over herself numerous times thankfully the ambition I look for from Flying Lotus comes in on the end of this LP through several tracks that all feature vocal guests and they're all kind of bunched up together I don't know why but Thom Yorke's work on the track electric Candyman is is chilling great track very potent mood to it and the track hunger Nicki randa's vocal contribution there is even better than the first track she sang on it's like nightmarish down tempo and on Lord Darlington's track she's sounding as beautiful as ever and there's some very nice string arrangements swirling around that track to kind of the two part track meet yesterday and and courted comes in after this and these four songs all after each other just kind of make up this album's longest and and most developed and most impressive axé I mean it's it's just kind of unfortunate that they all come in at the end overall for me this LP is just a collection of beats which is nothing new for Flying Lotus but typically his his vivid sonic visions and adventurous spirit more than make up for it I didn't feel like those two characteristics of his personality were is strong on this album unfortunately this album is still really good I can even see some Flying Lotus fans preferring the simplicity and the chilled out vibes of this album over Kozma grandma but I'm more of a cosmic gram of fan honestly I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this LP what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Flying Lotus forever [Music]
