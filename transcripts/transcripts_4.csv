EcGF0_3IarY,join me everyone everyone everyone join me please in a united prayer for the lives that we lost - chill wave hipster hipster run off hi everyone anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the brand new Toro y Moi record outer piece yet another installment in the ever-growing and ever-changing discography of mr. Chaz bear aka Toro y Moi a songwriter and producer who is known for many things but he's most notable for being one of the few voices that helped pioneer the short-lived internet genre known as chill wave and even though the genre came and went like the blog based dog and pony show that it was Chaz had the talent in the foresight to pivot to new sounds and new ideas as soon as possible as he would start to dabble in synth funk and psyche an indie pop and electro pop even a bit of R&B as well he seems to come through with a different style and aesthetic with every new record which has led to some rockiness in his discography over the years how in love I am with a new Toro record usually depends on whether or not the direction he's going in clicks with me I do love a lot of the impeccably smooth synth funk jams on underneath the pine the sweet psych pop on what for but I can still barely recall anything from Chaz's last album and some of the subtle vintage boyband isms off of his record anything in return they still give me nightmares regardless of what Chas has done last I'm usually pretty intrigued to see what he's going to attempt next especially on this new record because teasers like ordinary pleasure were really delicious feels like we're getting more vintage grooves more disco and synth funk vibes instrumentally a bit more Hardware a bit less software a few aspects of the instrumentation on this album sounds like something off of an old DFA records release but with more glamour and pizzazz and like a tropical scent and a neon color palette and this is an influence Chas himself references on this record on these song laws the universe where at one point he flatly says James Murphy is spinning at my house unquestionably a highlight for me on this record and thanks to this song and the two before it this thing begins with some real momentum and as it progresses I'm just getting more and more excited even slightly awkward bits like the way too loud delayed howling lead vocals playing throughout the intro track have kind of a cute amateurish charm to them however it is not very long into the tracklist before Chaz just loses sight of the momentum he's built up until this point and veers left into this super flat spacey alternative R&B aesthetic with the mostly thankless ballad miss me overall it's a passable track for the style maybe it's a bit more artsy and eerie than something you might usually here but this is unequivocally an awful turn in the album's flow it's like instantly being teleported from this fun never-ending all-night dance party to just blankly staring into a cellphone in the dark in your room because you have nothing else better to do and if I wanted to capture that vibe I would I would just literally do that we stray even further from God's light on the song new house honestly to me this track sounds like a transitional moment off of AB Rockhampton record with its glossy synth chords and its forlorn boyish lead vocals the kind of skittering beats Chaz does make this sound and this vibe his own with a story coming out of the lyrics about his own anxieties surrounding flying and travelling as well as with some auto-tune on his voice and some very robotic bass notes but outside of that it just feels like again a heavily brock hampton inspired interlude moment it's pleasant it's sad but still I kind of wonder how we got here the track baby drive it down is another moment that feels like it could have been built up a little bit it's way too basic rudimentary OneNote not a whole lot of progression to it I do like some elements of it I do like the sad dark plucky chords playing throughout the track the vaguely tropical vibe and the sort of spacious atmosphere surrounding the lead vocals there's an enjoyable awkwardness - Chaz repeating baby drive it down for me but still there's not much in the way of a compelling tune or progression to this cut it just feels like a loose idea just extended out to the length of a normal track the song freelance is another highlight on this record for me mostly because it feels like we've once again been teleported back to the funky digitized sent out vibes of all the tracks that kick the record off the song is really fun the grooves are top-notch the song who I am is an odd surprise in that for me it felt like a combination of like some future funk a splash of vapor wave maybe a little bit of influence from the Buggles you know video killed the radio star the track is mostly rooted in this very tight funky synth lip Chas paints this groove with some silly effects and leads tops all of that with some super cheeky vocals and lyrics and a very funny delivery that I like quite a bit sounds like Chaz is embodying a cartoony version of himself or something it's simple effective it's fun I just wish there was a bit more body and progression to it and as far as an artsy or take on alternative R&B goes the track Monte Carlo featuring wet is much better the synthesizers woven into the mix are so heavenly and idyllic and the lyrical angle sees Chaz diving into anxieties that he seems to have around best friends it's the closing cut on this record is yet another moment I found to be just ok it's a little frigid it's very cool very mellow like many closing tracks tend to be but nothing that really ties together this very inconsistent uneven and mixed-up album if there's one thing I appreciate the idea of in Toro y Moi it's the level of versatility Chaz is put into his records and his discography over the years however that has led to some really inconsistent releases and I think outer peace sadly is one of them which is really just a shame I'm feeling a strong v to light 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which an I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Toro y Moi outer peace forever

CYldmrlhCZA,hi everyone gettin flute out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new James Blake record assume form this is the fourth full-length album from uk-based singer songwriter producer mr. James Blake who we haven't heard from in a while at least in studio album form as he has been doing quite a bit of songwriting and production behind the scenes for projects like Beyonce's lemonade and the Black Panther soundtrack when Blake originally exploded onto the music scene off of a wave of pitchfork hype he had a style in a skillset that set him apart from every other electronic music producer and singer-songwriter of his time he seemed equally talented at rolling out these elegant heartfelt piano ballads as well as futuristic electronic odyssey's fusing together elements of UK bass and future garage and dubstep and when these two streams crossed into cohesive and compelling songs it created quite a unique sound for Blake now James first two studio records kicked off his discography really well but he's still very much sounded like an artist who couldn't quite settle on a single idea or sound or direction a guy who maybe just refused to be pigeonholed not the biggest deal in the world as it wasn't hurting the overall enjoy ability of his albums up until that point I do think Blake's inability to focus and settle on a stable sound did hurt the likeability of his third album that dropped in 2016 though the fragmented ballads and the dodgy recordings as well as the half-baked production on this album really did leave me feeling mostly indifferent to the whole thing and given just how in consist of the material on this thing is an hour and 15 minutes is just way too long of a runtime so I essentially came in to this next record hoping James would come through with a more concrete vision and while on assume form he still can't quite get away from this temptation of being a jack-of-all-trades the guy who can do and incorporate whatever he does deliver some of his best tunes yet in this tracklist I do think the record does kick off with kind of a rough start though the title track assumed form really does anything but assume form it's a fragmented mess of meandering vocal melodies all of these ambient no phrases that remind me of the incidental music Brian Eno made for Windows 95 and the lyrics see James going off on an emotional diatribe that's less than gripping the transitions the song features from one section to the next star less than fulfilling nor do they really build up enough tension to really make any of the changes on this track gratifying I'm similarly underwhelmed by the following track mile high featuring Travis Scott and Metro boomin essentially it's just a very bland and Spacey trap cut with very average input from metro and Travis percussions pretty basic Travis's auto-tune rapping is pretty basic really the most standout element of the entire track and it's almost wallpaper are the ambient synth textures swallowing the instrumental then James drops in on the second half with kind of this slow melodic kind of rapped verse he's like slow-mo rapping I appreciate the attempt but I wasn't really all that crazy about it thankfully the quality of assumed form just goes up from there as far as collaborations go on this record teaming up with Moses Omni on the next cut is much more appropriate than Travis Scott in my opinion not to say James shouldn't be crossing over and other genres if he wants to but I don't know some of these vocals just complement James's style so much better also Metro boomin strap rhythms on this track are much busier and I think more intricate unique wears on mile high it's like everybody's just kind of phoning it in I also think James passionate kroons on this cut contrasts really well with some knees very expressive and kind of mystical singing I also love the instrumentals deep bass and desert string melodies and after this cut is when James essentially lets open the Ballad floodgates which is when he truly shines the track into the red kicks off with these beautiful gorgeous moody string back vocals it's got a great relaxing beat it's a fantastic mix of electronic and acoustic instrumentation but the stunner of the song is James hypnotic refrain she was the gold rush she was the gold rush essentially likening this love that he's found to discovering endless riches I also love the dreamy and kaleidoscopic can't believe the way we flow James on this track sounds like he is floating on air he is literally high on love on this track the squeaky shimmery vocal samples are quite nice the cloudy pillowy mix the lead vocal melody and even though I do usually enjoy Blake's abstract approach to writing songs there are some tunes here where he's actually pretty forthright with his ideas and emotions the song I'll come to is like a welcoming loving lullaby with its orchestral strings and nocturnal background vocals the electronic beats and the haunting melodies create a very gentle atmosphere which gives me the sensation of being rocked like a baby meanwhile the lyrics on the song power-on follow a surprisingly simplistic formula for Blake you can see them right here essentially his preconceptions about love or this relationship that he's in being smashed repeatedly you can just tell on this record on so many tracks James is right now at least to the point of making this record just smack dab in the middle of like this honeymoon phase of this love that he's in and he is just packing it into his music there are some kind of enjoyable dark patches on this record though like the song are you in love which lyrically read to me is like somebody who's faking their way through a relationship or at least James being in a position where he's looking for some kind of assurance from the other person waiting for that other person to confirm to him that does she love him as much as he loves her it seems like a budding relationship and yet he's at a point where he's just ready to devote himself to it completely I do love the tune the vocals the lyrics the instrumentation the layering is beautiful the one thing I'm not too crazy about on is the super dry simple clap hi-hat pattern that just sticks out like a sore thumb in the most unpleasant way don't miss it is a depressive little ballad that James dropped months before this album that still sounds good in the tracklist featuring these heavily manipulated vocals these watery piano chords it features a nice linear progression the instrumentation builds beautifully the lyrics detail the stressors of a busy and restless mind with James coming off almost as if he's disconnected from himself in some way meanwhile the song where's the catch is a very dark shadowy and negative piece of art pop with a fantastic verse from Andre one that he describes as petty before he goes right into it and even though it is a very grim moment on the record I do think this album needed something like that to balance out of the more euphoric bits and to go off of this track into another collaboration on this record the cut featuring the one and only Rosalia oh my god it's amazing oh Jesus I knew she was gonna be on this record was looking forward to hearing the feature and it just surpassed all expectations not only in how gorgeously James and Rosalia's vocals just intertwine on this song but I'm also mega impressed with the nocturnal instrumental and the tune itself oh god the song feels so so just emotionally hung up and sexy the closer on this record is not super strong in my opinion though lullaby for my insomniac it is pleasant on the ear but not one of the more gripping and engaging Tunes it's got a lot of layers it's got a lot of atmosphere it has some nice vocal harmonies it's got some ambiance to it but you know not as strong tune not a strong direction just feels a little bland in my opinion still though I would say assumed form is an incredibly good album from James Blake really bouncing back from his last LP a few years ago in a way it is still kind of held back by some of the more awkward detours that he takes toward the beginning and end of this album but this thing easily features some of the best writing and production needs given us since the earlier part of this decade I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I worry you next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony

kHn-r95Gsm0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the brand new future album future Hendrix presents the wizard don't do it don't you do it future he doesn't make music for you he doesn't make music for you he doesn't make the music for you you're not simply that verb you're not about that life place that this is the latest full-length album from Atlanta Georgia hip hop phenomenon future ever since future popped up on the trap radar earlier this decade he's been nothing but a bonafide hit machine same damn time mask turn on the lights move that dope of the song jump man the collaborative cut off of his album with Drake just to name a very select few and future seems to churn out so many bangers just by virtue of putting out so much material on the whole and even though future does put out a lot of music his ratio to what hits and what doesn't is definitely better than that of his contemporaries who are putting out as much material most likely because he works with a very simple bold effective formula that just works futures husky and rappy kroons that usually barrel right through the auto-tune that his voice is soaked in he also tends to hop on some very blunt and trippy instrumentals not to mention he was pushing trap in more psychedelic directions before Travis Scott was making waves with rodeo so future has been a lot of things across his career so far incredibly catchy consistent distinct and ahead of the curve really everything but versatile which has pretty much worked against every future project so far in my opinion because if I can boil futures style or his biggest shortcoming down to one sentence it would be a pretty good idea stretched out to the point where it's lost its appeal which is sad because I do think future does have a pretty distinct sound and his albums and mixtapes could be improved greatly just with some very simple changes and additions to his usual formula and for the most part the wizard does present those Changez now don't get me wrong here I'm not saying the future has turned over a new leaf and he's become a completely different artist the lyrics on this record are very flashy and Bragi a lot of nods to money and sex and dope occasionally some clever wordplay or some introspection over a struggle that he's gone through or going through sonically on this thing you're still gonna hear a lot of warbly auto-tune vocals and trap beats and wavy vibes but you know what not every song on this record is shooting for the same vibe there's a pretty good mix of aggressive and gritty and all so surreal bangers on this thing some passionate ballads too if you can believe it we're future is almost having like an emotional internal monologue futures vocal style his singing voice is still not gonna be for everybody but it's it's there especially on the track crazy but it's true where I love futures flow on this thing especially on the hook where it sounds like he's almost out of breath it's crazy but it's true this song essentially sees him ranting about being owed respect for his influence because there are a few artists in my opinion that have been bitten as mercilessly by his contemporaries as future meanwhile the instrumentals are a bit more detailed this time around offer some prettier layers than I think we've heard on past future works occasionally they get kind of weird as do futures flows I also think future's gotten a lot better on this record at throwing a catchy idea out there and if he doesn't have any way of extending it beyond a few minutes of novelty in a single song he just kind of ends it there no kind of dragging a single repetitive redundant idea out for five minutes or four minutes and change to the point where I just get sick of it really the only track that approaches that for me as the opening cut never stopped and even though future as he starts to approach that five minute mark he begins to lose me there's still a lot of worthwhile things about this song I do like the pretty and glamorous instrumental the flow future presents as ever-changing as this is one of a few cuts on here where it seems like he's in the middle of an emotional rant the following jumping on a jet by comparison goes much harder even though I'm not really crazy about this one either not because it goes on too long but it's one of several tracks on here that by all means just seems like future by the numbers stick to the models and income back just a few songs that seem like they could have been slipped into any number of future projects and they wouldn't have sounded out of place just again very average for future digging deeper into the record the future actually hits a really great stride with this album especially in the first leg the song rocket ship I love the eerie minimal vibe of this track the evil and smooth bass the chilling chorus vocals that pop in on the second half in futures mantra urban Poppins is my demo bitch one of this records many hilariously egotistical phrases that are just fried into my brain future goes melodic on the following track temptation which actually features some really nice vocal harmonies and some kind of quirky vocal samples as well I mean at its core the song very much feels like futures usually clunky and weirdly melodic style but it's layered out to the point where it's got some beautiful harmony and body to it it's kind of refined and if we look at the lyrics they seem almost confessional on some bars where future kind of gets into his inability to deal with his own temptations the song crushed-up is pure eargasm ik euphoria the chai me swirling arpeggios in both channels the distant funny Reed melodies plus the hypnotic rhythms and futures mantra on this track diamonds crushed up in the face I could see it yeah there's a lot of flash and materialism throughout the bars on this track but the way future goes on to describe it combined with the instrumental it seems dreamlike and surreal like future isn't rapping about his real life or an experience that he's had but more like a psychedelic vision the song fnn sounds like the exact true-blue formula for a future hit complete with an earworm hook FN n FN end but the song has been built up with these incredible synth layers to give it this kind of panoramic widescreen feel also there is a heavy and aggressive beat switch in the second half of this track that's like what what futures do we beat switches now what's the song literally just explodes into banger mode in the second half and this is one of actually several tracks on this record that features some really cool quality beat switches and that's something in my opinion that is so refreshing to hear from future I love it on the song baptized I love it on the incredibly funny and tense talk like a preacher future also peppers the tracklist in the second half of this record with some weird moments that kind of stand out for their oddity like the song overdose where yeah the instrumentals little repetitive and everything but futures flow on this cut is it's a little relentless and there are multiple times mid rap where he's kind of stopping to laugh at the line that he just said like he's kind of just having a giggle at his own verse not one of my favorite tracks on the record but certainly stands out for that weird characteristic alone then there's also the song goin dummy which features this strangely cute vocal melody maybe one of the cutest Stu ever pop up in a future song I love the track slightly sunburnt but also wintery synth leads that kind of overlap cascading over one another with a delay the instrumental sounds like a trap remix of my favorite SNES games winter level music and also another track on this record that feels wonderfully dreamy then future goes totally unhinged on the song face shot future delivers one of his most amped performances on the entire record here and I love the incredibly grimy instrumental and the slightly industrial synths on the mix too it's like there's a kind of adventurous progression to the entire project where future seems to be taking more risks and doing more weird stuff as the album moves along however he does save some of the worst moments on this record for last especially on the closing cut where his flow just starts to slur to the point where he's almost unintelligible which is something that I didn't really care for and much of his earlier work believe it or not future has done a lot better in recent years to be a bit more readable lyrically speaking in his songs which I really do appreciate and not that I'm against things in general like mumble rap especially when it comes to an artist like future because much of the time the appeal of his music boils down to the energy and the vibe of it but when your articulation is so off that your syllables lose punctuation and your flow doesn't really have that strong of a sense of rhythm and pacing a lot of what you're rapping and a lot of what you're saying can seem very samey however that is not the case for a great deal of the material on the wizard it's the exact opposite I would argue futures actually really lively and even borders on electrifying on some of these cuts but again with the exception of the songs on here the seemed kind of average for him and again that closer that features such lyrical gems as I'm future Hendrix but I'm not a guitarist that's it's not it's not a good one as far as the features on this album go like usual with future there aren't that many which is something that over the years I kind of respect him for he doesn't tend to lean all that heavily on whatever talent he can bring on to his album outside but still Travis Scott is on here featured on the song first off which I feel like this song suffers from the same problem that ninety percent of Travis Scott featured songs do and that the psychedelic vibes combined with his relentless ad-libs just sort of make the track feel like a Travis Scott song that just features the the artist who the song should be spotlighting because it's his song but I digress then there's the song unicorn perk with young thug and gonna and I admit I'm kind of torn on this song while I do love what young thug brings to the table the ad-libs he throws all over the song behind future are insane and animated and bring a lot of flavor and character to the cut gun as performance though in the second half is absolutely boring and flabby and uninspired he just sounds like a tired young thug after saying all that I still think future Hendrix's the wizard here is the most entertaining thing he has done to date now keep in mind it's maybe not his most hype release it's not his most cutting-edge record either like ds2 that record was certainly a sea change for psychedelic trap I don't think the wizard really does anything all that novel in the grander scheme of things for future but I do think he layers matures and refines his sound to the point where it's a bit more dynamic there's a little more subtlety to it there's a little more nuance to it you can kind of dive into some of these tracks and get some interesting details out of them I also think future provides some really sticky and memorable hooks on this thing to give some good vocal performances emotional and aggressive and I'm actually monstrously happy about that I'm happy to hear a future project that I can enjoy more than just a couple of tracks at a time and that's it while sure still he's not the most versatile artists under the Sun and I do think the album does have some serious lyrical shortcomings the start of it is pretty weak the ending of it is kind of weak as well but that is not stopping me from feeling a light to decent 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

tpuYQ64fdzc,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week you know what it is we've done enough of these by now for you to know firstly I want to mention that I am going on tour in May hitting up Vancouver Seattle Portland San Fran Los Angeles San Diego hope to see you guys there very excited very excited we're gonna have a good time tickets and information linked in the description box as well as a link to our sponsor in this video

now if you hit up the link down below you can get 10% off of your order using promo code melon and also down there are our Amazon and turntable lab associate links treat yourself and treat us in the in the process all right the worst tracks of the week worst tracks of the week minute in we're getting to the worst tracks the week just a few just a couple not gonna bombard you guys with too many tracks that I disliked this week first off this new collaborative cut between me ghosts and mustard is absolutely generic boring nondescript nothing special about it whatsoever nothing special about this meeting of the minds sounds like yet another generic Mego song just boring one dimensional by the numbers trap music I have no idea how they're continuing to drop this stuff and people like wow whoa a new song yeah it just sounds like every other track that they do it's getting boring moving out from there logic has a new cut Keanu Reeves which is a little cringy in my opinion sure it's one of his more upbeat cuts it's a little more amped and in-your-face he's not going to emotional with it or anything like that but there are some bars on this thing that kind of just like got me scratching my head about how he is referring to himself as biracial in in a way that almost embodies the giant joke that everybody makes about him online like he's actually becoming the parody that people are drawing him up to be on his previous records which i think is sad I think that the whole logic is by racial thing has not really been a point of attack that I think is all that fair and while he has talked about it in depth and interviews it's not something that he brings up in his music to the point where it just sounds ridiculous but he's actually kind of doing that literally in this song and he's obviously attempting to do it in a knowing fashion but I feel like he's a failing miserably at letting the listener in on the joke and instead just kind of like looking like a joke in the process moving out from there this is a new cut from a project by the name of 93 punks with an ex ninety-three punks apparently Chicago singer songwriter rapper vic mensa is involved in this project and what is linked down below is a cover of the cranberry song zombie and it is god-awful I don't ever want to hear it again in my life it is so painfully boring alright let's move on to the tracks that I thought were met and like I just said with that a 93 Punk's cut all the songs that song included are linked down below in the description box so if you are curious about any of these cuts check them out for yourself they are down there below alright next ynw Melly new cut out featuring Kanye West which I gave a full length review on the Fantana channel kind of like the sweet auto-tune chorus it is really catchy it's pretty compelling but everything else about the track is generic by autocrine standards in my opinion moving on from there the drums the poppy Indy poppy post-punk II band the drums have a brand new cut out record on the way the name of this new song over here let me refresh my memory is body chemistry and yeah it's kind of sweet it's kind of jangly it's got a peppy beat to it sounds quaint and just just very sweet and cue like the way that good indie rock tends to be you know very very by the numbers however I think that's a bit of an upgrade from the band's last record which I think was a bit of a mess in my opinion all right The Cranberries mentioning them again in this video we're actually back with a brand new song and they're very wispy and forlorn and jangly brand of pop music still sounds pretty decent all over after all of these years the name of the track is all over now yes sounds like for the most part they still kind of got it and slightly intrigued about the new record I'll say slightly intrigued slightly intrigued moving on from there Tanya Tanakh whose name I hope I am pronouncing correctly Canadian musician has a new track a new record on the way the name of this new cut over here is snow blind if you're unfamiliar with Tanya's music it's it's a mix of piano music and some art pop and throat singing as well you may have heard her contributions on York's legendary madula record which I talked about at length in my worst to best Bjork video and I'm usually not that crazy about her music and obviously I'm not - won over by this track because the combination of throat singing and art pop does still kind of sit a little weirdly for me but I thought there were a lot of interesting passages to this cut so you know if you're new to throat singing and it's not something you've paid a whole lot of attention to and you do like your art pop to lean a little bit more to the art side than the vibe and the props I'd give this thing a shot it is an intriguing track it is a mystical dark intriguing track moving on from there pup has a brand new cut out titled kids the indie rock and pop punk outfit pup it is not bad it's a very verbose very narrative dense very wordy cut from the band with just some somewhat jumbled choruses but fun sweet melodies and guitar riffs it's a pretty cool cut certainly sounds a bit more lively and unique than what the band was delivering on their last full-length record I will definitely give it that this is the cover art for the brand-new panda bear track token which I will say sounded a lot better than the weird aquatic last single that panda bear came out with such an awful cut in my opinion this was a lot more palatable seem to have a stronger pop sensibility to it while still being kind of alternative and psychedelic like many panda bear tracks usually are thought the vocal performance on this cut was pretty decent as well and the song is attached to a very strange and awkward music video featuring mr. Dean blunt unhappily taking part in a series of activities at like a carnival or a fair like riding rides and playing games and stuff like that so uh it's it's pretty entertaining next South African artist Akane has a brand-new bright and vibrant new alternative pop track out featuring a note me and it's a banger you know the vocals are a bit overwrought and very heavy it's some very strange and very loud vocalizations all over the track it's very powerful they just do not let up a lot of the time however the song again is very vibrant is very uplifting I think definitely hits a point of a supreme passion if there's anything that kind of makes this song stick out it's it's definitely that moving on from there movin movin movin max a verse can the twee pop jangle pop band Scandinavian I believe yes yes yes they are from Sweden they have a brand new cut out although they haven't really changed all that much since their last album if anything the songwriting kind of pops out a little bit more I suppose but it's still pretty much the same kind of vocals the same shimmery guitars are the same kind of aggressive rhythm section the name of the track is demands and it's it's not bad while it doesn't stick out in my opinion from a lot of their other material they're still sticking to the sound pretty solidly and you know sounded pretty good doing it moving on from there James Blake has a few different tracks out I mean really a whole new album out and this new cut featuring Metro boomin and Travis Scott is a little underwhelming for me I mean I think it's a cool meld of influences ranging from Metro boomin rhythms to Travis Scott's vocals and a little bit of James Blake's voice in there and some very eerie atmospheric tones it's it's a marriage of I guess some of James Blake's futuristic blue-eyed soul some strange electronics and trap while it all sort of functions I wouldn't necessarily say the track pops out as being particularly exciting or special I guess but you know I am NOT that crazy about it but that does not mean that I'm not crazy about the rest of what is on the album in fact I do think it kind of goes up pretty significantly from there the track I did not mention his name Mile High moving out from there health has a brand new single out they've been dropping a lot of songs as of late and this is one of the few tracks it's not the only track in this recent album promo cycle that didn't actually have a feature on it 1999 is the name of the cut and it's got kind of a heavy electronic pop but also industrial vibe to it it's pretty dark and the vocals are pretty eerie you know III wouldn't say it stood out to me as a lot of Health's best songs or anything but I do like the mix of influences going on in the track gautsche which I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly this is a group that is entirely new to me so I apologize if that's the case but they seem to have a very kind of strange throwback experimental almost post-punk II kind of sound on this new track conspiracy theories with a lot of shouty funny lead vocals and kind of angular jagged guitar licks and and rhythms they're very strange weird little rock band that seems right off the bat to have a lot of personality even if it is a somewhat grating to people who aren't into kind of weirder things in the side of punk and post-punk music moving on from their future has a brand new cut out on his album featuring Travis Scott Travis got his two features in this video with James Blake wealth future been listening to the new future record I will prematurely say that I am enjoying quite a bit of it this Travis Scott cut however was not one of them in my opinion I thought the song was just okay sort of suffers from the same problem that a lot of Travis Scott featured songs suffer from and it's that his presence and typically the tone of the production which does shift usually when Travis Scott jumps on a track usually ends up turning the song in such a way where it just literally sounds like a Travis Scott song but with the main artists featured rather than the other way around with Travis Scott being featured or really just kind of sounds like a Travis Scott song with future on it which you know I don't really need another one of those in my life 3500 is amazing enough but I digress so a track was okay track is okay far from my favorite on the wizard far far from and Daphne aka caribou has a brand-new lengthy mega mix of Michael Jackson's Thriller out on Bandcamp which actually came together pretty well it's a fun little fun little remix loved that little disco loop pulled out of the track and it's a pretty fun progression of funky loops and beats also Ariana Grande's seven rings the big to-do this week has been oh my god ariana grande is ripping off so many people in her new song and yeah she pretty much is she ripped off quite a few quite a few ideas on this track I don't doubt it but this drag is essentially ariana grande trying to go a little hip-hop a little braggadocious a little mega materialistic on this new cut over here so she's kind of stealing a lot of ideas from other rappers on this cut to you know sort of a go a little flashy I suppose on this song it's okay you know not as compelling as a lot of the ballads off of her new full-length album in my opinion and also Caryn oh and Danger Mouse have come together on a brand new track titled woman and yeah you know it's it's alright I'm not all that crazy about it I mean Karen knows vocals are certainly explosive and passionate and it almost feels like a the old Karen o is back in a way but Danger Mouse however I feel like the production to the table is just super super safe and and bland I mean if Kara knows music and the IAEA's created excitement with anything it was also really great instrumentals you know instrumental backdrops and to me this just sort of seems like a watered down ultra commercial take on a lot of the more under you underground and rough and wild indie rock that was coming out out of New York in the 2000s alright let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the the best this week the best tracks this week the ones that won me over the most we had quite a few metrics this week but these ones are the ones that really want me over starting off with this brand new cut from Shu Shu pumpkin attack on mommy and daddy which is maybe one of the weirdest titles of any Shu Shu song ever and it's just as freaky as the last two Shu Shu single - I love that Shu Shu are really kind of going back into weirder and stranger territory the pulsating beats the tense lead vocals the noisy loops and samples placed throughout the track - are really menacing and weird as fuck yeah maybe it's a little bit like hey trihard art school sort of thing but it is produced really well and in a lot of ways that is pretty harrowing and very heavy and very dark moving out from there over here we have a brand new single from wise blood an artist that I've never really been that crazy about in the past her songs mostly to me have come off a little bit you know like just wallpaper just backdrop stuff not too heavy not too demanding or anything like that but this ballad over here on the song Andromeda is actually pretty beautiful pretty incredible liking the mix of old-school vocal pop and contemporary art pop on this new cut over here her vocals are just particularly good the production is very beautiful and pillowy loving it to bits moving on from there The Killers have a brand-new cutout titled land of the free and they really kind of get their Springsteen on with this new song over here in a lot of ways I mean not only just generally with the sound of the track but also Brandon Flowers voice and just the the theme in the story of the song - because I feel like back in the day Bruce used to get to the heart of America's shortcomings and you know what philosophically at the time of Records like born in the USA you know sort of made the u.s. less ideal then you know the hype might lead you to believe and I feel like the killers are effectively getting to the heart of that on this brand-new cut over here but obviously facing down a lot of the issues societally that we're facing currently issues thrown on to us by the current administration and so on and so forth none of which you probably need to have explained to you again but you know I feel like the song is not only a beautiful track but also kind of sums all that together really well moving out from there Tamron and artist - previously also I've never really been all that crazy about comes through with a very hard-hitting and I can't even really explain it fully genre wise but you know it is a great tune and what really kind of won me over with this track is basically the the the vocal performance and the passion coming off of it I mean the title of this new song over here new record dreaming in the dark the name of the song is fits of Rage and you know while it is a track that has a strong pop appeal to it I will say that tamron's vocal performances do a great job of embodying embodying that title it is a really gripping track again with some powerful vocals on it moving on from there spelling a project that I mentioned in a previous y-you know review because I liked the weird alternative almost witchy synth-pop quality of the music but I found some characteristics of it to be kind of awkward however even though some of that does remain on this new cut over here titled under the Sun I did find this song to be a lot more solid even if it is kind of lengthy and it works in multiple phases I think the synths are really cool and again eerie witchy quality about them something kind of low and weird about it the vocals are something that really kind of pulls you in in a really nice way you know if you could take a synth pop and kind of dive it down to its weirdest and and most amateurish and almost ambient dark ambient ish depths then maybe you'd start approaching something that sounds like spelling again name of the track is under the Sun it's pretty cool moving on from there an artist by the name of methyl ethyl trip the Mane's is the name of this new cut over here it is a really fantastically assembled piece of pop with a mesmerizing video with like a lot of sort of like ragout the vertically shot video clips of the main brain of the project kind of falling backwards onto a bed it's it's a very strange little visual art piece connected to a very compelling piece of a alternative pop with a great chorus to it a really good chorus on this track I like it quite a bit and whom Atmos is back plastic anniversary is the name of the duo's upcoming album and they are back at their usual grind with creating incredibly catchy little electronic pieces with strange source material this track is titled silicone gel implant and it in fact samples a silicone gel implant now of course mat MOS manipulates these samples to the point where you can't really recognize their their source a lot of the time and they do a great job of kind of making these samples have a musical quality to them and that is no less the case on this new cut over here which is incredibly weird and funky I freaking love it it's so colorful and so unorthodox it is quite amazing new cut over here from a group by the name of Huntley the name of this very low-key but very compelling ballad is low grade buzz it is very pretty it's very relaxing I'm loving the vocals on this track I'm jealous just loving the serenity of this song quite sucked up into it and looking forward to more music from them in the near future and singer-songwriter on our next cut Glen Hansard whose music previously have not really been all that crazy about he has several albums out already another one coming via anti records this one over here next to my hood has a brand new song I titled I'll be you be me and it's got some elements of indie and singer/songwriter in there and maybe a little maybe you call like noisy loaf I broke with the building just a very chaotic but beautiful instrumentation kind of flowing throughout the track a very tense progression to the song I'll say and even though the vocals are pretty quiet there is a kind of a quiet tense compelling sticky pulls you in kind of madness to it that I like quite a bit so give this track a shot as well and that is gonna be it for this weekly track roundup thank all of you for watching hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this one and I will catch you guys again in a weekly track roundup exactly a week from now because that is what we do that is the schedule that we're on remember once again link down there in the

c23Z7jd6VLM,[Music] hi everyone out Gastineau here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another installment of our ongoing worst - best series where I go over what I feel are the worst two best records in a particular artists discography studio album discography in in this installment outcasts the beloved legendary groundbreaking Atlanta hip hop duo Andre 3000 and Big Boi together with organized Noize their usual production team Outkast has made some of the greatest hip hop music of all time inventive and cutting-edge and chock-full of personality over the course of their discography Outkast had a sound like no other I mean not only were they getting two particular sounds and ideas and fusions of genres first long before many others would but they would go on to inspire countless artists that we know and love today contemporaries who are on the cutting edge themselves at the moment like Kendrick Lamar and even artists who extend beyond the galaxy of hip-hop because outcasts music was legitimately that good that it transcended cultural and genre boundaries alright let's rank these records ba-bam [Music] Idlewild is the sixth and final album from Outkast it served as the soundtrack to a movie of the same name and being a soundtrack album there is a degree of creative sacrifice here it doesn't really sound or vibe like many other records in the Outkast discography it's also a pretty bloated project at 25 tracks - there's a lot of filler on this thing and it's nowhere near as a memorable or as wild adventurous and experimental as many Outkast records prior overall a very weak note for the duo to end on as they haven't followed this record up with anything since the quality of tracks on this thing varies pretty greatly you have more traditional hip-hop leaning cuts from Big Boi andre 3000 is fiddling around with jazz and swing and blues kind of a creative split that we heard on speaker box and love below but not nearly as bold and adventurous this time around it's painfully obvious that Andre 3000 bigboy the chemistry that they've had on previous albums it's not really here on the soundtrack contextually Idyllwild isn't really remembered as one of outcasts core records as again it is a soundtrack record it does feature some interesting ideas and powerful moments it could have been far worse than it actually is if this project showcases anything it's that Big Boi and Andre at this point we're just looking to split off into their own artistic directions and that was already kind of illustrated on their previous double record but this time around the the results of them continuing to stick together or even less fulfilling next on my list is outcasts debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik its various scenes off the ground and a lot of the region's early pioneers aesthetically and instrumentally sounded a lot like artists you might hear on either the east or the west coast it was going to be a few more years before the roots of that dirty southern sound and what we currently know as trap would start to formulate I mean the most original thing going on in this area at the time was most likely the Memphis scene which is fondly remembered for its dark horror inspired lyricism eerie instrumentals artists like three 6 mafia but it would be a while before the influence of all this spread widely which is another video entirely so outside of their regional dialect and lyrical tone outcasts don't sound that much different than a lot of other artists in hip-hop at the moment on the east and west coast respectively but the duo and organized Noize do their best to put their own spin on it the dark little bassline and the boom bap rhythms on the track hootie-hoo are one of several moments on this record that sound like something straight out of New York meanwhile the flows and the guitars and the wavy synthesizers on the title track or almost like something lifted off of dr. Dre's the chronic however everything out cast is doing on this record is still impressive in its own right because the grooves the layering the melodies that a lot of West Coast hip-hop artists were offering around the time of this album were unmatched but here comes outcasts and organized Noize and they're just like BAM first record first tribe we did it on a debut album they effortlessly achieved that same hooking as' and lusciousness so considering that it should be no surprise that Outkast went as artistically far as they did down the road now there are a few cuts on this record where outcasts just starts to tease towards some of the funkier and more psychedelic leanings that would come out on records like acqu M&I and ATLiens the song claim and true or the track funky ride but for the most part what sells outcasts debut album isn't their originality but the raw talent on display between Big Boi and Andres flows and lyricism the incredible instrumentals and the songs that are so tight and well assembled and infectious and even though Outkast was just starting out on this record Big Boi and Andre play off of each other like seasoned vets plus they offered verses that were a bit more emotionally dynamic and reflective than that of their hardcore and gangsta counterparts on the east and west coasts especially on cuts like deep or get up get out or the relaxing weed anthem crumble and herb and the messaging the duo was trying to get across on this record on some of the refrains on some of the hooks is so universally true and great and sticky that they stand to this day as some of the most ear wormy bits to ever come out of a hip hop song whether it be ain't no thang but a chicken wing which is not a phrase the duo invented but helped popularize with the song on this record also get up get out and get something even at this point in this very early stage Outkast was writing timeless shit and they would only continue to get more original and more profound as their discography continued on [Music] next on my list is the outcast double-album speaker box and the love below and even though on this record there are a lot of highlights there are a lot of great tracks a lot of creativity to be heard even hits like the song hey-yah which was gigantic when it was released it was becoming increasingly obvious that outcasts as a duo as a collaborative was kind of splintering because Big Boi and Andre on this double record respectively each have their own side where they're just doing their own thing and under these conditions this record really truly could have been awful could have been a flop because Andre and Big Boi were very much not on the same page big boys speaker box is pretty cohesive but a prototypical blend of hip-hop and R&B from the 2000s it's a solid listen with the quality lyricism we've expected up until this point maybe not as varied and as exciting as previous Outkast projects but still it's kind of a solo record so it's a different thing entirely basically this album is like listening to two of the greatest songwriting minds in the genre locked into this McCartney Lennon like scenario where they're at odds because you have one person whose taste is a bit more pop centric and accessible and maybe even traditional but still creative and eclectic meanwhile you have a voice that is far more adventurous and experimental difficult to control difficult to rein in and it's like mixing oil and water effectively on the speaker box side of things we have some killer features from killer Mike and Little John and jay-z Big Boi essentially keeping up that very collaborative spirit that he maintains on his solo material meanwhile Andre aside at some points almost has like a an old-school guerillas vibe Norah Jones makes an interesting appearance the genre energy on his side of the aisle is much more focused on electronic music and funk in neo soul Audrey does quite a bit of singing on the love below which rubbed some fans the wrong way it's still a very interesting and fulfilling project though with a lot of very cool nooks and crannies and even with all of its flaws it still stands as one of the best double albums hip hop has to offer [Music] next on my list here is equipment I essentially third from being outcasts best record in my opinion it is actually their third record it's often considered to be one of the best hip-hop albums of this era which i think is saying a lot considering its placement on this list equipment I is a conscious hip-hop album sort of a high-minded hip hop album that doesn't come off as too preachy or annoying the record sees outcasts experimenting quite a bit with genre fusions bringing an elements of funk and rock and even country for the year 1998 the production on this thing is very detailed very clean and believe it or not at this point in their careers even though Outkast already had a few successful records under their belts artistically you could argue they had proven themselves they were still working against these biases that were being thrown at them because they were from a region of the country that was just lower on the totem pole in terms of relevance and hip-hop thankfully this record very much turned that tide especially with features from guys like Raekwon the chef on here and with one incredibly great well produced and lyrical song after the next a lot of thoughtful and topical cuts throughout this record especially the open or return of the G yeah another incredibly compelling song where the duo's working against the stereotypes of violence and machismo going on throughout much of the genre a lot of the beats on this record maintain a pretty spacey vibe but nowhere near is Spacey and alien and as otherworldly as we heard on ATLiens by comparison equipment I is much more colorful much funkier though when you do compare it to later releases it doesn't go quite as far it's not quite as adventurous in a way I see a criminai as a bit of a middle ground between like outcasts debut record and and something a bit more eclectic like a Stankonia equipment I does cram a lot of ideas into one album it's well over an hour of material just like the record that would follow it though again not quite as bold and adventurous instrumental e which in the case of this record I do think works against it slightly I feel it to be a slightly bloated album or at least a record that I think could have used a bit more variation and color across the tracklist something I think the duo's next LP does a better job of offering even if the lyricism on this record is pretty top-notch so even though I think Andre and Big Boi did go on to slightly more interesting things after this record that's not to take away from its overall quality it's still an excellent excellent album and far more unique than a lot of what else was coming out around this time and I will just leave it at that next on my list number two from being the best in my opinion is the duo second album ATLiens for the Atlanta duo this album is a pretty defining moment and easily one of the best and most unique hip-hop albums of the 90s so just a few years after their debut album and not too long after their controversial appearance at the 1995 source Awards Outkast come through with a very bold change of pace on their sophomore release in comparison with Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik to a degree Tupac's Califonia which was a pretty chill and funky and fun song so even though the artistic presentation of this record is super subtle Big Boi and Andres talents continued to grow as did their profile when this record charted far higher on the Billboard 200 than their last one did and stayed on the Billboard 200 chart in some capacity for over 30 weeks as far as the lyricism on this record goes Big Boi and Andre already set themselves apart from their contemporaries on their debut record with a lot of verses that were personal and heady and kind of throughout a lot of cautionary tales and warnings advice and they kind of go further down that road on ATLiens there are quite a few tracks on this thing that I think focus on sex and dating and promiscuity like on Babylon or jazzy bel whose sentiments at this point I think are a little dated but still in a way I guess well-meaning as I guess they're warning people not to take their lives into their own hands just to get a quick lay but there are other tracks on here where there's a lot of commentary on the industry outcasts popularity whether it be on the song mainstream or elevators me and you and like on their debut record there are cuts on here that display Andre and Big Boi as outcasts as artistic outcasts as outcasts in the industry but on this record they take it a step further and portray themselves as being out of this world which may be at the time trying to be a famous and up-and-coming rap star in the south it might have felt that way this sentiment probably comes out the most boldly on the song et Extra Terrestrial a bulk of this album's appeal in my opinion comes down to its incredibly unique vibe to it's very soft and subtle but sticky hooks also its cunning quotables as I would argue on this album Big Boi and Andre do a much better job of coming into their own vocally and lyrically Big Boi and Andre have grown into these incredibly distinct personalities and voices that reinforce each other so well especially on Wheels of Steel or on to dope boys in a Cadillac have to also mention the flow of this album is killer one great track after the next it all seamlessly comes together really well there's a beautiful simplicity to this album a power in its simplicity that I feel like very few hip-hop albums overall try to achieve it's no fluff it's all fire this is Andre and big boys standing out coming into their own and going against the grain and just just sounding great doing it and finally what I see as outcasts best album in my number one and my best spot here Stankonia this record came out in the year 2000 and it is what I see as outcasts best and boldest album which believe me was not an easy choice to make considering how fantastic much of the duo's discography is now every one of outcasts records up until this point had grabbed the attention of the hip hop world to some degree which I will repeat again at this point was a feat in and of itself considering how irrelevant the South was at the time in the grander scheme of things but Stankonia put outcasts in a position where they essentially transcended all of those regional boundaries and really became a household name that can be attributed greatly to this album's pop sensibility it's crossover appeal I mean what the song miss Jackson alone did for the duo's career is gigantic not to mention it's easily one of the most overplayed songs of the 2000s now I do have to say maybe all of these genre crossovers and this mass appeal is what makes Stankonia less of a hip hop purist pick for the duo's best album that typically goes to an equipment eye or an ATLiens instead if your opinion is more from that angle I could see how you wouldn't really think very much of this album but you know what even though Stankonia does offer some sweet moments that work well on radio for every track that fits that bill there's another song on this thing that's wildly weird and experimental like a psychedelic funk hop Odyssey there's not really a moment on this album to some degree that is an ambitious cutting edge catchy or strange as far as length and material it also goes the distance like equipment I did but it offers so much more in terms of variation and sound even though this album had gigantic Commercial Appeal for outcasts so many of the deep cuts on this thing artistically are way off the beaten path even further off than much of what they've done up until this point in a lot of ways I see Stankonia is the shape of hip-hop to come as on this album Big Boi and Andre pushed and emotional depth and genre breadth that no other hip-hop artists at the time were and wouldn't for a while because keep in mind this record came out long before we had Kanye polarizing people and blowing minds with his auto-tune to opus 808s and heartbreak and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and all the electro-pop fusions of graduation not to mention this record was coming through with quirky weirdo fusions of pop and rap before gorillas would do the same to if you want to talk about records that are ahead of the curve and challenge listeners to get out of their comfort zone Stankonia is it and not only is this record ahead but it's also really well executed it has so many facets and phases and nooks and crannies to it I love the weird interstitial bits that bring us from one segment to the next and these like football huddle break lines that kind of bring us from one track or moment to the next the skits on this thing and the interludes are consistently creative and hilarious there are excellent explosive rock tinged bangers on here like gasoline dreams and bombs over Baghdad also supremely sweet and slick spots on this thing like super super clean meanwhile snapping and trapping toilet tisha and I'll call before I come I think still stand as some of the weirdest things to ever come out of the South in terms of hip hop ever meanwhile explosion with be real of Cypress Hill Fame as well as Erykah Badu on this record stand as some of the most essential hip hop features of the 2000s I also love that outcasts take the time to show some southern hospitality to gangsta boo on I'll call before I come making that very necessary three 6 mafia connection there while for many people this record may be a difficult listen because of how wild and varied it is and how much some of the more low-key cuts really demand from the listener especially the closer which is like a really weird sexual space fantasy despite all the weirdness and the oddity of this album you gotta give it to this record because how many hip-hop albums sound like this man even to this day I think this album is still not appreciated to the degree that it could be as many fans seem to more favored releases and outcasts discography that have more traditional or consistent or predictable tone to them meanwhile as far as my preferences go I very much appreciate and embrace the madness of this record I find it to be so colorful so chock-full of character big boys verses are fantastic the flows on this record throughout are so amazing and intense especially the verse and flow that Andrej brings on the opening two bombs over Baghdad one of many killer moments on this thing a story and the details of miss Jackson the big boy brings to the table the hilarious we love these hoes as well as the killer posse cut gangsta shit it's just one great wild insane moment after the next where despite the fact that Big Boi and Andre seemed to be in very different creative places they were still very much complementing each other really well it's sad to know the things kind of fractured past this point but still I guess it's better to have loved and lost and at least gotten to this incredible peak of creativity than to have never experienced it at all and I will leave it at that that is my outcast worst ooh best thank all of you for watching transition before I end this video off I want to give a huge shout out to fill up over at Volks Geist who co-wrote this video with

QCLxY1FHMh0,hi everyone dark the Prague's you know here's its busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Big KRIT compilation TDT Big KRIT is a Mississippi rapper who I have covered on this channel multiple multiple multiple times some of my most positive reviews have actually been Big KRIT reviews in fact I think his last full-length album was actually his best so far made it on my best albums of the year list when I put that together but last year Big KRIT did not stay silent releasing a handful of EPS with a few tracks on each and now he has seen fit to release the songs on those EPS on a compilation that brings it all together last year a lot of people were kind of hitting me up saying hey why haven't you reviewed these EPS I noticed the EPS didn't make it on your besties piece of the Year list like what's up and I will admit in 2018 I did not do as good a job of covering the EP side of things as I possibly could have so I figured I can kind of make up for that by talking about this newly released compilation of all of these Big KRIT EPS right here right now let's go so big crate if you don't know he's not only a rapper but also a lyricist and a singer and a producer really kind of a triple threat he's greatly influenced by pop rap and conscious hip-hop a lot of southern hip-hop Outkast Kanye West as well now across crit's discography there are hits and misses there are highs and lows my least favorite projects of his actually are the ones that he put out on a major label because it seems like those records for whatever reason were a lot more limited however these days he's back on his independent shit through that I think his music has gotten a little better which initially did make me excited to try these EPS because he strikes me as an artist that wouldn't release anything unless he really needed to release it and it seems like lately he has a lot more creative freedom indicated by his last phalanx LP however I feel like that freedom isn't really being taken advantage of on these new EP in fact I think pretty much all the material that these EPS presents for crit is kind of underwhelming even in comparison to some of his most lackluster records mostly because I think the beats generally are pretty generic not really a whole lot in the way of interesting rhythms on this thing a lot of the percussion on this thing just hits a very one-dimensional trap vibe lyrically I didn't think there was a whole lot to these songs that stood out but let me go over some of them the opening cut energy is a quick and euphoric piece of pop rap with a distinctly southern flavor it's got some sweet soaring background vocals and strings Creek keeps up a pretty athletic flow at a consistent pace with a lot of nods to the tough upward climb that he's had to keeping up his energy thumb Attica Lee it's it's pretty general doesn't really get into a whole lot of details as far as what he's rapping about the song learned from Texas is one of crits many musical tributes essentially kind of giving a nod to the music and the sounds out of the state of Texas that inspired his music over the years whether it be you GK or chopped and screwed I love the instrumentals cascading synth leads that have a bit of a chime equality to them they almost sound 8-bit it certainly adds a lot to the blissful nostalgic tone of the song the song glorious is theme melody sounds almost like goodie mob's who's the creeper though but like a lesser version of it the cut presents very little in terms of an exciting rap performance or verses meanwhile the track 100 grabbed my attention but for all the wrong reasons because easily it has the worst chorus on the entire record crit's oh-oh-oh-oh is all over the track sound completely ridiculous though I do give him props for being able to very subtly shift into this glamorous R&B Lane but still be able to perform pretty well in that sound without coming off awkward or out of place meanwhile higher King part six is a really passionate monologue delivered over these kind of fuzzy auto-tuned vocal leads that sound like something straight out of a Kanye cut it's kind of sad and anthemic it sounds like something off of 808s and heartbreak or maybe even some of the more low-key cuts of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy very Spacey very dramatic first matched with a track beat and crit has a particularly husky vocal on this cut and a flow that reminds me almost of like Rick Ross as far as the lyrical content on this song goes a lot of reflections on his present his past materialism God for me the song for the three has the most exciting groove of any cut on this record with these bleeping synth leads and a growling bassline it's cute but has an animalistic quality to it but still another moment on the album that's not really going above and beyond on the rhythm side of things because again the beats on this record for the most part they're just really one-dimensional trap beats and considering how much experimentation is going on in the genre right now how versatile and simplistic the form is and how creative crit has proven himself to be in the past I would think that rhythm wise there'd be a bit more variety on this record but there really isn't meanwhile the compositional bits in the instrumental sometimes they come off kind of pretty most times they feel super basic and uninspired even the beats that are produced by Cribs lyrically this compilation is not nearly as topically focused as any record crit has put out in the past he seems to be dipping back into a lot of the same thumb addict wells that he has in the past but coming up dry as far as anything new or refreshing or profound to say and not to assert that crit has nothing to say at all anymore I just think that he didn't really spend as much time on these tracks as he has on a lot of his recent material it's like he's groomed and refined these songs just to the point where they sound acceptable enough to release I don't know if that's because the ideas on these tracks are left over from his last album or if he just wanted to rush a bunch of songs together to kind of give fans something to listen to to hold them over before the next big project in a lot of ways the material on TDT it sounds just as breezy and casual and almost effortless is like what migos were doing on culture 2 in fact I could imagine quavo and offset and take off doing any number of boring MeeGo systems over these instrumentals overall TDT the EPS on it the material it presents it's just not as colorful or as creative or as versatile as we've known crit to be in the past just seems like a really slapped together collection of songs and believe me these cuts are by no unlistenable I'd actually say there listenable to the point where they don't challenge the listener to do anything other than just have it on in the background because outside of a few pretty instrumental bits and some personal and specific verses there's not much here that could legitimately inspire any sort of excitement or thought I think TDT at the end of the day it's passable it's okay hardcore fans will most likely love it but in the grander scheme of things that is completely average and unremarkable for crit and I know he's capable of so much more I'm feeling a strong vibe 2.oh late six on this thing transition have you given this compilation to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well or over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Big

Mjs52lzxkZo,hi everyone bad that he buns you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new bad bunny record x100 hurry this is the debut full-length album of rising Latin trap star bad bunny a Puerto Rican singer and rapper who is exploded in popularity with the recent rise of trap flavored pop wrap geared toward spanish-speaking audiences the sub base and the rattling high hats and the crispy snares and the triplet flows they made it to Latin America and now artists like bad bunny are essentially fusing those sounds with Latin pop and reggaeton and R&B among other things and it creates a somewhat refreshing sound though I think bad bunny sticks closely enough to the current day trap blueprint so that his tracks could be played pretty seamlessly in a Spotify playlist with Drake on it and I mean Drake is in fact on this record on the closing cut Mia a single I didn't really care for when it first dropped a single that I still don't really like now that it's in the context of the record either it's a very Spacey and forgettable and vanilla track that I think speaks to the laziness that Drake sort of oozes on a lot of his new material not to single my dislike of this one track out though because there were other reasons I wasn't all that excited to hear this LP namely bad bunnies singing voice over the past couple of years as this dude has successfully transitioned from grocery store employee to Latin trap superstar I've heard a handful of pretty high-profile features from him with Will Smith and J Lo and cardi B he's been plastered all over the front of Apple music for days and days and days at a time and whether it's a feature or one of his many successful singles bad bunny consistently comes through with this bellowing throaty voice it's like the vocal equivalent to a bull just charging through a china shop and deeper into this record there are more spots where bad bunny exhibits odder vocal quirks like for one he most likely because of his intense singing style will usually start a lot of lines off with him just gasping for air it sounds like repeatedly through his own album he's being waterboarded on mic or like someone's dunking his head into a tank and then he's coming up for air all of this adds together into something that's very loud it's a very ear grabbing but I can't really say that I enjoy it for sure bad bunny sounds unlike a lot of other singers and vocalists out there in the current pop trap-filled but I'm just left wondering whether or not he has anything else to offer listeners who might have kind of gotten their attention grabbed by him on a feature here and there or like a random single and to his credit on this album he does make an attempt to vary up his sound a little bit try some different things I applaud him for not putting out a totally one-dimensional album trying out various sounds and styles within the trap genre while also throwing a few unexpected surprises in there - and most of this variety comes through on the production end of things the beats really do tend to steal the show because they're all pretty infectious and detailed and entrancing like the heavy trap percussion which backs up very well the trippy effects and the plucky chords and finishing violins on the opening cut or on tenemos que hablar which feels like a fusion between trap and pop rock I mean I can't say I think it sounds all that good as a tune or as a meld of styles but it's certainly unique the song otra noche in Miami has a throwback 80s synth wave quality to it feels like I'm spending a night in grand theft auto's vice city where I'm just like doing tons of coke and strippers and there's a nice gauzy vaporwave aesthetic to it then there's also the Warped and sad pianos that warp psychedelically into a wash of auto-tune vocals on the track good lettuce which in a lot of ways sounds exactly like something Travis Scott would do on a record which is not the only spot on this album where I hear a pretty bold Travis Scott influence without a doubt all of these production bells and whistles are a nice touch they add a lot of flavor and character to the record they definitely play a huge factor in this albums and joy ability but for the most part it is kind of a distraction from bad bunnies vocals shortcomings even with him attempting at going into a falsetto range and riffing on some more expressive vocal lines on like cs2 vase emos juntos or even some low-key spoole issue vocals on the track car Oh meanwhile we have other cuts on this record where the songwriting runs then the beats feel a little generic and even bad bunnies voice he's kind of painted himself into a corner because he has nothing really left to present us whether it be on Sarah Burchett a or estamos bien probably the most vapid cut on the entire record featuring this really awkward flow that really doesn't invite the listener to Bob their head or anything also these squeaky undefined synth melodies that get lost in this wash of reverb it sounds like a wintry nightmare there may be a few spots on this thing where bad bunny comes through the vocal melody that's uniquely good transcends the genre he's n transcends the language barrier but for the most part the vocals on this thing are either increasingly getting obnoxious or they are falling into the background because the tone and the tambour is so same across the entire record that it just feels like wallpaper after a while the vocal performances from one track to the next they come off very very se me the beats consistently steal the show as I said earlier and what's crazy about that is that the beats aren't even that amazing sure many of them sound pretty expensive and kind of refined but if you've been paying attention to a lot of the biggest mainstream rap records over the past couple of years there's nothing really on this album that's all that cutting edge or refreshing is anything on this album as experimental or as adventurous as what you might hear on JPG mafias veteran not really is anything on this record as luscious colorful surreal and cutting edge as you might hear on Travis Scott's Astroworld no neither is bad bunny trying to say anything all that profound on a lot of these cuts either I mean given that I'm not a native Spanish speaker maybe there are some elements of wordplay here that I'm not privy to maybe some of the songs on this thing where he's kind of in his fields over a failed relationship just some love on the rocks might speak to other people more than me but lyrically this record is not really looking to blow your mind or anything like that which is something I'd been happy to overlook in the past with other records if they've presented some great instrumentals or some good vocal performances or a unique personality or something but I just don't really feel like this record has that at its disposal I think the closest this record came to bordering on something super interesting is the song quando pari a bus which i think is the only time I've heard reggaeton and trap and glitch melted together maybe unintentionally but I don't know the squawky synthesizers and some of the weird noisy effects it's all intentionally cacophonous it seems like I don't think how noisy and freaky this song sounds is an accident or anything and it's oddly satisfying despite how grating it is La Romana is also one of the more enjoyable raw cuts on this thing especially after a very sharp beats which in the second half and a super grimy feature from El alpha overall though this new bad bunny it's kind of spotty and slightly bloated album with a pretty much even mix of highs and lows and while there are some moments of genius on this record where I think bad bunny vocally does pretty well the instrumental is pretty awesome for the most part the cuts on this record feel like bad bunnies just executing a random shotgun blast of tracks where he's just trying a little bit of everything some of it works out some of it doesn't a lot of cuts on here where he's wearing his influence very clearly on his sleeve and he's just trying to hop into a lane where another popular rapper already is to kind of just ride on those coattails and he's not really putting that deep of a spin on the sound that he's trying to copy meanwhile he's trying to string a lot of this project together by delivering a lot of these very lovesick lyrics it's pretty good in spots but I think that's the most complimentary thing I can say about it as much of the record is really inconsistent while also being too consistent I mean vocally speaking I would love to hear bad bunny switch it up a little bit more meanwhile their instrumentals and tunes on this thing that just feel like total duds because bad bunny can certainly hold a pitch but I feel like there are a lot of spots on this thing vocally where it's almost like he just hits autopilot mode and just kind of delivers his song in the same tambour that he does every other track that he's on I'm feeling a decent too strong 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next

cvMev0AoeeU,okay okay okay okay okay everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and we are back we are back back back back with our weekly track roundups I know all of you missed them but they are back they are here we have a lot to get through a lot of songs some of which are kind of back dated a week or so because you know it's it's been a while since we've been doing the weekly track roundup updates we took a break because of the holidays and list week but hey we're here so let's kick things off and just shout out the tour that I have coming up in May we have tour dates right here over my head now they're in front of the poster we have dates in Vancouver Seattle Portland San Francisco and Los Angeles San Diego again coming up in May if you want to get tickets link down below in the description box and also shout out to the very good beautiful people over at seat geek sea geek is an app that aggregates ticket prices from around the web to let you know whether or not the price that you're getting on a ticket that you're purchasing for your next concert is it a good deal or is it a bad deal you can get there in app view from C to see exactly where you're going to be sitting and use code drop on your next order to get $20 off again link and information down there in the description box see geek alright let's get into the weekly track roundup want to also say our Amazon and turntable lab links are down there in the description too if you want to treat yourself we get a little bit of kick back from that turntable lab link I want to also give a shout out to this new song from the 80s shoegaze outfit the telescopes Austin wrote a nice thoughtful blurb for their brand new song and music video over on the website you can find that link below along with a link to the brand new Kravis EP the black metal and experimental metal outfit is back with a brand new but kind of shortened to the point collection of tracks alright worst tracks this week only a few only a few didn't want to ruin everyone's week back with the weekly track roundup with with too many worst tracks we have a brand new song from Hopson which is a name that I cannot say without getting a little bit of indigestion Hopson if you may have missed it over the course of the holidays because you know you're engrossed in your family and all the goings-on with you know Christmas and all that then they're there most likely is a God in your life yeah he dropped a little Christmas Christmas song over the holidays titled hell's Carroll avoid it at all costs and unfortunately I did not really dig the new collaborative cut from gosh awful Stine and the weakened a lost in the fire thought it was quite underwhelming thought very average vocals from Abel kind of a bit of a cute 80s throwback synth funky beat a very nocturnal the production was easily the best thing about it but as far as the song and the vocals go it was really a kind of a letdown unfortunately and now let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of myth but we're not terrible we're certainly worth your attention you might like them a little bit more than me let's uh give Machado first off I want to give a shout out to this music project featuring the one and only mr. Adam Neely youtuber and music theorist and bassist extraordinaire the name of this project is is Sun gazer and this new cut over here which is titled electro is an interesting combination of some jazz fusion and a variety of different electronic music styles just sort of blended in a very experimental and and somewhat explosive manner it's it's pretty fun to listen to it's pretty fun listen moving on from there we have a new cut from Sleaford mods kabab spider which is definitely a little more electro influence then I think a lot of their recent tracks have been it's a fun listen to very wild off-the-wall lyrics from the duo as usual and still I do like their post-punk e energy Lana Del Rey has seen fit to drop a new very long-winded very syrupy ballad but I didn't mind it you know I just wish there was a bit more of a climax to it but it's still a kind of a nice cut hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have very pillowy very sensual like like a good or usual Lana ballad should be moving on from their new La Dispute cut footsteps at the pond I wasn't really all that blown away by this song unfortunately I feel like the track hits all the checkboxes one would want hit for a usual La Dispute track but I feel like it doesn't really go above and beyond enough to really kind of WoW me or anything maybe it's a little bit more melodic and harmonious than some of the cuts off of their last couple of records but outside of that I didn't really find it to be all that thrilling maybe it's kind of a slow burner you know maybe it's a track I just need more time with on their new full-length album I'm just gonna be dropping this year so looking forward to that moving on from there a new Kalani cut featuring ty dolla sign it's a pretty slick smooth catchy commercial R&B banger with a lot of goodness to it think they have some good vocal chemistry on here they definitely sound good paired up on this cut and it's a very well produced as well not one of my favorite songs you know I think gonna be this year but it's it's still a likeable cut it's still decent moving on from their integrity has a brand new cut and a record on the way this one has a bit of a very heavy grimy gross disgusting distorted but triumphant feel to it almost feels like integrity is continuing to play with some of those heavy metal influences that have turned up on their stuff as of late I like how much this metalcore outfit is sort of proving to be so so primal and so visceral but also a pretty pretty versatile as well movement oh and I didn't say the name of that cut all death is mine is the name of that cut over there girl pool has a brand new cut out easily the most low-key song of all the tracks that have been teasing toward their new full-length album and it's that bad it's pretty low-key chill ballad very very sad tugs on the heartstrings and that sort of thing future has a brand new cut jumping on a jet and also has dropped this this little documentary which is streaming at least I've seen on a Apple music I haven't gotten a chance to watch it or anything like that but if you're a future fan you probably won't want to miss this cut even if it does sound like much of what future usually does maybe with a bit more punch and he's really kind of going in on the vocals a little bit really going above the top but yeah yeah I'll just uh I'll just leave it at that moving out from there oh no him who is a pop artist who has been at it for a little while and just now getting to her stuff with a recommendation over social media from a few people on this new cut over here it's titled buckets and it's really insane it's like a mix of art pop and some trap and some really shouty in-your-face post-punk II almost like Alice glass Crystal Castles shit is mixed in there and maybe a touch of mi a as well I've heard her past stuff which is way more electronic and ambient music influenced this sort of seems like a whole new direction for her kind of like she's reinventing herself a little bit certainly the boldest thing I've ever heard from her so you know maybe that's enough to give it a try can't say a super strong definitive personality came out of it or anything but she's really kind of like you know spilling a lot of blood on this track and I I admire that moving out from there Deer Hunter has yet another song out teasing toward their new full-length LP planes is the title of this new cut and it certainly does sound plain sadly kind of peppy and feel-good indie pop with a sunny vibe to it without much in the way of a lot of quality songwriting and sound experimentation the stuff that has really kind of made deer hunters greatest records as great as they are I feel like the more we get away from that golden era that they had in the 2000s the less the band seems to understand what exactly their appeal is or what exactly they do so well so um I don't know just sounds kind of bland for a deer hunter single sadly mah or mad as hell new cut from The Chemical Brothers it is a hard punchy aggressive mix of electro an acid house honestly the the mad as hell refrain of the track is a little obnoxious as well are the squelchy bass licks on the track although you know I do care for some acid house but I can't say this is gonna be one of my favourite acid house songs to be to be quite honest moving out from their Beirut has come through with a brand new cut it's titled landslide it is very tense but honestly it's it's probably one of the better songs to be released from Zac Condon's project new album out this year keep an ear out and Adia Victoria a different kind of love is the name of this new single over here she's a kind of an interesting singer-songwriter figure with a a mix of like goth rock and blues in her style it's very dramatic and there's a lot of batma sphere around it and it's it's quite nice it's quite tasteful certainly someone to look out for I guess over the next few weeks and she has a nice little NPR tiny desk concert out if you guys have not seen or heard of that if you want to kind of get more familiar with what exactly she is doing so uh yeah keep an eye on keeping here out Adia Victoria alright let's move on to the best tracks first off we have Teyana Taylor who actually came out with a remix of the song with Method Man Raekwon Ghostface Killah the Ghostface Killah verse on it is great there's a little music video attached to it as well it's very cute it's very endearing I actually wish this is how the song originally was yeah I mean it's it just sort of makes me wonder whether or not like the whole project she dropped was kind of rushed because of you know Kanye's influence over in everything and maybe if she had more time to work on it and more connections and sort of bring people on to it it would have been like a much bigger much more filling record because it certainly did have potential but you know just didn't really go far enough to really kind of stand out outside of a few pretty catchy tracks that made some you know pretty prominent placements on some playlists over the summer but nice to see that this song has come back with a you know our tasteful and in a very good remix moving on from there Sullivan liqu Hugh has a brand new music video out which I enjoyed quite a bit for this cut over here titled love and sacrifice track that's at least new to me and did like it quite a bit there was something kind of sweet and uplifting about his some vocals on the chorus that almost reminded me of like a Lincoln Park track keep keep looking out for this kid he's a he's a young rapper with a lot of potential and he's coming out with some good stuff and I'm slowly warming up to him wasn't really super impressed when I first heard the dude but he's a really starting to grow on me a little bit I'll say that I'll leave it at that moving on from there Slater with with three wise SLA yyy ter alone is the name of her new single over here she has a few tracks out already she's a bit of a weird social media musician that has odd hot pink cover art and lots of it's it's like I don't know dark grainy sultry social media pictures are kind of like her aesthetic and like this teenage girl obsession with like mm Zehra pop artists and pop music like there's there's very much a huge Britney Spears influence on this cut over here but there's something really weird and experimental and glitchy about it like if you could take Britney Spears biggest hits of the 2000s or like a big Christina Aguilera hit and just like screw it up and glitch it up and make it kind of aggressive and strange and freaky and and just wet just wet as hell then you would get like a Slater song essentially and I do kind of like what her and a lot of other up-and-coming pop artists in the underground are doing right now you know kind of experimenting with those pop diva sounds of the aughts whether it be her or rena saw gamma or some people in the PC music camp or Charli XCX I do kind of like this new wave of experimenting with a lot of these older pop sounds and I'm getting something cool and interesting out of it moving on from there Sharon Van Etten has a new record out on the way very soon as strapping this month 17 is the name of her new song and music video it's great-great-great-great-great loving the bold steps and sounds that she is approaching on this new record I think this is gonna be her most diverse and fun album that she's ever put out so I'm really looking forward to hearing the whole thing and reviewing it a piss grave has a brand new completely disgusting and putrid and vile news Oh from their new full-length album coming out soon posthumous humiliation this over here next to my head it is not the album art this is just kind of like a weird little single picture the album art is very gory and horrifying do not look at it unless you have the stomach for it but the new song over here is titled euthanasia and it is as gross and as stomach-churning as I want a piss grave song to be so if you want to listen to the grossest nastiest most disgusting oh you're probably going to hear this week give it a shot song 31 a track that I did a little track review for over on the Fantana channel this new track from freakin no-name is quite nice definitely one of her faster tracks as far as rap flows go and it's very nice as far as I guess like just a little check in past the incredible success of her latest full-length album room 25 and Liz o juice brand new single from this lovely lady who had a great track on my best songs of 2018 list and this new cut over here will most likely be on my next greatest singles of the year list because this song is fucking killer it is a peppy Dancy great piece of pop and synth funk with some motivational inspirational lyrics a great energy to it I just kind of love the charisma that just she uses at the track and the music video is incredible so lovin the lizzo juice and o vivió sound machine they have a new record coming out soon and a new single over here their usual mix of pop and funk and electro and afro beat music is all kind of here on this new cut it's got a bit of like a weird throwback almost like awkward like I don't know underground disco vibe to it that I thought was kind of cool the name of the new cut over here which I don't want you guys to miss is tell me Doka Doka mine and moving on from there Squidward knows is the name of the new cut from cupcake which is very raunchy very sexual very nasty very tongue-in-cheek very tongue and mouth very tongue in but the tongues and everything you're talking about a cupcake song and it's got it almost like a reggaeton kind of vibe to the percussion the bars that she drops on this track are gut-busting ly hilarious yeah more spongebob references please more spongebob references and want to shout out Chong the Nomad who is a fantastic little producer the song is older but still it's new to me it's new to a lot of different people so I gave her a shout-out in my recent reviewing your music segment on the Fantana channel people took to it I loved it I think the mix of glitch hop and underground you know kind of cutesy weirdo indie pop on this track it's a really interesting fusion of sounds and there's not really anything I don't love about this track from the strange little vocal harmonies to the really intense harmonized arpeggios it's a really creative little cut with a lot of phases to it and shout-out to her for being a really kind of creative unsung producer for so long and now she's finally getting the attention she deserved so that has been our weekly track round up everybody one more time I want to give a shout out quickly to the tour that I have coming up

the description box and support who is supporting us thank you alright guys this time around I got I got a nice fat bundle over here that we're gonna go through oh so nice so nice first off first off I'm sitting right between two tens over here baby two tens Wow let's go through the first one over here the new daughters record here's the money shot whoo it's dark and black like my soul you really won't get what you want if what you wanted to get was a big picture in the in the gatefold so I can't remember what the sticker said on the front of the plastic when I pulled it off but I think the sticker described the vinyl as being like some kind of London Fog grey or something if I remember correctly but it certainly does live up to that title it does look like a nasty grey impenetrable fog so definitely not not lying on that one so pretty just dark minimal art and and just sort of packaging over here generally a very straightforward plainest fought possible presentation of the lyrics on a one sheet and yeah I mean that's basically a you know the vinyl sounds great it's a decent pressing and the gatefold I mean it's not that long of a record not sure how necessary a gatefold was but I don't know gatefold is always nice I guess the kids see ghosts record and packaging is actually pretty straightforward plastic sleeve black vinyl plain white labeling with grey album titles on it vinyl sounds pretty good although it's probably just a digitally produced record digitally pressed record so or rather you know it's just recorded that way so you're just putting a digital signal onto an analog medium so a very artsy lyric sheet over here with the lyrics printed very cleanly in a series of paragraphs back of the album cover is is okay you know just kind of repeats that same image over there it's alright it's okay you know nothing mind-blowing or anything but it is a great little record which is obviously one of my favorites of the year since it made number two on my albums of the year list even though I think in a lot of ways it is it is kind of like an EP in spirit a perfect EP alright I have a couple related records over here that I had to get when I saw them in the store because in college these records really spoke to me they were some of my favorite records to listen to of course I'm talking about Conor Oberst lifted and fevers and mirrors maybe some of you guys don't really listen to Conor Oberst maybe you're too young I'm sure a lot of people are maybe a little closer in my age range loved his stuff back in the day his bright eyes stuff Conor Oberst you know they're artists in every generation that kind of gain an audience and get popular because they're sort of like tortured souls you know and Conor Oberst is very much that guy very much the tortured soul the poems and his songs are heart wrenching and depression there yeah can't talk depressing pretty straightforward plastic sleeves on these but thick nice thick pressing not super thick but you know it's got a nice density to it the records sounded great very happy with the sound quality of the records very happy after all of these years after listening to these albums over and over and over through like some prop probably some illegally downloaded mp3s that I nabbed off of a friend I now own them both on vinyl so Connor you got my dollar after all these years you got my dollar because I don't think I actually know you actually know you know what I did own lifted I did own lift it at some point in college and I don't know what I did with it if any of you are collecting vinyl for a while you know that sometimes through buying trading selling borrowing changes and taste records that you have bought way back in the day they they tend to come and go and this I'm very happy that it is now back in my collection in a newly repressed format although um as much as I've always loved fevers and mirrors I've actually never owned a vinyl copy of fevers and mirrors interesting that there's actually like you know some mirror effects going on with the album art over here I do I do appreciate that especially since I do love looking at myself I do love looking at myself there you guys are in the camera whoo oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go I love you one one one one can you guys see that can you see me loving myself sorry this is why you guys watch this segment right it's well it's not a real mirror it's a slide out it's totally fake the mirror is a lie but also uh there's some very nice photos of Conor in the band looking a looking real emo in a in album art you know Conor Oberst again tortured soul great songwriter great poet wrote a lot of good tunes his songs were just painfully dark I would definitely recommend lifted / fevers and mirrors though I know fevers and mirrors is kind of the go-to record that a lot of old heads say is the best but I actually think lifted is a little bit better I do like how instrumentally ambitious and sort of high production value that record is and I think it does pay off in spades double LP gatefold lyrics scrawled on the inside there the vinyl is very good quality just like that of the lifted pressing so you know this is kind of like in a repressing series for these Bright Eyes albums you know still own my copy of wide awake even though that's been repressed I didn't need to grab a copy of that since I already had that but again to to to favorite singer-songwriter records of mine back in the day I know Conor Oberst is definitely a little bit more of a generational phenomenon people who are a little bit older than me or people who are a little bit younger than me maybe he doesn't really quite make sense and I I think his his stories and his songs really speak to a very youthful and teenage type ank's that I think you have to kind of be there for it for it to really kind of like connect with you and make an impact on you but you know I guess if you don't mind listening to a record that's older and you feel like you're at that point in your life now or here a young guy or girl or however you identify and you you feel like you you've just got a lot of angst you're working through right now maybe his work will appeal to you maybe his work will appeal to you next one Black Flag first four years I do look Black Flag Black Flag is a great band although there are some you know later Rollins era records that I think are a little overrated I do love the earlier stuff better than than some of the later years stuff I do like the contribution that guy's like Keith Morris bring to the table in the pre Rollins era pretty much everything you're hearing here on this record which is essentially a compilation is just work off of their early EPS when they had different singers and the recordings were way way way WAY rougher the songwriting style and the mix style really resembles that of you know that those first four off EPS tracks like nervous breakdown and fix me very much sort of resemble that that off sound you know this is obviously which is obviously that that's just like a throwback to this for a scummy and as gross as this record sounds it is a thick ass pressing like is that heavy ass pressing just a straightforward black vinyl red labeling and just sounds really scummy great fantastic fast aggressive in your face if you are looking for a true blue hardcore punk record that is just balls to the wall and in-your-face highly recommend this one this one is quite nice I've had a lot of these tracks downloaded for a very long time since I was like heavy into Punk back in college and happy to have them on vinyl finally moving on from there finally got on vinyl for the first time the avalanches sits since I left you the plunder phonics classic is now here in the Fantana collection very happy that it is is landed here if you're looking for some incredibly funky and fun sample-based jams with a lot of soul and melody and beauty and grooves and grooves and grooves for days please listen to this album do not miss out on this record a shame that they were not able to follow it up sooner rather than later but pretty straightforward pressing here dick nice and thick you could kill someone with it thirty-three and a third rotations the labeling is quite nice and the gatefold is kind of a nice blown up photo this the ship that seems to have been printed onto the record labeling very nice tiny fine print liner notes there and yeah just pretty pretty straightforward you know the record like this it's just good to have it on vinyl because it sounds you don't need a whole lot of flash in the packaging in my opinion all right here's a bit of a throwback a used copy of the debut Violent Femmes record an album that I highly recommend a really great kind of early years full Punk album that was so ahead of the curve that they recorded and put it out in the late in in the mid or late 80s but it actually didn't catch on until the 90s through hit songs like blister in that sad lemme go on big hands I know you're the one lyrics scrawled in in pure angsty fashion on the inside of the record there yeah The Violent Femmes they just like wrote really gross grossly dark and emotional and tortured like semi-acoustic punk rock with a really sort of rickety I guess a rickety aesthetic to it Gordon's vocals and his very again a upsetting lyrics on this record and sad and depressed and lovesick and they were they were unlike anything else going on at the time so um yeah I really uh just loved the fuck out of this record love their follow-up album as well Violent Femmes were a group that in my opinion were not really appreciated enough in their time even for as viral as the group was in the 90s for for a hot minute also uh if I remember correctly Gordon he had an appearance in in an old Pete episode which I did love that show all right next one I believe this this one actually came from a fan of the show who passed it along this is like a Japanese import Japanese pressing of Kenny Durham's jazz contemporary which I'm sure this was contemporary when it was released in 1960 Kenny if you're unfamiliar with him he actually had a stint in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and had quite a few solo records himself and this album over here I mean there is a lot to it that I can't necessarily get into because it is in Japanese however there is some description of the tracks on the back which is nice and it just kind of seems like a pretty straightforward Bop and modal jazz you know it's it's not a bad record the handful of tracks on it good performances it's one of those old-school mixes where you had entire bits of instrumentation pan all the way to one side on the mix like the bass and the drums in one channel the pianos and the horns and the other channel and the performances all in all are pretty good pretty tight it's not exactly super aggressive hard bop or anything like that it's very melodic it's got a nice swing to it it's very tasteful you know not too over-the-top or anything like that so if you're looking for like a sort of like a nice I guess smoother brand of Bebop you know I guess I guess you can give this a get this a shot kenny dorms jazz contemporary again dropped in a in 1960 and i greatly appreciate the dude who sent that over to me we're not even really sent it over to me but a hand delivered it to me when i'm I was out on tour when I did my little East Coast South series of dates and lets us stay on the debt the Jazz train this next one actually comes from my wife yes my wife I don't know why I did that that was like the cringy aestethic I've ever done video on this YouTube channel and I know y'all are probably gonna say something about the little pump review in the comments but no that was way crazier than any any review score I've ever given so if you guys just want to just never watch me again I would not blame you but anyway so my wife got me this this record my beautiful wonderful smart and thoughtful wife got me this record before there was hip hop there was the hip heart Dorothy Ashby hip harp this record came out what was it late 50s or early 60s to the sand the back here I know I looked it up but then I sort of lost track of it but um this this is a jazz harp record yes jazz harp which a lot of you have probably not heard such a thing before and I'm not seeing the year off the just sort of that first glance on here and again I know this was Frank West's one of the men who was instrumental in establishing the flute as a jazz instrument and there is jazz flute on this record obviously Frank West's mentioned on the front cover of this thing but you know Dorothy's harp playing is really what kind of steals the show on this record dorothy is associate in this set an extremely versatile musician heard on all toe and tenor sax --is as well as flute with Count Basie's band Frank blends beautifully with the with Ashby's sound here originally an Oklahoman West did much playing in Washington DC in the 40s and early 50s before joining basing in 1953 yeah again not seeing the year again but given that you know you're talking about people working and getting the other with other people in the 1950s you kind of have a sense of the timeline here and obviously this couldn't have been super super early because I mean in in the days of sort of the the I guess the I want to say the primordial days of bebop and hard bop you know you didn't have you know jazz harps flying around left and right slowly to this day you don't have a whole lot of jazz harp records and yeah I mean it is a peculiar sound there is a lot of resonance to dorothy's playing on this record a lot of notes tend to ring out for a very long time but it does add sort of a very beautiful and dynamic quality to style up jazz that you just typically don't hear harp in so again you don't hear a lot of flute jazz generally I mean it's part of the reason why I think Roland Kirk is so great so you do get flute jazz on this record but on top of it you get harp jazz too so two of the more unlikely that jazz instruments especially for their time come together on to this one record of there's seven tracks on this thing and I've gone through half of it and so far it was just frigging fire so highly recommended we're a unique little jazz record from an artist that up until this point my wife had never sort of like turned me on to this record before told me about this record I've never heard her listening this record she just said that like her dad used to listen to it and that she had just sort of like remembered it one day or something and you know thought to look it up and thought that I would like it and I mean honestly it's great so Dorothy Ashby harp Hermann right on bass Arthur Taylor on the drums frank west on flu so harp bass flute drums don't need much else all right last two records over here but they are related I got these over Third Man Records in Nashville when I went over there and visited the store and the sort of distribution plan that they have down there the sort of the main brain the hub of the place we have two records from The Melvins stag and stoner which 90s rock outfit but they're still they're still around today but mostly known for the work that came out with in the nineties The Melvins ah two really solid records from their discography especially stoner which over here which a lot of people tend to prefer over dag I mean look as far as like their 90 stuff with the Melvin's you can't really go to wrong you know you could really grab any number of records from that era and you're gonna hear something awesome and the band was truly ahead of the curve on a lot on a lot of stuff that I don't think they really get a lot of credit for because they're kind of like a a musicians band like there are a lot of people who listen to them who are just like total weirdos or other musicians who just like hearing experimental stuff weird stuff cutting-edge stuff bands that are just sort of odd I guess you know people are sort of like underground attics and that kind of thing there are a lot of mainstream music fans who obviously listen to groups that The Melvins have influenced over the years but may have no idea who the Frick The Melvins are although maybe that partially has to do with the quality of their discography kind of waning over the years but to you know just give you a basic basic super basic rundown Houdini as a starter record is really good it's really heavy it's really fun listen it's pretty straightforward it's pretty gutsy I really can't go wrong with it stoner which is a bit heavier a bit more badass a bit nastier can't really you know go wrong with this one either there are some weirder and sort of like lighter tracks on here where the band does their best to kind of provide a little bit of I guess a variety to the tracklist they sort of embark on a few odd silly little somewhat tongue-in-cheek ideas where I think they they show off their humor their sense of humor a little bit more and stag is not as well regarded as a lot of the records that came previous to it but I think that has to do with some of the ideas on this thing being even stranger maybe not quite as aggressive and heavy the band was incorporating more elements of like psychedelic rock and like Warped weirdo pop rock especially on like cuts like black black Bach and goggles or two of the weirder tracks on here certainly and even tipping the lion had like a really odd mix to it with kind of a squelching Wow Wow baseline to it which is again not stuff that you typically hear and a lot of the Melvin's early stuff there's also like some horns on here some sitar the band was definitely experimenting with instrumentation a lot on this thing so they came up with like a lot of weird goofy sounds and mixes and just kind of instrumental palates on this thing to kind of build their typically heavy sludgy stoner sound out a lot and and that's the thing you know there's a lot of sludge metal sounds on these two records a lot of stoner metal sounds on these two records they're very gruff they're very heavy and and even though the Melvin sort of had the punch and the the girth of like a sludge or stoner metal outfit they don't really take themselves as seriously as many stoner metal bands and outfits out there do which I think has kind of prevented them from transcending into metal circles as much as I think they should have over the years but I digress I mean you know just to kind of illustrate a point here there are sounds and riffs and vocals on this record that sound exactly like ideas that would turn up on Metallica's loaded and reloaded a few years later but but way frigging better and actually nasty and badass and awesome not like crappy and horrendous like in the way that they pulled the ideas the other on on those on those two records but I digress so yeah highly recommended these two albums for me and you know money shot nice a nice gate folds over here with some cool pictorials of whatnot what let me switch that oh yeah oh yeah this one is not a double LP the stag copy is a double LP pretty straightforward thick ass black vinyl with that lovely third man labeling over here because this is a third man exclusive reissue and given that it is Third Man Records you know that they sort of care about the sound quite a fit and it does sound great leaf does sound heavy it does sound fresh as hell for something that was sort of recorded and put out in the 90s is very clear is very heavy and for music in the style you do want it to sound gargantuan so The Melvins stag and stoner which everyone and that is going to be at Ford of this vinyl update everybody hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this one and I love you transition have you given these albums a listen are they in your collection yet if they are then good for you

cY27XD0ZRho,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new 21 savage record i am greater than I was this is the new full-length LP from George rapper 21 savage he dropped it at the tail end of last year and I am just now getting able to get to it in 2018 hip hop was louder than ever with aggressive scream deliveries bombastic beats with massive bass but it's one of the softest voices in the genre over the past few years that has miraculously cut through all the noise and that is 21 savage I mean as he says on this album I don't got to talk loud but you hear me though this dude's nearly monotone and very low-key flows started turning heads a few years ago especially when he broke through off of his collaborative record with Metro boomin savage mode now there were some things I could appreciate about the album like it's cold blooded demeanor and how minimal it was - but for the most part savage mode in my opinion is so stripped back and so one-dimensional it borders on parody at the time I thought it was the kind of thing that would just disappear in a year or so or just have one or two hot singles and then vaporized but 21 Savage has arguably come into his own more and more since the release of that project for all of its flaws his album did see him trying to change things up with some hardcore and pop rap blends even like a 7-minute freestyle at the very end of the record and his surprise 2017 collaboration with Metro boomin and off set without warning was a pretty eerie listen with its frigid beats and its catchy choruses and horror movie vibe so it's become increasingly clear that 21 savages flow his style it's not going anywhere anytime soon especially if he keeps dropping records like this I am greater than I was from a title standpoint is a pretty bold statement to hit fans with right out of the gate as before you've heard this album savage himself has already made an assessment on his growth on his artistry also on himself as a person but ultimately I think he's pretty much saying here this is my best record so far and I can't deny that there are improvements on this record 21 is definitely more expressive on this record than I think he's been in the past whether it be his forlorn demeanor on the song a lot which is legitimately moody or his murderous bars on the good day there are also some rare moments on this record where he'll break into some whisper raps into like an auto-tuned raspy falsetto but overall I think one of the biggest changes 21 presents on this record is an emotional one as it seems like on this album he is not afraid to be himself reveal his intentions to be better to his own kids than his father was to him the trackball without you see he's 21 kind of in his feelings over an older relationship where it's over and it's kind of bittersweet because he has to go on without this person and sort of enjoy all the success that he's seeing alone there's also a very sentimental auto-tuned diatribe about love and hate and loyalty in the midst of the song - I also admire 21 for wearing his heart on his sleeve in the way that he does on the song letter to my mama which is a beautiful tribute to his mom for supporting him and being behind him and getting him to where he is today and pushing him to be a better person and there's some really endearing details laced into the lyrics of this track - whether it be the van that she drove the PlayStation games that she got him or just the school hearings that she showed up for the emotional tone of the song is great I like the instrumental a lot even though it is very simple the serene electric piano chords are a nice touch almost reminds me of like a old-school hip-hop throwback to LL Cool J's I need love in a way now even though there are a lot of cuts on here where twenty-one is essentially in his feelings there are some really grim tracks on this thing too like the lethal closer for L and to mention one more time the track good day whose sentiment in a way reminded me of that Ice Cube hit it was a good day except way darker and nastier and even though of course 21 savage is pretty violent on this record he does add a bit more levity to his bars for a bit of a comedic effect whether he's threatening you and your dog and your goldfish or dropping a hilarious follow-up to his viral 12 car garage line where he says he has six cars while you have a 12 car garage and now his answer on this record over here is that he got six more cars also lines on this thing like a que make your brother do the limbo make this Glock Shiggy challenge out of the window yeah there are a lot of references on this thing to shooting people gang violence drive-bys all really nasty adult cold-blooded shit he's also rapping about people betraying him snitches rats drug-dealing money women materialism materialism materialism but at least he's balancing that out a little bit more on this record over here with some personal tracks where he does seem to get a bit more emotional and introspective and it becomes clear that a lot of what he's saying on the more braggadocious tracks is you know just kind of for the hype of it generally it seems like there's more of a focus on this LP to really make the choruses pop especially on tracks like all my friends and one-point-five there's a pretty impressive mix of features on this thing too from rappers that you wouldn't necessarily expect to cross over into the land of 21 savage like Jay Cole and childish gambino and even schoolboy q Memphis legend project Pat is also on this record as well and to keep things current and relevant of course offset is on here post Malone is on here kind of paying it back for the incredible feature that 21 savage laid onto the hit song rock star young Miami of the duo city girls also appears on the track a & T her verse and delivery is quite gangsta boo inspired which I guess it should be noted pretty clearly that a lot of this record is very indebted to three 6 mafia it seems like there are more topical and conceptual tracks on here than there have been on past 21 savage projects - whether it be 21 reflecting over feelings of abandonment and mistakes that he's made on the intro cut a lot a surprisingly mushy song to kick a 21 savage record off with also love the Jay Cole feature on this thing I think it's one of his best features period one of his most meta as well not only rapping about the song that he's on being in the studio with savage his sort of mentality going into writing this verse but also other rappers out there faking their hype faking their streams there's also again a and T the raunchy stripper anthem the track Gunsmoke which is just an ode to guns guns guns guns the production generally is simple but effective nothing mind-blowing but it is colorful and it is trap flavored I like the fractured staccato notes on the track a and T it's almost kind of glitchy in a way the throwback soulful vocal samples on the opener are really beautiful - the sad little woodwind bits on the track can't live without it are also a nice touch and there's a really pretty beat switch in the middle of the track break the law that I like a lot to the word this album gets is really when 21 drops a beat or a verse or there's a feature on here that's just kind of underwhelming it's forgettable it just kind of breezes by which you know this record can to kind of dip into that territory not only because 20 months average he's still not that varied of an artist but also a great deal of this record is pretty subdued is pretty low-key some of it might just slip by you and feel like wallpaper sometimes 21s personality does get lost in the changes on this record like all my friends the sentiment and the melody and the flow of this track just kind of seems like he's riding on Drake's coattails a little bit even if he does sort of drop that funny fuck Kiki why earlier in the record the childish gambino feature on the song monster was frankly one of the most underwhelming features of the whole bunch just barely passing above little baby and gonna on here who are easily the most most most underwhelming features on the entire record as they sound just as generic and uninspired here as they do nearly everywhere else the tracks ASMR and padlock are probably two of the least definitive songs on the entire record as they're one of a handful of cuts on here that kind of lack any real topical focus because while I wouldn't say the twenty one Savage is doing too much on this record it definitely is a project that's way too bloated for somebody who's just now evolving out of being a one-trick pony yes it's it's definitely got more variety more flavor more energy than any solo 21 record so far but I still think it's gonna be a bit longer before we hear 21 savage dominate almost an hour of material and is engaging in flames from start to finish I'm glad to hear he's growing though and I guess I do agree with the sentiment of the title over here this is his best personal solo commercial work to date so there you go I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana 21 savage I am greater than I was forever 
FBrhTigkhM8,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd do you know who it is and it is time for me to go over because it is January 2019 albums that I am anticipating in 2019 these are the albums that I am looking forward to this year not all of them do I have a confirmation on but given the previous album release patterns of these artists I'm kind of hoping they drop an album this year thinking they'll drop an album this year or you know hey I just really freaking want it so this is a pretty lengthy list of all the records from artists that I would like to see in 2019 I'm looking forward to hearing and let's go let's see what's up okay to kick things off the top dawg entertainment crew a good deal of the roster at least the most important artists on that roster in my opinion it has been a while since they've all dropped an album or it's about time that they should drop an album so I'm looking forward to a new album this year hopefully from Kendrick Lamar ab-soul schoolboy q maybe another scissor record sooner rather than later and most likely an Isaiah Rashad album this year too so it could be a huge year for Top Dawg entertainment fingers crossed of course like usual Death Grips as they typically do drop at least something every year I don't know the trio to take an entire year off so looking forward to seeing how they kind of reinvent and progress their sound in 2019 whether it be through another side project a new album another EP and other steroids type megamix that sort of thing so let's see how the trio continues to surprise I and many other people online have been seeing Freddie Gibbs T's toward the sequel to his project with mad lib pinata - pinata - so it should be amazing Tame Impala has teased toward a new album this year Danny Brown has been teasing toward a new album very soon so I'm hoping that 2019 is going to be that the disgusting and gross and abrasive death metal band piss grave has a new record coming out do not look up this album cover unless you really want to see some disgusting gore hoping king gizzard does something in 2019 they absolutely should I mean I understand how they would kind of take 2018 for the most part off because they did drop so many great problems in 2017 but hoping to see another great record from King gizzard this year health has been dropping lots of singles lots of tracks with guests artists guest vocalists on them so new album from health sooner rather than later I'm hoping and could be interesting to see an entire roster of guests on that new album tool has said they're going to be dropping a new album in 2019 the thing is recorded it's getting mixed lengthy mixing process happening right now as you watch this video if it's come out before the album release probably Slipknot should have a new album coming out very soon they dropped a single last year that I thought was pretty decent so looking forward to hearing that Kanye should have at least one project dropping this year sure he and Kid Cudi have have both kind of confirmed that there will be more kids see ghosts at some point in the future but we know that yandi is dropping at some point in 2019 should have dropped last year according to Kanye but didn't end up doing that so hoping 2019 is the year we see yandi though I am not anticipating that is the album title at this point everything with Kanye on his records is subject to change between now and whatever that album drops and maybe even after it might be a bit premature to want this given how great flower boy was and how much work Tyler was putting into music with the whole Grinch movie soundtrack and stuff but I'm hoping for another Tyler the Creator album in 2019 his last one was so good would love to hear more of that mature soulful neo-soul hip hop fusion that he's been working with lately it's just such a great progression for him and I would love to hear him continue down that path or really any path that sees him embarking on some new sounds and some great songs injury Reserve has signed a record deal and they should be coming out with a new record in 2019 so really looking forward to seeing the hip hop trio blow up this year if they can come out with a great single and really kind of turn the heads of and convince so many of the doubters and people who have been kind of sleeping on their shit for a long time doo Rina saw yama record this year though many of you should know that if you're subscribed to the Fantana channel and you caught my interview with her that happened very late last year Charli XCX should have something coming out this year she has been sort of beating herself up Twitter saying I have to make an album I have to put out an album so hope she ends up doing that Grimes should have something very soon I love that single that she dropped last year a holiday Sidewinder who turned up in my comments Twitter thread asking other people with albums they were anticipating she has some connections to Alex Cameron and in his bandage she has some fun cheeky tunes so I am looking forward to seeing what she ends up doing on her latest full-length LP James Blake should have something dropping very soon I hope Flying Lotus I have no confirmation or information on that he is kind of an elusive dude but I feel like now should be about the time we hear a new Flying Lotus record you're dead was so freaking good childish gambino childish frickin Gambino had a lot of great singles last year this is America took over the airwaves took over the Internet and you should have a new album coming out very soon I mean it should be great considering how late we've been waiting for it you would think that given how big the singles were that 2018 would have been the year you know would have been the year to drop a new full-length LP but you know I feel like you can kind of get away with it because this is America was such a huge cultural touchstone of the decade that I feel like people will most definitely wait for whatever he has coming around the corner a little loosey vert the turn alert okay should be coming out very soon JPEG mafia is he gonna remain silent in 2019 it kind of coasts off the hype of veteran and do a bunch of side project or promotional stuff or will he strike while the iron is hot and drop another record sooner rather than later Vampire Weekend new album coming out soon I mean let's be honest we know those guys don't need the money so that's why they're not coming out with a new album or why they haven't come out with a new record in a while they don't need to put out an album if they don't want to so I would hope that they can kind of get it together and actually put out a pretty good record angel Olson singer-songwriter angel Olson would love to hear a new record from her her last one was so good chance the rapper a lot of people have been anticipating a first big commercial record from him I hope that happens in 2019 rihanna has been teasing toward a new full-length LP in 2019 it's been a while since we've heard a new studio album from her carly rae jepsen she had a new single drop in 28th that I thought was just okay but I'm hoping this year she can keep up that level of quality on her newest full-length LP of course I'm talking about just how great her last full-length album a motion was just would love to hear more production and more songs that are sort of as catchy and as enjoyable as the crop of tracks on their record moving on from there Frank Ocean may be I I really have no idea I'm just hoping I'm just pulling the straws here fka twigs maybe I mean I'm talking about artists here who drop an album and completely disappear off the radar they just vanish into the Bermuda Triangle and we don't know if they're here they gone are they alive are they dead we really have no no clue no idea but we're pretty sure they're breathing when they end up dropping an LP moving on from there the PC music camp should definitely have some records coming out this year that are worth listening to hopefully a new Hannah diamond record hopefully a new gf oty record girlfriend of the year record Gustavo Stein had a fantastic single last year that it's just dawning on me now that I forgot about that single in my lists it probably would have turned up somewhere but a really great single looking forward to new record from him this year J idk or just idk looking forward to a new LP from him his collaborative little EP that he dropped last year with a lot of different features on it was just alright I think he has more potential than that mostly just kind of seemed like a casual fun project to kind of network with a bunch of other rappers that are pretty good moving on from there the roots Philly rap outfit the roots I mean I know they're busy they're hugely in demand in the industry they're doing their Fallon thing all the time but goddamn it we deserve a new roots record we deserve it moving out from there hoping we hear a new clipping album this year Davi Diggs and the gang I mean daveed another guy who I know is very busy always doing stuff always appearing somewhere because he is he is a triple threat he is a rapper he is an actor he is a living God but would would love to hear him take some time on the side to you know come back to the the little obscure industrial noise hip hop trio that kind of help a lot of things take off moving out from their death metal outfit gate creeper definitely not one of the most unique death metal outfits out there but they do make some fun chunky heavy mocchi tunes that that are pretty cool and and maybe this new record will hit me hard enough where it really kind of shakes me and gets my blood pumping hoping new nails album drops at some point this year would love to hear that band just like rip across a new 20-minute record and and just fucking kick my ass run the jewels is there gonna be a new run the jewels album LP and killer Mike hoping so future a lot of people definitely anticipating a new future record this year he had a relatively quiet 2018 so hopefully that means he's gearing up for an even bigger 2019 I would love to hear Baroness follow up the purple album Mac DeMarco hoping he dropped something sooner rather than later Karen J Kalinin Alex Cameron my two favorite Australians at the moment a sky ferreira a lot of people been talking about a new sky ferreira record not not exactly sure why if there's been like some news or some rumors of that that have completely flown by me or anything but a new sky ferreira record would be interesting Blueface everybody's talking about blue face everybody's thinking about blue face will you have an album a mixtape of something out sooner rather than later I'm hoping so because he does have kind of a really interesting quirky weird almost outside a rap style that I think is being a tad misinterpreted at the moment Playboy cardi who I know who's got to drop something in 2019 I mean dial it was great and and I would hate for him to kind of wear out his welcome by doing the same shit over and over and over and over but I I need a new playboy cardi record in 2019 where he just continues experimenting and adventuring and just like lodging his self in my brain with those infectious little ad-libs and speaking of which will will there be a new Scheck Wes record this year I mean I know mud boy was pretty good and he had some huge hits last year but would love to hear him grow a little bit more this year on a new record or a tape or something moving on from there Moses summoning who had a kick EP last year want to hear him come out with an even bigger album this year tiara whack whoo I mean she's still kind of breaking through I love what she's done so far but I have no idea what kind of artist she's going to be going forward will she gravitate more toward visual projects audio projects something else entirely will she drop a new album of songs that are longer will she try to do another 1520 minute project where everything's a minute each and it comes packaged with another video another short film another whatever I feel like we're still kind of getting a grip of who Tara whack is and I'm hoping that she doesn't remain silent in 2019 and she surprises us once again with another thing whatever it may be always would love to hear the dream pop band come back with another infectious collection of tracks will Arielle pink do something in 2019 I hope so Brock Hampton are still with RCA Records and they have so far dropped one album of what I think is is a multi-album deal with the label so I am hoping they follow that up this year they most likely will I mean they dropped three records in one year back in 2017 so I don't know I won't get another album in in 2019 going from there we have Billy woods who I'm hoping drops something soon yet an excellent collaborative release with a lucid under the Armand Hammer name last year so I'm hoping he does something solo because typically he'll sort of come off a duo record with a solo record and and you know kind of alternate like that so I'm hoping we hear something from him this year thinking of sort of that underground New York scene hoping uncommon NASA does something soon as well Rhapsody - I'm hoping Rhapsody comes through with a new record soon because her last album is very soulful very tasteful a lot of thoughtful and beautiful tracks on that album and she's really starting to convince a lot of people who might have previously thought hers as being a little underwhelming or bland certainly one of the more promising conscious rappers out there at the moment Sharon Van Etten has a new record coming out very very very soon and I will be reviewing it just around the corner so I mean I'm anticipating it's almost here so I'm about to pop tobacco and Aesop Rock have a collaborative record very soon these are both artists that both have something coming out very very very soon Fleet Foxes I'm hoping you have something coming out would love to hear Robyn pick NOLA and the gang back at it writing those heavenly Falk ballads very very very soon dren he had some great tracks in a good EP last year he had that great debut album the dude is such a fun and a unique artist with an amazing personality and I am praying to Jesus literally to Jesus that we see a dram record in 2019 Weezer has the black album coming out soon so looking forward to that the band crying who people seem to have forgotten about a little bit I hope comes back with the mathematic progressive Thuy and Cynthia Moe pop music that I feel like they do so well there's such a unique group and I feel like they're so freakin underrated and and cattle decapitation a death metal outfit cattle decapitation I would love to hear come back with a new album in 2019 and look that's just kind of the tip of the iceberg of what we are going to see this year surely of what I hope we're going to see this year and I'm gonna leave it at that you can comment down below if you guys would like to and sort of drop in any records that you're looking forward to that I've listed or even that I haven't listed share with each other communicate with each other doesn't all have to be memes down there you know you can

-jI1ofec02A,system system up it down toxicity system of a down classic review let's go this is the sophomore full-length album from California alternative metal outfit System of a Down the breakthrough record that would solidify the band as an essential figure in modern metal with singles like aerials and toxicity and chop-suey toxicity was also the band's first platinum album and they would go on to sell 40 million copies worldwide of albums throughout their discography and as much as it was a part of my musical diet when I was a teenager metal music in the late 90s and early 2000s it was kind of a shit show of course anyone can retrospectively go back and cherry-pick any number of great underground releases from that time period that have withstood the test of time from opeth or Boris or Mastodon or sleep but it wouldn't really give you an accurate portrait of the metal landscape at the time because all that thrash metal and groove metal it would eventually give way to some really tacky hybrids of rap and rock as well as new metal now of course there were some great groups that crafted their own sound and image during this time period your Marilyn Manson's and your rage against the machines corn and Deftones and tool and Slipknot but there was still so much crap to cut through especially with each new group sounding more cookie cutter than the next putting more and more of an emphasis on either a larger visual gimmick or just trying to sell the small goth image but System of a Down was a much-needed breath of fresh air in an ocean of cringy rap verses and down-tuned to note riffs and even though the band did take a lot from the prevailing grooves and guitar tones that were popular in metal at the time they built their own little unique sound into it over the course of several great records and what made these albums stand out was their bold personality pure absurdity potent rage and infectious hooks also the band's sense of melody was much greater than a lot of their other metal contemporaries they were also not shy about working their Armenian roots into their music as well through the percussion the melodies through the harmonies or even the instrumentation on a given track and I would argue that influence only got stronger as the band progressed their lyrics were political for a metal band at the time - and this dates back to their early demos and debut album while the ridiculous sugar and uncompromising ly dark spiders served as functional singles for their first record that kind of drew listeners into the cults of system of a down deeper cuts like sweet pea and war weren't hesitant to dive into topics like American imperialism and religious fanaticism and the band wasn't just writing music that was socially aware but socially ahead of the curve toxicities official release state was just seven days before the September 11th attacks in 2001 but the lyrics on this album were written as if they had the hindsight of the next seven years of authoritarian garbage that the Bush administration would serve up and it's kind of depressing to admit that this album's themes of pollution and addiction and private prisons and endless war they're only more relevant now it would be an oversight on my part if I also didn't mention that frontman Serj Tankian is one of the most enigmatic and expressive front men in metal ever he's really the kind of singer that you only get one time in a genre and one time only as his son vocals on systems records were not only incredibly compelling but showed a ton of volume and range I really love his very nasally Tambor sits up very high in the throat but has such a strong sense of pitch meanwhile his dynamic and cartoony shrieks and growls and screams remain unmatched in metal in their energy and character meanwhile guitarist and songwriter Daron Malakian wasn't shy about bringing his own vocals into the fold more and more as the band grew in popularity and this brought another interesting dynamic to their sound especially on toxicity and on toxicity you have all these elements coming together and totaling into this incredibly raw and heavy and varied sound all of its being filtered through the production lens of the legendary Rick Rubin who had also helped develop the sound of bands that inspired System of a Down like Slayer now toxicity is a pretty tight listen even for its 15 tracks because the band had the talent to allow themselves to write these fantastic anthems and mystical ballads but also these blistering two minute on slots like the bizarre jet pilot a track that even the band has admitted doesn't really mean all that much and then there's the very hilarious tribute to group sex on the song bounce but between the lines of eccentricity and weirdness that are placed throughout this record toxicity does deliver some very significant songs and statements like on the opening track prison song which is most likely the most effective example of straight sloganeering in a rock song but actually managing to keep it entertaining even in the midst of surge shouting crime statistics and corruption headlines in the middle of verses and choruses oddly it adds to the songs incredible sense of fear and tension meanwhile the riffs on this track are hard as friggin cement then there's the harrowing deer dance which is all about police brutality especially toward peaceful protesters this track eventually progresses into imagery of kids getting pushed around with automatic rifles and even though the message and the aggression of this track are pretty bold the most breathtaking part of it is actually the super mellow bridge where you get these beautiful rustic guitar melodies toxicity also features a greater sense of spirituality especially on tracks forest and science which directly reference the environment being destroyed at the hands of human progress and technological advancement themes that are also expressed on a song atwa which stands for air trees water and animals the track is like a forlorn send-off to all the great things that the planet has given us that we're slowly killing off however the songs message and title takes from the ecological credo of Charles Manson and I mean I could think of better figures who have an environmental message that you might want a reference but as far as I can tell Darren does sort of separate Charles Manson's heinous actions from what he thinks about the the livelihood of our planet I guess there are quite a few cuts on this record that dive into themes of control as well whether it be more widespread and nefarious strains of it on the song shimmy which features some very odd and repetitive and simplistic lyrics but it can be gleaned pretty easily that the track is about conforming as a result of indoctrination via a fake education or even control as the result of an a or dependency on a substance like on the song needles where the band likens being addicted to having a mind controlling tapeworm stuck in you that you need to pull out of your ass oh the tapeworm out of your addiction is also in the spotlight on the most popular song on this record chop suey which is kind of lost in translation in the songs fragmented narrative as well as the band not being able to name the song after the self-righteous suicide reference in the hook and instead having to call it chop suey if you listen very closely at the start of the song you can hear we're rolling suicide making reference to the original title of the track but this song essentially boils down to a conflict between two people one person who obviously has a problem and they're doing everything that they can to hide it and just keep it under wraps either that or just not deal with it and meanwhile we have an antagonist who's trying to expose this problem take this person to task over this problem this judgment and this pressure eventually drives this person to suicide that almost kind of turns into like a religious experience over the bridge where they're basically crying out to God why have you forsaken me it's pretty heavy stuff and much heavier than I think a lot of the young listeners this song appealed to appreciate it at the time especially since the track has been kind of covered and replayed so much that it's lost all meaning then there's the gorgeous and haunting title track which culminates a lot of the album's ideas on losing touch with nature and spirituality and humanity essentially getting sucked into this modern overprescribed society there's also a mental health angle to it as well meanwhile the closing track ariel's reaches an even larger emotional and instrumental climax with tons of soaring vocal harmonies and strings and grand guitar chords the lyrics on this track exploring themes of oneness as well as isolation and putting up walls basically needing to throw out small mindedness and egoism to attain real freedom eerily odd how much this record kind of goes against the grain of a lot of the prevailing politics of the past few years though I guess back then things weren't really all that different the only thing that's changed now is the factor has been multiplied pretty greatly overall toxicity is animées album a metal record that I don't not love a single song on it is a beautiful and also a brutal record too it's ridiculous yet also deadly serious it's nuanced and complex and then also in another breath it's just grossly aggressive and primal and that's because this record like many great ones that came before it has a fantastic duality to it arguably one of the best metal records of the past twenty years one of the best metal albums alternative metal has ever brought to the table and certainly a masterpiece from a band whose prime music making years were cut kind of short transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

3d1rxJTIJX8,burial Oh true classic review burial untrue let's go this is the second full-length album from william emanuel bevin AKA burial an electronic music producer based in the UK who dropped this album back in 2007 through hyper dub records helping ignite a quiet revolution in the dance scene there that would become an international sensation the influential lineage of burials music goes back to the days of Garage house in New York City decades and decades ago where a smoother strain of the house music coming from Chicago at the time began to take hold this somewhat different blend of house music coming from NYC at the time was marked by more disco rhythms luxurious pianos and synthesizers as well as lead vocals that were more inspired by soul music and even gospel notable singles include early eighties pioneers like the peach boys with song don't make me wait a track that had a bit more of an electro influence too as well as more experimental cuts like Arthur Russell's let's go swimming then we have some of the prime hit makers of the late 80s and early 90s tracks that charted both in the UK and the u.s. at the time like a divas House flip of the soul smash PSAT or Chicago Outfit ten cities that's the way love is also the crystal water song gypsy woman laddie laddie over in the UK they started to develop their own strains of the stuff in the 90s and 2000's resulting in some really weird and wild variations fused with elements of other electronic genres R&B even hip hop artists like Roy Davis jr. and the streets and Zedd bias and MJ Cole this new umbrella of UK garage encompassed a lot of different sounds and styles one of the most surprising of which is 2-step which featured these kind of shuffling boxy rhythms that gave the sound of really interesting vibe all of this artistic evolution then falls at the feet of burial in the 2000s but his ideas and intentions are far different than that of any UK garage producer up until that point William came through with a pretty distinct sound right away swapping out garages typically jaunty and jumpy pianos or ambien oceans of synth swapping out live singers and guest singers for vocal samples from other popular tracks like uh sure's how do I say or see Aras promise or Beyonce's cover of Victoria Beckham's resentment just to name a few samples on this very large record and the vocal snippets on this thing are usually pretty short pretty tight treated to a lot of pitch shifting and effects the vocals on this thing are also laid out with tons of reverb and echoes various manipulations to make them sound distant and ghostly and disembodied but still really beautiful and haunting how burial treats voice on this album is easily the most stunning thing about it and this formula for most of the tracks on this record pretty much leaves the groove on the shoulders of the beat and the beat alone and those beats tend to run pretty busy on this record and they're always subtly shifting - they have a really strong sense of rhythm and direction to counteract the usually washed out layers of subterranean bass and vocals and since that sit on top essentially what burial is presenting on this album is like the most abstract take on a variety of different electronic and dance music styles that were prevalent at the time whether it be some dubstep or two-step or R&B or UK house and garage so not only are all of these ideas coming together but they're also being filtered through this IDM and ambient techno lens you could actually argue a lot of what burial is doing on this LP does kind of mirror what Richard D James was doing back in the 90s grabbing a variety of formulas and ideas from typically aggressive and in-your-face forms of electronic dance music and then softening them and stretching them out and giving them tons of space and mood and atmosphere so they're more fitting for like a headphone listen the ideas that William presented on this record were so left-field for the UK garage scene that they were worthy of their own genre title future garage and this combination of ideas and sounds is essentially what burial would work to perfect over a few he pees a debut album really until he ended up releasing untrue in 2007 several more lengthy EPS where he would continue to experiment and evolve what this sound would drop after this record but if you're interested in my thoughts on those I have done reviews on them but untrue is the record this for was about in my opinion a defining moment for electronic music across the board specifically in the UK and artistic aha moment a moment where a great fresh idea makes a huge splash among fans and critics and even a sea of labels and artists who would drop Brigade after Brigade of future garage records for like the next five to six years this record really was a phenomenon that wowed fans across the music spectrum with its evocative atmospheres with its hypnotic rhythms the album generally sounds like blissfully raving into the night on an endless loop with tears in your eyes the track listing features 13 songs and interludes it is 50 minutes of material and burial essentially whips up a perfect mix of variations on these simple but effective themes that I was talking about him working with earlier the flow of this record is parsed out really well with an intro some more ambient interludes to kind of give you a very relaxing breather but even though some great highlights could be separated out from this album for the most part a lot of the tracks just kind of seamlessly bleed into one another into this gorgeous orgasmic experience that you just don't really want to end and I suppose it doesn't have to as long as you keep repeating it and even though untrue does have some washy and blissful and ambient qualities to it there are some bold and interesting sounds to be heard on this record that are worth paying attention to this is far from a wallpaper record if you wanted to you could eat up every crackly and tingly and industrial sound haunting the mix on the song ghost hardware or even the title track there's also the very quiet and subtly whooping bass notes on the song itched head plate which match really well with the vaguely glitchy manipulations that burial makes on some of the vocal samples on this cut if you want to you could get lost in the endless and infinite echoes laid onto the vocal samples on near dark which also features some oddly appropriate sounds of a what sounds like bullet shell casings hitting the ground I also love the thumping drums on raiveer which is probably the most danceable song in the entire record also feature some kind of awkward and plucky thumb piano notes in the second half are an odd addition but still bring some flavor and for soft as it is the slowly shifting droney synth notes as well as the vocal samples that ring out like whale calls on the song endorphin or on the edge of your seat gorgeous meanwhile some of the other interludes on this thing vibe kind of like a darkened version of New Age music or something like if new-age music were goth I could go over every single little sonic detail laid into this record and believe me there are a lot but describing every single bit of that is not as important as the viscerally beautiful experience that all of these songs coming together creates the mental weightlessness that this album can deliver to the listener when listening to it in kind of close quarters or in just like a very isolated setting as the tracks on this album not only sound like clouds pillowy clouds but also concrete it's like I'm experiencing the eternal bliss and numbness of an afterlife but it's also kind of struck down by eternal grey skies the key to this album's widespread popularity is the ideas and the beauty of this record are so great and Universal really to the point where knowledge of the ideas and genres that burial is working with on this record it's not entirely necessary to just enjoy what's going on here I may even argue that explaining what makes this record so great isn't entirely necessary either as you should really just go listen to it transition have you given this record listen did you love it did you hate it I hope you freakin love it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next

PAkj5yAUFno,cannibal ox the cold classic review cannibal ox let's go cannibal ox is a music duo consisting of Harlem rappers Wardle mega and vast air and for a while this 2001 album the cold vein had been their only album until they followed it up in 2015 with a record whose reception was less than lukewarm I'm not gonna dwell on that now but the cold vein though it was a watershed moment for hip hop on the East Coast in the 2000s the next logical step for Big Apple rappers who sought to keep the genre lyrical and gritty but also evolve past the basic boom bap sounds that defined the 90s and even though up until this point hip hop has always had an underground scene of some sort because the underground is where the genre started the 2000s is really where you start to see this cellular division of what hit the mainstream in hip hop and what did the sounds and lyrical styles that were more popular on both sides of the mainstream aisle were different the artists that were popular on both sides of the mainstream aisle were different though many tried to transition typically on the underground side of things you found a lot of more obscure and conscious and abstract strains of hip-hop and at the time this more left-field scene was fostered across the country through a network of groups and labels but in the case of New York and specifically cannibal ox it was definitive Jux records the cold vein over here was the labels first full-length album release which opened the floodgates for numerous artists whose own unique takes on this abstract style is still felt to this day people like Aesop Rock and LP rjd2 cage as well as Murs Def Jux did end up closing shop in 2010 but not before going on to inspire great works from other artists who were connected to the scene people like uncommon NASA as well as Billy Woods and I definitely want to mention some of the newer names that have come along and progressed this new york sound in their own way that i don't think they would be here if not for the efforts of Def Jux the now-defunct rack Lucid who was also teamed up with Billy woods and their own duo named Armand Hammer guys like coswell I see these guys as sort of kind of being a part of the same lineage even though I think a lot of the experimentation and inspiration artists take from music these days is more internet-based than it is localized within whatever region they're living in but at the time of the release of the cold vein the sound that vast air and Wardle mega were creating on this record it was localized and it was specific as there aren't really any rappers I can think of who dropped significant records around this time who sounded anything like them in its most comparable moments the cold vein kind of sounds like a wu-tang cypher if the MC roster was limited to rappers who had philosophy physics double majors on top of that the production from LP on this record sounds unlike anything else that was released at the time the closest thing I can think of are some of the beats he produced with company flow a few years earlier but even some of those feel pretty distant from the glistening and grimy sounds el producto formulates on the cold vein like the ghostly horn hits in space age since on the song iron galaxy kind of sounds like something out of a science lab or on the song ox out the cage which features these crashing chords ringing out into oblivion these dramatic synths wells that are like something out of a sci-fi movie soundtrack a b-boys alphas instrumental kind of resembles a RZA be at some points with it's chunky rhythms and it's fractured pianos but the vibe is kind of flipped with some other weird piano passages effects and delays it's like wu-tang on a spirit journey the instrumental on painkillers pulling from a very similar place of inspiration but with the eerie samples and theatrical organs I feel like I'm trapped inside of an old-school horror movie or like a turn-of-the-century mental hospital where I'm being treated to electroshock therapy the be on raspberry Fields is like classic LP production the stuttering kick drums and croaking synth bass lines that sound like a freaking Mecca toad and not to mention all the heaping helpings of sound effects laced throughout the track too even though this record came out in 2001 the beats still contain the lethal qualities of hardcore hip hop's golden age but it's just taken to another dementia sometimes achieving like a beautiful mystical quality like on the song stress rap the instrumentals are honestly what is aged best about this album in the almost 20 years it's been since its release this record also still stands as one of the best executions of a Jaco Pastorius sample I think I've ever heard on a hip hop record - in my opinion the lyrical performances from vast air and vorel mega are equally impressive but I think they've aged somewhat awkwardly and not just because these days it seems like there's less of an emphasis in ever in hip hop on lyricism but also through the 2000s albums like this attracted these somewhat obnoxious leagues of backpack rap fans that needlessly poo-pooed the artistic merits of a rapper like jay-z because he just had a braggadocious style and was seeing all of this commercial success but keep in mind this sentiment is not specific to this scene or even this point in hip-hop history as it's been voiced at numerous times whenever the genre sort of seems to get a popularity boost EPM Dee's the crossover comes to mind but before the internet came in and erased many of raps and other genres artistic boundaries many of us didn't really have the foresight to understand that a record like the cold vein as well as jay-z's The Blueprint could live in artistic harmony so there is definitely a noticeable air of pretension to a lot of what cannibal ox does on this album but it's mostly in the spirit of competition and vast air and Wartell Megas respective styles were pretty unique for the time so I think they had reason to believe that their lyrical miracles were something special especially when vast air says we in the catacomb nappy head had never used a comb and built with the forces that blew away Dorothy's home I grabbed the mic like are you experienced but I don't play guitar I play my cadence and if I exhaled arguments only to hold my breath I would die and I ain't talking hair color I'm talking about the reality with my mother's eye water the transition from dying to hair dye than to my mother's eye water AKA tears is kind of weird it's one of many verses and passages on this record that stick out for there odd references and word choice but most of what happens on the cold vein lyrically speaking is pretty dark esoteric and occasionally nerdy whether the duo is battling it out with aliens like on this bit right here or dropping poetic nods to stuff like children's stories or video games not to mention vast air slightly unorthodox delivery style flows kind of like he's part rapping but also part ranting he can be pretty funny too like on the song raspberry fields like in this bit right here where at the end of it he kind of makes fun of himself for using the same word twice in his verse oh my god and then immediately after which he proceeds to use that whole same section of that verse over again in the same track almost like cannibal ox were annoyed with whatever standards people would be throwing on to their own music because the duo wasn't insisting that what they were doing was like I don't know some kind of like golden rule to live by err that other people couldn't make their own styles of hip-hop music because records like this are very much about breaking the rules not necessarily just holding up traditions in contrast with vast air voidable mega vibes more like a quintessential New York rapper he's got that incredibly slick New York flow that actually could have fit on any number of jay-z songs had he been invited for a feature for example the song straight off the Dee I see dick effortlessly smooth especially on the hook which is incredibly catchy despite the fact that it's so frigging wordy and despite some of the beats on this thing being weird as hell it does not really seem to trip up for dole Megas incredible sense of rhythm especially on the song vein which has one of the most unlikely grooves of any hip-hop song in the 2000s and lyrically even though his stuff is pretty thoughtful it's never really doing too much like many other verses or even features on this record are like Alaska on the song Adam where he says a lot of cats pop I pop apocalypse topple propaganda force-fed to the populace my thoughts run the gamut from outstanding to preposterous on top of this I move posterior z' from impoverished to posh areas which is wow you're really trying to work those lyrical angles and you know what I do dig it I do dig it or even vaster on this passage of lyrics right here where at the end of it he kind of ends off with this mocking laugh kind of like he's aware of how hard he is trying with all this stuff again some bits of this record can be a little much can be kind of over the top but still this is a New York hip-hop album which very much contains the grit and guts that rappers from this city are known for because there's plenty of deadly and murderous lyricism that can be read between these lines but then again there's enough emotional dynamics to this record for cannibal ox to come out with songs like f-word which is essentially about romance and trying to get out of the friendzone with your opposite sex or relationships or on the song stress rap where they lyrically go off on the misery that a lot of people stuck in the NYC rat race feel the song painkiller is pretty focused on themes of escaping pain and addiction and depression meanwhile there are numerous very smart lyrical references to birds and humanity on the song pigeon these themes also carry over onto the final bonus track screaming Phoenix - which ends up being kind of a cool transition point for the duo from a pigeon to a Phoenix the features on this record generally add a lot of flavor to it - like life long and searay on the track battle for ass guard which is easily one of the most badass songs in this entire record the appearances that LP makes on this record are not only really great but also showed just how consistent he's been over the years from the opening lines of ox out the cage to whatever he's recorded most recently with run the jewels LP style is distinct and instantly recognizable the cold vein is also a pretty dense record - at 15 tracks topping seventy minutes of material so not only are a lot of the hip-hop songs on this record just throwing a lot at you they're very layered they're very again experimental and abstract but vast air and vertol mega and LP give you a lot to sift through and it's a lot of great stuff - with adventurous instrumentals and forward-thinking lyrics and great performances and not a lull in the entire tracklist assuming though that it's your cup of tea those are pretty much my thoughts on the cold vein classic hip hop record great hip hop record one of the best of the 2000s painfully sad and unfortunate that this album was essentially the start also the end for cannibal ox in the same breath and the scene that this record came from was kind of short-lived - but still it's amazing that it happened it's amazing that all of the records and the back catalogue and the artistic fingerprints are there the influential ripples are still moving to this day and hopefully more artists take from the experimental and adventurous cues this album puts forward into the future transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which an I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here

P_VJMHhM6v0,sleater-kinney the woods the woods hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd classic review let's go the woods was the seventh full-length album from american rock trio sleater-kinney originally this thing came out in 2005 via Sub Pop Records for years many thought it to be the band's swan song record until they had basically reformed and dropped a follow-up album ten years later the album no cities to love a pretty decent no BS indie rock record but back in 2005 the woods seemed like an epic moment of finality for a band that didn't really give a strong reason for hanging up their instruments the next year and over the 10 plus years the band had been performing and dropping albums up to that point sleater-kinney had become a pretty essential part of the burgeoning American indie rock scene which was then just starting to see some major commercial success and a big part of what made Slater can you stick out from other bands cut from the indie cloth was they're gutsy unapologetic attitude and sound that was hugely inspired by many riot girl bands that came before them they're very treble e and crunchy dual guitar no bass sound certainly contributed to that as well as front women Carrie Brownstein and Korn Tucker both taking on vocal duties and both brandishing the shouty sharp and in-your-face singing voices that rang like sirens even though for many people the aggressive and also sour quality of can you sound maybe initially off-putting like many other great rock bands they push you out of your comfort zone and they're abrasive demeanor eventually ends up being what pulls you in some of the band's past records are more palatable than others but most of them are pretty no-frills especially their self-titled debut and dig me out but the woods was a much different animal for Slater Kenny it was much noisier and gnarlier it's not a sludge metal album or anything like that but Kerry and Korn and Janet on this record we're working with more layers and distortion and effects then I think they have on any previous record all of the sounds the band was pursuing on this record was a pretty bold move away from the raw and organic and very dry style that had been their calling card up until that point even all the way up to more recent is on the Kill Rock Stars label like all hands on the bad one and one beat now most likely this was due in part to switching producers on the woods over here to dave friedman known for his work with the Flaming Lips with Mogwai Sparklehorse too as well as Mercury Rev who he also played bass for point is that these are artists that aren't exactly known for keeping their sounds simple and making this change did create an interesting result in slater kenny being able to maintain this organic raw performance style while still creating a pretty varied and dynamic sound the drums on this thing are pretty heavy and booming the guitar certainly have more separation in that some of them were EQ to have way more bass so they would kind of suffice for a bass part in a given track and the woods wasn't just a change in the way that sleater-kinney was recorded though because certainly on this record they were writing and performing with more ambition than ever - and on occasion with these songs kind of looking to the Past for inspiration the song what's mine is yours is like a tart piece of stomp rock everything about the track the riffing the pacing it feels really old-school almost like a classic rock song or something all of it except for the very brash and abrasive attitude as well as the mirror shattering vocals there's even something about some of the lyrical phrasing on this track that feels like it's been lifted straight out of an old blues song someone's in the kitchen cooking hearts of oats though the songs steep air sounds like an enraged and kind of demented take on the dramatic hardrock forged by bands like Led Zeppelin the following track let's call it love seems to pull from that same era of inspiration but it's an 11-minute Monster nowhere near as catchy or brief as a lot of the other songs on here the track is really an edge of your seat thrill ride with wailing guitar leads and exploding drums psychedelic effects blaring away in both channels never before his sleater-kinney sounded so simultaneously lost in the moment but also crushing this track also transitions pretty seamlessly into the closing cut night light which is kind of a calm after the storm but is still mired by a lot of these feelings of moodiness and tension that carry out through much of the woods it's undoubtedly an angry album but I don't think it points its anger in the same way that most pissed-off albums do at some kind of faraway point or effigy or idea in the case of the woods sounds like existing as a band and maybe even just recording this album itself is what's pissing the band off either that or carry Korn and Jana have essentially said to themselves what over the years we haven't been loud enough and in-your-face enough and bold enough so it's like for themselves they're raising the bar and then rocketing over it so to take it back to the start of the cell P the Fox there is not a volume you can play this track at where it does not sound deafeningly loud Janet's drums pop like gunshot scary and corns guitars roar like heavy machinery the lead vocals are wailing harder than ever and the heavier passages on this cut contrasts nicely with these woozi guitar chords set against this kind of ominous story of a nefarious fox breaking a naive Ducks heart it's like a bitter twist story romantic allegory made out of a kid's story the song wilderness almost grooves as if it's an old-school post-punk throwback with somewhat weird dance be in these very well defined staccato guitar notes and phrasings meanwhile the lyrics of the song tell a story of a couple trying to get on with their lives move on to the next chapter but their love for each other is kind of dissolving before their very eyes and neither come out looking all that good especially with lyrics like a two-headed brat tied to the other for life I also love the song rollercoaster for it's equally peppy guitar licks one of the only tracks on this entire LP I would dare call cute the lyrics on this one for me read like they're coming out of a place of pure lust and infatuation driving someone into a relationship with somebody that they eventually just get bored of like it was just a bad idea to begin with meanwhile the song itself sounds like you're stuck on a carnival ride when it suddenly gets super booming and distorted in the middle third between all the noise on this track and the whoo background vocals it sounds like a waves album before a waves album even existed kind of like Sleater Kenny was there first to the Lofa indie craze of the late 2000s the song jumpers we're quiet and introspective than a lot of other songs on this record but no less tense and hard-hitting in the grander scheme of things the song features these chilling in unison lead vocals our protagonist in the song is wanting to commit suicide because of this really lonely and isolated city life that she leads I legitimately find the end of this track to be pretty frightening meanwhile the song modern girl is a pretty tone down simple raw Velvet Underground ish ballad with very twangy and playing guitars very rudimentary accompaniment there's a simple Beauty to it that I love a lot and believe me at this middle point of the record this breather is very much needed the song entertain is easily one of the catchiest songs the band has ever written it's also a pretty interesting critique of commercial entertainment and the retro trends and rock music at the time it's kind of funny the band was complaining about this in the 2000s because I wonder what they would think about it today especially with lyrics like you come around looking 1984 you're such a bore in 1984 nostalgia you're using it like a whore it's better than before it's better than before it's also kind of curious considering there are parts of this album that feel like a little bit of a throwback though I would argue sleater-kinney does a good job of updating these ideas and sounds though there's definitely an intentionally indecisive push and pull to some of the lyrics of this track go away don't go away look away no please don't look away also some of the pre-chorus sections on this track as well as the whoa-whoa background vocals feels like something straight out of like a 70s rebellious punk song but as scattershot as the point of this song maybe I do think sleater-kinney comes through with some strong ideas especially in regards to making safe are making safe music conformity buying into whatever lie commercial entertainment is often trying to sell you there's also a really strong sentiment of rejection and opting out being voiced on this track that I think may have also driven the band to their ultimate decision to go on hiatus for as long as they did a hiatus that I'm definitely glad ended which i think is a pretty good closing sentiment to round the serve you up on so all in all in my opinion the woods one of the better rock albums of the 2000s regardless of sub-genre not a single song and this thing that I'm not impressed by not a single element of it that I don't think is incredibly bold to some degree whether it be the vocal delivery the textures the production the performances some of the topics the personality especially the volume and I love how the band was essentially able to evolve so quickly and creatively on the cell P challenge themselves challenge their listeners and create a really well-written album that is a crossroads of many different styles of underground rock whether we're talking about indie rock and punk rock or garage and psych stuff or noise rock totally badass record period one of the most essential rock albums of the 2000s and we're gonna leave it at that those are my thoughts hopefully you've checked this album out as well if you have not please do transition have you given the woods a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which an I review next hit the leg if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the

fexnCtc5_BI,the Postal Service give up hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of this postal service album give up let's go this is the first and only album from Jimmy Tamburello and mr. Ben Gibbard as a duo the Postal Service this is a landmark record from two figures that would take the indie world by storm in the middle Ott's getting the ball rolling on a tidal wave of indie Tonica music that would stay a pretty essential part of the scene ever since and not to over credit Jimmy and Ben on this one because slipping electronics into the typically guitar centric sounds of indie was already a thing at the time of the release of this album thanks to acts like broadcast or stereo lab or even Jimmy tamarillos previous work but the release of this LP was a phenomenon that was like none other at the time I mean it was certainly enough to convince Conor Oberst that he could do an electronic record I should also note that give-up is just one of only two albums to go platinum status in the Sub Pop Records catalog with the lead single from this thing such great heights reaching gold and seeing a handful of major advertisement placements to keep in mind that this was all happening during a time when these overnight sensations exploding out of the music underground had kind of come and gone with the grunge era in the early and mid 2000s between major music publications and radio and television the industry had pretty well regulated what was relevant and what wasn't between post grunge garbage and dance pop divas and new metals final hours as well as hip hop's bling era being in full swing there weren't a lot of spaces in the mainstream for alternative voices even with the explosion of emo and pop punk rocking against bush don't what a bit America today yeah musically speaking if you wanted to find something underground or even keep your finger on the pulse of something as commonplace as jazz in the 2000s you kind of needed to go out of your way to find out about it either at an actual place like a performance or a club or a record store or through what little online sources there were like peer-to-peer music sharing services or music journalism upstarts like pitchfork media or obscure music forums and yes even though in the 2000s the internet was in fact a thing the closest thing everyone had to a large-scale social media and music streaming service at the time was MySpace the internet was there but it wasn't yet at a place where it was creating these large-scale cultural phenomenons on the level of a nod future so at that time it was kind of surprising to see bands like Modest Mouse and Death Cab for Cutie as well as The Decemberists landing these major label music deals all of which I could go on about forever but that's just kind of a little bit of taste of the context at the time that contributed to why this record stood out in the way that it did despite how great this record is how popular it is as well it doesn't really seem like that much on the surface as it is a pretty straightforward collection of 10 tracks rounding out at 44 minutes and all the tracks on this thing given the previous output of Ben Gibbard with Death Cab for Cutie as well as Jimmy's work especially under the name den tell these songs are essentially a perfect marriage of their respective styles not only in that they complement each other really well but they also create something really special together the beats on this thing generally are very beautiful they are texture rich they're subtly glitchy in many ways they're not too unlike a very heady spacious piece of 90s IDM but they also sweetly groove along like a nice piece of synth pop too and given the indie angle of this record as well a lot of the songs on here are quite quaint there's also something very calculated about the instrumentals on this record to constantly veering between desolate dystopia and blissful utopia in such a way where it blurs the lines between the two I love the rudimentary forlorn intro of the track the district sleeps alone tonight the songs a venture will build up into a very peppy finish is excellent the subtle touches of background vocals and strings along the way are quite nice there's also the idyllic sleeping in which is a very gentle and beautiful electro acoustic mix I especially love how the kind of nimble synth bass line on this track mixes with the washy wall of acoustic guitars that kind of envelops the track at the very finish the lullaby chorus on this track is fantastic don't wake me I plan on sleeping and it feels like I've been handed the nicest sweetest warmest snuggly a sweater ever and I'm wearing it but I'm you know basically living through nuclear winter so you know the serene instrumental on the track recycled air feels like I've been transported into a brave new technic recei where feelings have been rendered completely obsolete outside of the very low baseline level of ennui due to the prolonged emotional numbness then there's the intense and breakbeat heavy closure natural anthem easily the most cacophonous song in the entire record hitting a point where these looped wailing melodies are laced into a wall of very fast distorted clipping percussion this is contrasted by this place as a prison easily the simplest and most minimal song in the entire record the sound of this track really lives up to the title as the track does sound pretty desolate does sound pretty lonely features very dusty percussion some rough sounding bass notes and synthesizers that are cold and smooth like iron bars the production on this thing generally is just straight excellent there's plenty of emotional and sonic variety across the record while also sticking pretty boldly to a unique and sharp concept many of the beats on this thing are pretty detailed too featuring some tasteful instrumental switch ups the most repetitive track on this thing is most likely such great heights but that song kind of gets away with it by virtue of being the most irresistible catchy track on the entire record the rest of give ups appeal I think boils down to Ben Gibbard singing songwriting in lyrics when it comes to indie frontmen Ben has never really been one of my favorites however I absolutely love his singing on this album it's just something about the very boyish quality of Ben's voice and the very even style in which he sings that just fits perfectly in the bittersweet sterility of songs like we will become silhouettes and brand-new colony and Jimi Tamburello nods to futurism and utopia and the instrumentals that he creates are also mirrored in been singing and lyrics to mention the song we will become silhouettes again the lyrics on this track are loaded with references to like prepping for the apocalypse filtered water cans of food I'm not coming out till this is all over the air outside is unbury the bull if we breathe it it'll make us explode all of which is really just an allegory for a fight in a relationship or just a really toxic nasty patch in a relationship that Ben can't seem to manage can't seem to get through so he's kind of avoiding all of it till it's done and this mix of themes also holds true for many other tracks on this album Ben seems to constantly be working on this sliding scale between dysfunctional relationships and total apocalypse like again on the song brand new colony where Ben's lyrics referenced this love that he's singing about starting anew in a different setting where it can kind of flourish and this starting anew is represented in a way where it's almost like starting a brand new world or again a brand new colony the song sleeping and makes reference to global warming and environmental destruction but also the global populace is ignorant sorry I guess lack of understanding of which also the JFK assassination that too and the song recycled air even though it may just be about one's fear of flying Ben's anxious and poetic portrayal of this experience there is something about it that fits in really snugly with everything else on the record and even though there are some tracks on this thing that are very obviously just about love and not much else Ben and Jimmy do actually have some pretty refreshing approaches to that whether it be on the very beautiful and touching such great heights a song that very much embodies the euphoric high and the eerie feeling of serendipity when you're in a loving relationship that just works meanwhile the song nothing better features a duet with singer Jen wood of the band tattletale he's in character she's in character and she's essentially playing opposite to the delusions Ben is expressing on this song about whatever relationship they had still existing and flourishing into the future she kind of reality checks his obsessive outlook where he's imagining him and her growing old together and being unable to let go of what is essentially lost is a theme that recurs on this record quite often and is explored even more deeply on the song Clark Gable I would say where Ben plays somebody who essentially gets a camera a whole movie rate going just to invite his ex onto this scene that he's written where he wants her to act as if you're still in love and kiss him which is about the most hipster thing I could ever imagine if only it were directed by Wes Anderson and I know the concept of this track and maybe others on this thing might seem kind of cringy on the surface but there is something conceptual going on here I think with the neurotic romantic angle Ben is constantly working on give up that I find pretty intriguing overall there's not really a song in this record I don't love to some degree not really a lyric or a story or a theme that I don't admire I think the closing track is a little inconclusive or it's one of a few moments on here where I wish Ben had just contributed more vocals and lyrics to the song overall but give up in my opinion is a near perfectly crafted pop album that is pretty much like I don't know the the indie version of mad villainy though it came out before mad villainy but you get what I'm saying two great artists in a particular genre coming together for one single album that is amazing and genre-defining and one of the best of the 2000s so yeah that's that's pretty much what what this is it's classic as hell I love I love it to death and I highly recommend it to anybody who has not heard it yet and yeah I'm gonna leave it at that transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which an I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die hit the bell as well over here

jhpP8YKjtTQ,"[Sigh] Hi everyone, Dethony Stresstano here, the internet's busiest music nerd. And the light is at the end of the tunnel LIST WEEK 2018 With the 50 - Top 50 Albums of 2018, it comes to a close. We are here at the finish line And, I'm - I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna step over that finish line, Gonna tell ya, my favorite albums, of the year, and it's gonna be over! [Rapturous moaning] Yeah, maybe I need, I need a bit of a mental health vacation... We have 50 albums to go through, five-zero, it's quite a bit I'm gonna kinda plow through the first half of the list I love all these records, they're all good But, obviously, they are in a particular order I had many more albums to consider that did NOT make it onto the list Some of which made it onto the honorable mentions but others just did not make the cut at all. It is what it is. We are talking about a limited number of spots here. So, gonna plow through the first half of this list, Gonna explain more of my thoughts on some of the records that I love a little bit more past the midway point Let's do it! At number 50, we have the new Current 93 record, ""The Light is Leaving Us All."" Following that, at 49, the new Blood Orange record, ""Negro Swan."" At number 48 we have the Aussie experimental rock supergroup, Tropical Fr*ck storm with their new record At 47 it is the newest Guerilla Toss album, The band sort of transitioned from being this weird, left-field post-punk dancy outfit into something much more psychadelic and odd this time around Dynamic vocals and almost progressive indie rock instrumentation come together on the newest Hop Along record, ""Bark Your Head Off, Dog."" And the band Screaming Females comes in after that with one of the catchiest and most muscular records they've come out with in a long time, the title of that being ""All at Once"" At number 44 we have a record that actually grew on me since my original review of the album So, gave it a 7 at first, it did sort of warm up to me a little bit more, I became even more impressed with just how odd and quirky and unique this record is, and that of course is the new Tierra Whack album, ""Whack World."" I love how emotional and dark yet also colorful and funny and strange this record is the production is quite quirky, and Tierra comes through with a lot of personality. And the 1-minute song limitation on this thing ended up kind of growing on me a little bit as well. All in all, I see it as a very interesting project that has me looking forward to whatever Tierra Whack is gonna do next. At number 43 we have one of my favorite avant-garde progressive death metal albums of the year (as if there were that many to begin with) Of the new Imperial Triumphant album, ""Vile Luxury."" Blues, black metal, soul, gospel, slave song, and more all come together on to the latest Zeal and Ardor album, ""Stranger Fruit,"" at number 42, And at number 41 we have the new fantastic breakout record from Dreamville and Atlanta rapper JID, DeCaprio 2. At number 40, four-zero, I am placing the new re-performed re-recorded version of Car Seat Headrest's ""Twin Fantasy,"" as I think what Will Toledo did with this record is pretty fantastic It's a very intriguing and long and somewhat conceptual indie rock record with a lot of unique narrative twists and turns, a lot of emotion on display at number 39 we have one of the best chamber pop experiences i've had this year the new Julia Holter record, ""Aviary"" and at number 38, Brownsville rapper Ka once again on the new Hermit and the Recluse record ""Orpheus vs. The Sirens."" An intriguing lyrical and dramatic hip-hop record which pulls pretty deeply from greek mythology. Of all things for a 2018 hip-hop album to pull from. At number 37, we have Pusha T's raw and lyrical new record, ""Daytona,"" with front-to-back production from the one and only Kanye West. At number 36, we have Janelle Monáe embarking on one of the best true blue pop albums of the year, ""Dirty Computer,"" And at 35 we have the worlds of neo-classical darkwave and drone and organ music and experimental rock all coming together onto the new Anna von Hausswolff record, ""Dead Magic."" Easily my favorite progressive math rock album of the year, guitar licks and lines and grooves all over this thing that'll just have you doing complex equations in your head, I'm talking about the new Polyphia album, ""New Levels New Devils,"" and at 33, a pop rock record that I did not anticipate to enjoy earlier this year: The new Twenty-One Pilots album, ""Trench."" At 32 we have Kanye West's own personal dive into his struggles with personal issues and mental health on the album ""Ye."" And at 31 it is Andrew W.K.'s own life-affirming tribute to music and just *being* and partying and existence and mental positive outlook the album ""You Are Not Alone"", it's like a mix of fist-throwing arena rock and also, like, self-help music. Feel good. Feel- I hope you feel good. At number 30, two of my favorite rappers living today coming together for a very creative set of collaborations on the new Jean Grae and Quelle Chris record, ""Everything's Fine"" very fun, entertaining, strange, and left-field record, with lots of dry humor Julian Casablancas and his band The Voidz come together on a new record titled ""Virtue,"" which is incredibly fun, experimental, and catchy, love it love it love it love it love it, A record that also did grow on me this year, a record that was not previously on my Loved List, but with more listens to it, more adjustments to its strange, unique and minimalist trap vibes, I really came to love it, it really has stuck out in my head more than a lot of other trap albums have in 2018, I am talking about the Playboy Cardi record, ""Die Lit."" At number 27, Anderson .Paak comes through with a big, breakout record with the help of Dr. Dre on ""Oxnard,"" a wonderful set of synth-funk and hip-hop songs that have so much flavor, so much color, soul, and personality, And at number 26, Earl Sweatshirt takes us to the darkest and most despondent corners of his mind on his latest record, ""Some Rap Songs."" Now we're at the halfway point of the list! We're goin! We're goin! let's go! At number 25 it is the Aussie experimental and avant-garde metal act Portal coming through with their newest LP ""Ion"", a record that I rated really high very early in the year "

Tilman a fantastic personal and mental health portrait portrayed in song which was definitely a major highlight on his latest full-length album really compelling tune love Josh's vocals on the track love the lush production and love the dark but also very self-aware and kind of funny lyrics at number 24 the band superorganism delivers an anthem for the social media age with everybody wants to be famous the lyrics on this track are smart the production is super quirky and few tracks lyrically I think really described prevailing cultural sentiments in 2018 more than this song does at number 23 we have the hard rocking and hard groovin corporation from Jack White's latest full-length LP one of the many track off the record that just feels like a really groovy in the moment jam with lots of interesting transitions and breaks at number 22 we have jid and j.cole forming like Voltron for one of the most fast and fiery lyrical displays of the year on the song off DS the flows the bars the energy everything about this track is just oh oh my god ah ah most definitely proving that jid is going to be an artist to look out for for the next few years at number 21 we have us girls with the amazing pop rock and hip hop fusion of the song pearly gates even a little bit of an eight dog influence on the hook here I would say definitely the most standout teaser track from her new full-length album in my opinion and at number 20 we have Grimes bringing new metal back on the song we appreciate power heavy metal guitars and some elements of art pop and dream pop and more all sort of converge on to this one insane song that lyrically dives pretty deeply into technological dystopia at number 19 I have the emo rap anthem of the year juice worlds lucid dreams I'm not sure if there's a better emo rap song that came out in 2018 or if there was a bigger sort of prevailing trap trend this year than emo rap like it was so huge I still see you shadows it by Rubin it is a friggin jam at number 18 I have the ghost song rats haha that's the metal band is back with an incredibly dramatic and really theatrical new single which at first was a little off-putting but I think I only grew to enjoy just how over-the-top and campy ghost was on their newest full-length album especially on this single at number 17 we have Denzel Curry's excellent cloud Cobain a song that is not only fantastic just from Tunes standpoint a production standpoint but I also love the message that curry is trying to get across and the lyrics of this song having to do with clout and getting attention and Fame and desperation and how destructive self-destructive all of that can be to Internet age music stars huge respect to him for saying what he said in the song and just basically trying to make the that he made at number 16 I have Travis Scott sicko mode excellent track amazing multi-faced psychedelic surreal mind-bending trap Bangor also featuring Drake and some amazing production front to back some of the most deep lush and psychedelic stuff I've heard out of a rap record in 2018 and at number 15 we have the Boy George Clanton basically bringing shoegaze back on this new cut over here with a new sound production style and aesthetic on the track make it forever which again not only love the collision of genres and styles coming together on this track love the production but also the tune is amazing to the hook is so friggin uh it's life-affirming make it really just throws it back to the 90s in the best way imaginable tasteful forward-thinking not just merely stuck in the past but referencing it and updating it at number 14 we have what is essentially the flamenco pop anthem of the year and that is Rosalia's ma lament a while flamenco pop may not be an entirely new thing Rosalia is someone who is really drawing a lot of eyes to it very suddenly across the world and not only because the music video attached to songs like these is amazing but also her just amazing songwriting and vocal talent which I'm really looking forward to seeing develop further and further into the future given just how great it was on her newest full-length album at number 13 we have the very playful and flirty sexy and fun best hugs from the dude DRAM yoga gives the best hugs yeah very few pop and R&B songs this year I found to be as fun as this track I mean DRAM is just straight-up hilarious and charismatic on this track the instrumental is this killer piece of smooth ass synth funk that is amazing it's just a really beautiful song with a beautiful sentiment and I'm just looking forward to seeing dream continue to kill it into the future hopefully a more sizable full-length record comes through in 2019 at number 12 we have a sign of pure rage that is the new reco nasty single rage there were a lot of artists out there that sort of tried to fuse trap and heavy metal guitars into like these raging bangers and in my piñon nobody really did it better than Rico nasty especially on this song and it's unfortunate because when people are talking about this new prevailing trend it's it's like her name doesn't really come up as often as it should which is all the friggin time so going forward please put some respect on Rico nasties name for Christ's sakes thank you at number 11 we have 1539 Calvert an amazing single and opening track from the latest record of JPG Mafia veteran the jittery experimental glitchy futuristic and cutting-edge production on this track is amazing Peggy vocally and lyrically is incredibly funny impressive raw and aggressive this track is just one of numerous examples as to why veteran was one of the best rap records of the year period okay and now we're here in the top ten my top 10 favorite singles of 2018 let's go kickin it off on the 10 spot with Natalia la forged a new song Danza date gardenias which is not only a great single but also the opening track to her new full-length album that I reviewed earlier this year an excellent collection of songs from across the Latin Fulks spectrum each one more beautiful than the next but this first track is not only beautiful and gorgeous and lush and enchanting but the guitars are wonderful the vocal harmonies are awesome and it really just kind of loops me into the record right away and gives me like this beautiful shot of vocals and instrumentation and just everything everything I want out of Latin folk music ever please I can't say enough nice things about this song honestly it's it's just gorgeous please I don't know why I'm saying please but we'll go to number 9 now the very fun and cheeky and flirty and sexy song boys from Liz OH which is not only super groovy excellently produced awesome bass line but Liz Oh on top of this track is amazing her energy her delivery her charisma it's just all off the charts the vibe and the sentiment of this track is amazing and it's really just a beautiful cherry on top of what is just a series of great grooves and just raw just really sticky songwriting and vocals kind of takes me back to like the super early days of a very stripped down like LCD Soundsystem singles or something like that but it's got kind of a new soulful 20-18 female empowered edge at number eight we have a very introspective powerful and emotional moment in the midst of one of my favorite albums of the year kids see ghosts and that is the song reborn Kid Cudi and Kanye essentially come together onto one of the sadder and darker tracks on the record that really sort of sees both artists in a point of severe vulnerability hoping to sort of evolve or grow past whatever demons or issues or problems that they're suffering through in this moment in time it is a very powerful song very powerful sentiment I love the beautiful production on this track Kid Cudi's vocals are steadier and more on pitch than they typically are Kanye's verse is pretty compelling too just all-around really beautiful track also incredibly beautiful despite the very raw and punked-out demeanor of this next track at number seven is the idol song Danny 2 Delco very few tracks in the way this song did in 2018 head-on addressed all these issues that we're seeing in the West with the rise of xenophobia and a fear of the other this track essentially trying to dispel a lot of that a lot of that fear surrounding issues like immigration with a strong message of friendship and unity and understanding of course the wild guitars and loud production and really gargling aggressive and monstrously vocals that are featured on this track also do a lot to make the song interesting and and really just in-your-face it's quite possibly one of the most compassionate but also incredibly fiery and aggressive I think I heard this year at number six we have the wildly funky and quirky post-punk anthem wide awake the title track and a big single from the latest parquet courts album yeah to me this song really sort of embodies the underlying message of a great deal of this new album in that wide awake is essentially kind of like the white indie rock version of being woke you know a lot of this record does sort of boil down to being aware of just the dire political straits that our society is in at the moment and I feel like the song is almost kind of like a pick-me-up in the middle of that keep your brain and attention span going I guess I love the bass line on this track I love the shouted vocals I love the very weird herky-jerky guitar lines I love all the percussion on this track the whole thing sounds like I'm listening to a post-punk version of like a Mardi Gras parade or something it's an excellent exuberant track that has been one of my most repeated songs of 2018 at my number five spot is the dark and thunderous Death Grips track black paint an amazing track that sees the Bands sort of rock influences coming full circle into a track that feels like the fusion of just like ac/dc style arena rock just oh oh oh oh combined with like the noise rock and industrial elements that have been formed much of what the band is done up until this point just all-around fantastic track I love the change of pace the band brought on this one and just what they were able to accomplish with it at number four we have the sleek and sexy and deeply prints inspired make me feel by Janelle Monae easily without question my favorite pop single of the year I love the multiple phases of this song how the verse just feels so playful and silly and flirty and you know just kind of like a wink of the eye and nudge of the elbow and then that rush of synthetic heaviness on the pre-chorus which is just so powerful and so immense and then it goes right into that really sleek like little rhythm guitar lick when the chorus pops in the groove is so great Janelle monáe's vocals are so smart and playful and cool oh my god it's just so sexy it's just so fun I can't get enough [Music] at number three here we have a bit of an emotional change of pace that is the daughter's song Satan in the wait track that feels like falling into never-ending cavern of pain and suffering yeah the noise rock band daughters really did come back hard on their new full-length album and this song was an amazing dynamic and multifaceted teaser track to lead up to the new full-length album that really starts very dark and despondent and in stripped back and almost minimal and eventually kind of grows into these just earth-shattering and bright almost like deafening experimental guitars and noises and like when the reverb really starts taking over the track and the song ends up sort of enveloping your brain there's this overwhelming sense of dread that makes me feel like it's it's all over now it's it's over yeah that the the emotional sort of response I had to this track was really strong and it is is a powerfully dark song from a powerfully dark album that will probably be leaving a mark on me for a very long time and even bigger louder stranger and more industrial mark was maybe left by the song on my number 2 spot and that is the Sofie track Ponyboy yes this is like post-industrial experimental glitch club noise super freaky fetish she banger that is easily one of the weirdest things I've heard this year and I absolutely cannot get enough of it I just feel like this song speaks to a very physical and visceral dark side of me and I like having that that spot each thank you there's not really anything I don't love about this track I love the pummeling punishing destructive production and rhythms on this thing I love the dark and layered vocals I love how demanding the lyrics are like how Stern the song feels I love how overpowering the song feels I love rigid industrial groove I like the quirky weird freaky metallic samples and sounds that sort of are whizzing about the mix at various points there's just a lot going on in this song it is absolutely insane and I just can't wait to hear Sophie drop more music in the future and at number one my number one spot number one numero uno whoo it's it's childish gambino this is America this is America yeah I love this track I absolutely love it to death even though a lot of people see the lyrics is being overly simple I feel like childish gambino does really kind of get the message home with the gunshots the knots - police brutality and mass shootings and so on and so forth the beat on this track is insane it's next-level it's overpowering whether you're talking about the thunderous African drums that play throughout a lot of the track or the really heavy bass the siren like since that sort of wing at various parts of the song some of the acoustic breakdowns on the track some of the soulful bits on the song for a track that in a lot of ways is pretty basic and straightforward it does have a lot of parts it does feature a lot of segments and it does work in layers I love how much Donald Glover is able to get across in the song without overstating his point just an absolutely tremendous song and artistic statement that most definitely has me looking forward to seeing what Glover is gonna be doing with his new full-length album in the future and yeah that's that's my list most definitely favorite single of the year and there we go [Music] transition yeah that's my list what's your list throw your list down in the description box I'm sorry if some song that you want it on here wasn't on here again I did consider a lot of songs to be on this list but they just didn't end up making the cut could only do 50 and I like usual and over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana singles best of 2018 forever 
DniRzLNzxcc,Oh God hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of 2018 list week list we continues with the top 10 worst albums of 2018 yes and 2018 thousands of albums dropped across the internet from these huge viral sensations mainstream cultural events and some really lowly records some people didn't hear at all and I didn't hear all of it I didn't hear everything that came out in 2018 which on some level does disappoint me but I can't at least say the 10 albums list that I have prepared for you here this is at least the worst stuff that I heard at number 10 on this list I have placed the Godsmack album when legends rise a record that pretty much serves as a reminder as to why new metal and alternative metal are currently in the dire straits that they are now Godsmack was not the only artist to do that this year disturbed also came out with an album in 2018 but in my opinion the Godsmack record was significantly worse I mean not only were there tons of riffs and ideas on this thing that for some reason sounded ripped off straight out of a Metallica record but this record easily featured some of the Bands worse lyrics weakest songs and I guess corniest production ideas in a long time and we are talking Godsmack here so safe to say a lot of the sounds and ideas that groups like Godsmack broke onto the scene with years and years and years ago they're not aging all that well when imagines rise and number 9 on my worst albums list is the new Russ record zu zu is essentially a generic uninspired pop rap album that under any other circumstance would most likely just be easy to listen to just sort of basic something that I guess I would just be indifferent toward but what makes this album so difficult to stand and unpalatable for me is just Russ's horrific attitude which is really only something that in the past has been grading for me if I've ever caught Russ saying something in an interview or on social media or something like that I mean even though his tracks and his records in the past didn't exactly blow me away I could say they were at least agreeable but now with his new record Russ has seen fit to pack his songs with the same annoying indignance that a lot of his public statements are - I mean granted there are a few tracks on here where Russ does hit a legitimately inspired point of emotion or maybe he goes a little hard or aggressive and it's kind of easy as the listener to get into that aggression but mostly a lot of what he's saying and doing on this record either comes off as really corny really simpie sort of like on the emotional love song side or he is displaying just this general unlikable bossiness this pretentiousness and this demand to be thought of and considered in great rapper conversations even though he hasn't come out with any groundbreaking or truly amazing music yet so yeah there are cuts on this thing that do feel like a temper tantrum stemming from those feelings and when Russ isn't doing that he's just pretty much coming out with tepid pop rap that pretty much disproves any argument that he's making that he's great at number eight on this list is an album that I was really hoping I would like an album that I had my fingers crossed for a little bit and that is the little yachty album nothing2prove as I said in my review of this thing unfortunately this is a project that really does live up to its title and that little yachty really sounds like he doesn't have anything to prove on this thing like he's putting in as little effort as possible and I don't know exactly what the cocktail of context is that leads to a record like this is it because there are so many opportunities and demands on new and young artists these days to come out with as much music as possible preventing them from being able to sort of disappear and invent and craft and evolve new sounds is it because the audiences of these artists aren't really demanding of them music that is a cut above this quality level is it because nobody cares anymore and we're just all depressed yeah I really truly don't know what it is all I can really say is that yeah it sounded like little yadi just really phoned everything in on this album and I mean everything from the beat choices to the lyricism to the flows so many songs on this thing even lack thoughtful choruses anything remotely sticky or memorable and unfortunately this is kind of an ongoing trend that I'm seeing in a lot of popular trap music at the moment because there there's just so much saturation in the scene right now it doesn't really matter whether or not your new record is good or bad as long as you're putting out something and putting out as much as possible and that's something we're seeing at almost all popularity levels whether you're talking about Drake or migos dropping these incredibly bloated new records with so many unnecessary songs or just one more uninspired generic formulaic by-the-numbers Underground mixtape to throw into the ever-growing ocean of generic by-the-numbers formulaic underground mixtapes so yeah you could say this new little yadi was definitely a contribution to to that this growing sense of a lack of ideas and effort on the part of these artists who just a few years ago burst out of the trap and soundcloud scene with fresh faces and cool sounds yeah it's just disappointing at number 7 on my list over here is one of the more awkward musical crossovers that an artist has made in 2018 and I'm talking about the new Justin Timberlake record man of the woods unlike some other releases in the list over here I can't really say I dislike this album because Justin didn't try no Justin and his producer certainly did try but I think all of them were maybe so gassed up in the process of making this record they sort of let a lot of ill-conceived ideas slip through the cracks which is maybe the most polite way I can put it to put it simply a great majority of this record is essentially Justin Timberlake transitioning into country music a little bit of folk music on the side too and yeah it's it's it's like a totally unlikable bone Iver with a pop and R&B twist not to mention there are other cuts on here that genre wise don't even really fit into that category like supplies which are still utterly terrible is the whole concept of that song the apocalypse the romance that it's it's really just a mess it's records like this that come from artists with extremely high budgets and profiles that really just make me sit and scratch my head at how the music industry functions like how many people did this album have to go through and nobody said like you know what no this is a bad idea Justin Timberlake trying to fuse the sounds of trap and country over a series of really uninspired and boring and unlikable songs yeah I think I think we're gonna do a pass on that so yeah in short I will say Justin Timberlake trying to make the genre crossover that he did on this record one of the hottest messes of the year at number six is an album whose popularity still perplexes me to this day and that is the new little baby and gonna record drip harder there are very few auto-tune trap records this year that I could say were as uninspired as this one completely lacking on the lyrical front on the instrumental front on the melodic front too because many of these records do involve singing and little baby and gonna certainly do attempt that although their voices on this thing are so drenched in auto-tune any humanity or personality to come out of their vocals is really sapped out of the mix on top of that vocally speaking neither of them really have a distinct style or personality either as both of them sound like they're doing their own variation on young thug's whole shtick which mind you it's a good stick I do like thugger vocally I think he's pretty dynamic and I think he's come out with some good tracks over the years but vocally and lyrically neither of them are so interesting I would rather listen to one of them over young thug not to mention that listening to two dudes rip off young thug for one track after another track after another track gets a bit redundant if you're a solo artist I guess that's one thing and gonna does have the thugger seal of approval by being on his label not to mention thugger has an appearance on this record so I guess he's aware of how much these guys are copying him and he's fine with it but to put out a collaborative record by two artists whose popularity is mostly predicated on their similarity to another popular artist yeah there's nothing really kind of thrilling about that for me and also again if I have not mentioned on the songwriting front of this thing there's not really much to it at all I mean the only track on this thing that's remotely memorable or even has a chance of lasting into 2019 is the title track and that's it so yes another uninspired auto-tune trap record to you know be completely forgotten within the next 365 days at number 5 is an album that also kind of fits into this auto-tune trap field but sort of landed at this point on my list not because I felt it was generic but because it stood out as being uniquely difficult to sit through and that is the new blade record red light now blade is a northern European artist who's connected to young leans sadboy crews so you know if you're familiar with that sound that style that aesthetic blade very much sits into it pretty snugly and if that's a sound and that's a style that you love you may in fact love this record you may have already heard this record it may be one of your favorite records of the year and I can't deny that blade has had a pretty decent 2018 he's gotten a lot of big endorsements he's been on some big playlists I'm a little bit of an odd man out in not liking this album as much as I do but god I just don't see what's so goddamn appealing about it I my review of this LP I did compliment the instrumentals quite a bit I liked how futuristic and glossy and almost vapor wave ish they sounded definitely sounded like I was listening to some auto-tune track from the year 2084 but I just I could not get past the lackluster songwriting and the vocals on this record at all I mean not only is the auto-tune on this record lazily applied completely uninspired and actually grating to the ear but it does absolutely nothing to cover up blades obnoxiously horrendous vocals all over this thing as many of his vocalizations on this thing are kind of lazy or sloppy very out of tune and very messy and needless to say vocally he's pretty one-dimensional too again I could see how this record would appeal to some people it sounds quite postmodern in some respects and I don't think there's a lot out there the sounds exactly like it and that alone is going to create an attraction of some sort in that in its own weird way I think this album does have some unique qualities to it but for me personally everything that makes this record stand out in a positive way for other people sort of works against it for me at number four on my list over here is a record that really hurts to place on this list because this is a guy I see as immensely talented and played a pivotal role in what I thought was one of the best bands of the 90s and the 2000s I'm talking of course about the new Tom Morello record guitarist Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine Fame he has dropped this new record called the Atlas underground and it's a total frigging mess Tom Morello here essentially trying to come through with his own brand of like guitar driven rock and hip-hop and EDM with like woke lyrics and a lot of guest rappers and singers the only common thread linking a lot of these songs together is just Tom Morello's guitar because this thing switches up stylistically that often you have kind of these glassy female pop singers on this thing rappers like vic mensa dude's like steve aoki people who you would never think would cross paths with Tom Morello and yet here they are Oh God and the songs are so bad god they're so bad and Tom's playing is applied into these super glossy pristine sanitary instrumentals in like the tackiest most unlikable way the rawness and the revolutionary ideas and sounds that were so exciting in his and rages early music is just not here on this record at all and he's really just like boiling his talents down in the most reductive and unlikable way what's amazing is how top-to-bottom bad this record is even tracks that you would think that you know could go over pretty well especially given that Tom Morello is no stranger to hip-hop he's worked with hip-hop artists in the past the lead poisoning clothes are on this thing with RZA and GZA names that I think back in the 90s you would have been excited to hear on the same record RZA and GZA and Tom Morello working on a track together would have been amazing but in 2018 it's enough to make you go back in question whether or not any of the music you listen to and your childhood was it really ever good god and marcus mumford is on this thing too just just so many guests and so many sounds that really just should have never should have never been on this thing should have never been pursued yeah I don't think I have anything else to say about this other than that at number three on my list is the new nav record wreckless an album that I'm not really sure what I can say about it as some of my critiques of a few records previous in this list like the little yachty album nothing2prove also apply to this as this album is not only totally unoriginal from a pop rap and a trap standpoint but it is blatantly uninspired at all levels of music and music production from the vocal melodies to the offensively dumb and basic lyrics to the instrumentals on this thing not only that but nav has one of the most boring and vanilla and forgettable and totally just why do we even need this how did this man get a record contract voices I've ever heard in hip-hop period in the whole history of the genre I mean I guess I could say I know an AB song or an Ave verse when I hear it but really the only defining quality of NAB's anything is just how robotic and lifeless and just not human it sounds whatever NAV appears on a track or is doing his own song it's like I'm listening to lyrics that were created by just a trap lyric generator just randomly pulling together popular phrases that you would typically hear in a song in this genre but somehow slipping in some painfully annoyingly stupid ideas here and there when I hear his voice it's like I'm listening to an old-school PC based text-to-speech prompt that essentially has had some auto-tune thrown on top of it dude sounds like a cyborg not even like a convincing cyborg look a human robot hybrid that you're like wow I can't even like tell that you're you're actually part robot you feel that human no it's it's kind of like the you know the like the beta version that they haven't quite worked out all of the the humanity kinks yet so he still just is operating like this hello fellow rappers I will do a verse on this song god it's it's terrible it's really bad at number two on my list is the new Jaden Smith sunset tapes project a cool tape story that is completely devoid of a story yeah I'm just confused as to why this tape exists I mean Jaden as much as I didn't really like his sire project from a while back I can't at least say it sounded like he was really putting in a lot of effort into that project and there were some ambitious moments on that record maybe some of them went really haywire but still ambitious all the same and there were some tracks on there where you know it sounded like his sound it sounded like his direction maybe he still needed to kind of get past his influences being warned so boldly on his sleeve but I guess you kind of knew Jaden verse or a Jaden song when you heard it however sunset tapes is the complete opposite the budget that went into this project sounded incredibly low the mix was muddy these song ideas were scan Jaden sounded like he was ripping off even more from his influences than he was previously their tracks on this thing that pretty much just sound like Brockhampton songs pretty much just sound like Drake songs what whiffs of originality there were on sire are completely gone on this project they're non-existent not only that but a lot of the songs on this thing are either incredibly redundant or brief to the point where you can tell he didn't really put any effort into the songwriting you just wanted to capture a vibe and throw a few bars out there and then just like dip which is a really awful way of going about crafting your mixtape you're pretty much guaranteeing that your songs are gonna be uninteresting and dime a dozen so if offensively low effort projects were the plague of 2018 this is one of the most prime examples but maybe serving as an even more prime example is the album in my number one spot here and that is the new little Xan record totals anarchy yes our good friend Diego here came out with in my opinion the worst record of 2018 and the criticisms I've had for many of the album's earlier on this list also applied to this one but almost like tenfold the beats on this record are boring and generic the lyrics are annoyingly repetitive mind-numbing ly repetitive and dumb not only that but lil Zan's talent for rapping is like nowhere to be found on this record I'm not even sure it exists as the flows on this thing are either awful or uninspired or non-existent as many of little zann's performances on this thing just sound zombified and linked out to the point where he's just like sloppily creaking all over the mix yeah his voice gets pretty creaky on this record really creaky if there's one record that I can say from this year that I will at all costs avoid a full listen of it's it's this one for sure hands down no doubt and I think that's everything I have to say about these albums thank you guys very much for watching and writing a lot of this music out with me through 2018 if I had to do it all alone I would probably be a just a broken person right now a totally broken person hopefully 2019 shines even brighter with better releases for us to listen to and transition have you given any of these albums a listen did you love him - J hate him what would you rate him you're the best you're the best what should I

6YLcTdaNYPw,ah [Laughter] it's it's fine I just have to do a list of the 10 worst singles of 2018 because it is it is list week so yeah yeah you did hear the words correctly that came out of my mouth the 10 worst songs of this year that we are currently living in assuming you're watching this video in the year that I made it although if you're not please keep watching it should be no news to you that in 2018 a lot of music did come out and quite a bit of it was bad so bad I could quite possibly do a top 50 worst songs of the year but I'll spare you the the skull splitting migraine and just keep it to a simple nice easy light 10 so without any further ado do top 10 worst songs let's go at number 10 I have placed the collaborative little zan and Noah Cyrus song live or die live or die features one of pop music's greatest power couples but I digress live or die is a non-stop thriller where little zann's creaky rap verses interject in between Noah Cyrus trying to do her best Lana Del Rey impersonation quite literally that's what this song sounds like just like Noah Cyrus was kind of living on an endless diet of Lana Del Rey and after a while she basically decided hey I'm famous and have an industry connected family I'm just going to come out with my own Lana Del Rey song with my boyfriend and yeah the end results here are about as uninspired boring and shallow as one could imagine the title of the song may be live or die but everyone knew going into it the stakes were not that high at number 9 on this list it's Freaky Friday featuring Chris Brown it's it's a little Dicky song if you've been following my channel for a while you know that my opinions on little dickie haven't exactly been positive and yeah the song pretty much epitomizes everything that I haven't really enjoyed about little Dickies music up until this point the whole song itself is based on a painfully dumb and unfunny premise furthermore the humor he extrapolates out of this premise is horrible and then on top of all of it manages to like just be really tacky and bad taste obviously the title of the song is in reference to the movie Freaky Friday so Chris Brown and little Dickie switched places for a day I guess and little Dickie is like whoa amazing I'm not this guy that like is super awkward and can't get laid then Chris Brown is essentially like yeah I'm not Chris Brown people aren't looking at me and remembering me for all the horrible things people know me for I mean I guess you could say the instrumental and the flows on this thing are passable but why would you ever want to listen to it when the concept is such trash at number eight on our list it's the Bad Religion song The Kids Are Alright since the entry of the Trump administration into the White House there has been no shortage of political songs across the music spectrum and generally I guess what's more political than a good old punk tune and you would figure with this incredible wealth of problems in the world at large like punk music would just be killing it man there's no shortage of stuff to bitch about or really rage against but unfortunately this song accounts for one of the more uninspired and tepid rock songs in response to this new rise of the right wing in the current political meta I mean not to say I disagree with the politics of the song or anything I mean fascism is bad the alt-right is bad but this is easily one of the most uninspired and boring responses of punk flavored dad rock I think a band could have to that at number seven it is the 6-9 song Bay Bay featuring an well a a the New York rapper essentially trying his hand at a land trap and a Latin pop flavor on this one the instrumental is offensively generic six 9s vocal performance is nasally auto-tune soaked and god-awful and well AAA's voice just sounds really gargle II and like he's just got a mouthful of water that he wants to keep in the bottom of his mouth while he sings his lines I mean I know the song did numbers it's an incredibly popular track four six nine and certainly was a successful transition into the Latin charts but goddamn is the song obnoxious even more obnoxious is the track hitting my number six spot on this one and that is pitbull ocean to ocean featuring yeah yeah yeah this track is essential an original cut for the Aquaman soundtrack that pitbull saw fit to put together and for the most part it's just him like singing and rapping some really corny bars over a revision or a reverse engineered version of the Toto Africa instrumental the chorus vocals are mixed way higher than the verse vocals pitbull going one is mixed even higher than all of that the the production and the compression on this thing is is really blown to shit it's so friggin loud on top of it it ruins the incredibly fantastic song that pitbull essentially just uses as an instrumental on this track there's really nothing appealing about this track outside of the musical elements that already existed in Toto's Africa before the creation of this song it's just one of those tracks that really makes you feel as a music fan like this is like blatant disrespect to the original and into the artistry of the original - pitbull literally ruins music men at my number 5 spot like I said earlier this year in 2018 there was a lot of crossover between music and politics and very few artists crossed over harder than Kanye West which is why at this spot here is the song yeh versus the people if you would let me recap earlier this year Kanye came out once again in support of Donald Trump which is nothing surprising because he had done so in 2017 at a live event which caused his fans to kind of turn onto him in the moment then he disappeared from the public eye for a little bit citing mental health issues and everybody just sort of assumed that that whole Trump endorsement thing was was really just a fluke but no Kanye was real about it's the real friggin deal Magga hat and and everything needless to say the vast majority of Kanye West's audience and the Internet at large did not take to this very well mega people and conservative grifters and Talking Heads and the alt-right were pretty excited about it though and even though much of the time it may seem like Kanye is so engrossed and whatever Kanye feels like doing that he's not paying attention to the signs anything that's going on outside of himself that is in fact not the case because yeh seemed fully aware of the very negative reception that his Trump endorsement was receiving so I think in his own weird way he thought he could kind of explain this whole thing away by essentially making a song with Ti and it really just ends up sounding like a half-assed piece of trash that doesn't really explain much I mean not only does it sound like Ti is performing with a mix of like I'm actually not happy with you over this but simultaneously I don't really want to be here but a lot of what Kanye is saying on the track only goes to show how little he sort of understands about the greater political dynamic of right now and on top of it how much these decisions for him really sort of come down to Kanye West himself and his ego and whatever his gut feeling is and whatever people generally are telling him not to do which Kanye it's pretty much his mo to go against the grain at every turn and even though Kanye West is responsible for a lot of the music that I loved in 2018 I got to say yay versus the people is not an example of that at number four I place the Paul McCartney song for you a track that essentially feels like a for you to anyone who's ever enjoyed Paul McCartney's music Paul McCartney saw fit to drop a new full-length album of solo material this year and all in all it's not a bad album at the very least a cut above many of the records artists had been dropping these days who come from the same era of music that he does but fo you was not only a terrible teaser track to this album but maybe the most low musical point on the record - as this song is essentially Paul McCartney trying his hand at writing a really bad tacky piece of millennial pop complete with the woe was you know the Millennial whoop and without question the worst lyrics on the entire album if there's one good thing I can say about this track though is that it will disappear with 2018 entirely I will most likely never have to listen to it again for the rest of my entire life except for when I'm on my deathbed and my brain is just basically shutting down and in the last synapses firing away in my cranium made of vibranium and titanium the song is playing as my death rattle just sort of calls out into the hospital room at number three I want to place the Eminem song venom which is not only the tacked on closing track to his new record kamikaze but it's also on the new venom soundtrack essentially a music movie promotional tie-in like we're living in 1990 friggin nine or something and yeah this is easily one of the worst sounding and annoying songs Eminem has released in a long time and yeah revival didn't even come out that long ago and a lot of that does come down to a crappy be a totally obnoxious hook where Eminem sort of layers his voice on top of itself again and again and again where he's delivering in this growly demeanour yeah there are very few songs I would say that this year sounded more diss pleasurable than this at number two we have one of the grossest songs in the top ten it is the r.kelly track I admit a 19-minute long cut where are Kelly doesn't really admit anything essentially this song is just R Kelly singing out every rationalization for the shitty behavior that he's had that's been plastered all over the news media for the past how many years and honestly if I had to listen to our Kelly do that I would I would much rather listen to an interview or something not not not a song cuz again that just ruins music it just disgraces music in general which yeah that might be my reasoning for placing it so high up on this list not only is it really annoying and long-winded and totally tedious and unnecessary but our Kelly is essentially using the art of music to Gaslight his audience into thinking hey man well I didn't do anything wrong come on buddy you know all this bad stuff happened to me before and you know what sure I like the ladies yeah this is horrible this is cringy this is friggin cringy as fuh fuh you and at the number one spot the greatest rapper of all time that anybody's ever heard in their lives ever Tom McDonald with the song white boy white boy white boy yeah the rapper the internet loves to hate he's pretty much here at my number one spot it's Tom McDonald if you guys have no idea who Tom is I did a video on my Fantana channel where I essentially cringed to this song and the music video attached to it but if I could summarize this track in a few words it's basically like white indignance Tom McDonald taking the fact that maybe some people have had some negative comments about his braids on the internet and they don't like it they he's a white guy and he's rapping and taking that negative backlash from trolls over social media or people who don't like his music for whatever reason and extrapolating that into white people are under attack oh my god white people are under attack mean tweets and articles on slate.com are not tantamount to slavery and family separations and police brutality and any other problem that people of color or minorities disproportionately face in this country shut the fuck up and this whole shtick this ideological angle is pretty much Tom McDonald's mo now as many of the songs he's released past this track sort of deal into this anti politically correct guru and I get that political correctness can very much be a problem but the right contributes to it just as much as the left and Tom's whole opinion on it is based on this really skewed and white centric view never mind the song itself as corny as hell like Tom McDonald sees himself as this edgy truth-telling mclemore it's like he's the opposite of Macklemore in every way except for skin color and talent level and yeah I'm gonna leave it at that those are my top 10 worst songs of 2018 if you're morbidly curious about any of them I guess you could find more information on them down in the description box and yeah thanks for watching transition have you given any of these songs listen did you love him too Jay hey Tom what would you rate them you're the best you're the best which should

oQ28ZolgeaI,hi everyone listen a week Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another installment of list week yeah you know I'm I need to be you know you know I'm had to be Wow cow that was your best freestyle yeah how are you even coming up with these lyrics well every night before I go to sleep I just eat a page out of the dictionary you get all the words in in my brain I'm not sure that's how it works but that's cool well my doctor says that too but you know that the poop is in the pudding you sounded really on the beat well yeah but was I as on as in is the beat as I couldn't be I'm not sure that was English but I think I catch your drift let's let's do another take a one A two A one two three four guys I'm trying to do an EPS list over here can can this can this wait well me and my friend knew it jackman we got a practice for super best friend world tour around the world tour I don't care I don't care I don't even care not even a little do you need me to call someone for you Cal no it's okay I'm just gonna take it day by day what usual you're a monster yeah this is gonna be a top 15 EPS of 2018 2018 has been chock-full of good music everybody chock-full of good music really really too much music for me to review which is why I sucked so bad at reviewing ep's this year there are actually quite a few EPS that I enjoyed a lot and did not even get the chance to cover them like I did so many albums throughout the year so there may be some EPS on this list that you're surprised to see because I didn't cover them you didn't think I was aware of them or maybe you just assumed because I didn't talk about them that they wouldn't place so high but yeah please do check out these EPS any information on them down below in the description box because I definitely do recommend that you try out all of them they're all good listens at number 15 I wanted to give a shout out to the new tomb moldy peace rule Ian's salvation that dropped this past November these guys were a death metal act that has had one of the more celebrated death metal albums to drop this year which in my opinion was an OK record kind of seemed like a bit of a meat-and-potatoes death metal album in my opinion this new EP though by comparison is much more raw and animalistic and nasty and disgusting and blood caked and all that gross disgusting stuff that I love about death metal generally definitely not as clean and as straightforward as sound as their recent fooling them so I guess if you do like your death metal a little bit edgier a little bit darker a little bit more gruesome a little bit more primal this two track EP will definitely please you no question at number fourteen wanted to give a shout out to the new Rabin Lynnae EP crush gave this a review earlier this year very quick review the rundown of it was that there were some moments on this EP where Rabin Lynnae definitely came off as one of the more forward-thinking R&B artists out there today with some pretty psychedelic and surreal production there were a few other tracks though that read to me as being much more I guess colourless and straightforward a little plain bit of a 90s R&B throwback which is not all-in-all a bad thing but I'm kind of hoping that this EP especially with those more trippy and forward-thinking cuts becoming some of the more popular songs on this record I hope that sound ends up guiding artistically where Linnea is headed in the future but overall solid little R&B EP you do not miss this thing it is pretty sweet next they new open mike eagle EP what happens when I try to relax open mike eagle going independent on this new little record over here yeah I mean it feels like an EP to me it's relatively short and to the point open mic really kind of dives into a lot of the mentality that sort of goes with independent hustle gets him to a lot of the personal stuff that he's been dealing with lately and does it over some very synthetic and futuristic and glitzy production that I'm not super crazy about but it definitely creates an aesthetic for this particular release not my favorite crop of songs that he's ever dropped or anything not my favorite EP of his but certainly a solid release from open mic this year and hopefully he continues to just keep dropping music independently hopefully you see success with it more music from open mike eagle is always always always a good thing next Caracara bonito with their latest EP that prefaced their new album that dropped a little bit later this year this little EP did have me worried in a way because it definitely was a deviation away from the more synthetic and bubbly and j-pop inspired sounds of their big breakout album and while yeah I mean this thing is a little rough around the edges without a doubt kerokero bonito kind of smooth this sound out got a little bit more dense and colorful and creative with the sound palettes and production when their new record time and place eventually did release while not every track on this new EP is a banger and is one of caracaras best I do appreciate it as a bit of a creative stepping stone to where they ended up being on their latest full-length album next they knew always from which I understand is it's a bit of an exclusive like tour only project that has several different b-sides from the band's latest full-length album on it so even though this thing didn't receive the widest release I did give it a shot and even though I do understand why these tracks maybe couldn't go toe to toe with everything that was on the latest full-length album if you are into Dream pop if you're into the very song centric catchy sweet and orgasmically blissful sound that the band brought to the table on their latest full-length album you're definitely going to enjoy this EP of what you can hear of it where scrounge of it if you can find it on like record purchasing or trading website or you know try to stream it off of YouTube or something like that because as I said this thing definitely did not get a wide release and hopefully these track do receive such maybe on a larger compilation from the band down the road or something because they are good tunes next at number 10 the new proto martyr EP the consolation EP this post-punk outfit definitely came out with one of my favorite rock albums of last year and if I had one major criticism of that album it's that occasionally proto martyrs approach can be pretty overly simplified pretty straightforward very much fitting within the the incredibly limited scope of the dark and moody and and somewhat Joy Division influenced post-punk revival though this bands influences do seem a little bit more diverse than a lot of other groups out there having said that though on this new EP there are a few cuts that while decent do strike me as that but simultaneously there are a few other songs that come off a bit more noisy and experimental and intense and and potentially paint a way forward for the band in the future hopefully like with a lot of EPS or a van sort of tries out something new this is the group kind of dipping their toes in the water for something that is only going to grow bolder and more exciting when they drop their next full-length album whether it be next year or the year after that definitely not an EP that this sort of seems like a super out-there standalone piece where the band sort of diverts into something that they'll never touch again definitely kind of seems like a bit of an experimentation phase where the band is trying out some new stuff some new ideas some new sounds and hopefully they're applied really creatively and interestingly on their next full-length album next the new Moses Omni EP black in deep red 2014 if there is a songwriter who sort of struck me as a bit of an enigma last year it was Moses Omni and while I liked a lot of the sounds and ideas that he presented on his last full-length album there were some tracks that to me that that felt like he was really wearing his influences a little bit too boldly on his sleeve or tracks that ended abruptly and ran kind of like bridges to nowhere however I still found his mystical dark and moody fusions of soul and art pop to be really intriguing and kind of unique and even though this new EP over here is incredibly short just a couple of axé I feel like the quality of songwriting and the quality of production the eerie surreal unsettling and strange production on these tracks is exactly what I want to hear from Moses Omni in the future and this EP definitely has me excited for Moses Omni 2019 without a doubt at number eight I want to give a shout out to a musical project by the name of shy girl which if you're into this current trend coming out of camps like the PC music camp of avant-garde experimental strange club music this whole deconstructed Club thing postmodern and almost post-industrial dance music you're gonna want to give this a shot because this is totally off the fricking wall the vocals are insane the production is nuts the songs yeah they're a little short but there are a lot of insane ideas on this EP that I like a lot most certainly you can put shy girl and this EP on my ongoing list of reasons to be excited about the underground of electronic music and pop music and club music at number 7 I want to give a shout out to the one and the only James Ferrara the Enigma himself the multi-talented James Ferraro who has essentially come out with the first of a series of releases I'm pretty excited to hear for an EP this thing is pretty large it's pretty massive and this thing is definitely a continuation for James in that recently he's been locked into a lot of sounds on his records where he's kind of diving into these MIDI interpretations of neo classical music of glitch and and new-age music and while I have sampled a lot of what he's been doing in those fields recently this is one of my favorite releases that he's done in that vein and given that it's just a taste or the first step in an ongoing series of releases that has me even more excited just looking forward to what he's gonna do with it into the future so if the prospect of long winding heady cerebral neoclassical MIDI compositions intrigues you especially since a lot of the sounds that James develops and crafts on this record are so cool give it a shot give it a listen next I want to give a shout out to two EPS both of which inhabit the six spot on this list and that is volumes 1 & 2 of streams of thought from Black Thought the frontman the lyricist extraordinaire from the Philly rap outfit the roots who essentially just kind of drops 2 EPS out of the blue the first of which is my favorite and features wall-to-wall production from the one and only 9th wonder on both of these EPS you'll find a lot of jazz and funk and soul samples laced throughout the instrumentals Black Thought is just going off lyrically gritty rhymes topical verses smart wordplay it's cutting it's junkyard dog level of power and aggression but it's also pretty smart and smooth and clean cut easily hands down no question the two best rap EPS that I've heard all year so there you go at number 5 I want to give a shout out to the new HM LT DEP hate music last time delete HM Ltd is an upcoming group from the UK whose first big commercial released this EP I was pretty excited for given the singles that have been released up until this point and I love how HM Ltd is essentially able to take a lot of the post-punk and the goth rock of the 80s in the UK and sort of update it for a modern audience with freakier bolder louder and stranger sounds this EP may be kind of short but it packs a punch their hilarious tracks on here sexy dark strange songs that successfully in my opinion bring this older shade of post-punk into the modern era at number four in this list I want to give a shout out to the new Jenny who volley p the long sleep definitely enjoying this one quite a bit a smoother and more coherent sound than her last full-length album in my opinion loving the sax led artpop that she embarked on on this record also the very massive like experimental 10-minute drone that was pretty fantastic as well it definitely has me feeling a little excited for the next Jenny hvala record it's been a while since I've been really looking forward to her music in a big way because I feel like her stuff has sort of gotten so experimental and and highly conceptual to the point where it's almost kind of like lost its musical appeal in a way I feel like this EP definitely goes back to that it still feels quite odd and perplexing at points and that oddity only ends up in dancing the beautiful compositional elements of this record in the long run so again Jenny have all the long sleep definitely not an EP you want to miss another EP that I want to give a shout out to at the third spot in my list here is one that I actually totally missed up until recently even though I was sort of well aware of its existence I'm talking about the new boy genius EP which is essentially a collaborative singer-songwriter trio people have used the term supergroup to describe them as well and I saw a lot of coverage of the trio in the indie press and NPR music but personally I wasn't really floored by the recent solo records of any of the artists sort of involved in boy genius Julian Baker Phoebe Bridgers Lucy Dacus so honestly my curiosity with boy genius didn't necessarily peak or anything as I assume the songwriting on this thing wouldn't really appeal to me considering that it didn't do so all that deeply on their respective solo records yeah you know what I was pretty much wrong about that I mean stylistically this thing isn't really outside of the wheelhouse of the whole singer-songwriter indie rock indie folk sounds that each of these songwriters are known for but the tunes on this thing are still really well produced and recorded very passionately performed nicely written even the vocal performances throughout much of this thing are pretty heart-wrenching for the most part I can't really complain it's a quality release maybe the sound does come off a bit plaintive points and maybe not every song is amazing but given how much material here is quality and just how much positive press came out of seeing these three get together I can only hope that they will collaborate more in the future on a better and a larger release at number two I want to give a shout out to the boy igloo ghosts who dropped two sister EPS this year clear teme and steel Mogu both of which had slightly different personalities one much darker and heavier and more aggressive than the other and even though in a lot of respects I saw much of the music on these two releases as being very much in line with a lot of what igloo ghost has released on his last full length album he hasn't really given himself a whole lot of time to progress artistically past what he did on his last full length record it's kind of like listening to an update of that album like version 1.5 we're not quite at 2.0 but there's a lot of great production on these two releases I think he definitely does a great job of continuing the igloo ghost lore which if anybody has been following that it's only getting more and more interesting with each new release and each new progression of the storyline or the world that all these characters igloo ghost has has come up with where they live where they come from what they do their nature so love these EPS love of igloo ghost is doing and looking forward to him producing more and just progressing into the future and at number one my number one EP my favorite EP of the year hands down has to go to the brand new FX twin EP which actually features some of FX twins nuttiest glitchy ax stand most out there productions in a while some of my favorite tracks that he's done in a long time in my opinion leagues better than anything he's been putting out on his recent EPS or even his comeback record Cyro which I know a lot of people might disagree with but I don't know I think it's pretty bang and release now given that it is a FEX twin and Richard does tend to be a very unpredictable and somewhat volatile and you know kind of really marching by the beat of his own drum kind of artists there's no really way of knowing or predicting whether or not Richard is going to continue with this sound onto an album into the future and that's not to say that I'm necessarily demanding that either because as it is as a standalone piece this EP is pretty satisfying if he did this EP and only did this sound this one time and then went on to something totally different on another EP on another album and never returned to this I can't say I would be entirely disappointed however it's it's not like I wouldn't enjoy hearing more of this in the future though so again loving how dense and experimental and really rhythmic and visceral the electronics are on this little release again definitely Richards most hard-hitting stuff in a while I mean enough so that it ended up at my number

sHNjyrzkxgY,[Music] one two three four oh you got what I need but you say he's just a meme but you say he's just a mean Oh baby you you got what I need but you say he's just a meme but you say he's just for me hi everybody it's your friendly neighborhood meme guy here here to talk to you about me as all of you know 2018 is a year that has been has been chock-full of internet humor and as you know on this channel we only only talk about the music related stuff not the maymays some of you might find that to be a bit of a conflict of interest being a meme myself but you know I make I make do well anyway in in honor of list week I have seen fit to do another video diving into the internet memes going over the 10 best music related memes of 2018 in no particular order in no particular order but these are unequivocally the 10 best the cream of the crop the tippity-top of those sweet sweet day gasps music memes first off let's let's kick it with this Greta Van Fleet Led Zeppelin missed mr. bean copycat meme over here Greta Van Fleet looking over the shoulder of the other guy cop copying his test and that's it that's that's basically the mean that's a pretty funny one that's a funny one right certain list off easy we're easing into it you know nothing nothing too deep to kick things off you know just as a good solid easygoing meme to start to start this next meme that I'm shouting out is is is a new meme it's a fresh meme it's a sort of underground meme it's an up-and-coming meme and and this is not just some weird obscure a little bit of out of the way internet humor this man who I'm talking about here is actually a living meme I would say he is living his memes and creating beautiful original meme content with his art I think I think this man he sort of blurs the lines between where art and sort of memes start and finish maybe making us realize that memes and art were not only not that different to begin with but maybe memes and art were really all along just like the friends that we made along the way I'm talking about this guy named Oliver tree he's a producer he's a songwriter he is a one-man wrecking crew and a performer extraordinaire you check this guy out you see one of his live shows his whole stage presence it's just decked out in me Murray the bull cut the weird wraparound sunglasses the way they're all tiny tiny on his face he wears like these puffy old-school thick 90s neon colored jackets he wears like the big raver Jenko pants or you know like some some shirt with like that weird cup design on it you know that it's it's just like the 90s just threw up all over the dude he also just like rides a razor scooter everywhere and he makes these like little mimetic videos that he throws around online everywhere that are pretty funny smoky ways for bull but I feel like artists like Oliver over here are pretty much going to be the wave of the future in a way because memes very much at the current moment are like the new wave as far as music promotion is concerned and Oliver is kind of ahead of the curve in that not only is he sharing and endorsing memes that his fans are already making of him like many other artists out there do he's making his own memes for his fans to pare it back at him and share for him sort of cutting out the audience middleman just kind of making up his own maymays and then just kind of feeding off the hype off of those so you know shout out to this guy for kind of getting a little more creative and inventive with his a musical promotional game and in embracing embracing the meme next on our list is the nav Astro world verse as a lot of you know Travis Scott's new record astral world was a pretty good record it was a really psychedelic futuristic mind-bending tribute to pop rap and trap just basically the current sound of hip-hop at the moment however there was one thing on the record that really stood out to everybody and no I'm not talking about sicko mood because it was a particularly good track I'm talking about one particular verse on the entire record that stood out to everybody as being really really weird something kind of off and that was the Navis who shows up on the tail end of this track over here he's in the songs very very very final moments however his voice is mixed so horrific allele oh that you could barely hear the dude now this resulted in a lot of people commenting on this yes of course but there were also memes all over social media about how low his mix was there were spongebob memes there were also memes or it was like hey this is what nav recorded on and it's like a picture of a Nintendo DS like on a mic stand the jokes at NAB's expense for how low his verse was mixed I mean they got pretty savage and I would say they were really unrelenting to the point where Travis Scott literally had his vocals remixed so that people I guess wouldn't make fun of it or wouldn't make fun of him or die I guess basically kind of right this wrong or whatever I mean not that it improved the track or anything NAB's verse on the song is horrible my heart goes out to anybody who bought and downloaded that shit before the mix change occurred but on top of it there is something about the music nerd in me that does kind of freak out a little bit when I see people actually commenting on subpar mixing it makes me think wow wow they're actually like listening they're actually listening to the way this stuff sounds oh my god next we're giving a shout out to Johnny Johnny yes papa now if you guys didn't know already there's this little website called YouTube's dotnet apparently you can go on there it's the biggest video site of all time ever and you can watch a ton of videos about different things you know you can watch videos about about music reviews you can watch videos about music or hands yeah I don't care but there's also quite a bit of children's content on the platform too and because it's really only children and toddlers and babies watching the content the quality control of some of this stuff is really low like the production is bad the music they using the videos are bad have to really think whoever's watching your stuff is to try to pass them this quality level of content there's one particular song and performance of the song Johnny Johnny yes papa in the animation [Music] next given shout out to this awesome other meme remixes and other mimetic content macros label pictures and so on and so forth coming out of Donald Glover's this is America hands down without question Donald Glover came out with one of the best most entertaining most politically sharp and poignant songs and music videos this year a music video so outlandish and violent and fast and colorful and active in in-your-face that it could not not have turned into a meme in some way shape or form in fact I would argue that Glover was a hundred percent conscious of the potential mimetic appeal of this music video which only helped spread its word spread its message spread its visuals spread where you'll know yes for whatever reason there was like kind of a bit of kickback in the journalism community balli oh you shouldn't turn the music video in to me but that's the whole point of the internet and social media just like taking stuff and recontextualizing and riffing on it and changing it and sort of like making your own sort of message with and building on you fucking Luddite anyway this music video is a supremely bold piece of art and I think that is very much reflected in the wealth of creativity that has been shown in the illustrations and basically artistic liberties that meemers and artists alike have sort of taken in making their own creations inspired by this music video and I haven't even gone into the plethora of other videos out there that people have made that have been like this is Russia this is Nigeria this is Italy basically doing their own little plays on whatever place or country they come from relating that this is America formula to their own surroundings their own geographic location which may not directly be a mean but it's still very much in the spirit of remix in which is very much attendant of meme culture so hell yeah this is America remixes recontextualization Zanden memes hell yeah do that forever next Mason Mason Ramsey yes the the little yodeling Walmart boy who just yodeled his way into America's heart I know a lot of people out there might be kind of salty about like oh hey you know this kid he's got Lee's just like a dumb meme and now he's got like a serious a serious music career now I mean hey come on if Joe Jie could do it so could Mason Ramsay anyway this kid was like yodeling in a Walmart and like people thought it was funny like mostly like black Twitter was going crazy and then white America was basically like oh wait not actually actually we like this but anyway this little video of Mason Ramsey just yodeling his heart out has been remixed numerous times there's been lots of little plays on the video also lots of people have acted out their own little Walmart yodels and performances too in hopes that they would achieve massive internet fame and and maybe land a music contract after that but there's no chance of that happening because Mason Ramsay is a cute little angelic darling oh my god he's melting I heart like butter also have you guys seen him do this though save some girlfriends for the rest of us buddy come on as soon as I do sound saying all of this Mason Ramsey he does seem like a nice kid I do love the memes that have sprung out of his little yodeling fiasco and including like this this really weird surreal CGI video on this surreal entertainment YouTube channel it gives me friggin nightmares the next meme in this list is the young thug little Dirk computer picture meme where young thug is just looking like like he's like he's doing some real important on the PC maybe he's like on an episode of Law & Order and he's like you know looking at the computer footage the video footage is like enhance enhance do pixelate sharpen desaturate the photo zoom in zoom out zoom left zoom right there is we've got his identity baby baby baby fingerprints fingerprints fingerprints ID hacked into the the mainframe the Guy Fieri mainframe meanwhile little Dirk's back there he's just like amazed at whatever young thug is doing he's like wow man he's like he's cracking the code dude and this has been accompanied by lots of funny little little text bits it's been sort of photoshopped over lots of different versions of the picture there's an even funnier version where they sort of take this picture and it's like they're I don't know superheroes or part of the justice team or whatever and then they cut to a picture of one savage looking absolutely evil like he's some kind of like you know like super evil mastermind and he's like you but you've got to give me like forty three billion dollars or I'll blow up the Eiffel Tower and then like you know meanwhile young thug and little darker like we don't negotiate with terrorists bro yeah I like this photo a lot it's an amazing photo amazing picture beautiful visual and I love what the main community has done with it it's wonderful next meme in 2018 is Takashi 6-9 no particular Takashi 6:9 meme the dude himself is just like a living fucking meme and he's just like been doing nothing but just like being a meme throughout 2018 I would actually argue if it weren't for the Takashi 6:9 meme this one really be any reason to pay attention to takashi 6:9 whether it be some crazy offhanded shit that he says in an interview shoutout again too much dank I'll let my nuts hang another video where he's like running but he's not even running particularly well and he's like in his underwear and he's not like a gun in his hand or whatever all the footage people have taken from his music videos and remixed it with like emo pop tunes yeah I don't know if there's been a bigger legit industry backed musician out there who has been a bigger meme in in 2018 than Takashi six nine I mean he's really like reached peak meme dreams the next name on this list is from an artist who I think in terms of meme dreams in terms of meme relevancy in terms of meme dominance maybe came in at a very very tight a very like a photo finish second place and that would be Kanye West mr. Kanye West he was responsible for a lot of memes in 2018 whether it be all of his like crazy mega hat Trump stuff for the I love it video or the yeah Connie has been behind a lot of memes in 2018 however I would server wind it back a little bit and say the I love it video / visuals and memes that sort of came after that was the mean that really kind of stood out to me the most meme to me that was my favorite I mean not only is it a ridiculous friggin music video but the whole look of little pump in him and these like giant blocked out outfits where they just like look like friggin roblox characters is I don't know if it's like a sign of madness or a stroke of genius I I can't quite figure it out but all I know is that I liked it it took the internet by friggin storm and the amazing photo shops and memes some of which Kanye has actually put onto his literal Twitter feed because the dudes like just embrace the mean he's embracing the mean which of which I embrace I embrace embracing the meat and I am Pro embracing the meme our final meme comes from one of the newer and more cancerous platforms music-related though that has sort of risen up in 2018 and that that is tick-tock yes this this platform you can kind of make these a little funny short-form videos where you're dancing or lip-synching or acting to the audio of a song or another piece of content and people make these videos all the time where they're kind of you know lip-sync duetting to other tunes and other people sort of crash other people's tick-tocks with like ridiculous shit and you know make like insulting tic TOCs and offensive tic TOCs and it gets kind of crazy though you listen you will never see me on there I will never be on tick-tock and please do not take this piece of footage and put it on fucking tick tock okay because that that would be illegal but you know out of all the tic TOCs that have come out there's one that really rose above them all [Music] this chick talk is amazing this is an amazing tick-tock I mean this one video this one short little tiny video clip of this white girl dressed up like an anime babe like basically justifies the existence for the whole platform the moment I saw this thing I was just like damn that is a good ass tick-tock apparently the audio is lifted from like this rap song that before this wasn't even really that popular that was meant to just be like a Mia Khalifa diss track but still if this subpar rap diss song didn't come out like this Tik Tok would have never existed and this thing is friggin high art I love this girl her look on her face I love her outfit I love her whole performance this is the fucking Mona Lisa of tik toks it's pretty dark times in 2018 but to be honest looking at this tick-tock it did lift me out of some pretty some pretty deep dark abyss ease of emotion you know this year to be completely honest is how sweet this is one of the best music related memes of 2018 2019 2020 2021 hands down my hands are down my hands are literally down right now that's how good of a meme this is how the remixes of the other people doing their own little hit or misses I love people taking the vocals on this on this tik tak and sort of throwing them into Travis Scott sicko mode which is about like maybe the most 2018 remix I can imagine yeah I mean sure a lot of content on tick-tock it's it's pure garbage but you know there's sometimes just one video one mean one juicy visual video meme makes it all worth it okay guys that's been my top music memes of 2018 video hope y'all are doing pretty good I miss you over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you in the next one and me man bye 
NFCN0tOZ4UE,
0RX4a0htqGE,ooh hi everyone professional here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Meek Mill album championships this is the latest full-length LP from Philly rapper and Maybach Music Group MVP Meek Mill and championships is a pretty big moment for meek this album comes after some of the most tumultuous years of any rappers career as meek is currently in the calm of an ongoing legal storm that has somehow made him the face of criminal justice reform in the hip-hop community something that's earned him not just tons of coverage within the music journalism community but outside of it too on network news even New York Times op-ed that was published recently and it would seem that Meeks story is actually having a cultural impact which all-in-all is a pretty good thing and I've talked about this before on camera I'm not here to say that meek has never broken a law in his life or that he's a perfect angel or that he's followed all the rules of his parole but reading deeper into the situation it's pretty clear that the court has taken an active role in playing with Meeks time playing with his life gotten in the way of business opportunities and just generally given him the runaround and the court system should mainly prioritize carrying out justice and assessing whether or not certain individuals are threats to society not turn the lives of high-profile celebrities into total Fiasco's out of a personal vendetta or just the will to make an example out of somebody not only is it painfully unfair it's a waste of time it's a waste of money and a serious misuse of the judicial branch of government because the only example the court system has made in the case of Meek Mill is the revolving door many ex-cons find themselves trapped in post prison now even though all of this has made really interesting context surrounding the release of this album I would be a total fool if I were to go into this thing thinking that this experience that meek has been going through has totally changed his sound totally changed his lyrical abilities certainly Meek Mill can get personal in his songs but I didn't have any assumptions going into this thing that he's suddenly going to become like this introspective conscious voice not only that but I don't think that's really what his fans are truly looking for from him I mean surely there need to be tracks on this record that referenced the experience that he's been going through but he came up a braggadocious pop rapper and I think he's just going to kind of continue down that path I mean even my favorite Meek Mill Project dreams worth more than money is not really much more than a pop trap album at the end of the day and even though I do like the high level of energy Meek Mill typically delivers his bars with sometimes his writing is pretty average or just centers around a very limited amount of topics I mean I think his follow-up record in 2017 wins and losses displayed just how one-dimensional he is as he didn't really bring a whole lot to the table that he hadn't already on his previous albums and mixtapes and in most ways championships despite everything meek has been through is pretty much yet another bloated focus-grouped a little something for everybody pop rap album with a lot of trap beats and quite a few hit or miss features meek attempts a track with a kind of Latin vibe to it on the track uptown vibes with a few little beasts switch ups in the instrumental that take on kind of a reggaeton groove there's also a very sluggish and well AAA verse at the very end of the track the song would be a total loss if not for Meeks hyped chorus cardi B's appearance on this record is pretty average despite her being the hottest commodity in hip-hop right now jay-z's heavily covered contribution on this thing is really only interesting because of the lyric that he throws out about Kanye and I do think some of the brags about his business acumen in this verse are pretty clever but for the most part there's not really a whole lot of chemistry between him and meek and Ross the last of which there's is barely even a factor on this track even though he kicks the entire song off Ella Mae's inclusion in this record really only adds up into a track that feels like a 2000s era R&B pop rap blend and going bad featuring Drake did cause a lot of commotion because hey meek and Drake they had that big explosive beef that everybody remembers and now they're back together or things are smooth it over it's cool and I mean it is good that Drake and meek are back on good terms I assume Drake kind of steals the show on the track but the song is basically yet another piece of sanitary pop rap without much in the way of a strong hook to carry it all it mostly feels like Drake and meek are kind of riffing for three minutes and then it just sort of ends I mean this is basically the kind of stuff I anticipated from this record and I there are like a handful of songs and the 19 tracks of this record where Meek pretty boldly dives into the legal battles and very traumatizing experiences that he's been going through over the past few years of the track intro the track trauma the closing track cold-hearted to which are all undoubtedly high points on this record Meeks lyrics are great they are vivid they are detailed they tell a strong story he delivers all of his verses passionately and there are a few other cuts on here that may not directly be related to everything that meek has been going through but they do still tell a personal story of his own struggle whether it be sort of in the present like on the track respect the game or going back into his past like on the track ooh tools and noodles babies and it's not like meek needs to be super socially charged on a song in order for it to be good the cutthroat pay you back with 21 Savage is savages hell and definitely one of the nastiest songs on this entire thing the braggadocious and glamour has stuck in my ways is about as flashy and as money-hungry as we expect meek to be it's a fun hard-hitting captivating track that pretty much tells you that meek is not changing he's not intending on doing anything different he's staying on his typical grind I mean it says it basically in the title and if it wasn't obvious enough he goes deep into the lyrics about his drugs his money his cars his women you get the idea but almost every likable moment on this record is countered by a song where meek is not executing very well going for a sound that doesn't really favor him whether it be the terrible auto-tune ballad almost slipped or the buttery and smooth dangerous toward the back end of this LP which also features P and B rock and is equally uninspired so yeah overall this album is every bit as much the mixed bag that I anticipated it would be and again while I do appreciate the position that meek isn't currently and I do like the fact that he's using his influence and his platform to spread ideas and make a case for some very important issues the fact remains at this point his music is still pretty average and if he's going to continue to stay in this pop wrap mode continue down this path I would much prefer that in the future he'd drop a record more like dreams worth more than money where he's cutting down the tracklist to the most essential moments he's not embarking on anything too awkward or awful anything that's outside of his comfort zone or beyond his abilities or putting redundant tracks on his album - because meek while I do like him and I do think he has a nice baseline of talent I don't see him as an artist who's so dynamic that he can carry an hour in ten minutes of material and have it be fire from front to back I'm feeling a light too decent five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony

jVCFinUjUrU,hi everyone scruff that a face tan out here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new soap and skin album from gas to solid slash you are my friend this is the newest full-length album from Austrian singer-songwriter soap and skin whoo we have not heard from in a studio album capacity in about 6 years at this point not since 2012 s narrow which was a pretty unique record of art pop and chamber pop the LP featured a mix of these hushed beautiful piano songs which were incredibly haunting incredibly dreary and topped with the womanly and haunting voice of Anja Francisca plush now there were also a couple of tracks on this thing that featured very ominous and heavy almost industrial ish instrumentation moments that not only made for major high points on this album but also set anja apart from a lot of other singer songwriters out there and this was also a pretty scant record at 30 minutes in length I was hoping that whatever else came down the pipe eventually as far as a new album would be larger in terms of sound and scope but sadly from gas to solid and you are my friend is really neither of those things despite being a longer album the simple art pop piano songs for Anya are back once again but the tone and atmosphere of these tracks is noticeably lighter so not nearly as dark and despondent but somehow still really slow and patience testing and on top of it unfortunately the songs aren't nearly as compelling either which is truly unfortunate because part of narrows appeal for me was that the songs were so wonderful at their core that it didn't really matter how fast or upbeat they were play they still resonated they still shined unfortunately I cannot say that as the case for cuts on this thing like this day which features this descending lead vocal melody that after a while gets quite tedious cycles with no real progression or resolve it mostly just kind of meanders I do like the song's lyrics it would seem Anya's singing about being trapped in a destitute and corrupt society the tracks weepy violin accompaniment is kind of a nice touch too it's just a shame that it's not all hitched to a better song and even though I found the song Italy kind of pleasurable on the first listen once I kind of heard it in the context of the record it sort of reached a similar place for me to where the tracks key vocal melody after a while just got really tiresome really basic the songwriting just felt super super-thin despite the heavier sound on this track with droning pump organs and massive bass I mean I don't necessarily mind on paper that soap and skin is trying to change things up instrumentally on this record into a tambour of sounds that may play over a little better with like indie fans like the marching snares and twanging ringing lead melodies and pianos on the song atham or the completely unexpected synth odyssey on the song falling the problem is though is that the instrumental additions on these tracks feel really just sloppy or maybe they're just awkwardly applied they feel sort of unsure like each piece of new instrumentation or melodic idea doesn't quite know what it should be doing where it should be standing so most of it is just kind of like haphazardly filling space because it has to be there I think the song foot chamber is another prime example of this though this song stood out to me because the tune is so faint and almost non-existent to the point where it can barely carry the horns and pianos the vocal harmonies all of which come together like in a nasty drunken lullaby which again is a shame because a lot of the instrumentation on this thing sounds like it was recorded pretty well it could sound much prettier or even much darker had the writing been better the song surrounded is maybe the biggest anomaly on the entire record in that it features a pretty well written song combined with some tastefully executed and assembled instrumentation that comes together into a very powerful and invigorating climax with a wall of strings and soaring lead vocals it's such a focused and well groomed cut that is completely counteracted by other songs on this thing whose inclusion into this record are just perplexing like the closing track on this record which is the slowest and shoddiest cover of what a wonderful world I've ever heard in my entire life and generally I'm all for the idea of taking popular songs and slowing them down to the point where they basically become a depressive dirge but the execution is is really kind of shaky the very spaced out piano chords the lead vocals it just feels very off and not really in a dark surreal or unsettling way then there are cuts on this thing like creep this is water as well as the track palindrome which comes off like a very artsy religious chant songs that feel more like song sketches or stretched-out interludes there's not really a strong song or musical idea at the core of these cuts they mostly just provide filler and the tracklist it would be easier to overlook the inclusion of these tracks if the songs they were surrounded by carried more weight to the point where you needed a bit of a breather in between songs but unfortunately that's not the case and all these tracks really end up doing is just killing time unfortunately this is just not really the album I hoped it would be at all and not even really just in terms of Oh Anya changed her sound it's a total flip or whatever I mean sure while there are some instrumental pallets on this record I didn't necessarily expect for the most part what really keeps this album from succeeding is the songwriting is just much more lackluster than it was on the last album even Anya's previous EP had that as well as the arranged instrumentation on this thing been better I could see my way to liking the brighter and lighter sound of this record much more I'm feeling a light two DS and four on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please

QxqCaR0jFQU,hi everyone Johnathan Ilan Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Black Thought and Salaam Remi ep streams of thought vol 2 this is a brand new EP from Philly rapper and primo lyricist for the group the roots Black Thought who dropped the first installment of streams of thought just this past summer 5 tracks wall to wall production from the legendary 9th wonder easily one of the better short form hip hop projects I've heard so far this year something that left me wondering when the next installment was going to come around and here it is it's here now right here it is although Black Thought has seen fit to switch things up with a different producer Salaam Remi whose production credits include people like Jay Cole and Eminem nas also Cee Lo and The Fugees as well as the late Amy Winehouse so just based on past efforts alone Remmy seems kind of like a perfect fit a guy who's gonna put his own spin on the usual mix of jazz and funk and soul that black thought sounds best over and the instrumentals on this thing range from the sweet and groovy soundtrack to confusion to the very grim and dramatic fentanyl then there's the very mystical and ominous how to hold the choppa on top of which Black Thought delivers this kind of spaced out very slow flow and delivery a little more easygoing than usual in fact it sort of sounds like something off of a Cobham with how I guess subtle the approaches in a way the opening lyrics on this track read dark room with the cloak draped over the mic colloquium light the smoke from the opium pipe which yeah the track sounds exactly like how those lyrics read long story short the production on this thing is pretty solid it's not mind-blowing it's not cutting edge or anything but it does present black thought in a good way in a positive way it just sort of fits with what you typically expect from him aesthetically meanwhile Black Thought himself is as lyrical as ever and offers up a slight change of pace from the previous EP in that one there are no other guest rappers featured on this thing there are more songs on this record nine instead of the five off of the previous EP though many of them are pretty short just a minute inch and for the most part the tracks and instrumentals on this record segue or transition into one another making a lot of the tracks on this thing linked up for a pretty seamless 23 minute listen as far as highlights on this EP goes there is the chilling intro track fentanyl which is essentially about death and overdoses in the opioid crisis it gets pretty grim as Black Thought lyrically references artists that have been taken from us due to overdoses over the past several years basically lacing the measurable effects of this crisis with some pretty vivid poetry in a way the musical tone as well as black thoughts flow on this track and many others on this EP reminds me of when Ghostface Killah linked up with Adrian young and his band for like that 12 reasons to die record and basically everything you sort of done in that vein since and while it's not the most refreshing sound or anything it is done pretty well the following soundtrack to confusion I think can be boiled down into a single line toward the beginning of the track that black thought spits I'm channeling uncertainty and using it to tell the story of winning in life and losing it as well yeah I mean if you think about those two lines that really does kind of get to the core of what a lot of black thought is on about generally in his lyrics because as to be expected on this EP black thought pretty much just has that beast flow that nasty voice just dropping really slick talk on dark realities with quite a few quotables and some pretty clever wordplay too and that is pretty consistent throughout the entire EP I mean there are a few spots that do make me raise an eyebrow where I think black thought presents like an away some anti-vaxxers and there are a few spots where lyrically black thought does come off like he's just kind of spitting a hysterical lyrical spiritual miracle and a swimming pool like on the intro to the song long liveth or on the intro to the song streets where he says my cranium is vibranium my brain is uranium and titanium and even though I do like that black thought is cut from a different cloth not only from his contemporaries but for many of the other young rappers today there are moments on here where his will to go against the grain feels more like mere contrarian ism than it does some kind of natural drive thought is truly at his most on the cep when he is speaking from personal experience or diving into some really deep and unlikely cultural references they far from rock-solid they soldiers terracotta of my philosophy I'm the father like Aristotle I will put an end to your whole saga you Harry Potter's is soft your rhymes IMO mines is non-gmo I'm a vessel a vehicle y'all don't see it though or on the song how to hold the choppa where thought says Gramps told my father they sold his Papa for gold and copper even though he was the strongest cropper now am I wrong to teach my son to properly hold a choppa which makes me want to take my hat off and just go that's a lot the closing track on this thing is pretty strong as well these soulful vocals laced into the beat are inspiring and fantastic also when a guest singer does manage to pop up on the CP it does provide a nice bit of counterpoint and and structure to these tracks many of which come off just like loose free styles and even though I do like the fact that many of the tracks on this thing link up on this EP it does sort of leave a lot of the songs on here sounding kind of say me and you know that's the thing while there is definitely an incredible amount of talent going into the instrumentals going into black thoughts flows and lyrics it does feel a little one-dimensional at least with the shorter volume one of streams of thought there were other guest rappers on there it didn't really kind of draw on quite as long it's unfortunate that no other voices sort of are presented on this EP I mean with Volume one it was so awesome hearing black thought on the same track as a new rapper who's also carrying that lyrical torch like Rhapsody hopefully if there's another installment in this EP series something can be done where maybe that's kind of a bit of a mini concept featuring people exactly like that because it did seem like that there is at least a little bit of a vibe or a direction or a very loose sound or theme kind of driving both of these EPS so far and while I'm listening things off that I would have liked some more cutting edge production I think wouldn't have heard and I will say I think the quality ratio of the bars on the first EP was maybe a little bit better than on this one too sometimes it does feel like black thought is just kind of throwing whatever he feels like out there that sounds vaguely cool or impressive regardless of whether or not it has all that much substance to it not a bad ap though pretty decent listen I say keep them coming and volume three em I'm looking forward to it feelin a decent too strong seven on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it digit eight it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

VozueZjxlic,ahem ahem-hem-hem hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for an assessment of the new nominations that have come out of the Grammy Awards for the 61st Grammy award show that's happening next year like I said we have the nominations right here through the power of the internet online and I'm pretty much gonna go through the major categories the ones that piqued my interest the most in this upcoming Grammy Awards and pick the ones that I think are likely to win but also the ones that I would like to win let's go ok ok ok to kick things off we have the general filled with record of the year in which we have a lot of nominations I am actually surprised you've gotten this many nominations but it seems like they've almost kind of over nominated for a lot of the fields this year I don't know if they are trying to prevent people from feeling snubbed or left out or trying to prevent as much controversy as possible around like oh you didn't include this I mean I understand that I understand wanting to create less drama because so many people sort of demand so many things from the Grammys as is but still they're really kind of throwing a lot at you and I'm not exactly sure if every single track here should have made the cut regardless though record of the year we have I like it with cardi B J Balvin at that track off of her latest full-length album which isn't a bad track it's an OK track the joke Brandi Carlile which got a few nominations I've heard the track it's it's ok she's a country song stris and it's a pretty sad powerful piano ballad though I'm not exactly sure if I think the song is as culturally poignant and necessary as the people who clearly nominated it do moving on from there this is America childish gambino Drake God's plan shallow Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper all the stars Kendrick Lamar Sousa from the of course black panther soundtrack a rock star post Malone at 21 savage and Zedd and Maren Morris and gray the track the middle I mean of those tracks the favorites of mine are probably I like it this is America and rock star but preferably I would I would like to go to this is America I would like to go to this is America I think that's the best out of all the tracks their album of the year in which we also have quite a few nominations we have the Black Panther original soundtrack Golden Hour Kacey Musgraves I'm going to just come right out and say I don't want either of those two janelle monae dirty computer I would be absolutely floored if that one it's a pretty great pop record beer bongs in Bentley's post Milan I do like but I don't think I prefer it to a dirty computer her I'm actually surprised that she got the nomination for album of the year her musics not bad it doesn't really stand out to me as far as like commercial R&B goes or anything but it's it's it's certainly not awful scorpion Drake no by the way I forgive you Brandi Carlile again which I'm not all that crazy about an invasion of privacy car DB which is a record I don't dislike but I think in this category I'm just gonna have to go dirty computer I would like it to be dirty computer and if the Grammys end up sort of falling upon their usual mix of hey let's try to find what's mainstream and accessible but simultaneously let's try to pick something that's a little artsy that may in fact end up being the record that they land upon however if they're thinking more in terms of like what's popular what sales what's the most relevant they might end up landing on the Black Panthers now track they might end up landing on post Malone or even most likely end up landing with cardi B for song of the year we have all the stars obviously from the Black Panthers soundtrack once more Ella Mae's boot up we have God's plan Drake in my blood Shawn Mendes the joke Brandi Carlile again the middle once more Zedd Maren Morris and gray shallow Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga this is America Donald I obviously would like this is America too to win on that one I do think it is the most culturally relevant track in the entire list maybe they will try to go more accessible again and they'll pick all the stars or maybe God's plan or something like that but you know or maybe they'll even go a super duper duper duper white America safe and pick the Brandi Carlile track I'm not sure but preferably I would like this America we have the best new artist field over here which honestly I have zero investment in this field no artist here really made an album that I liked this year I mean I would maybe going forward like to see more from her it would be cool it would be certainly neat to see her walk away with the Grammy on this Best New Artist category but yeah I wasn't really crazy with the recent output of any of these artists pop solo performance we have Beck colors Camila Cabello Havana live God is a woman Ariana Grande Joanne from Lady Gaga and better now post Malone that this these could not be the best 5 pop solo performances of the year are they is is this seriously the field I mean I like the post Malone song and I like the ariana grande song but as far as solo pop performances there there had to have been better choices than this throughout the year no I mean jeez I mean it would be cool to see ariana grande walk away with it the post Malone better now I do love that track and I also have a soft spot for it because when I first heard I said this track is gonna be big this track is gonna be a hit and in fact it became one because it sounds like a friggin hit so I mean I would love to see either of those two tracks walk away with it though I would not be surprised to see Lady Gaga do it or if the Grammys pull another Beck and everybody's just like whoo Beck we like him yeah even when he's not coming out with with good music Best Pop duo/group Performance it's fall in line Christina Aguilera Backstreet Boys Tony Bennett Lady gaga Bradley Cooper maroon 5 Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton on say something the middle once more with Zedd another category I am NOT invested in at all which is kind of unfortunate because I don't recall there being even two categories in the major fields of last year's Grammy pics then I was like wow I don't I don't care for any of it Best Pop Vocal album we have a camila cabello x' new record we have kelly clarkson ariana grande shawn mendes pink taylor swift i'm just gonna have to go ariana grande I mean it would seem that the industry on the whole has been kind of sick of the new Taylor Swift record so I'm not exactly sure if I can predict her walking away with it maybe they'll go super safe and and pick Shawn Mendes maybe they will acknowledge Camila because she's relatively the biggest up-and-comer in this whole list but I I would prefer ariana grande if she definitely had the best pop album out of this field we have best dance and electronic album over here we have John Hopkins latest record singularity which I liked quite a bit woman worldwide justice which I didn't end up reviewing but I don't see how I would end up preferring that to John Hopkins so if he took her tree house Sophie oil of every pearls on insides yes yes yes and shout out to a toki monsta as well for the loon rouge record the surprised Sophie made it into this but I'm gonna have to go Sophie as much as I did enjoy the John Hopkins record the Sophie album for the most part is amazing and that's a pretty significant nomination there not only because of such an avant-garde record but you're talking about a transgender songwriter producer creator is well there so wow really really unexpected there as you can tell I did not sort of a spoil any of these for myself for the most part outside of like the the top album and song nominations but very surprised and very happy to see that I would love love love love love to see Sophie walk away with that if anybody watching does have the opportunity to vote in this upcoming you know Grammy Awards and you have not listened to this Sophie record yet please for the love of God do because it is great I promise it will definitely stir some kind of emotion in you next we have the best rock performance category four out of five Arctic Monkeys when bad does good Chris Cornell made in America the fever three three three Greta Van Fleet highway tune hailstorm uncomfortable um I mean I do like that Arctic Monkeys track but it's I feel like Arctic Monkeys latest record barely even qualifies as a rock album it's like a loungy soft rock record if a rock album at all I I do kind of like some of the stuff the fever has been doing as of late even if it is a little too infused with like pop music for me to kind of like really get into how edgy it's it's trying to be as sort of seems like a little bit of a watered down sort of rap rock punk sound in a way but I certainly think it has a lot of potential going down the road the Chris Cornell track I'm sort of indifferent to for the most part though still rest in peace - Chris great singer great talent all around obviously I'm not very much another Greta Van Fleet hoon yeah I mean I it would be really cool and exciting to see the fever do it though I predict it's most likely gonna go to Cornell or Arctic Monkeys although I feel like I'm not really properly assessing here how much of an industry-wide boner do people who are voting for these awards have for the band Greta Van Fleet I mean I wasn't really crazy about them there are a lot of fans that have certainly pushed back on the record but for the most part it would seem that a lot of like the rock press just friggin can't get enough of them so maybe I'm completely off the mark here and the word is most likely going to go to Greta Van Fleet actually actually that that might just be the case best metal performance Between the Buried and Me deafheaven honeycomb which is interesting that's interesting that they would they would land in they're high on fire electric Messiah Trivium and we have under oath two best metal performance and no ghosts no ghosts in here really no ghost at all no ghost in this it's cool to see high on fire and deafheaven in here I would love to see either of those two especially high on fire walk away with the award though it is more likely that one of the more popular acts here will get it between the Buried and Me or under oath though some of these metal performances they can be a little unpredictable because you you never really know who people are gonna go for best rock song we have a black smoke rising from Greta Van Fleet jumpsuit 21 pilots which I would love to see walk away with an award because it is a great track mantra Bring Me The Horizon st. Vincent mass seduction rats from ghosts okay well there's a ghost nomination right there um yeah I mean as much as I do love jumpsuit and I did really like that Tia t.o.p record yeah I'm gonna say rats I just fucking love that song it's a it's a great song it's great video it's a great record it's great everything ghost ghost deserves a Grammy for Best Rock song truly it is a great song Best Rock Album here we go the new Alice in Chains record which I did not like at all of a new Fall Out Boy record which is barely a rock album the new ghost record prequel amazing awesome excited to see that a Pacific daydream witch from Weezer it's it's also barely a rock album it's actually Weezer's probably most mainstream pop friendly record yet then we also have Greta Van Fleet from the fires and yeah can't can't really say I'm excited to see any of these walk away with the award other than ghosts and I just hope that that it ends up being the case best alternative album the new Arctic Monkeys tranquility base Hotel and Casino the new Beck the new björk the new David Byrne and the new st. Vincent I feel like my favorite of this group has to be the new Bjork it's definitely the New York I mean I did like a lot of tracks off of the David Byrne but I feel like the Bjork record was a bolder artistic statement whereas the David Byrne was something that David it's it's kind of been a sound that he's been toying with for a little while now just slightly updated the Bjork record definitely was a lot more adventurous with the woodwinds and the bird sounds and some of the personal emotional story she was telling on that record so I would actually love to see Bjork get a get a Grammy for utopia please please for the love of God Best R&B performance as long as I live Toni Braxton some of the Carters yoy while a Hathaway best part her featuring Daniel Caesar pjmartin first began another category of not really all that invested in outside of you know that that track featured Daniel Caesar best part is pretty decent can't really say I was really all that into the carters record frankly and I know there were other R&B performances and recordings out there this past year that were certainly more intriguing than a lot of these I mean I mostly chalk my lack of enthusiasm up to just just not not some very intriguing pics I don't know I guess I'll just say that as far as best R&B song goes we have boot-up with Ella Mae we have come through and chill with Miguel and J Cole and Salaam Remi we have feels like summer with Dominic Glover focus from her and long as I live with Toni Braxton once more yeah I mean as much as I was lukewarm on it when I first heard in fact I don't really think I cared for it that much when I first heard it I would love to see that childish gambino track walk away with it either that or boot up I mean even though I wasn't really crazy about the rest of her album Ella Mae's record that is I did think the remix of that track was pretty cool and she's easily one of the biggest and newest artists to break this year and that childish gambino record if it's as good as its most likely going to be when that album finally drops like that record is probably gonna get so many Grammy nominations probably gonna get so many Grammy nominations in the rap category we have the best rap performance cardi B Drake king's dead from the soundtrack Black Panther soundtrack once more bubbling Anderson PAC which is at Rackham sad did not make it on to his new full-length album and sicko mode with Travis Scott Drake sweetly big Hawk wow that's a that's a pretty steep performance list um I personally I love bubblin I loved bubbling and as much as I do love it I think I would love to see sicko mode walk away with it it is a great track it does have a few parts I'm not super crazy about but it is a great song it is a really forward-thinking futuristic psychedelic rap track that in a lot of ways I think embodies the current hip-hop meta in a way that none of the other tracks on this thing do though again I wouldn't be surprised if the Grammy has decided to go ridiculous with it and just give it to Kings dead you know or do a bit of a safe pick here and go car DB or Drake with the best rap and sung performance we have Christina Aguilera with gold link black and Jake Cole trial - Gambino this is America once more all the stars rock star post Malone a 21 Savage once more I'm gonna have to go this is America it is a great track it's a great track all around deserves all the Grammys it's nominated for as far as I'm concerned best rap song God's plan Kings dead lucky you Eminem featuring Joyner Lucas not really that great of a track so I'm not going to be a advocating for that win with j-rock don't really care for that one either but and cinco mode is on here once again and yeah I would like sicko mode to win cinco mode should win something it should win something it is a great track and here we have Best Rap Album category we have cardi B's new record Mac Miller's new record Nipsey Hussle zni record nipsey somehow made it in here okay that's fine Daytona Pusha T and Travis Scott the Grammys most definitely I think will play it safe in this category either picking cardi B or they may want to tribute Mac Miller you know because he passed away recently and the industry seems to have taken very warmly to his last full-length album I obviously was not crazy about it but that's just me Pusha T's new record I think is fantastic as well as Travis Scott's however I think push a tee and nipsey hussle are a little bit more of the underdog picks in this category I think it's most likely gonna go to Travis or work cardi but uh yeah that's that's my thought best country solo performance would love to see Chris Stapleton get it best country duo and group performance I'm not really that invested in that one so but in the best country album category I would like to see the volume to record from Chris Stapleton walk away with it because it is a pretty great record the American roots category does have some nominations that I'm interested in Willie Nelson as well as even the Brandi Carlile record for the performance category looks pretty sweet also best American roots song build a bridge with Mavis Staples and Jeff Tweedy is a pretty decent track wouldn't wouldn't hate seeing that track walk away with an award as well as knockin on your screen door from John Prine John prions latest record is actually a pretty solid album and knockin on your screen door is one of the cutest songs on there and it seems that prime even has two songs nominated in this category also the track summer's end probably not my favorite of those two tracks but I guess being nominated twice in one category does increase your likelihood of winning an award also seeing Prine nominated in the Best Americana album category is pretty encouraging as well the tree of forgiveness if you guys have not heard it it is a solid album the best recording package section does have a few interesting nominations in there the new Minsky record be the cowboy is in there as well as mass seduction from st. Vincent also the new BTS record love yourself tear I mean if there is something I did enjoy about the st. Vincent album I did love the cover I did love the packaging I did love the look of it and the color scheme I do have to credit it as being very bold and I grabbing and creative so I would most likely go with that personally also there's a Weird Al Yankovic best box or special edition package category nomination which is I guess fun I will never understand what exactly goes in the criteria of best best album notes best liner notes best music video actually has some really interesting picks in it this is kind of a fire music video lineup we have a pet from the Carters we have this is America we have Joyner Lucas I'm not racist we have pink from Janelle Monae we also have a mobile jumbo from Tierra wack man that is a hard pick because I do love this is America I would love to see Tara whack walk away with it because that whole visual experience for the wack world record is actually super creative it's amazing it's immersive it's colorful it's off-the-wall it's surreal the Janelle Monae music video is very fun though I don't think it's the best music video to come out of the album roll out of her new record I mean it's most likely in this category going to go to this as America though I would personally like to see teairra whack get it and everybody that those are pretty much my opinions and picks for this upcoming Grammy Awards the 61st and I don't know I guess I will see you guys next year for a follow-up video to talk about whether or not any of my personal picks or predictions ended up going through you're the best I love you over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana a mama mama mama mama mama music forever 
A38GRCfbJkw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new xxx 10th asean album skins this is the new posthumous album from rapper singer and songwriter xxx 10th Ozzy own who was tragically murdered this past summer in broad daylight he just released a pretty successful sophomore record in March and he was still awaiting trial for domestic abuse charges that have since been dropped due to his death however X is passing did not stop the promotion or the release of his music as bad vibes forever in connection with Empire Records still plan to put out more ex music sooner rather than later and at this point who knows maybe what's on this new album over here is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what ex's label is willing to release of his leftovers what's for sure is that as long as X's music is in the spotlight and it's continuing to be released and promoted his public image is going to be in the spotlight too as this past October pitchfork media dropped a previously unreleased audio recording of what sounded like X admitting to the abuse he was charged with that being said I don't really feel like this is a review or I'm going to be talking about the music on this album all that much mostly because there is so little here there are 10 tracks on this new record they amount to 20 minutes or so the first track is an intro for the most part the tracks on this thing just feel very roughly pieced together to somewhat resemble maybe an image of possibly an album tracks like whoa mind and awe as well as I don't let go just feature X faintly vocalizing and kind of rapping very softly over a pretty skeletal instrumental it very much sounds like just a sketchy idea for a song and that's it X's label didn't even properly mix these tracks before they came out the difference interlude is another completely unnecessary and tedious moment on this record the thought that an album like this could have an interlude when it sounds nearly as demo quality and just as brief as everything else on here somehow this thing sounds less finish than many of the roughly recorded emo full cuts off of X's 17 and even some of that turns up on this thing most notably on the closer the fact that M I would drop this album in the state that it is just goes to show how desperate they are to get more streams off of X's name and that's it because they're literally just reassembling the cutting room floor and painting it as an album one more thing that makes me feel that way is that this album doesn't even feel like the artistic direction X was forecasting to on his last album as his last record featured more tracks more variety some longer songs cuts that just were straight rock instrumentals and there is a little bit of that here but again it feels like it's just in a diminished capacity because much of what's on skins just doesn't feel finished from the lead single bad which pretty much reads like the other two near demo cuts on here but maybe the vocals are a little bit better recorded it's still barely structured enough to be a song X for the most part his lead vocals just kind of sound like a very faint nasally idea of a hook not really something he's kind of saying all that boldly because I don't know if he was going to end up changing it down the road or something the song one minute with Kanye West it's it's titled one minute but ironically it's the only track on here that breaches three minutes I don't know what to say about this song I I guess I just hope that all parties involved are at least chose to be involved are proud of what they did here I guess in a way I kind of admire it for trying to bring rap rock back but one the track features this awful lead guitar riff I don't know what this sound is is it a horrible sample is it something coming out of a keyboard I'm not sure or is it coming out of a DAW I don't know it just feels like the worst imitation of a guitar riff and it's just so static and repeats so plainly across the length of almost the entire instrumental it's kind of annoying in the first few seconds of the song and my god in the last minute it's like torture where a minute mama X only comes in on the tail end of the song because there's not enough of him to actually make this an entire track that's why Kanye has to fill out most of it but before I go on to yeas verse I will say there was a ridiculous part on this track just before the last chorus and bridge where X lets out this really long brutal scream but the thing is some studio wizard took a chunk of his scream and looped it over and over and over so that his scream would stretch out eight full bars because it literally sounds like he's going ah meanwhile with Kanye's verse he just reads us so painfully desperate for attention and acceptance from this new wave of music listeners who inhabit X's fan base one bar after another in Kanye's verse is pretty much meant just to give people who are still deflecting on the X allegations up until this day a bit of a comfort blanket like oh you know it's it's okay it's alright while simultaneously delegitimizing the claims of people who have suffered abuse I mean I get it innocent until proven guilty there's a reason that it's a primary function of our judicial system but why you would want to argue that point I don't know after an audio recording surfaces of the person whose track you're on claiming to have fucked up his ex-girlfriend and stabbed multiple people honestly this makes me miss when Kanye was on the mega train because somehow it was less cringy honestly the only parts on this record I really liked were guardian angel again not really a full track on this record but despite its brevity I am kind of impressed by the intense and speedy and passionate rapping that X delivered onto the track the instrumental though pretty much just sounds like a reversed version of the Jocelyn Flores beat though the songs staring at the sky doesn't sound like much at first it does kind of kick off like another piece of emo folk from X with some nasally vocals and some basic lyrics and an acoustic guitar lick but when it eventually goes full-fledged into this heavy distorted hook it's actually kind of great and reminds me of a lot of old-school very heavy lo-fi scream Oh music from back in the day a sound you don't really hear all that much anymore I wonder how much of that sound in this track is X coincidentally channeling it or if he was aware of a lot of these old-school screamo groups then there's train which I actually think ranks as one of X's best tracks ever where it's kind of a narrative cut over a low fire sound effect filled instrumental with these very dreary and dark pianos the beat in a way kind of makes me think of like what Phil elrom from Mount Airy would do if he had to make a hip-hop beat or something X wraps over the track about essentially trying to go home walking there he goes by some train tracks and there's this dark figure who's essentially torturing him and tormenting him personified as death I believe and he essentially makes our protagonists meet his end on the tracks of a train I guess it's a pretty dark track outside of that though I didn't really like anything that this album had to offer skins is easily one of the least gratifying projects that I've heard this year however I cannot lay the lack of gratification at the feet of the artists who this album is titled after I put that instead on the individuals who decided to take part in this project and to release it as it currently is in it's very clearly unfinished state and not label it properly as like just leftovers or b-sides or whatever which it very apparently is I'm feeling a decent two on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please

qaD2eyTJoj0,hi everyone ah ah Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new ski mask the slump guide albums Stokes dopey this is the new commercial debut album of ski mask the slump god whose work I've covered a few times up until this point because I think his voice his flowed his lyrics are some of the most unique in the soundcloud scene at the moment I guess if you could even call it that anymore his voice is kind of husky with a light rasp he's not afraid to lose it on the mic to when he needs to his flow is visceral it's speedy occasionally dizzying his bars are consistently crude hilarious and kind of absurd with numerous references to games and bodily functions and cartoon shows like SpongeBob and Danny Phantom and Ben 10 in my favorite anime to drinkin jesh really anything to sound weird and get a rise out of his audience even lace his tracks full of these very zany ad-libs what's been holding me back from loving a ski mask project up until this point though has been his mixtapes brevity and inconsistency but since this album is ski masks official commercial debut record I was kind of hoping he would go a little bigger pull out all the stops and resolve some of the underwhelming issues that I've had with his projects in the past unfortunately though Stokley is every bit as much a mixed bag as its predecessors despite ski masks best efforts to draw this record out a little bit and vary up its style and sound first off this thing is 32 minutes long which is not the longest record in the world but certainly feels like a marathon by ski masks the slump gods standards and even though he does shoot for some longer song links on this thing there are a few tracks that actually reach the 3-minute mark these songs actually end up being some of my least favorite on the record meanwhile other cuts on here like get geeked feel more like a rough sketchy idea for a song more than it does an actual song though for me brevity is not the biggest issue when it comes to ski masks music mostly because his flow and his lyrics are so eccentric that they leave a pretty huge impact in a short amount of time what's more disappointing on this album is seeing ski mask essentially creatively paint himself into a corner on a handful of tracks that feel utterly by the numbers or tracks that totally fall flat as he tries to step out side of his comfort zone I'm talking about the intro track on this thing where he tries to pull off this Moni spacious atmospheric moody trap thing I mean it's 2018 we've heard dozens of artists attempt this sound at this point however in this instance it feels like it takes forever for the song to even begin and even develop by the time it's over I I really don't feel like I've heard much of anything other than just elongated filler the vocals are really sloppily executed this sound is really not in ski masks wheelhouse so why he would go at it for so long and start his new album off with it I really have no idea and sadly this is not the only time on this album where he goes in this direction the song saved me part - sounds like a buttery blend of pop trap and R&B and personally I don't really think ski masks voice his personality his flow really fits over this ultra slick style of production it really sounds more fit for a Chris Brown song granted the other two tracks that shoot for more melodic style are not nearly as bad the song you and I as well as far gone with little baby but I wouldn't call either of them highlights meanwhile almost a third of this album contains tracks that could have landed on skis to previous mixtapes and just got lost in the haze because they sound so utterly average somewhat left field track beat a kind of forgettable hook a few funny quotables here and there like I beyond they asked like a fucking bike seat I'm talking about tracks like adults swim and unbothered and get geeked as well as the closing track cat piss with little yachty which was kind of disappointing I thought that him and yadi would have a bit more chemistry on this cut it's not nearly as exciting as seeing ski and juice world totally go off on the song nuketown the performance is on this track are some of the punk is shit I've heard on a track beat in 2018 and as long as we're talking highlights on here I have to mention the song foot fungus which has one of the weirdest and funkiest beats on the entire record which combined with the elongated on the hook the track essentially sounds like sound clouds answer to snoop dogg and Pharrell's drop it like it's hot the flow that ski mask shows off on the hook also kind of leads me to this conclusion the song la la is also a highlight on here it sounds like one of the incredibly in your face aggressive overblown bangers that sort of put ski masks xxx fantasy owned on the map earlier in their careers the Ronnie JB on this cut is pretty simple but effective as the selling point of the song is really how over the top and animalistic ski mask sounds on the beat not some of his best verses on the entire record though most of them just come off as a really edgy without enough levity the song reborn to rebell is another highlight on the record but mostly for its banger beat and sing-along hook the lyrics had this weird faux revolutionary tone that kind of read like I don't know giving a middle finger to the White House on top of a dune buggy spin in donuts while the country is just submerged into a nationwide riot it's wild it's fun it's edgy it's free but you know it doesn't really provide much else outside of that the song faucet failure is one of the weirdest surprises on this thing for the most part it sounds like another piece of weirdo trap from ski mask but then certain passages incorporate what sounds like a reggaeton beat but somehow it really works and kind of keeps things refreshing I mean overall this record isn't awful but it's still kind of a letdown because at this point ski masks career I was kind of hoping that he would totally just kill it surprise me come into his own a little bit more and define himself is just kind of being a cut above as a lot of the other artists who he's currently in competition with and sure while some of his best material is on this record some of his worst tracks are too as again there are quite a few songs on here for him that feel really predictable not all that memorable or are just totally lackluster attempts at trying to change things up so even though I came away from this record liking more songs than I didn't for sure I still don't really feel like this project is a true display of ski masks full potential and you know that's sad I'm feeling a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it's like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if the Bell as well over here is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana ski masks the slump god forever 
NBPPffw84r4,uh hi everyone voter suppression here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new 1975 album a brief inquiry into online relationships this is the latest full-length album from UK pop outfit the 1975 their third record to date and this thing has quickly become the band's most critically acclaimed release so far garnering high praise from across the music publication spectrum and it seems to be winning over a lot of fans - and I can see why this thing is easily the band's most mature and versatile record yet as they try their hands at a myriad of different styles outside of their usual guitar-driven pop anthem comfort zone the production on this thing generally is smooth its pristine but still pretty lively I do like the aesthetic of this record a lot I mean it just sounds pretty during its best moments the music on this thing radiates this feeling of pure bliss and euphoria and even though it might seem pretty obvious what this record is about given its name I still do give the 1975 credit for making this album slightly more conceptual than their last two I generally think the tracklist of this thing flows pretty well for an entire hour of music it certainly doesn't feel that long or it feels like the band are always presenting something new so the record continues to stay engaging and dynamic I can't say I'm coming away from this album as impressed as some people are though and it's not that I don't admire what the 1975 are shooting for on this album I do but some of it is just either half-baked or ill-conceived typically when this record works for me the band are playing it pretty straight like on the single loved it if we made it which was a teaser track I enjoyed upon first listen and it's only growing on me in the context of the record I love the tense and sweet instrumental on this thing building up against some really passionate vocals the lyrics essentially about society's unresolved problems or even worse and problems as we have transitioned into this modern age and even though the track takes really long to resolve into the first hook when it eventually gives the listener to the payoff it is amazing it's rare that you see such a mainstream pop act out there willing to tell the audience no you have to wait for the payoff just a little bit but believe me when the eventually does let go into this gargantuan shimmering eighties esque chorus it's great I also like the band's attempt at a pop and R&B blend on sincerity is scary the loving cascading but kind of messy horns the skipping beat the intimate vocals it's all pretty endearing and it gets even better as the band introduces these huge panoramic chorus vocals which honestly really lights the song up why can't we be friends when we out of us easily one of my favorite tracks the band has done so far the 1980s and specifically pop rock and synth pop continued to be a huge influence deeper into the record like on the song it's not living if it's not with you a track that probably would have ruled the radio had been released decades ago the slick guitar licks and high gloss finishing orgasmic chorus on the song are wonderful I also love the sentiment of the song too even though it's probably been said a thousand times over I do like the idea of just life and the world being a miserable place without this person who you have in mind I also love the slow burning and dramatic build-up of the track inside your mind the track feels like staring at a bunch of old Polaroids and crime when you're overcome with nostalgia or I don't know running across the beach like in slow motion with a sunset in the background in a wide-angle shot looking real cinematic also these strings and wailing guitar lead on this cut are pretty iconic too I couldn't be more in love is another pretty ballad on the album seems like an old-school contemporary R&B throwback from the 80s again just based on the synth Tambor alone just based on the synth patch alone and the closure I always want to die sometimes is a strong finish for the record though stylistically the song comes from like more of a 90s alternative rock slash Britpop place with a splash of shoegaze influence coming out of the production feels almost like something that could have come off of Radiohead's first album or whatever songwriting wise anyway songwriting wise I do think the the pillowy fresh and ultra clean sound of this record is is something specific to the the 1975 even as they embark upon a lot of these old-school sounds and there are a lot of great moments on selphie that come from referencing back for sure when things on this album go awry is really when they are I guess going contemporary or a little left-field like the bands attempt at a jazz number on the song mind which essentially sounds like a combination of the blandest most forgettable elevator jazz you've ever heard with some really middling forgettable mainstream pop so I'm writing it's Pleasant while it's on but not nearly as engaging as a lot of what's here then there's the ridiculous spoken word passage the man who married a robot and while I appreciate conceptually what the band are trying to do here how the song adds to the themes the major themes of this record it still does not change that this thing reads like I don't know a lost chunk of a script from Spike Jones as her fused with a bad for chant copypasta the track overall is much more annoying than I think the band intended it to be there are some other tracks here that would otherwise be okay if not for the obnoxious auto-tune laid on to them the song I like America and America likes me comes to mind it's easily the most grating cut on this entire record or the single - time - time to time which at first listen weeks and weeks ago I did not like maybe it's grown on me a smidge since then but I still do not care for it it mostly sounds like an upper-crust appropriation of several different cooler music styles that have been blended to the point where it's hard to tell where one starts and another one ends and for whatever reason the song be my mistake reads like what would happen if you forced Ed Sheeran and perfume genius to write a song together but it simultaneously scratches neither itch that both of those artists kind of serve and the track how to draw along with everything that develops after it is one of the most perplexing spots on the entire record the cup moves through numerous phases this extended somewhat pretty ambient ish intro an electronic instrumental suddenly pops up that sounds like a ripoff of a postal service beat there's like an ominous electronic breakbeat passage that it shifts into at some point suddenly at one point the track actually develops into an actual song with lead vocals but the vocals are pitch shifted downward into this deep whiny Tambor that's nearly unlistenable I can appreciate the band wanting to change things up a little bit structurally an experiment and do something different but every idea the group shifts into on this song is just worse than the one before it the song give yourself a try is another moment where I do enjoy the social commentary coming out of the lyrics I also think these super simple and minimal electronic beat is pretty compelling along with the lead vocal melody however these squawking and somewhat over driven and highly mixed lead guitar is not something I would have made as prominent on a majority of the track it makes the song sound more one dimensional than it actually is all in all though I like this record a lot quite a few improvements on the band's last LP I did like thematically what they were going for even if many of the risks they took here didn't quite pan out I guess I could also say this thing paves the way for more promise than their last record did and once again I could see this album appealing to a lot of people that are very much not me but I think in order for that to be the case the rougher more ill-conceived spots on this thing would need to resonate with you much more deeply than they did with me I'm feeling a decent - a strong six on this LP transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't

G6em044hErc,"Hi everyone, Anthony Fantano here, the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Earl Sweatshirt album Some Rap Songs. This is the third full length album from poet, song writer and abstract hip-hop word ninja, Earl Sweatshirt. It's been a few  years since we last heard from Earl in a studio album capacity, his 2015 record I Don't Like Shit I Don 't Go Outside was his last. That year was also the same when the hip-hop collective that helped pave his way to fame, Odd Future, had pretty much become defunct as a cohesive unit. Though Earl's absence from the group during their peak of hype kinda became a rallying cry across every corner of the internet. On music boards, on social media; every music publication under the sun as well as even traditional outlets like the New York Times Free him, free my boy Earl Free him now He's literally been free for like the past five years. We did it, we did it everybody We did it, good Job While Earl is a member of Odd Future and certainly a big reason as to why the group blew up there's always been something about him that's made him stand out amongst every other member in the group whether that be his literal geographic location Or his lyrical talent and attention to detail. Also, an uncompromising emotionally dark streak in his music. That not only made him stick out like a sore thumb in Odd Future, but really in the current hip-hop meta in general. And Earls anxieties, as well as his depression, have not been exactly a secret up unto this point They were on display in a big way on his last record and on top of it, earlier this year Earl canceled a entire European tour citing anxiety and depression as the reason why. Considering that I guessed months ago ""whatever Earl's next album is going to be will most likely be his darkest and maybe most dependent yet"" And the teaser tracks for this record like the Mint and Nowhere to Go certainly foretasted towards that Especially considering the songs gloomy lyrics, minimal structures and hypnotic experimental production "
sh7znEb3TQg,hi everyone flash the flash Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new Kai Whiston project Kai Weston Kai is a young buck from the UK who is fresh off of a little EP that he dropped via the big Dada label last year which has gotten a lot of support from the likes of igloo ghosts which is probably why his new record over here is coming out via the glue record label glue as an egg loogie glue glue kai is pretty much one more in a growing scene of music producers with a somewhat postmodern twist creating these massive multi-genre cacophony zuv glitchy bangers from the future explaining kai Weston's influences on this record is less like a crossroad and more like a multi-lane roundabout or like an intricate highway system with a series of on and off ramps going in routes that hit a variety of different directions as Kai's new record over here contains elements of industrial music and wacky and trap and glitch hop a bit of UK bass maybe a touch of bubblegum bass and a little bit of new metal in there as well for some reason there are some subtle nods on this record too to the heavy bass and gargantuan drops of dubstep but maybe a little bit smarter not too smart though this is not like dubstep with a bachelor's degree this is more like dubstep going to night school to get its GED and then maybe go on to learn a trade and it pasts all the classes but it didn't study that hard the grades weren't that good generally because most of the time it was worried about being the cool kid in the back of the class with some ripped jeans and an edgy band t-shirt does that does that explanation is is that enough for you I hope it is there are definitely some artistic parallels on this record too like the jittery rhythms of an igloo ghost track or the build ups and choppy samples of a Hudson Mohawke or even Arcas super abstract and post-industrial sound design kai will often find spaces in his hard-hitting and relentless tracks to work in some finer more regal instrumental passages that are a bit more atmospheric and moody and emotional like the haunting and rich synthesizers at the start of the opening cut on this thing all is fair in love and Kai Whiston or the moody little electric guitar licks that are introduced in the second leg of for fuck's sake a surprisingly long cut on this record at seven minutes with a passage that features some screen vocals and incredibly busy beats it's like listening to a fusion of Death Grips igloo ghost and emo trap some of which comes together pretty effectively though it does feel a little gimmicky at the end of the day what seems to leave an even larger mark on this record though is Kai Whiston sense of humor as there are tons of cheeky absurd and over-the-top samples and transitions all over this thing these screamed watermark that turns up periodically on this record the sky busted the mutated vocal samples on the track mushy seize the dream out of all of the chipmunk chatter that sounds like something out of an igloo ghost song on LSD more LSD than usual then there's the song druk which features these incessant vocal samples repeating again and again and again and again it sounds like something out of a ghetto house track kind of wish it were longer though and then there are some pretty novel and creative fusions of sounds and ideas on this record too like on the track brain fritter which sounds like Kai is taking an inspiration from that amazing tonight EP but trying to just over blow it and distort it to the loudest volume possible this track is brain demolishing with some meth sprinkled on top this track is not only laced with these horrifying sour synth swells but also distorted lead melodies that that feel like a guitar lick being sucked through a wormhole this record also has a vocal feature from the one and only Clarence clarity on the cut your secrets where I do wish vocally he contributed a little bit more to the track but it is a nice multi-phased Bangor where Kai does effectively use Clarence's voice as an instrument a sound just a sample to be chopped up and sort of played throughout various points of the track to add a bit more color it's a tasteful execution Kai for all of his BOM Basset II for being as obnoxious as he is in the DA he does seem to have quite a bit of technical skill and the taste to know when to push things and maybe when not to however in my opinion there is a bit of a lull in the last leg of the record and listen it's it's not for lack of volume or anything like that but I do think Kai hits a bit of a snag in some of the final moments of this album in that he has pushed the bangers on this record just about as far as he possibly can at this point in time anyway the song structures on this thing even start to suffer as the closing tractor seems to disappear suddenly into vapor at some point when Kai just kind of sounds like he has no more ideas to progress it any further than he's brought it Kai's compositions on this record for the most part are pretty maximal - and there are some moments where I do wish the mixing was a little bit better he just packs these things with sound and I feel like some of it could come out a bit more clearly or be a bit more overwhelming had it been more intelligible I guess there are also a few cuts on this thing that I think could have used a bit more structure a bit more length as a result of being as short and as one-dimensional as they are they do feel kind of like odds and ends or even filler all that being said though most of what is on this record though is pretty good it's colorful it's nearly lethal it's off-the-wall it's borderline insane and shows a lot of promise definitely a sound and definitely an artist I would like to hear more from in the future I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit

Dg3EqzHV7nQ,okay okay okay all right all right all right okay all right okay okay okay okay okay all right all right all right okay it's time for the weekly track round up everybody Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and I'm going to be going over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of this past week thankfully thankfully we have bounced back from the holiday week last week where we didn't have many songs to talk about this week not only do we have a ton of tracks to talk about with but we have a lot of good tracks to talk about this has been a pretty great week for singles in my opinion a lot of big and a lot of notable songs and fun entertaining enjoyable inspiring songs have drops first though let me shout out our sponsor in this video animator in illustrator mister Joran cul who for the holiday season has released a new nine-hour epic the 179 days of christmas it's the official 179 days of christmas song video and a cute little endearing animation doing a little happy dance next to the 179 days of christmas and yes this is not some half-assed version of the 12 days of christmas where he just kind of pads the song out by repeating stuff and so on and so forth Joran comes up with 179 separate things to celebrate for the 179 days of Christmas and they tend to get funnier and more hilarious as the the song progresses forward so we will leave a link to this video down below as well as to Joran's website and to his Instagram you may already be familiar with his work because he did those brief history of videos with pitchfork a little while back he's also done music video work for artists like They Might Be Giants so the dude has been around the block and enjoyed quite a bit at least what I saw of the 179 days of Christmas video admittedly I did not watch the whole thing I was not man enough do that but Jordan has told me to relay unto you if anybody for the holiday season is willing to withstand the 179 days of Christmas challenge and listen through the whole thing then you're a braver man than than I you're a braver man than I so again we will link to the video the song the animation down there in the description box also down there are our amazon associate and turntable lab associate links holiday season is here you need some presents for yourself or some other people people who buy colorful pressings of record some audio file gear turntables speakers get them via that turntable lab link we get kicked back from it supports the channel supports the segment and also want to shout out this new waves emo Christmas - track EP that has just dropped if you're looking for some Christmas music to ring in the holiday season give it a shot also want to give a shout out to the new Eminem 11 minute freestyle that just came out I'm not gonna really be going on about this freestyle in this video I am going to do a full-length sort of reaction slash review on the Fantana channel very soon so you can expect that they're not going to bog this video down with a half-assed analysis of this freestyle right now I'd rather kind of go over it second my second line by line in the video with you guys so let's get into the tracks that I thought were the worst of the week only a few honestly but they were pretty terrible first off Zane has a brand new single I really do not enjoy Zane's music I guess I feel like every time he goes out with a new single it's garbage and that's also true this new track over here titled rain berry you know honestly there are some bits of this song that aren't that bad but the bits that are awful are really so terrible that they ruin the entirety of the song and Zane insists on singing in this really off falsetto for a good deal of this song and it just sounds really week and it just sounds terrible it just sounds like he should not be singing in this register like this is just not his range however he does it all over the track it just sounds like pure trash and I don't know who professionally would have advised him to sing like this but whatever and also Skrillex did a remix of Travis Scott's Astroworld and it pretty much just sounds like the original version of the sound of the song but with a shittier bass and like some weird sound effects kind of orbiting the track at certain points eventually changes the beat up deeper into the song but it's one of the most pointless and annoying remixes I think I've ever had the pleasure of hearing so yeah let's get into the tracks that I thought were met man man man not blowing me away but not terrible certainly worth your attention let's give him a shot first December's are back traveling on brand new single believe it or not even though this is not the best section I think this is one of the December's better singles and a while kind of reminded me of the theatrical and charming and kind of organic instrumentation and in songwriting that I used to enjoy on the group's older records long before they went super slick and kind of dumb to their sound down a little bit this seems like a touch of a return to form dig the aesthetic dig the tune dig the vocal performance on this track a lot even if you threw this song on an older Decemberists record it wouldn't necessarily come out into the top five of all the songs on the album it is a decent cut it is a decent cut so hopefully they kind of continue on the streak and I don't know stopped watering their sound down moving on from there The Alchemist has a new record out and one of the big tracks teasers singles from it is this new collaborative cut with Earl titled ecoli it's a pretty cool left-field hip hop instrumental earl i don't think has as good a rap performance as I'm hearing on pretty much any cut from his new album but you know Earl fans you don't get a lot of material to work with anyway so you kind of excuse me you got to kind of take what you can get I guess so you know it's not a bad cut moving on from there saba has a brand new song out which didn't hit me as well as his last single did but it's still a pretty decent cut over here definitely nice to hear this up-and-coming rapper continue to define himself and drop more material moving on from there this Australian duo I believe their name is khlo KL ello I'm not sure how I pronounce it exactly but they have a smart and a passionate new little single out titled candid and it's kind of a mix of very moody pop and alternative R&B it's produced really well the tune is nice the vocals aren't the most distinct that I've ever heard but it is a very moody beautiful nocturnal smooth little sad Jam that I like quite a bit shout out to them shout out to them on a band camp j-rock has a brand new single out with T grizzly which goes over pretty well it's not one of the best G rock songs ever heard but it certainly goes over much better than a lot of the goofy cuts from his last album win win win win win win win you know it certainly surpasses that very low bar moving out from their granddaddy is back with a new song yeah like usual kind of middling somewhat sad indie rock here from granddaddy but it's it's still pretty endearing it's still pretty endearing and miraculously cult's has come out with one of the first singles of theirs that didn't strike me as obnoxious and I don't know just just nostalgia pandering you know the the cult's has long been a duo that I've not really cared for all that much but I found the moody instrumental and the passionate vocals on this cut to be a pretty nice change of pace not quite the watered-down old-school vintage vocal pop pastiche that the duo is usually known for definitely a maturation if even a slight one and also wanted to give shout-out to our money white a hip-hop artist that I'm only now becoming aware of who has a smart little new single out title wonderful it's attached to a pretty creative music video kind of diving into I guess virality on the internet like the song is sort of being portrayed through a bunch of sort of like online content and YouTube screenshots and so on and so forth sometimes it's spliced in with live footage and performances it's actually a really unique music video on top of that the instrumental is very busy and jazzy and nimble reminds me of chance the rapper a little bit in some ways but I think Armani vocally and lyrically comes to a very different artistic conclusion than a chance does on many of his songs though though still I do think both of them achieve similarly upbeat and kind of inspiring tone with with their music but not from their Annie Lennox I don't know what it is with these wonderful female singers and songwriters only really coming out of the woodwork to write and record songs for movie soundtracks but hey we have another instance of that annie lennox wreck wreck the requiem for a private war and it's pretty a heart-wrenching sad and very dramatic little ballad over here that i highly recommend that you check out if you are someone who is into very very despondent piano song and let's get into the track so I thought were the best this week I have quite a few you know even the met tracks this week we're pretty decent but the best tracks this week really really kind of for me had a lot of tracks to talk about so you know we're rolling we're really only at the tip of the iceberg here guys and remember all the songs that I'm talking about are linked down below in the description box if you want to try them out give them a shot so BAM let's go you tell me an art pop outfit that I am only now being made aware of as a smart little new song out titled water cooler with a pretty unique instrumental palette odd groove bulimia it's it's just a very quirky and complexly composed little pop tune with some wonderfully eclectic instrumentation and some pretty decently vocals as well you know if you do like your pop tunes to kind of have a bit of a left-field instrumental vibe give this a shot it is a wonderful little tune moving on from there CIA the CIA they had a new record on the way via in the red records and one of you might say who the hell is the CIA well the CIA is a new group featuring not only ty Segall but also his wife they have a new cut out titled oblivion and the song is essentially Ty's significant other on vocals drum machine and dueling like distorted bass guitars it's it's an odd mix it's an odd mix of sounds but it comes together really well there's something kind of lo-fi and nasty and almost like black metal ish about some of the drums and some of the riffs on the track but I love the lead vocals they shouted in your face kind of socially charged vocals of the track are pretty hard-hitting attention demanding and respect worthy reminds me of just like some really old school art punk or no wave type of shit at some points with just how kind of out there and risky it is so shout out to the CIA definitely looking forward to this new project over here Steve Mason has a new song and single out via Domino Records middle II have not really dived that deeply into Steve Mason's work but I do love the quality songwriting mixed with some old-school rock and roll rich and instrumentation on this tune it's uh got some beautiful background vocals as well there's something very raw and organic and almost like The Velvet Underground ish about the demeanor of the track to moving on from there this is new song from an artist who also I was not aware of prior to this week who goes by the name of sneaks Hong Kong to Amsterdam is the name of this new cut now sneaks she has a sound and a vibe of her own but what I will say about this track is that I caught a similar excitement off of this song as I did when I remember first having heard like mi a like it's got a hard-hitting groovy dance beat really odd lead vocals some smart sort of international lyrics there's just something about it that kind of reminded me of mi a but in a way it doesn't really sound much like mi a you know that there are some characteristics of her music conceptually that I think parallels with with her music but um I I think what she's doing very much sounds Millenial very much sounds of this decade you know they're spots of her music that sound more contemporary in terms of the rhythm choices more contemporary in terms of the the bedroom pop aesthetic that is so popular right now that I think she embodied a little bit on this track it's a nice little dance pop tune alternative dance pop tune I guess is what I can label it as I like it quite a bit and she's certainly an artist I'm gonna be trying to keep an eye on I thought this track was really great moving on from there Sharon Van Etten has graced us with yet another fantastic teaser to her forthcoming album not quite as electronic or you know Cynthia's her last cut that she dropped but Jupiter 4 is the name of this new song over here it's much slower it's a very powerful heavy dramatic ballad and definitely looking forward to kind of seeing the artistic expansion that she's gonna be undergoing on this forthcoming album moving on from there phoebe Bridgers has come out with a brand-new christmas-themed ballad it is quite and moving but but still a very enjoyable cut so shout out to her shout out to this new song give it a shot give it a shot Christmas song is the title Mark Ronson nothing breaks like a heart featuring Miley Cyrus miraculously some of you might have been aware of this cut and thought that hey I'm probably gonna hate this song but it's actually a wonderful pop tune it is actually a wonderful pop tune I will say given the current state of things it's not the most original because there are some elements of the track you know kind of going back to that old-school acoustic ballad jury of the seventies there's something about it that reminds me very much of the new Lady Gaga album it's like Mark Ronson was trying to kind of touch upon that same musical era with what he was doing with this track but I still think it's got a great beat it's got a great transition from the verse to the chorus Miley Cyrus on the whole track is really compelling I think honestly like when she wants to sing passionately and she wants to sell a song that has a lot of heart her vocals do really well I think a lot of times she does a kind of sell herself short by just trying to be as out there and as ridiculous as possible you know there's a wonderful recording of you know her doing a Dolly Parton cover that is awesome the performance is great her vocals are fantastic you know it's just not very often that she is a kind of allowing herself to create in that space in that genre in that sound and you know thankfully she's getting an opportunity to do it now through this Mark Ronson cut and it's quite nice it's an epic cut it's an epic song it's a powerful ballad again and enjoyed it quite a bit you know I didn't listen because it's a single track and it's Mark Ronson there's no real way that you can bank on because of this track will the rest of his next project be good because you know it's gonna be all over the place you know it's gonna feature bunch of different vocalists but I can at least say that I'm enjoying this one track quite a bit and it's gotten a lot of traffic since uh being uploaded to so really liking that it's getting a warm reception moving on from there Jeff Tweedy of Wilco Fame has dropped a nice new little ballad that captivated me surprisingly despite how low-key it is I know what it's like yeah I mean vocally and instrumentally I wouldn't say this is one of the more special or unique tracks that I've heard from Jeff it's got a solid structure and some cool little guitar licks in it but really what sold me on this song was the smart and personal lyrics that Jeff lays throughout this track I'm not gonna spoil sort of what he's going for in this song conceptually I highly recommend that you check it out for yourself Wilco fan or not because I do think this song is so good that it should translate to people outside of the the Wilco pulpit you know the the the Wilco choir iceage has a brand new single out which I like quite a bit more than the last non-album track that they released out of nowhere this one broken hours I can at least say has a bit more excuse me a bit more structure to it even really some more structure to it in terms of you know verse chorus so on and so forth verses some of the very one-dimensional and repetitive cuts off the band's last album so a kind of happy to hear the band dropping a track that not only has a good performance of those animalistic vocals that we have come to enjoy from ice ages songs up until this point but but also a track that has at least some kind of composure to the chaos that that they are known for instead of just kind of getting lost in the sauce in a way I guess Oh Grimes we appreciate power featuring Hannah I gave this song a firmly positive review on the Fantana channel a very thoroughly thoroughly positive review on a single track review there and long story short I loved the track it's a good song the industrial turn excuse me the industrial alternative rock sound and style that this cut goes for is actually pretty awesome and I love how Grimes is uh I don't know kind of bringing it back a little bit in a way it does remind me of what she did off of the recent collaboration that she had with poppy and there was at least you know a few other songs on that record where poppy was kind of pulling from the same stylistic place but I will say in Grimes defense on this new cut over here she did kind of bring it into a little bit of a darker more dystopian future direction with this new cut over here there's actually a bit of a vibe I get off this track that reminds me of that old new metal band or G that old new metal industrial rock outfit or G give a shout out to Gustav Osteen the French electronic music producer is back with a brand new single which hits hard it is titled reset the music video is hilarious but the song just all-around has fantastic production if I didn't say it already great groove sweet little synth leads and yeah it's just kind of a very danceable very dark little song that feels almost apocalyptic in a way I love how he continually drops these dance tracks these very smart electronic music compositions that have a very dark and dystopian vibe and Durand Jones and the indications a relatively new group they have one record out there about to drop this one over in May of next year not May March mix that up so March next year this album over here next to my head is coming out and this group they have an old-school classic soul sound and style which you know if you guys are fans of dapped own records and like you've you know heard that stuff as far as the the newer artists the revivalists set of that sound however I will say that this new cut over here I don't know if this is going to be the case for the rest of the record but this new cut over here don't you know is an amazing little song great songwriting great vocal performance classic lush and gorgeous vintage instrumentation I can really not say enough nice about it if you hate anything and everything that just sounds old or is old school or trying to chase after you know in a vintage vibe you know maybe this is not gonna be for you but if no matter what the aesthetic is or if you enjoy it you know a little bit that old-school sound you just want to hear some great solid fantastic vocals and songwriting you want to hear this you want to hear it and I think this is the last one we're gonna be talking about now second to last we have chance the rapper over here he's dropped two new tracks you've been blessed with so much music this week chance the rapper two new tracks this week one of which featured the the dude the boy Joey purp that of the two tracks I thought was just kind of okay but this first of the two cuts man who has everything I was a pretty emotional little track about chance just basically coming to terms with trying to be a regular guy a Family Guy man who loves the city but also a famous rapper trying to I guess kind of work his way through his fame and in a way kind of a reject it take a break from it find an oasis from it as it can I guess be sort of stressful and demanding to be mr. chance the rapper you know I sound like I'm riffing and kind of clown on the track a little bit but still I enjoyed it enjoyed it quite a bit it's a really good tune really good instrumental as well kind of warped heavy guitars nice sad somber beat also arctic monkeys have dropped a b-side from their last full-length album you know b-side extra cut you guys know that a little on the fence with tranquility base Hotel and Casino it had its moments you know but but for the most part I feel like Arctic Monkeys maybe should have road-tested this sound a little bit more before they decided to drop it on a record kind of fine-tune it a bit more fine-tune the songs however this new cut over here this b-side cut anyways is one of the more solid tunes that I've heard the band write in this style and you know it works along with the kind of glitzy swanky dramatic slowly delivered kind of cerebral luxurious pop and rock style that they've been going for you know it kind of feels like a weird surreal version of what you might have caught on a Las Vegas Las Vegas strip music stage show and like the 50s or 60s or rather the 60s the 70s I guess so you know hopefully you guys have enjoyed the direction Arctic Monkeys I've been going in with this sound because if you if you do here's more of it and and at the end of the day I think it's ultimately a solid tune you know regardless of the style and the the branding the band has kind of given their sound here and that is the weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching and making it through this somewhat lengthy er version of the series but hey we had a lot of songs to get through want to give a shout out one more time to my boy Joran Co hit up that 179 days of Christmas video to get in the holiday spirit see if you can make it through all nine magical hours of this masterpiece this holiday masterpiece over here and we will catch you guys in the next video thank you very much for watching more reviews coming soon as usual Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup for ever 
HgUsQKCw7Wo,hi everyone NAFTA here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Jade DiCaprio - this is the latest album from Atlanta native and dreamville signee jid following up last year's the never story and album that while it did underwhelmed me it did turn a lot of heads in the hip hop community and without a doubt the flows and the lyrics on this record did put a lot of raw talent on display but the lack of strong songwriting coupled with jid really wearing his influences on his sleeve did kind of make it difficult to love this album for me and see a definitive way forward artistically for jid in the future one of his most obvious influences is actually one of his most popular contemporaries mr. Kendrick Lamar and I'm not sure how much of what I'm hearing in Jude's music is an actual direct influence or copy from Kendricks music or if it's just a matter of coincidence in that both Jude and Kendrick happen to have some pretty dynamic flows and high-pitched nasally voices I know they both occasionally favor some pretty weird left-field cracked vocal inflections too on top of it their spots even on this mixtape where I hear some Kendrick isms from the instrumentals from some of the vocal effects and pitch shifts I don't bring any of this up to discount or D legitimize JIT necessarily I guess I'm just saying the commonalities that I'm hearing here are just too many for it to be just a mere accident and I think copying an idea and being influenced by one of your fellow contemporaries is is one thing what you do with it how you spin it how you flip it how you define it to be your own is another whether or not you can pull that off to me is what defines a copycat from an actual artist and if anything separates jid not just from Kendrick but from nearly everybody else in the contemporary hip-hop field it's most definitely his approach to lyricism and flow take one of the teasers to this project 151 rum structurally and lyrically speaking it's not one of the best tracks on this entire record doesn't have as many quotables doesn't really have a strong hook or anything like that it's just kind of this one massive blocked out verse with a few refrains of 151 152 on Brown on paper you could say it's a one-dimensional tract but the wage it approaches flow on this cut the way that he breaks up his flow into numerous phases on this song provides quite a bit of variation the vocals switches the rhythmic switches not only are there quite a bit of them but they're all really impressive I think a lot of this album's appeal can be boiled down to one of the introductory tracks on this thing slick talk the song features a mystical futuristic boom bap beat that despite its old-school roots does not sound stale at all instantly catchy flows on this thing a pretty decent singing voice and way too many lyrical gems to name jid just throws them out one after another as if they're like nothing this song truly lives up to the title because the the wordplay is deadly sharp it points thankfully this song like much of everything else on DiCaprio - what makes it so good is really just kind of on the surface it's right there in your face just great instrumental choices great flows great vocal performances clever clever clever clever clever it's not super abstract it's not bogged down in a pompous concept okay okay okay but can you play it backwards I'm sure you could but and I don't know if it would change much whatever Jude's creative word assembly and his flawless execution are essentially what makes DiCaprio to so great and even though he's a really technically sound and talented rapper the way he displays his abilities it's pretty tasteful not so flashy that it's annoying or obnoxious it's like he's taken the raw straightforward hard-hitting vibe of a mixtape but has given it the lyrical depth that makes it sort of brainy but simultaneously you can listen to it casually just look at the lyrical banger Westbrook which features a roaring hook from ASAP ferg Jude completely blows up on the last leg of the song saying okay I'm fired up I'm really fired up that moments pretty intense Jude and J Cole go toe to toe on the next track the song off DS which features two of the most intense verses on the entire record J Cole really ties it up nicely in the second half did not foresee him keeping up with jid at the pace that he does the song off design key is just oozes charisma he raps so smoothly over this instrumental that is a nice blend of trap and soul and jazz upping the intensity of his flow at one point of the verse at the this block of lyrics which I absolutely loved at the midpoint of this thing jid throws out a few mellower cuts with some mostly positive results the song working out is gorgeous it's luxurious it is blissful though the song tied with black and LMA I did find to be kind of grating mostly due to jits cracked voice the weird rhythmic pattern of his flow the kind of tedious back-and-forth of the love on the rocks narrative coupled with all of the annoying references to phone screens and social media I mean I guess that's very much how love plays out these days whether it's going good or bad but maybe Jin's portrayal of the situation is so good I'm annoyed because I feel like I'm in the middle of it if we're talking gender dynamics the song strawberries I thought was much better which is a really beautiful track about not just loving your significant other but also kind of being their support system being there for the women in your life in general through the traumas and relationships and hardships that they suffer through there was one bar on this track that stuck out to me about men just generally needing to learn to be more sensitive and not be so insecure about it the song hotbox is kind of another typical stoner anthem with a somewhat muddy mix however Jude's lyricism and the animated vocal performances of Method Man and Joey badass were kind of enough to make the song shine anyway the fantastical flows continue on the song mounted up with all the vocal and rhythmic changes Jude lays into this track the song feels like a workout I'm hitting the treadmill I'm hitting the ropes I'm flipping a tire over I'm doing pull-ups in the song despedido to is a pretty gritty and hard-hitting finish I mean overall this is a great project it's probably not as ambitious or as conceptual as jid could probably go down the road and for sure they're still going to be some listeners who continue to dismiss him because there are some Kendrick Lamar parallels there I would say there are even some little weighing parallels to a lot of what Jude does too but you know what the rhymes the flows the beats the songs they're all generally really quality regardless of what else out there it kind of sounds like on top of it I kind of get the feeling that jid isn't even working at full capacity on this thing because all in all this is a pretty raw album it's not overly polished and a lot of what Jude pulls off it's almost like he's just doing all of this casually as great as some of the bars and performances on this thing are I would not at all be surprised to hear JIT completely blow this project out of the water within the next two years and hopefully that ends up being the case I'm feeling a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album but listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Jed DiCaprio to forever 
ztTCkWZ1qko,ah hi everyone got anything you need to know here are the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new onyx collective album lower east suite part 3 this is the debut full-length album of New York jazz outfit onyx collective who had been building up to the third installment of this Lower East Side series with a couple of eps both of which made for some pretty raw and abstract jazz releases some really rough recording some fusion grooves occasionally vocals snippets being laced into the performances too in the third section of this series though the onyx collective seemed to forego all of those weird bells and whistles in order to focus on their best recorded and most straightforward compositions yet this record basically consists of a lot of short but evocative vignettes most of which are in tribute to the personality and intensity of various spots in New York City's Lower East Side whether it be FDR Drive or Delancey there's also a track on this thing referencing the all-too-common eviction notices in the area given the rising rent costs and even though there are different sources of inspiration for every track on this record many of them end up sounding like the soundtrack to the most intense film noir piece imaginable it's like every scene is screaming with tension and lowdown grooves moving through these tracks is like stepping over a bunch of dead bodies strewn throughout a room or a really dense crowd of eccentric dancers swinging their way through the Black Lodge their moments on this LP we're similarly avant-garde jazz records come to mind like black saying the sinner lady from Charles Mingus where some of the compositions here sound similarly strained but simultaneously the musicians have like this really loose and fluid connection to one another by contrast instrumentally this album is also much more stripped back it's really just kind of some drums and bass a sax maybe on a track you get two saxophones but the relatively simple instrumental build on this record does not stop the band from conjuring some pretty strong moods for starters I kind of love the very curious and sour bass and sax harmonies throughout much of don't get caught under the Manhattan Bridge which come off very puzzling strange and the way they sync up with the drums and lock into these tumbling music passages it's like I'm watching a crowd of people fall down an escalator in sheer horror very slowly then there are some very synced up horn leads on the track de Lancie dilemma which sounds like two cars caught in rush-hour traffic trying to outmaneuver each other to get to a destination first it's like an impossible competition that kept me on the edge of my seat I wish there was more to it these strange horn harmonies do not end on the track battle of Bowery in fact they get kind of militaristic with its marching snare drums in the background I love how progressively the song goes on it gets looser more messy more chaotic and there's something pretty menacing about the track rumble in Chatham Square to the song essentially sounds like a fight scene in two parts one section with very defined bass and sax melodies kind of trotting and thumping their way over some very sparse drums it's like listening to two gangs feel each other out before the fight really gets started like the Jets and the Sharks dancing around each other with knives eventually the drums get more busy the bass starts droning away the sax starts howling out dramatically this is like the moment where the fight is actually going on and a lot of what's happening is lost in this messy cloud of violence the closing track I also thought was pretty awesome it's a very interesting mix of just sounding likes a very smart metropolitan New York jazz but simultaneously it kind of progresses to this very odd and destructive place overall this LP does contain some great tracks some great moments but it does leave a little bit to be desired sometimes mostly in the writing and development department the opening track for example onyx court for all of its scattered drums and droning bass and super sinister sax melodies compositionally it doesn't really add up to all that much the track eventually fizzles out like everyone in the band before practice took an ambien at the same time and now it's suddenly kicking in there are a handful of other brief and kind of underdeveloped cuts on this record that I could see my way to overlooking if they somehow phased into or segwayed out of some of the longer or better cuts on this record but unfortunately they don't and then there's the cut magic gallery which wasn't really one of my favorite compositions to begin with at the start but as it progresses it's like the song just kind of falls further and further into this totally drunken chaos despite my complaints though and kind of being left wanting more I mostly enjoyed this record occasionally with a song it does feel like the band are kind of building a bridge to nowhere not really coming to a strong conclusion but when this record is great it's pretty captivating I love the band's wild attitude on this album they're kind of reckless demeanor also the way that in their music they're able to embody both the highs and the lows of New York City and that the band are able to successfully borrow from the classic sounds an artist that the city is known for and build it into something a bit stranger a bit weirder more modern I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this one transition have you given this record of listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry

fpnn6UuKUZU,hi everyone company gang tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new 6-9 record dummy boy 6-9 or takashi 6-9 is a new york rapper who has quickly grown to be one of the most polarizing and controversial figures in the genre today and i feel like that has so little to do with his actual music I fear that I'm not going to be talking about the music of this album as much as I would like to in this review I mean and the reason I say that is I feel like six 9s appeal and his continued popularity very little of it comes down to the quality of his songs I think you could argue pretty objectively in the grander scheme of trap outside of six 9s hyper aggressive vocals hyper aggressive and violent lyrics and his hyper aggressive instrumental choices there's not a whole lot about his songs that are all that special and in a way I think he's realized that with how he's tried to change things up and diversify his sound with this new record over here however we will get into that deeper into the review but despite the severe lack of substance in his songs combined with the fact that since he's gone mainstream he's kind of boiled his tracks down to the most cliched elements possible six nine stock in the world of hip hop has risen exponentially and yes you could say Anthony that's kind of the case for most artists in mainstream hip hop today you just oversimplify your sound to the point where you're reaching a larger audience but very few artists out there today period have the extra curriculars that the 6:9 does which i think are actually much more integral to his major success and what I mean by that is six-nine like no other artist today can grab a headline with something ridiculous that he said something stupid that he did another progression in the ongoing saga of his legal troubles which now has reached a fever pitch with him and people connected to him being held on racketeering charges right now please keep in mind this review being shot toward the end of November 2018 so I have no way of knowing where six 9s legal battles are going to develop from here another thing that needs to be said in terms of Takashi six 9s promotional prowess is that the guy is a one-man meme machine everything this guy says and does turns into an online joke resulting in Photoshop sand macros and viral video edits and I will not deny that even though I don't enjoy a great deal of six 9s music I love the memes that surround the guy if a new six nine track pops up on Spotify I will most likely listen to that when I have to meanwhile if a new much dank video edit of some interview that he did like turns up in my YouTube feed everything is dropped right now and that's kind of the Beast of the modern Internet age and media consumption you don't even really need to be a fan of something to be consuming something because a great deal of people who are listening to and watching and reading every single thing Takashi 69 is doing are mostly there just to kind of gawk at it basically the man has built himself up to be the biggest freak show in hip-hop today one that other major artists can't seem to turn away from or ignore despite his ridiculous antics as Takashi has landed multiple features from Kanye West and Nicki Minaj on his latest project here so to kind of wrap this section of the review up in a bow so I can actually talk about the songs on dummy boy I'll say that yes I definitely think 69 would not be as popular as he is today were it not for his grating eccentric and out of their personality all the ridiculous stuff he doesn't interviews on social media which gets remixed shared edited again and again and again and again and don't get me wrong the guy has some catchy songs the guy has some legitimate hits but I think of his day 69 tape showed anything it is the limitations of making music that is simply in-your-face and not really much else and that's one more thing that makes 6-9 kind of a unique beast in hip-hop right now that he is truly truly a singles artist like yeah sure he has this project he has the day 69 mixtape but honestly the primary function of 69 is to just come out with Singles anything full-length he's put out so far just kind of sounds like a random collection of singles and every single 69 has dropped this year has been almost like a cultural event and in a way an extension of his internet attention-seeking the fact that he has a track on this thing featuring Bobby shmurda on a phone from prison rapping on the cut was never not gonna turn heads never not gonna make headlines his track fefe with Nicki Minaj which showed an incredible instrumental and vocal change also a really colorful and sexy music video is never not gonna turn heads the fact that Kanye West is on this thing was never not going to turn heads and also the fact that 6:9 goes like Latin pop on this project with his first big single with an well a a not only did this song do incredibly well on the charts but also seeing 6:9 kind of jump into this Latin pop trend was of course going to make waves too so even though my feelings on these singles had been mixed some I've liked some not so much I have to admit the artistic choices Takashi is made on these tracks from a marketing standpoint have been pretty genius however listening to the entire album now I can't really say the the quality is there again there were a few cuts going into this record that I knew I liked and a few more that I picked up along the way that I thought were pretty good the opening track stupid with Bobby shmurda is a banger for the ages with a pretty eccentric ba ringing and catchy little synth line six 9s flow is loud it's in-your-face some of his lyrics on this thing seem pretty self-aware and referencing the fact that he is silly that he's such a viral phenomenon of sorts the song essentially revolves around his utterance of stupid which through multiple viral bits of social media has kind of become his catchphrase in a way his calling card it's almost like six 9s skinny I also like the random bits of his flow on this track that don't throw up the bump throw up the bump again sort of adds to the ridiculous and colorful quality of the song Bobby shmurda incorporation into the cut is actually kind of creative it might have been short but it added to the track for sure the track kike featuring tory lanez is another highlight for me it's like a tropical Trap rager with these fun little steel drums synth lines Tory Lanez over much of the track is this really bold and rubbery vocal line and a ridiculous hook I do my own stunts Jackie Chan wit it's easily one of the most fun moments on the record and I think one of the few spots where vocally Turia's really stood out to me as as far as a feature goes six 9s flow on the track it might not be that different than a lot of what he's recorded up until this point but I don't know it's it's still pretty great there's just something really groovy and head-bobbing about how he flows on top of a trap instrumental it's not too basic it's not too complicated he finds a nice middle ground and he's right there in the pocket and just to give you a whiff of the lyrics on this thing mostly it is violence its materialism it's sex it's completely tasteless there's a line on this thing where 6:9 says Ray Charles John Cena shit I can't see the bitch oh that gives you kind of an idea of you know the the dark nasty attitude but but also slightly humorous that you do get for the vast majority of this record the aggression the callousness one more cut that stood out to me on this thing was kanga featuring Kanye West not only for its bustling throwback bling era beat but also Kanye's performance on this track is ridiculous his lyrics are like a mix of highbrow and lowbrow it's it's like gold-plated trash explaining the appeal of this track is hard because it's so ridiculously out there and bad that it's almost good and great and raw and just how uninhibited it is I mean I think you really have to not give a shit about what anyone in the world thinks to record and write bang bang bang and chicken Wang bitch yeah I know you love how I put it down bitch admittedly though when 6:9 says that lyric goddamnit I am here for it Tachi is probably the major last highlight on this record for me which features a beat from DJ spin King boy 1 and Q beats are also on the instrumental as well it features these weary sad little I think string samples kind of woven into a pretty stained bit of trap percussion the flows for the most part are kind of recycled from previous tracks I mean 690 even revisits his infamous blinky sticky uh flow for a little bit although at this point when he does it it's like he knowingly embraces the meme of the whole thing and yeah it's it's meme rap I'm listening in an enjoying meme rap right now one more thing I will give to this album though is that I like how on the track wando's 6 9 has Scott Storch producing a beat as clueless as 6 9 seems most of the time and maybe his choice to do this wasn't entirely his own but to have a totally underappreciated legend like Storch on this record I think in a way does say a lot the keys and those synth lines on this track are pretty great but outside of that I'm not sure who else Storch is working with these days as far as production goes so you know those are kind of the highlights for me on this record but that's that's really just a handful of songs there are 13 tracks on this thing in total and a great deal of them I don't think are very good there are a handful of cuts on this thing where 69 invites on vocal guests and rappers who either give horrible performances or outshine him because the rap style he has taken on on that particular track is not very distinct because when he's not screaming his brains out 6:9 doesn't really bring all that much to the table vocally I'm talking about cuts like Fifi with Nicki Minaj where again as I've said in the past 6 9 doesn't really stick out on this track his voice a wash and auto-tune his kind of pronounced eighth-note flow which reminds me of a track from Corey Feldman's angelic to the core for some frickin reason yeah on this song he doesn't really have that strong of a presence and again this is one of many moments where this is kind of the case Takashi shockingly enough is easily outshine by little baby on the track tick tock even with little baby once again sounding like a poor man's young thug impersonator he still has more flow more melody and a bolder vocal presence than 6:9 does on his own track actually I would say little baby is pretty much the reason the song is as appealing as it is the song Walken is one of the shorter tracks on the record at 2 minutes and 8 seconds and a great deal of the mic time on this song is spent with a boogie with a hoodies awful singing voice so not only am i listening to a part performer for the majority of this song but six nine barely has any presence on this track he's barely here sure he's as loud and is out there and his in-your-face as possible with a bunch of gunshot sounds kind of backing up a lot of his boom-boom-boom shouts but as far as lyrics and flow go this is one of his least interesting performances on the record six nine once again four goes the screamed vocals for something much more toned down on the song mama with Nicki Minaj and Kanye West and once again he is the least standout performer and on FIFA featuring gonna it's like him and the dude are in a competition to see who can sound the most boring probably the sleepiest and least fulfilling song on the entire record the closing track dummy featuring trife drew kind of suffers from the same issue the Boogie track does just way too short of a song with an awful vocalist taking up way too much of the track then there's the matter of the two Latin pop cuts that 6:9 works into this record both of which feature and well AAA the first of which Bay Bay dropped earlier this year I already kind of gave my opinion on this track six 9s nasally auto-tuned singing is terrible it's garbage it's trash I mean the beat isn't bad I respect the fact that he is singing in Spanish on the song and that he went in this direction stylistically and that it did so well for him but honestly it's it's not that great of a track especially with an Welles vocal performance here and on the next song as well and I can't say I care for him that much as a vocalist like yeah he has pitch he can hold a vocal melody but he has this really weird monie emotionally flat delivery that sounds like he's sing with a mouth full of water and he's trying not to swallow it or spill it at the same time he just wants to maintain it there in the bottom of his mouth whoa I mean he's easily the better vocalists on both of these songs don't get me wrong so in that respect his singing is not as unbearable to listen to and to some listeners he's most likely going to sound like a good singer because he's literally being put up against vocal trash but honestly to my ears there's not really anything all that redeeming about listening to these two tracks locked in the middle of this very very hit and mostly miss album so yeah I mean there are a handful of highlights on this thing the Kanye features are cool the beats mostly can be fire but yeah the songwriting is not really there six nine barely shows up for a lot of these tracks there are a lot of horrible guests the whole thing just sounds really low effort really cobbled together I sort of take him at this point as just like a social media personality who also happens to make music I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing

bljZyA60Qmc,ah hi everyone be the knee cool tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Tyler the Creator EP music inspired by illumination and dr. Seuss's the Grinch this is a new EP from West Coast rapper Tyler the Creator former Odd Future main brain he is fresh off releasing one of the most critically acclaimed rap records of the decade flat flower boy Tyler has also been producing music for the upcoming Grinch movie soundtrack as well but I guess the inspiration he had for this new movie did not end with his work directly with the film as he's now gone on to release his own Christmas and Grinch inspired music with this new EP here this thing is a pretty short collection of tracks at 6 songs 10 minutes and honestly the music Tyler produced for the Grinch movie soundtrack what I've heard of it I didn't really care for and I can't say the music that has landed on this new EP is any more fulfilling in fact the tracks on this thing I think might be even more awkward and weakly assembled I mean this project mostly starts off promising with the song Whoville whose title is obviously a Seuss reference but the sound of the instrumental sounds more like stiff hip-hop drums mixed with some peanuts Christmas special pianos suddenly this intro cut transitions quickly into the next full song on the album lights on featuring Santee gold as well as Brock Hampton affiliate Ryan Beatty and the song essentially sounds like the worst karaoke at a holiday party that you want to leave as soon as possible I'm not sure what I dislike about this song the most is it the rickety be is it the cheap and I CAT synthesizers that sound like a knockoff of something out of Wham's last Christmas or is it the vocals all of which seem like they're coming from a totally different place in terms of style and recording and mix santigold soulless talk singing throughout the first leg of this cut sounds like something out of a really bad high school play then there's Tyler's really little nasally raps that he places throughout a few points in the song meanwhile Ryan has one of the best and clear vocals on the entire track he kind of sounds like a young Justin Timberlake but what exactly is the story and the theme that these three individuals are playing on this track I mean are they connected together somehow or are they all just kind of musing about wanting to come home or wanting someone to come home or missing home I I don't know what it is but somebody feels like they're playing a third wheel here somebody's the third wheel following this is the track hot chocolate which I never could have imagined that a song could ruin one of the best beverages ever conceived but here we are the song starts off cute enough with these jazz loops kind of locked into a groove for the intro little glockenspiel melodies plinking away in the mix - not the first time you're gonna hear that on this record believe me then comes Tyler awkwardly rapping and singing about marshmallows and 2% milk and freakin cinnamon but then it gets worse from there with a feature from this Jerry paper fellow who's singing for the rest of this track is awkward monie sounds vaguely off pitch it's like I'm listening to a tone-deaf Stephen Merritt of the magnetic fields the song big bag is a quick rap motif where Tyler and a few short verses kind of tributes the Grinch stealing gifts from the who's in Whoville talking about his green skin and throwing the presents in the bag and breaking into the house sounds like something that could have been on the Grinch soundtrack but maybe he was kind of just throwing together a demo here and it would have been something that could have been further developed had actually landed on the soundtrack but since it didn't he's just kind of releasing it as an odd or an end on this EP I mean it's fine while it's on it's not one of the worst tracks on this thing but it's so brief and underdeveloped I couldn't really call it a highlight the following when loves come off is yet another awkward meld of second year high school jazz band jazz mixed with a bit of stiff hip hop percussion and then a dash of Christmas music mixed in there to the Guru vaguely resembles that of Marvin Gaye's let's get it on like he just needs a little more oomph and some horn hits oh and a way less sloppy instrumental performance too this is another moment on the EP where Ryan Beatty's vocals appear but his singing isn't nearly as impressive as it was on lights on and I feel like that may partially be because this song feels even more demo ish than the previous couple of tracks like Ryan and Tyler are just kind of throwing some raw vocal ideas out there on top of the instrumental and see what sticks and maybe listen back to it I mean their vocals certainly don't come together all that well and the track doesn't really sound finished if Tyler we're gonna throw together a bunch of like random demo ish Christmas tracks I I wish that he would have just kind of come clean about exactly what this EP is the closing instrumental Cindy Lou's wish III really don't know what to say about it and maybe Cindy Lou's wish was that the EP should be over because somehow it's even more unlistenable and awkward than the intro track was yeah I'm not really sure what to make of this EP honestly I mean I would say that for Tyler this is him backsliding or that this is him faltering or kind of him losing his way but I feel like in order to make that assessment I would have to get the sense that he actually worked on this EP and put as much effort into this as he would a track on flower boy and it's incredibly incredibly obvious that he didn't as it mostly just feels like he's slapping some tracks together in order to quickly cash in on the holiday spirit I'm feeling a strong three too late for on this thing Tran why are you so mean everything you say is mean you're like the Grinch but for music you're the Grinch of music nobody likes you'll transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well or over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony fan Tyler the Creator forever 
fvJc33l7Dhc,hi everyone sniffing oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of the why you know review where I get into a gauntlet of Records that I didn't have the time do a proper full review of but hey I'm gonna talk about them in a gauntlet right here right now as soon as we go into the the transition let's let's go my dogs barking ba-bam oh man a musical super group featuring Damon Albarn writing the same kind of underwhelming songs that he's been dropping on all of his recent solo records but now with like some schmaltzy organs and a cabaret aesthetic the prospect does not excite me as much as I was excited to listen to this new me without you record and as cool as it was to hear the band kind of turned the volume up and get a bit more aggressive once again on a handful of cuts on this thing once more I am kind of let down again by just how bland some of the softer passages are on this record I also appreciate the band is changing up things a little bit vocally as well diverging away from some of the annoying vocal effects and small nasally singing styles that kind of pervaded a lot of tracks off of that LP and truth be told a lot of the personal and cryptically spiritual lyrics on this thing are pretty cool too all in all this is not a terrible album probably the best album me without you is put out this decade however that doesn't really change the fact that this album still is just not doing that much for me you know I just don't have any major complaints about it outside of it just kind of sounding average a great deal all the time I was pretty excited by this new bloodbath record at first I mean it's easily the band's heaviest album yet there are some interesting little bells and whistles and strim ental II that pop up here and there are some nice keys occasionally on this thing also a lot of the lyrics are surprisingly intelligible some of which are a little hilarious in a way dark sense of humor obviously with this being a death metal album but you know after repeated listens I just feel like the songwriting the riffs as well as the production the guitar tone it's it's all very meat and potatoes death metal I mean it has enough going on to where it doesn't lose its flavor that quickly but if you're looking for something in terms of death metal that's a little bit more refreshing or cutting edge this is very much not it however if you just kind of want that classic comfortable sound with a little added extra here and there give it a shot people been recommending this record to me like crazy like you're gonna love it you're gonna love it you're gonna love it I was so psyched to try it and disappointed that it didn't really wow me as much as some people kind of built it up too and I feel like sure there's an interesting and a unique mix of influences and styles on this record I mean you do have passages of progressive metal of tech death of like some jazz and and soft rock influenced spots I mean very dynamic record in terms of all the sounds the band can achieve but outside of all of these styles coming together under one roof I don't really feel like there's a lot going on with this record that's all that special I mean as far as tech death goes the production and the songwriting on this thing is pretty average grading and formulaic a lot of these softer bits while they do again bring a bit of breathing room and a variety to the compositions on this record they're very bland and milquetoast like I would not go out of my way to listen to the sax passages on this thing in any other context I mean you throw these saxophones on jazz record there's some of the blandest and most uninteresting saxophones you're ever gonna hear but thrown onto a death metal record I guess they sound invigorating or just kind of new and exciting you know I guess just all the styles the band's working within the context of an album like this it's quirky it's new it's fun but I don't know in the grander scheme of things it's not really that exciting as you guys know I was pretty excited to try this new low album I did enjoy the teaser tracks leading up to the release of this thing however once I gave it a deeper listen it didn't really stick with me there wasn't really much about the album that was driving me to come back to it and listen to it again and again and again in fact as I heard it more and more it just kind of felt uninteresting and bland I guess I can give the record one thing that I appreciate the band trying to experiment more with sound on this record it's a very texturally dense ambient ish record you know if you want to hear low engage in some real sound play give this thing a shot because the sounds the textures the colors they're really the best thing about the record however what really let me down with the album though is that I found a lot of the songwriting to be kind of faint so without a strong song to carry a lot of these sounds I feel like many of these tracks don't really build up too much so I guess in a nutshell that's essentially this album for me really cool sounds intriguing textures all that for the songs they don't really come with a strong flavor yeah it's like my least favorite kind of post-hardcore mixed with my least favorite kind of metalcore with symphonic instrumentation thrown into the mix one-dimensional guttural screams and lots of this is this is not for me this new Black Eyed Peas record pretty much embodies the power of low expectations because not only as the band disappeared from the studio album scene for like eight years for the decade before that the aughts they just released nothing but trash so you're released garbage for like ten years then for eight years you do nothing and then you come back with like a c-minus record a c-minus a barely okay album of somewhat conscious somewhat thoughtful kind of jazzy rap songs that are cool and laid-back pretty corny lyrics though see - record and people are like whoa man whoa have you heard this it's amazing oh my god oh my god all the Black Eyed Peas accomplished here is they came out with a record that wasn't complete garbage which they could have been doing for a long time now but they just decided not to because in the year of our Lord 2018 that is when the Black Eyed Peas need to start coming out with political music and jazz rap please this new cult leader it's okay if you're into some mathematical metalcore with some experimental bits here and there I would give it a shot nothing all that exciting or groundbreaking or even so impeccably well done that it stands out in my opinion there's a little bit of time here spent coming out with some more downtrodden easygoing dark atmospheric music with some clean vocals kind of makes for the roughest minutes on the album but outside of that it's it's a decent metalcore record it's decent yeah this is pretty much another Cimino album that's doing nothing for me but with another record under my belt I feel like I'm getting closer to why exactly his sound doesn't appeal to me all that much and I think it's because it's really just kind of a vague blend of neo soul and hip hop and R&B where you can't really tell where one style or sound or even passage of a song starts and ends it just kind of feels like a hazy mess of very easygoing but somewhat left-field vibes that I guess it's got an alternative flavor to it but not that strong of a direction or an idea or a message frankly I feel like even though there are a lot of interesting sounds and ideas that go into this they all kind of cancel each other out into a very uniform and bland and mostly uninspired sound I don't know guys I mean considering how much I enjoyed young liens last project I'm kind of floored as to how awkward this new mixtape sounds it just doesn't really come together as smoothly as his last record which is again kind of a shame because I felt like he was departing away from some of the more amateurish and unlistenable elements of his music but it seems like they're coming back home to roost noumic I'm a craven record over here it is a monster at 90 minutes long tons of tracks on this thing and while I like the loose improvisational hip hop jazz fusion feel of the record a lot of the jams and performances on this thing are pretty milquetoast as far as jazz hip hop fusion goes and it's not exactly all that exhilarating to hear the same kind of vibe and sound over and over and over and over I know that he is a prolific recorder and that I guess he wants to throw out as much material as he possibly can but I feel like the high points of this record kinda get canceled out by the many tracks whose performances are just okay definitely a record that I think you should check out if you're a jazz head but could could have been improved with some mild cutting back this new record over here is kind of an interesting one for unknown Mortal Orchestra while the band has always been pretty clearly influenced by psychedelic pop in neo psyche music they've never quite embodied that influence in such a way where they're embarking on a bunch of jams and I mean this is a pretty short record the jams have some good textures and experiments going on I'm not going to say that they're engaging front-to-back some of them are a little breezy and forgettable but it's kind of again interesting to hear the band kind of play in this style work their music into this context for the most part I think it works but I don't know if I'm really gonna call it as memorable as some of the hooky er records they've dropped up until this point I'm pretty excited for machine girl that this seems to be one of his most well-received projects so far like there's a lot of hype behind this one and I do appreciate some of the genres going into this record the hip hop the digital hardcore the noise but I feel like a lot of the drums and a lot of the sense and the sampling is well this record just seems so deeply inspired by Death Grips very deeply inspired like Jenny death steriods a little bit of money store here and there I guess I guess some no love deep web but yeah it just seems deeply inspired by Death Grips to the point where it's a little distracting like you could almost throw ride on some of these songs and it would pretty much sound like a Death Grips track I mean it's cool that he was able to emulate the sound thus far but you know I feel like it doesn't really add up to that much in terms of like anything new or refreshing and listen you guys know that it's it's rare that I point to an album and I kind of disregard it by way of saying oh this just sounds like Death Grips this just sounds like Death Grips but really from a production standpoint I really do feel like the the parallels are so clear that it's I don't know just hard to get into the coal is out here easily writing some of the darkest and most tortured dream pop out here right now but unfortunately there were some cuts deep into this album where she's applying some electronic and like some trap elements and some auto-tune on her voice as well and as much as I guess I appreciate her trying to keep up with the times and everything ever everybody is I'm not exactly sure if these sounds play all that well into her music or even this genre I mean I'm sure it will only take time for either her or someone else to bring these sounds into the fold to where I guess they sound less awkward and less tacked on but unfortunately that's really how all these sounds feel on this new record over here some decent tunes some of her best so far but really given the weak incorporation of some sounds that she hasn't been really been working with in depth previously it's a bit of a mixed bag as much as I tried because of the rave reviews and the small but very vocal part of my audience that's just been begging me to address this record I have had such a hard time really enjoying this new soccer mommy album outside of a few very well written tracks and you know I will give it to soccer mommy that there are a few like incredible indie rock songs on here but for the most part everything outside of those tracks just sounds like some very everyday bland 90s rock pastiche that I don't know maybe it's because I kind of grew up in the era but it doesn't sound all that refreshing to me and it doesn't sound all that well done or memorable either as far as music and this particular vein goes and speaking of bands that are kind of stuck in the past Cloud Nothings put out yet another album that also feels like just very vague 90s pastiche and I don't know what it is every record since attack on memory it's like Cloud Nothings have less and less and less personality it's like I honestly could not pin this for a Cloud Nothings record had I not been told it was one this new shad record over here is one of the Canadian rappers most conceptual albums in his discography it's kind of a war record there's a bit of an interesting narrative to it but in my opinion it kind of fell flat on its face also shad comes out with a few of my least favorite shad songs on this thing one of which sounds exactly like an old Eminem song like some of the flows that he uses and the instrumental that he picks out it's a little distracting and I didn't know exactly why he would do such a thing on an album yeah I mean look I I do think this guy is a good rapper I think he's talented I think he deserves more fans than he actually has but I can't really say despite enjoying a few tracks going into this and really looking forward to how the concept of this thing turned out that it really kind of appealed to me the new foxing album I know it's taken me a while who address it but I guess I've been sitting on the fence with whether or not I want to review it because in one breath it's their best album so far it's not as washed out as lifeless as uninterestingly songs are more engaging the vocals are more passionate but then in the grander scheme of indie rock it's really only an above-average album so again I was kind of stuck between feeling those two feelings like hey wow this is better than all of these records they've made in the past that I didn't like it all but then like what I take a bullet for this album would I recommend it to a friend I mean not necessarily yes this new soundtrack from our boy Tom York I guess they were smart to tease toward this thing with tracks that sounded like they could basically be Radiohead demos or whatever I enjoyed those songs the most but that's what I was mostly expecting from this thing but obviously that's not what a bulk of this soundtrack is a lot of the tracks on this thing are kind of a mix of experimental and drone music and then a little bit of avant-garde classical too it's not bad but simultaneously I feel like this thing is indicative of exactly why I don't really review soundtracks all that often as I guess kind of a sample or interesting sounds and moods and vibes it's pretty cool but as an overall 90-minute listening experience no I have no desire to sit through this thing ever again so I mean it's got some interesting ideas if you're a hardcore Thom Yorke fan give it a try give it a shot but yeah it just kind of sits with me like a usual soundtrack making vaguely interesting background music that sets a mood sets a tone does admittedly I've never been a really huge Charles Bradley guy as much as I do enjoy some of the vintage throwback soul artists specifically ones that are coming out V adapt own records obviously Sharon Jones and and this new record over here is also the case but if you are a huge soul music fan you love that classic 60s and 70s sound and for whatever reason Charles Bradley has slipped by you do give this record a shot because for a lot of hardcore fans at least from what I've been seeing this record seems to be a triumph there are some interesting song concepts and ideas on this thing as well as a very interesting cover that I don't want to spoil for you as well don't let it slip by you again if your soul fan you'll have that classic sound give it giving giving it to give it a shot Smashing Pumpkins they're back Billy Corgan and most of the gang are back and guess what they're recording and releasing tepid over-the-hill alternative rock it does not matter that Billy Corrigan kind of got the band back together as long as his songwriting is as bland as it has been on the past couple of Records it's just gonna sound bland okay so yeah it's a it's a bland stale Smashing Pumpkins album listen to melancholy I was looking forward to this new Mick Jenkins album and unfortunately I just found myself sitting in the middle of the road on it while it is definitely better than his last commercial album it's simultaneously nowhere near as good as the waters I like some of the conscious lyrics on this thing I like some of the jazzy beats but there's nowhere near enough attention paid to these songs the song structures and the hooks on this thing leaving a lot of these tracks feeling very breezy very casual like Mick despite his lyrical efforts didn't really spend a lot of time crafting these songs that they would make the largest amount of impact for the most part this thing just seems like a smart but very laid-back and I guess impromptu conscious hip-hop record it's it's kind of stimulating while it's on but doesn't really leave a lasting impression especially with a lot of these tracks sounding pretty Sammy Sammy across the length of the record and that has been the latest edition of the Y you know review thank you everyone for watching over here next to my head is

a3FOOK8rjfo,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for another weekly track roundup this past week was pretty much a holiday week we had Thanksgiving Black Friday and everything so not an intense week of song recommendations and opinions over here is gonna be a pretty short edition of the weekly track roundup so let's get into it let's get into it first off let's shut out our Amazon and turntable lab associate links hit up that turntable a blank get yourself a colorful pressing of a record that I've reviewed on the channel a turntable some speakers some audio gear it supports the channel supports the segment also shopping days coming up Christmas presents needed so you know if you're gonna be buying some music some auditory gifts might as well be with the link that supports the channel that you love the most and want to shout out one more thing this perfume genius cover of a Bobby Darren's not for me sort of the official version has a hit YouTube now and it's a pretty atmospheric pretty dramatic and gorgeous as you would I guess sort of anticipate any any Mike had Ria's song to be and let's move into the track so I thought were the worst this week only a couple to shout out one vic mensa essentially tries his hand here at some dark and edgy emo rap with the song dark things and some very awful nasally vocals on this thing some cringy lyrics I mean listen a lot of this emo rap stuff it's it's been pretty rough you know the there have been a lot of bad emo rap songs to drop but this is easily one of the worst I just don't ever want to hear it again frankly let's get into the tracks that I thought were kind of met this week weren't blown me away but we're certainly worth attention kai Whiston producer kai Whiston has dropped a track actually many tracks this week as his new album is out but there is one on his new record which is a pretty packed full with glitchy bangers this one particular cut your secrets features our boy Clarence clarity he's not all over the track or anything but he does add some interesting like little bits of vocals here and there to a very colorful and busy heart hitting instrumental also I'm just noticing now that the parental advisory fake parental advisory sticker in the corner sort of talked about the or rather depicts the other title of the of the record Cayuse teen bitch so that's pretty fun moving on from there Fontaine's dc2 real is the name of their new single the other side of this single has dropped the song the cuoco is a Colin the cuckoo is a Colin it's much more toned down than the last track that I talked about from them last week which was a kind of wiry exciting intense art punk tune this is like more of a downtrodden indie rock ballad but still not that bad not that bad moving off from their ASAP rocky has dropped the track sundress which I talked about on the Fantana channel gave an extensive review this week all in all I mean the Danger Mouse production isn't bad the tame impala sample on this cut is okay and even Rocky's attempts of trying to pull off like a neo psych pop vocal it's not the worst in the world but as far as like songwriting goes it's it's not all that compelling it's kind of like a chorus a little tiny verse a chorus and then just kind of boughs out and not a whole lot to it sort of seems like just a taster in this style overall and finally in this section I want to shout out the new Billy Eilish song come out and play which is essentially a new ballad slash single that she's dropped in promotion with like this new Apple ad campaign it's not a bad tune I mean not a huge payoff to it or anything but it's a very very pretty vocal and instrumental to it so yeah moving on from there let's get into the best tracks this week the best tracks this week first off Weezer is back the black album is on the way if you guys remember the last single they dropped from this record I enjoyed it quite a bit and that's pretty much the case for this new song over here zombie bastards you know it's it's kind of odd I definitely hear of Weezer's last full-length record in this song just how slick and synthetic a lot of the production is however I still feel like the band has successfully maintained a bit of a dark edge or an emotional edge going into this song over here doesn't sound too much like just straight PAP it doesn't sound like disgustingly summery or anything like that it's a pretty decent tune and I do like the way the kind of beats play into the guitar samples at some points of the track too so it's pretty cool alright moving on from there move move move move moving on from there next up want to give a shout-out to sir Kai if I'm pronouncing that correctly it's been a while since I've talked about this project but a new song over here titled the unfair rather and unfamiliar reflection activates a gate featuring Aaron Harris and this is a wonderfully noisy and industrial ambient track reminding me of greats like lust Mort it's really heavy it's really dark and foreboding not a huge amount of progression to it or anything but the sounds are incredible I love the sound play on this track I love the sound play it is uh absolutely gorgeous if you do care for hideous sounds I guess moving on from there Meek Mill has a brand new cut out titled doodles doodles babies it is pretty hard hitting the lyrics get down to some pretty gritty subject matters with a bit of a social edge to it as well definitely one of his better flows vocal performances and instrumental choices in a while got to give it to him on this cut it's been a while since I've been this excited by a new Meek Mill single hot dad has dropped a new track out titled my tape in celebration of a new tape that he has out so hey support support the boy hot dad he's gotten tape out get his tape get his material dude's been creative and prolific as hell and his music is certainly certainly worthwhile moving on from there Earl Sweatshirt new record on the way very soon and has dropped a new song with this this dude by the name of navy-blue the mint is the title of this thing did a full-length review of it on the Fantana channel it's a really claustrophobic oppressive mix and sound on this track and Earl and Navy go into some really depressing subject matters like this is an incredibly dark piece of very abstract and grimy underground hip-hop and I'm just kind of like in the creative direction Earl is taking things in lately moving on from there next one next one next one Aesop Rock and tobacco believe it or not have teamed up for a new project by the name of Malibu Ken debut track single has been released from it the title of this track is acid King and the the whole track details I guess some of the background and lead-up to the murder committed by or rather you know a highly publicized murder committed by mr. Ricky caso who has had numerous songs and books and documentaries about just how much of a madman he was the occult backdrop of his crimes the heavy bands he listened to the drugs that he did an Aesop Rock really kind of goes into detail on all of that over a very eerie weird and twisted instrumental from of course tobacco very interesting to hear these two working together and just from this first track alone kind of seems like this collaboration is going swimmingly and I'm pretty excited to hear to hear more and ladies and gentlemen that that has been the weekly track roundup for this week thank you very much for watching hopefully you got some good recommendations out of it and I will catch you in the next one remember all the tracks that I talked about in this video are linked down there below in the description box and I'll see all of you soon Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
EJjG_aK0tIU,
I9YcGpehDnk,oh my god I want it oh my god hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest oh my god and it's time for a review of the new trippy red mixtape a love letter to you three this is the latest mixtape from Ohio native trippy red we just heard from the rapper singer earlier this year with his full-length commercial debut album life's a trip it was a bit underwhelming in my opinion not quite the ambitious show out that I was hoping for though it was interesting to see trippy very up his sound a little bit and successfully embrace the current emo rap trend with lots of compelling songs with guitar backed instrumentals so now he is delivering the the next installment of this Love Letter mixtape series which is fine with me because his last mixtape in that series is what attracted me to his music in the first place and even though my feelings on trippi's projects up until this point had been somewhat mixed I gotta say I'm pretty happy I mostly enjoyed this one yeah yeah I did I mostly enjoyed it mostly thought it was pretty enjoyable there some real highlights positives and improvements for trippy red on this project out of the current set of auto crooners and track balladeers out there I still think trippy is one of the most standout he projects a lot of passion and personality through his voice and he typically forgoes the heavy use of auto-tune that many of his contemporaries are addicted to resulting in a pretty raw sound that you often don't get out of this style of trap now in the past for trippy this has led to songs where his voice is just really going off the rails he is straining but on love-letter 3 I do think trippy tries to cut down on a lot of the vocal blemishes that were all over his previous projects off the bat I can see the tracks that didn't really appeal to me all that much were the closer campfire tale mostly because it is that rare moment on the album where trippy voice is just so over labored it gets to the point where it's obnoxious and difficult to listen to and then there's diamond mines featuring tory lanez and elliot trent which in my opinion just sounded like a very generic trap R&B blend with very slick boyish R&B vocals not a whole lot of personality or flavor to it it just sounds really pillowy buttery and bland outside of that I think the tracks on this thing range from being either decent to pretty great whether that be Topanga the lead track to this thing I was captivated instantly by the gospel inspired instrumental on this thing also the pitch shifted vocal samples on this thing also these sick lead vocal melodies from trippy on this one my tiger nested burger boom the messaging in the lyrics while it didn't really resonate with me all that much at first after repeated listens it strikes me as this really weird combination of romance and violent paranoia that again I'm not exactly sure if the message comes through all that clear it is pretty odd to feel these combating feelings on one song the song toxic-waste is an oddly sad and vulnerable moment for trippy with its sad little acoustic guitar samples and its gentle but busy beat but what truly sells this song in my opinion is the vocal performance with trippy asking this person who he has in mind to help him even though he knows that that person entering back into his life is not healthy it's basically portraying this addiction that he has to a very toxic and a negative relationship I guess meanwhile on the song can't love trippy sounds even more heartbroken literally crying out over a very simple beat in this sad electric guitar lick saying she said she loves me I thought you'd love me now how could you do this to me if you're looking for an impassioned heart wrenching trap ballad this is it and this is just one of many moments on this record where it feels like trippy is just deeply obsessing over getting the raw emotional deal out of these failed relationships which again fits as a weird combination against other tracks or even lyrics within these songs where he's just singing about letting chiapas bang in a way this record successfully inhabits this new wave of trap where you have these tough guys that just wear their hearts on their sleeve I guess the lines between those two worlds continue to blur on the title track of this thing to where trippy delivers this melodic righteous angry tribe about being tested and I think a lot of this tracks emotion and ethos can get boiled down into a single line that he repeats a few times I put my soul into these cups I don't worry about anything to me this line and many others just totally embodies the addiction the anger in the heartbreak that he dives into on one track after another on this record also thought the track loyalty before royalty was pretty great as well one of the slightly better topical tracks on this thing we're trippy is going on about Brotherhood in the midst of this life of sin that he's surrounded by my major issue with this record and trippy sound in style at this very point in time though is that the songwriting and the instrumentals could be a little one-dimensional because their tracks on this thing where the beat just does not change up all that much across the length of the song not a whole lot of melody or chord changes not a lot of percussive shifts or beat dropouts which might seem like a simple request might seem like something very basic but it does make a world of difference in terms of encapsulating certain parts of the song or highlighting certain parts of a song I mean sometimes trippi's vocal melody his flow doesn't even change up all that much from a verse to a chorus on a track and it just leads to a handful of songs on this thing just sounding very se me from front to back whether it be wicked or a negative energy or firestarter just to name a few and listen this is even the case for some tracks on this thing that I like but sometimes what ends up happening is that trippi's vocal performance on a track is so good that I just can't deny it there are also a handful of cuts on this thing where a guest rapper or singer is just enough to kind of break up the monotony of a song whether that be baby goth on the title track to this thing or juice world on 14-hundred the chemistry between him and trippy red on this cut is actually excellent both of them kind of drive each other to keep the energy high and honestly elevate and motivate has one of the slickest and most enjoyable guest verses I've ever heard from young boy never broke again so while I do like the bulk of the tracks on this record I like the direction of this album this in my opinion is one of trippi's most consistent projects yet I do still think there's room for improvement and what I would love to hear more going forward are more focused and varied songs I really feel like that's the next way for trippy to bring things to the next level because so far on this thing he has captured a really great sound he's got a distinct voice on the record a sixth sense for catchy flows and melodies I just think the substance and structure of what he's doing could be a bit better I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the

on the go at home at work the first vinyl selection that I have here I actually bought off of reverb it's it's been a 12-inch I've been in in my collection for a while now in my collection guys in my collection okay it is a little old techno jam from a project by the name of rhythm device and it's it's like this badly conceived old-school fusion of acid techno and rock music and yeah it's it's totally goofy it's totally off the wall the vocals are corny as hell I believe the intro mantra of this record goes there was a time when rock and Bowl was easy and now it's clean and heavy and then I guess that's crazy and I absolutely love it they're like these garish like distorted guitar keyboards all over the track too it's it's really nuts it's insane and now that I have the 12-inch over here I am now the proud owner of the acid rock remixes on the other side fr Oh records rhythm device these lovely acid rock remixes are now mine to listen to and also to jam when I'm out and about if I'm ever given the opportunity to to DJ this magic Oh believe me I will I have I have listened to and have gone through a lot of these records already but there is a select few that I have not even opened yet because I want to sort of experience that with you guys on camera shout out to the boy who sent me this one the the good the good man George Clanton whose new record over here slide I gave a pretty positive review to it's actually a somewhat excellent mix of chillwave and synth pop and shoegaze and a lot of different things you know 90s pop rock and again haven't even popped this open dude just offered to send it over to me in the mail I said hell yeah give it to me give it to me George and it was nice enough to send a shirt along as well and it seems like since the review a lot of people have been taken to his music and I'm really happy about that because he's making some good stuff I'm looking forward to where this guy is going in the future love this image of him going down the slide he's really kind of throwing it back there with the chain wallet he's really got a 90s vibe going on I respect it I respect it and the vinyl itself is this beautiful like blue-black mix love that ooh that is crisp and gorgeous can you guys tell that I have gotten a new camera because the vinyl looks gorgeous it looks gorgeous I feel like you guys have been missing out on the vinyl porn with the old camera and now that's that's no longer the case but the new camera you get you get that full you get that full vinyl porno experience gorgeous love that love that color love that blue color that's a gorgeous blue good job George that is a nice gorgeous blue black contrast that you picked out there for the vinyl pressing so good good on you my man good on you nice nice little record their nice little record all right moving on from there moving on from there I haven't popped this one open because I just bought it it's this old Jeffrey Lewis record just caught the guy live at a hobo Johnson concert wasn't even I had forgotten he was opening for him and he just happened to be there and I've been listening to Jeff's music for a long time he is an anti folk god and I bought some of his comic books as well but I was pretty excited to get my hands on this record Jeffrey and Jack Lewis sitting in Eastern songs lots of a old-school anti-folk classics on here and nice nice nice nice nice of course Jeffrey always hooks you up with some beautiful colorful visuals throwing that in there beautiful beautiful all the lyrics scrawled menacingly all on the inside oh that's fun so colorful and so fun pretty much standard black record over here feels like a pretty pretty standard pressing not anything super heavy or anything like that another album that I reviewed very positively this nice lemon demon record spirit phone nielsie serega put out this fun little kind of nerdy synth pop and pop rock record haven't popped this one up and yet either apparently due to my strong personal convictions I wish to stress that this record and know he endorses a belief in the occult as Neil kicks the record off with and I mean are you sure bro because this looks pretty occult to me exhibit a your honor this gorgeous lime green white red and black pressing this whoa this crazy mix of flavors and colors and everything what with a rotary phone picture in the middle that's creative that's creative guy that's smart and creative and creative and smart and oh nice this comes with the bonus tracks if you guys didn't know that was kind of a bonus track version of this thing released out onto the internet and I saw this is two LPS in like two LPS I know this record isn't it's like big enough for just two LPs but there's some bonus tracks on here so that's that's quite nice it's quite nice they were able to include bonus tracks and a nice little lyric sheet bonus tracks on lyric sheet is well and this record looks just as gorgeous ah it's blue the green isn't there it's Bubba blue that's quite nice that's quite nice proud of you guys proud of you Neal and needle juice records alright I want to give a shout out to the deluxe version of the new idols album joy as an act of resistance looked like a really interesting super creative package that I had to get my hands on if you guys didn't know already love this record post-punk album of the year in my opinion at least I I think I could definitively say that right now pretty straightforward black pressing and everything but it is thick and we got some got some lyrics around that sleeve over there but really kind of what makes this deluxe version interesting is you get this beautiful gate fold over here with the band looking lovely with the band looking one and the inner sleeve over here features a nice set of I guess pictures and art pieces that represent different songs on the album and they are double-sided depending on you know what I guess you're feeling you can sort of display a certain picture inside the the front sleeve whichever one I guess sticks out the most view and you want to represent the album itself so you know it is kind of an interesting uh I love that one that's crazy it is kind of an interesting way to kind of present your your art and your record to to the public to have like kind of this series of different art pieces thrown in there for the audience to I guess kind of switch in and switch out at their leisure almost as if your album is like a I guess like a frame or in art gallery or something you know which you know the the band's first album seems like a photo of like an art installation anyway so you know kind of seems like that's that's their intention and there's also a song on that record about making fun of people who don't really appreciate art all that deeply so you know I guess kind of building off that theme with that you know works into it smart interesting alright moving on from there finally got a chance to pick up look or drop not that I'm all that enamored with the state of this record and I will explain why but finally got a chance to pick up a copy of The OC Zork really great collection of punky garage a noisy psych Rock jams on this thing it's it's a wonderful record definitely one of the best rock records of the year that it came out but for whatever reason when I ordered this and it came to me I found it was like this weird like bullet ish punch hole in the corner that goes off into the to the other end and I have no idea why maybe I reviewed the new album too harshly maybe that's it I really have no idea but you know though the cover came to me to pitch the records themselves are and look fantastic I love this interesting sort of approach two kind of featuring the records in these rounded cardboard sleeves with you know lyrics and personnel and other information on each side and the colors are like a split blue and kind of lavender like purplish purpley lavender couple of color which is absolutely wonderful I love that contrast and it sort of matches syncs up with the cover art quite nicely alright moving on from there shout out to the great Nina Simone at town hall if you guys want to know what for me the rule of thumb is for a great sounding jazz record it is that when you throw it on a hi-fi presuming your hi-fi is not garbage when you throw it on the hi-fi it just sounds like you're there it just it just sounds like it's right in front of you it just sounds like real life essentially and I could certainly say that listening to this it just sounds like I'm sitting in the auditorium it's gorgeous it's wonderful it's beautiful the song choice is quite nice the performances are great and you know this is one of the most classic Nina Simone live albums that you can get your hands on so believe me if you're looking to intro with Nina Simone or if you're just looking for a very lovely jazz album with great vocals and great Tunes you cannot go wrong with this you can absolutely not go wrong with this packaging and everything on the inside is pretty much standard but really with records like these you're buying it for the fact that it sounds great it sounds of the era that it came from and albums like this were meant to be heard on vinyl I would also say that this new sons of Kennett record also passes muster for me in terms of a great sounding jazz record because I really do feel like I'm in the room with the band as I'm listening to this on the stereo it's amazing your queen is a reptile if you have not given a listen to this thing yet please do this is a funky intense and very versatile jazz record despite the fact that the the array of instrumentation on this thing is not that wide it's not that deep you know you're talking about a couple percussionists a few horns and the the grooves get amazing on this thing quite nice little gate folder right there liking that a lot that's tasteful I love it yeah I'm appreciating more and more just the just the design the graphic design and just the visual of this record the way unfolds that's quite nice it's a nice visual right there that's a it's an interesting interesting illustration I don't know if it transfers as high-resolution onto a 12-inch you know cover anything but I do find the picture pretty compelling alright let's give a shout out to Death Grips oh yeah brand-new record over here you're the snitch and it's it's a it's like the mouths kind of move it's it's a die cut we've got it's a diet it's a die cut album cover its die cut so the mouths kind of slide in and out I've got a lyric sheet in there as well which looks a pretty pretty trashy and pretty disgusting which you know sort of goes and in with the Death Grips graphic design aesthetic we basically have the same image on the front but thrown into you know just like a picture like a like a color reversal over here so it looks even more horrendous this is this picture gives me friggin nightmares I swear and we have a nice deep kind of green with uh you know some some black waves in there here and there interesting interesting deep green that they've chosen for this and what looks like a pair of eyeballs on the other side like some emoji eyes the other side of the label Death Grips it's just it's just all the all the horrible trash that was ever on the Internet just just being embodied in into real life into real life music that you can hear with your real life ears I love it and if you guys you know didn't already know this is another great addition to the Death Grips discography and the band really kind of I guess in a way distances themselves for some of the hip-hop sounds they're known for and they get into some krautrock sounds art rock sounds some noise rock sounds and you know it's probably not gonna be like this forever they're gonna change their sound once again into something else but still it's a pretty compelling collection of tracks and an interesting stylistic shift for them that they pull over pretty well so over here in my hands I also have the deluxe edition of the brand-new parquet courts record wide awake which I do love the way that the label has packaged this album quite a bit I love that visual of the front cover you know the three guys kind of like in the midst of no are they throwing down are they dancing are they running I haven't I haven't thought through the artwork all that much but I do love the the color palette I do love the visual of it also loving the artworks depicted on the back as well it feels so manic it feels so tense it feels so cartoony and fun and colorful just like the music itself on the record and these this this gatefold that I just had shown you guys actually flips up into lyrics from the album on both sides which again it just kind of continues adding to the lovely color palette ooh that's a visual that's a visual right there also loving uh again those lyrics and in visuals over there on the other side really create a way to package this record and this is like a labyrinth I'm stuck in it right now I'm trapped I'm trapped in the labyrinth and over here we do have the the single album that is packaged with this thing just uh you know straightforward black pressing and everything but still Rough Trade and parking courts put a lot of effort into the just to look in the vibe of this of this new LP the packaging on it it's very nice it's very nice so shout out to them looks gorgeous and it's very fun very very very very nice very nice boys very nice oh wow - wink if you want to listen to a nice post-punk II album with some deeply political lyrics do give this thing a shot it's very great definitely one my favourite rock records of the year moving on from there just a couple more left I have not opened this next one either and I'm not gonna open it in front of you because this this this is personal guys it's personal this is a 45 of uncle Adams original yes you are you are yours you are seeing me holding a piece of music history over here Fe on the other side uncle Adams original one of the greatest meme songs of all time or you know maybe not intended to be a meme song but but still uncle I respect the kid you know it came out with a literal 45 of this track and it's gonna stay in my collection forever it's gonna stay in my collection forever just uh you know just just needed to I just just needed that to be a part of my life you know just needed that to feel complete so shout out to uncle Adams for being the man and sending that over want to give a shout out to Third Man Records who hooked me up with a copy of this very raw live and direct five six seven eighths record when I hopped up in the shop yeah I mean if you are into old school rock and roll with a really really really raw edge to it check out the five six seven eight it actually struck me the there are a lot of people out there who may not know of the five six seven dates at all but they are you know kind of an old-school rock and roll garage rock outfit from Japan and they play the nastiest rock music revivalism of their day some of you might remember their inclusion in the film Kill Bill because they had like a nice musical bit in that film that they sort of stole the show in where they attracted a lot of their newer fans but a pretty straightforward Third Man Records pressing over there and yeah I mean it's it's nasty to the point where you know it's it almost hurts at some time at some points of this record but it's got a nice collection of tracks on here including a cover of long tall Sally it's maybe one of the most I guess liberal renditions of that song that I've ever heard in my entire life I'm going to finish it off with one more record over here that I'm super happy I got on vinyl because it is absolutely fantastic and that is the new Brit but but if I could talk the new Big KRIT album forever is a mighty long time I actually didn't know they were coming out with vinyl of this until I think I saw a picture of it on Instagram or I saw somebody kind of boasting about it but I love that gatefold oh my god a picture of crit right there is godly very nice purple front cover right there I did listen to this and I believe the vinyl is gold I believe the vinyl is gold yes Wow nice nice and I mean you know look it's not an analog recording or anything like that but on the table it did sound clean you know it did sound crisp it did sound fantastic I will I will give it that but uh but yeah if you want to hear a really great southern hip hop album with a lot of variety and flair and epically spun out into a double LP with I would say two kind of distinct musical personalities to them I would recommend this album highly if my glowing review of this thing was not enough already so what yeah that's gonna be it I'm gonna leave it at that this has been the latest edition of the vinyl updates sorry this new one took me a while but you know I had a lot to get through a lot to process but hopefully you saw some cool stuff and this one go out there and get some get some stuff for yourself if anything over here interested you and again make sure to hit up that link in the description for the good people over at reverb LP pick up the app do some record shopping yourself if now you kind of have the taste to do so you got that vinyl addiction going and

the bell as well and we will catch you guys in the next one when that comes out anthony Fantana vinyl update a forever 
r0kBjptl8_0,uh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Jaden Smith mixtape the sunset tapes a cool tape story Jane Smith is an actor a musician a rapper a tastemaker an influencer for a while he's been looking for an in into the music industry dropping some loose material and mixtapes here and there but I don't think his his dreams of actually hitting it big in music would come to fruition until his big commercial album debut sire last year and despite the fact that this album resonated with so many people it just didn't really sit with me right the best thing I could say this album has going for it is that it had some very great expensive sounding production on it lyrically this record fell really short Jane was not only repeating lines on this thing but he didn't really seem to have that deep of a mastery of the English language like some of the Great's in the genre and not to say Jane's music automatically isn't good just because it doesn't live up to the work of someone like Kanye West but the thing is Jaden himself makes that comparison in his own music sire gave me the impression not only through his lyrics but also through the reference points in his songs and in his flows that he thinks this album is on the level of the fantastic artists he's so obviously copying to make it and that's another thing sire for as long as it is it's it's pretty short on original ideas even though sire made a relatively big splash and Jaden had all the resources in the world to make it he still sounded like a super inexperienced artist who is yet to discover his own sound and path not to mention that the songwriting on this thing left a lot to be desired - so as hard as I was on this album maybe part of me felt like it could have rubbed me the wrong way that day maybe Jaden is still a young artist who's finding his footing I mean who knows maybe a year from now with consistent effort and Jaden's endless resources he will improve tenfold as a rapper and a songwriter which is what I was hoping for on this new sunset tapes project which is relatively short 11 tracks just 37 minutes this project is everything disliked about saiyr but worse the songs on this record are even more unoriginal than they were on sire the songs are actually even less coherent than they were on sire I could at least say in sires defense that Jayden would go after some pretty distinct musical styles on that record even if some of them were long-winded or the song at the core that was ill-conceived he was bringing a decent amount of variety he was taking some interesting risks with grand epic instrumentals and some acoustic cuts this however just sounds like Jayden generically rapping and Otto crooning over the most generic production that he could get his hands on all of which is badly mixed by the way the mixes on this record suck their muddy their bland their grey their colorless there are some songs on this thing where sounds like I'm listening to Jayden wrap or sing on the other side of a thin piece of drywall what's even more amazing about that is is that Jayden didn't even produce this entire record so I mean the thing is this sounds like very amateurish it sounds like very DIY and homegrown but the fact that he had so many other like artists in the creative process on this and it still came out this muddy and bland sounding is beyond me right from the start of this thing Jayden is sounding more uninspired than usual the song Soho mostly just sounds like a very Spacey diamond doesn't rap beat with Jayden just kind of crooning over it on the lyrical front there's not really much to speak of not even two minutes into the track we start getting bars about how those flows are cold and the mic is frozen the track essentially sounds like glamorous spaced rap with some really pretty pianos and not much in the way of a song it's like if somebody tried to write the blandest most forgettable combination of influences from rae sremmurd and brock hampton the Calabasas freestyle even though it is shorter it has a bit more meat on the bone because the the beat is more tangible Jaden's vocals are not mired in auto-tune he actually brings some flows and some bars though there are some weird ones on here like rap is one of my fetishes like a dragon that's pregnant is Jaden a furry whichever way you interpret it for it's not looking good again even though I do like the meteor beat and the consistent flows on this track as far as just voice and personality and style I still at this point cannot pick Jayden out of a lineup he is generic as hell I could at least say that on sire there were some rap tracks on there that had a bit more oomph and energy he exploded on the mic even if again he didn't have the most distinct personality it seemed like he was putting all of his heart into it calabasas restyled by comparison sounds like he is asleep at the wheel play this on a mountain at sunset I guess does kind of capture that vibe a little bit it's kind of ambient it's very easygoing the track essentially sounds like if somebody tried to turn Otto currents into elevator music if that interests you give it a try but honestly I don't even really think this track achieves what a track might need to in order to be pretty in the background or ambient as Jayden's auto-tuned vocal riffing it's not very pleasant mountains fountains mountains and once more I could at least respect numerous tracks off of sire for having a coherent song at the baseline of the track this once again while I guess he's going for a track that's ambient in nature it just kind of seems like he's dicking around plastic is another banger on this record with a terrible mix sounds almost like Jayden is trying to capture the spirit of a little pump or a bad baby hard-hitting instrumental pretty generic flow once again Jayden doesn't really come through with that distinct of a sound or personality you super short track as well so not much to it the song distant is another emotional cut on this thing Jayden really tries to flex his poetic license on this one singing about looking at butterflies in the sky and the stars waiting for the sunrise which how could that even be the case butterflies are not nocturnal how are you seeing butterflies and the stars at the same time the song also features these really weird pitch shifted vocals which once again puts him in the lane of like a dollar store brand Brock Hampton and it's one of the longest tracks on the record unnecessarily long I mean three minutes in this thing is already excruciating and it just gets progressively worse and worse and worse as Jayden fails to come through with a compelling set of chords a compelling vocal melody interesting lyrics really anything finally there's a set of like these Auto tuned multitrack vocals that sound like they're rip right out of the Kanye West playbook and I'm not even talking about just like a mild similarity here Jaden is just ripping off Kanye West as hard as he possibly can right down to matching these multitrack vocals up with some bad spoken word I mean it was one thing when Jaden was clearly wearing his influences on his sleeve but now it's like he's just unashamedly copying them without any real care for how it looks the song yeah yeah is a sort of unexpected Summer Jam the groove has a bit of a tropical vibe to it but the production is super wavy and glossy it's almost like I'm listening to a combination of vaporwave and dancehall paper haul but then once the vocal melody pops in it's a straight Drake ripoff Jaden is literally just trying to write a bad Drake song and believe me this track does not really get any better once you start diving into the lyrics with Jaden singing about you know thinking about wanting to see this girl naked we get this hard transition into this weird vocal interlude sire and Abbey Road which sounds like a nightmare it just sounds like a nightmare it's like if you had boney vert James Blake and Laurie Anderson all with auto-tune on their voices try to sing in harmony but they couldn't hear each other meanwhile on the song 10/10 Jaden doesn't even sound awake for his own track it's almost like he's sipped 3 bottles worth of coughs syrup and then he just like hit record on the mic and this is what came out the song is so vapid effortless and so devoid of of any effort at all it seriously makes me rethink my gonna and little baby not good this is a track that seriously makes me worry about the society that we live in because a society that puts a track like this out it must be broken the first leg of fallen Part 2 actually doesn't sound all that bad some really Spacey tones some post-rock ish guitars kind of floating and fluttering in the atmosphere Jaden crooning his way through the track with a relative amount of somber emotion and in his voice it sounds both pretty and dreary but then that portion of the track melts away in place of this little spoken word passage where he sounds super super serious very deadpan very stern in a way and it's it's almost like I'm listening to politics rap it's it's some serious politics at bars which is honestly just too much for my little heart to take especially toward the end of the album which again it's not even that long of a record and I feel like I've just been locked into it like a hell maze that I can't get out of meanwhile the closing track rolling around is one of the worst cliffhangers imaginable it just ends abruptly out of nowhere I guess in the spirit of the rest of the album just feeling very half-baked unfinished low effort like he just wasn't really trying and that's honestly the worst thing about this tape it just does not feel like Jayden is trying at all he's not trying to conceive of an original or an interesting idea he just borrows ideas from other artists and he doesn't even borrow the good ones and when he does he manages to mess it up I just feel like this project is the last thing that Jayden needed at this point his career sure while sire was a large record it did well it was a pretty big undertaking Jayden is still at a point in his career where he has something to prove you are not in the position yet where you can just come out with a project where you're just literally killing time and playing musical dress-up for 37 minutes and because coming out with a great record is not a do or die situation for Jayden the results sound like it just doesn't matter if this record does well for Jayden it doesn't matter if it doesn't do well for Jayden it doesn't matter either way he'll continue to be well off and have the resources he needs to shove his music in front of everyone's face in the music industry this was so boring sleepy bland and uninspired I'm just not really sure I have anything else to say about it I'm feeling a light - decent - on this thing it really is that lacking in terms of anything exciting honestly Tran fishin have you given this album a listen did you love digitate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next

tIWTYmVCs9c,ah hi everyone oxygen are tanveer the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Andersen Pack album Oxnard this is the latest full-length LP from California all around her anderson pack he's a writer producer singer multi-instrumentalist rapper astronaut it did take a while for Anderson PAC to get where he is currently at but it's it's hard to imagine living in a world where this man would not eventually get famous he's just so versatile as the sounds of pop and jazz rap funk soul R&B a bit of psyche have all flowed through Anderson's music in the past at some point also he has been releasing some very enjoyable albums as of late his 2016 underground hit Malibu and the same year breakout collaborative record that he dropped with knowledge under the no worries name he even received quite a bit of mic time on dr. Dre's Compton record a few years ago - and now that connection with the good doctor is finally paying off as this record is coming out on Dre's aftermath label Dre is also executive producing on this thing and regular producing on this thing other names on production on this record 9th wonder dem joints focus but honestly the production list on this thing is not as star-studded as one might assume given the major label push behind this record and frankly that's something I am happy about it would absolutely crush my soul to see Anderson PAC put out a new record where he's just rapping and singing over a bunch of generic trap beats plus the production palette of this record allows him to continue on his own artistic trajectory embracing the funky West Coast sounds that have inspired him so which have most likely been emphasized under the tutelage of dr. Dre - and even though this has been at the site sacrifice of the wider array of genres on Anderson packs last record one of my main issues with that album is that it wasn't really all that focused in terms of sound and songwriting Oxnard by comparison is a record with a stronger sense of direction it knows where it wants to go knows where it wants to be it's literally named after a place though I guess Malibu was too so whatever even in this slightly more limited state Anderson pack does bring the audience on this record a pretty nice variety of sounds ranging from g-funk and neo soul and jazz rap some futuristic bangers on this thing like who are you as well as Mansa Musa which sound like the next logical artistic step pass artists like Pharrell or a schoolboy q on oxymoron the tone of the tracks on this record range - like on the opening track the chase whose instrumental literally sounds like the chase scene out of a 70s blacksploitation film or the song brother's keeper which also captures the sound of a similar era exploding with these cinematic drums and guitars organs and epic background vocals Pusha T totally kills it on his verse backing up the sentiment the theme of the song and talking about his brother talking about clips talking about how he can't quite get away from his usual subject matter rapping bout the you know then there are some moments on this where Anderson in his typical Anderson PAC fashion is delivering some fun sensual flirty sexy tracks the man is a charisma magnet there are some poppier slicker show your cuts on this thing - like tints featuring Kendrick Lamar who ties up the back end of that track very well other features on this thing are equally pleasurable like Snoop Dogg his rapping on this thing sounds totally natural effortless like he was made for the instrumental that he's on or vice versa as he references that the sound of the beat reminds him of the G Funk era that he came out of Dre on this thing is a little less rigid sounds like he's having a bit more fun than he was on his Compton project when he appeared on that Jay Cole's appearance on this thing is slightly corny though I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting as he is rapping about kind of creeping over the internet on an old flame hoping she pops up on Facebook though I do give him credit for feeding into the song's theme of coming together and longing for someone I also like the eerie and psychedelic neo soul direction that the instrumental goes into bj the chicago kid sweetens up a kind of bitter and funny song about a series of ex-girlfriend's that Anderson has had over the years painting each of them as like a kooky character of themselves gotta say this is the first time I think I've ever heard a rapper brag on a song about dating a gamer girl who likes anime and wants to go to comic-con gamers rise up Anderson and his collaborators on this thing also fit in a few multifaceted tracks that feature a creative beat or musical shift like the song six summers which kicks off with this really herky-jerky funk bass line in these loose group claps the track sounds incredibly old-school incredibly vintage lyrically Anderson is making these wild proclamations about Trump having a love child and she's growing up to drink and party and make out with women which it's pretty funny but it's it's not I guess a piece of commentary that lands with all that much significance I like the songs transition into this really somber neo-soul rap blend in which Anderson hits this refrain about drinking and smoking just to cope with the pain if Anderson was going to inject some kind of social commentary into his stuff I think he he could have done better could have scratched a bit deeper below the surface but I do think he captured the emotion really well the the boom of frustration with the current state of things and the bust of futility and depression once you've realized that you can't change it at least not by yourself anyway smile and petty is also a nice two-parter the first leg of the song essentially is about Anderson being mistreated very very badly in a relationship over a very funky and interesting bassline that is incredibly deep gets all the way down to that fifth string meanwhile the second half of the track is essentially Anderson's less than mature response to all of that there's a pretty funky closing track on this thing I love the instrumental I like Anderson's energy on the song though he pretty much lays the track out in this fake patois I'm not exactly sure why he goes fake with the Jamaican accent in the final moments of the record though I guess I could say he doesn't sound as dorky doing it as some other rappers do it's kind of a weird way to end the record off but it's still a pretty solid collection of tracks I would actually say it's his best project so far in terms of production and songwriting performance as well as something I think his two previous projects were lacking and that's focus but as much as I enjoy this album I do think there is room for improvement here a few cuts on this thing we're kind of underwhelming like the track saviors Road which doesn't have nearly as much structure as a lot of other tracks on this thing do and there are maybe a few tracks on this thing where Anderson's juvenile lyrics get in the way of the enjoyability of this album and not to say that I think this record lyrically is worse off than any number of pop or trap rap albums out there it's just that in a way the production the presentation and some of the reference points for Anderson in the record insinuate that the subject matter in the substance of this album is a bit deeper than it actually is so it kind of pulls you in the direction of expecting to hear something that you're not going to and personally maturity and social commentary is not necessarily something I go into an Anderson Pak album searching for he just has a very electrifying and upbeat personality that pours through in his music and I'm not really sure if I need much else though I would totally welcome him diving a bit deeper topically as long as he you know actually put in the homework as is though I think this album still stands is a pretty nice breath of fresh air in the current state of pop rap and neo soul and it's encouraging to hear Anderson continue to grow into his very versatile sound with another quality record I'm feeling a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

n5Pehmoo-SE,ah hi everyone nice and Christian oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Action Bronson record white Bronco TV host foodie actress gonna be in an upcoming Scorsese film and rapper Action Bronson from Queens New York he's back and he has a lot of irons in the fire and despite the fact that he does have one of the biggest and most charismatic personalities in hip-hop right now this new brief album of his makes me wonder how much a priority that is for him at the moment sure Bronson's trademark boasts and sense of humor are laced throughout the 11 tracks and 26 minutes of this thing but the songs on this record feel more sketchy than they do fully realized for the most part this record doesn't really offer much in terms of a hook or structure or a coherent idea shift in style or evolution theme it mostly just feels like riffing over some really basic loops until the track is padded out for a minute or two and then it's either faded out or segwayed with a sample or something frankly it feels kind of low effort for Bronson granted Bronson's recent material hasn't really been his best or his most consistent blue chip 7000 mr. wonderful but at least those albums felt a little bit more fully conceived and even though there were some ill-conceived lows those records still had some pretty exciting highs on white Bronco Bronson isn't really packing these tracks with his best work with his worst work really with much of anything I mean the title track it's not exactly a long cut it takes around a minute for Bronson to actually start rapping with these really jazzy electric piano chords taking a long time to set the tone and there's an incredibly strung out outro to the track too with a really rambley refrain about bronson living his best life which I mean maybe he is because it does not sound like he's straining at all to make this throughout this entire track that was only one line that stood out to me the I'm like a father to these bastards shut the fuck up eat your pudding 20 alligators died for this shit I put my foot in which as a vegan the line breaks my heart but it's frigging funny but this album needs a lot more than Bronson just being humorous in order for it to make it a great LP that I want to return to it's like just a bunch of random freestyles over samples that kind of throwback to the days of classic funk and soul with a bit of jazz fusion mixed in here and there and some familiar faces on the production to like knowledge and party supplies and now who's the kind of hairy fraud who puts Bronson and ASAP rocky over a cloud wrap cut on the very tail end of the record a song that I didn't really care for at first but it's kind of grown on me in the context of this album maybe because in a weird way it's one of the more fleshed out and satisfying songs on the entire record doesn't sound as unfinished as a lot of the other material here and it's pretty rare that you hear Bronson over this style of beat and while I do like the musical aesthetic and flavor of the instrumentals on this record they're not the most detailed or varied beats that I've ever heard Bronson on for the most part it feels like a diminished version of what we've heard already in his back catalogue on mixtapes like rare chandeliers stuff earlier than that were again even that more recent material I mentioned earlier but noting more of the high points of those records granted there is something kind of left field and raw about the performances and the instrumentals on this thing the random horse neighing samples the colorful loops the bold persona and really out there ad-libs machine gun money this album almost vibes like mad villainy at a few points so if Bronson was shooting for something that's a bit more loose a bit more abstract I can kind of respect that but the thing is this album is so lacking if it was going to be anywhere in that league of quality because the instrumentals for the most part are kind of plain they're pretty straightforward they're not really all that wavy or texturally interesting and sure there are a few funny quotables on most of the tracks here but it's not like the flows or the reference points or the word player all that abstract or layered or intriguing mostly I'm feeling really on the fence with this record I've heard Bronson put out worse tracks in the passed but I partially feel like the material on this record is so agreeable because he doesn't really string these songs out into anything he doesn't really take any risks he doesn't really try to do anything different he plays it so safe and predictable that you can't really do anything other than just kind of like tap your foot to it and maybe giggle at a few lines that he says grab a record like mr. wonderful take all the best tracks out of that compile it into an EP and you've already got a project that's at least two times better than this I'm feeling the light too decent five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit

few sort of strip back acoustic cuts of songs from the last full-length album which are actually pretty enchanting and gorgeous one of them is linked at the top of the description box and all the other tracks I'm going to talk about in this video are linked down there as well too so do not miss out on that also a revising a song reworking a song is perfume genius the track Alan this is actually kind of a lovely rendition of that song and let me also shout out another revision big ghost big ghost Ltd you might remember from I mean I think he's still active but a while ago this dude was writing some of the funniest most brutal and most OnPoint hip-hop commentary to ever land on the Internet and now he has overseen a total remix of jay-z's the the black albums so basically all the instrumentals redone all the instrumentals completely replaced and switched out with something else you know new beats and everything like that and they're actually select some really good instrumentals on this thing and some really interesting revisions of some of the tracks on this record I paid close close attention to what he was doing with the you know dirt on your shoulder and 99 problems just because you know those tracks are so big when I was in college and again sort of the the creative liberties that he took with kind of redoing this record is uh pretty awesome so moving on from their worst tracks worst tracks worst tracks got a handful over here not too many there are more tracks that I loved this week and not but first off this new collaborative cut between Zayn and Nicki Minaj no candle no light the only thing that is more cobbled together then this song is this badly photoshopped album cover yeah sane and Nicki's collaboration here doesn't really come together all that well falls emotionally and vocally flat and like pretty much every single zayn has been dropping since his full-length album it is boring and bland as vocally he just has no personality no pen game and the instrumentals he pops on have just no flavor whatsoever moving on from there I've already talked about this in a single review on the Fantana channel but this new collaborative creed 2 soundtrack cut from Kendrick Lamar Pharrell and Mike will made it the mantra is one of the most generic pieces of trap I've heard in a while especially considering the names involved in this thing sadly moving on from there to the chainsmokers have dropped a new track called Beach House and it's just a really tasteless trashy piece of pop which unfortunately li was inspired by the duo beach house you know and not to sort of you know talk negatively toward Victoria and Alex that's not what I'm trying to say here but there are literally some passages of this song that sound almost like you know kind of the Spacey organ backed music that you typically get out of a beach house record but it's like doubled up with synths and drums and everything's to just just just to make it busier it's not like the chainsmokers are writing a dream pop song here or anything but there are some elements of the instrumental that do kind of come off that way but again of course like we kind of throw a bunch of stuff on top of it so that you're not getting that same effect or anything it's kind of like they captured a smidge of an aesthetic and kind of ran with it with their usual production and songwriting style so I guess moving on from there and finally Ariel pink has a new track out titled of moped look Ariel pink I've celebrated him as one of the best pop songwriters and producers of this decade essentially however a lot of people forget back in the Ariel pink archives there's a lot of weird difficult to digest and experimental stuff and this track really sort of sees him throwing it back to that it's essentially this eight-minute collage of visuals matched with this ongoing noise piece that's very distorted and always kind of shifting and it's it's not very enjoyable you know and it's not even really that it's just too abstract or that it's a noise piece but I don't really find the noise or the sounds that he's working with the be all that's stimulating they're kind of like burnt out and lo-fi to the point where they don't really have much body or flavor to them it mostly just sounds like annoying background sounds just very annoying noisy background sounds to me one of my least favorite noise pieces in a while I guess let's move out of the tracks that I thought were just ok not terrible not amazing but certainly worth shouting out and pointing in your direction if you're into this kind of thing but BAM one this artist who goes by the name of spelling has a new track out titled haunted water and obviously as you can see from the front cover it's being released on sacred bones records I like what this track is trying to do but I'm not exactly sure if it achieves it or if it does it as well as it possibly could I mean the production could be better the vocal performances could be better it's a little rough it's a little amateurish but there is something very dark in a cult and witchy about this track like if the performances in the production were more high-quality I could almost see this track being like wow this is like if which house were actually good if any of you can remember back to the artistic red herring that is which housed the totally forgotten chapter in really gimmicky internet indie music that is which house but yeah I could almost see this track as being like wow this is like which house but not totally garbage with its synthetic beats and dark synthesizers and the the vocal stylings like it's it again it sounds very old-school and a cult sounds very goth --is-- but there are a lot of contemporary elements to the writing and the production as well which felt kind of refreshing so I thought that was kind of interesting moving on from there Mercury Rev has a new record on the way single dropped sermon featuring Margo price each track on this thing just kind of features a different different musician different vocalist and yeah I mean it does live up to the title in that it sounds gospel inspired it does sound a little religious I can't say that I care for the vocal performance all that much it does feel emotionally a little monotone and one-dimensional it does kind of lose its flavor after a while as the performance is not that captivating it's not that passionate though again I do think it captures that general Gospel vibe along with the instrumental shadow - Mercury Rev for still keeping at it moving on from there this do cut from Mary Latimer it feels like floating yangtze healing fields remix guilty of serous Fame obviously yeah this thing I will admit I have not listened to it from corner to corner to corner as it is 22 minutes long and I I didn't have enough time to listen to the whole thing to get through it to do this video as most of the songs that I was into are much more compact what I'm talking about them here but I can say throughout this 22 minute song there are many many beautiful passages of glacial ambient tones and the vocals that are thrown onto it weave into them very nicely I can't say much for the composition having that's our I mean I guess maybe more of the structure having that strong of a direction to it especially since I wasn't able to sample the whole thing multiple times over but still at least aesthetically I can say the sound of this thing is pretty lush it's pretty gorgeous and maybe slightly haunting it at points with the vocals laid into it moving on from there a kodak black take one brand-new cut over here and yeah i mean i'll say this is consistently coherent much in the way a lot of his output has been lately it seems like kodak has been a little bit more on the ball in terms of just sounding a lot more intelligible on the mic and like he's really got like his  together like he's really focusing when he's in the studio however lyrically and stylistically I can't really say this is anything more than just kind of your average Kodak black track I mean if you've heard four or five of his best songs you've pretty much heard everything that this track has to offer honestly moving on from there sort of on the fence that this new Hannah diamonds song I do like the production that PC music brings to hannah diamonds and music I do like her vocals I think there's some elements of the lyrics on this track the the heartbreak and you know the relationship ending and so on and so forth that I thought were pretty captivating however I thought sort of going kind of a ballad direction with this song was kind of underwhelming and I'm not exactly sure if Hannah and the PC music crew have really worked out all the kinks when it comes to working her sound into more of a I guess subtle and emotionally captivating style a more dramatic style all the stuff that I've loved from Hannah up until this point have had like a lot of bump to it pretty straightforward pretty poppy postmodern futuristic and strange a little tongue-in-cheek however to take kind of a darker more subtle emotional approach on this new track over here it just felt like um you know something was missing certainly nuance you know because the instrumental while it is on the softer side it doesn't really have again I'll say nuanced a whole lot of nuance to it so there are things about this track that I like things that I think it could have done better but still all around give it a shot especially if you've been following everything PC music's have been doing up until this point moving on from there this new track from Co metha seen highriser production from kenny beats which is pretty much the reason I'm attracted to this thing some people have been asking me hey man what do you think about comethis scene what do you think about the new project at everything's you haven't reviewed the album I mean I feel like this song kind of puts pretty straightforwardly what exactly I feel about come at the scene and you know his sound and everything and while I like the production I like the energy that he brings on the microphone he just kind of sounds like a poor man's little pump at this point he just sounds like a boy he just sounds like a little pump knockoff and and that's it you know and listen he sounds young he's still kind of making his way in I'm sure and he can potentially go anywhere from here you know who knows at this point maybe he'll be the next Kendrick Lamar but for right now I can't really say he stands out in the current soundcloud rapper meta you know he just sounds really generic just sounds really run-of-the-mill it's got energy to it it bangs but there's not really any shelf life to it and I would say not really any shelf life beyond playing it twice you know because once you've heard it twice I mean there are better songs than this in this style so I mean why would I sit around listening to this but still that's not to say that that has anything to do with Kenny's production Kenny's bangin beat on this thing is actually the best thing about the song so moving on from there Big KRIT has dropped kind of a new little EP they're single or whatever three tracks higher King part six look what I got glorious can't really say they're the best that I've heard from him it could potentially be leftovers from his last full length album wouldn't be surprised if that's the case but yeah the production on these tracks is pretty basic songwriting is pretty basic as well thumb attica Lee not really anything newer cutting edge for crit just kind of seems like ideas that could have potentially been sketches at one point but he kind of brought them forward and the squeaked them up you know I guess cleaned them up rather to the point where they sounded high-grade and they sounded professionally pretty much sounded done but they're not like really the best songs that he's ever put out so you know bunch them together throw them together fans will eat them up yeah they're there okay you know if you like southern hip hop with a lot of soul some quality lyrics some thoughtful and personal song topics a lot of emotion on the mic check these tracks out not not really any bangers among these cuts either a little bit more on the introspective side from from crit on these cuts to moving on from there let's get into the best best best best best tracks first off want to give a shout out to the Onyx collective who have a new track out titled space Wars featuring sporting life yes that sporting life if you do remember rat king honest collective are a jazz outfit and this song over here sounds like if postmodern jazz had gone electronic shoegaze I'll say that much it's pretty intriguing and some really interesting horn melodies throughout this cut to moving on from there Kemba formerly known as YC the cynic has a brand new cut out featuring smee know who has been getting a lot of attention thanks to his full length that just dropped yeah I mean some of you guys might remember YC the cynic from one of my more positive reviews from a while ago and let me say he's really really flipped the script on the spra a new track over here I would say a lot of the great qualities of his music in the past have also carried over onto this new song its soulful its lyrical its passionate he's just got a great flow he's just got a great delivery but now instead of kind of trying to work with a more updated version of boom bap and jazz rap he's really trying to go super contemporary and is going into this this jazzy hip-hop neo-soul alternative R&B blend and despite the fact that I sort of see him as more of an MC or have seen him as more of an MC with a bit of an old-school soul he updates to this newer more contemporary sound really well and I think does it better than some of the people who actually have been working with this sound for a little while now I mean I appreciate that he's working with a guy likes me know because stylistically his stuff is very much in that same wheelhouse but personally I enjoy this track more than I have any song off of Cimino's new album you know not to hate on the dude or anything but it just is what it is so yeah highly recommend this track you know especially if you're into that more neo soul hip hop style that's very prevalent right now I feel like Kemba really pulls it off well moving on from there Danger Mouse and Karen O have miraculously collaborated on a new track titled Lux Prima and it is a epic symphonic piece of kind of art rock or kind of I don't know maybe baroque pop or something I'm not exactly sure how to categorize it but all I know is I'm hearing very artsy elements of rock music maybe a little indie in there and it's got kind of an orchestral presentation to it and it's pretty lengthy track as well so ambitious I guess efforts on both of their parts on this collaborative cut and they come together really well Karen oh I think cleans up very nicely on the microphone it's it's not typically the super emotionally tattered or kind of edgy vocals that you might remember her laying down on many yeah yeah yeahs record this is a much more hello Cara no but still I think she does pretty great on the song moving out from there digging on this new J Balvin track miraculously titled reggaeton which you know I've gotten people on my butt before so you don't review enough of that stuff or you don't like it or buh buh buh buh and yeah I mean honestly for a song that's obviously in the genre that it is time after yeah I enjoy quite a bit I mean it's got your typical like beat I do kind of like the very sweet what are they like kind of sent their guitar melodies that are looped throughout the track they are really really sweet they have a nice earworm quality to them and valve ins flows and vocal melodies over the track are really entertaining I know a lot of the time this music this genre gets derided as not being all that deep or significant or repetitive and so on and so forth but I do think Balvin does a great job of embodying everything that one would expect from a reggaeton song but with fresher more updated production and some actually stand out melodies that bring the sound bring the style quite a bit of flavor so I like the track it's a good tune there's a fun tune moving on from there hozier hozier who I reviewed not too long ago because he dropped a new EP movement is the name of this new suddenly dropped track and actually wish it had been released on the EP that he just came out with because it's actually a pretty powerful song gotta say I'm pretty hype for whatever album he has coming down the pipe in 2019 even if I did think that a lot of the songwriting on his breakout debut was so-so or really just kind of uh he was over selling out a little bit vocally but now this tune over here again powerful tune amazing finish great vocal melodies on this thing quality production so uh I don't know hopefully this next record ends up being a smash because I think the material that I'm hearing him create recently the direction that he's going in is a bit more flavorful tasteful more dynamic instrumentation better vocal performances so I'm down I'm down also down with this new Gucci Mane track Kevin gates which is one of the darkest eeriest and most cutthroat songs that a group has dropped in a while Kevin gates does pretty well on the track too so shout out to him and girl pool which is a project that I've never really been that into lately has dropped a song from the project's forthcoming album I believe it's dropping in February of 2019 that's pretty compelling it's a solid indie rock tune with I would say a width of Elias Smith coming out of the songwriting the guitar chords and the vocal melody are really impressive for a newer indie group which I mean a lot of the songwriting in the genre currently is either so bland or it's just trying to bite off of some old garage rock style or it's trying to bite off of some frigging you know Mack DeMarco melody or something like that this however had a bit of an edge to it and definitely took you know some some musical talent sort of drum up but I think this this melody and uh you know this is this chord progression and everything so moving on from there finally I think it's the last track that I want to shout out this new track from Fontaine's DC to real is the name of the song that I would love to point you guys to it's a very wiry intense piece of art punk that I thought was pretty fantastic I love the vocals on it and it comes with a really oddball music video involving I think a lot of ping pong balls do give it a shot as a fun time and that is going to be at for the weekly track roundup everybody remember once again this video is sponsored by the good people over at the ridge and also I voted link down there hit that up in the description box promo code Fantana along with once more all of the songs that I mentioned in this video hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of the weekly track roundup this week and I will see you in the next one in the next review anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
ZuiTDmMu01c,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new little peep record come over when you're sober part two this is the new posthumous full-length album from emo rap superstar and formerly goth boy clique member little peep come over when you're sober part two one of the year's most highly anticipated records and not just because of peeps unfortunate and sudden passing a year ago this month but also because currently the strain of emo wrap that peep is known for is kind of the current meta in track raft thanks to artists like him and bones and juice world as well as xx extant aussi own now it's been no secret that I haven't really been a fan of peeps material up until this point I named his 2016 project Hellboy is one of my least favorite of the year and with come over when you're sober part one I didn't exactly pull any punches on my dislike of that record either and I can't really say my expectations were all that high for the sequel especially since the big teaser track from this record which ended up being a bonus cut was the mostly unfinished collaboration with xxx ten tashi own which mostly read like a cobble together cash grab and whose intentions were already weird with xxx and tossing on recording the song with people already having been passed and now the intentions of releasing the track are even stranger with both of them being gone so I had a fear going into this that the rest have come over when you're sober would sound equally thrown together but it actually doesn't however that could be because a great deal of the material on this thing is older these songs run away in 16 lines or a few examples of tracks from this thing that were put up and pulled off of soundcloud at some point last year meanwhile the song life is beautiful is a remixed and retitled track back from 2015 still even with a lot of the material on this thing being familiar to hardcore peope fans already this is a pretty competently assembled pop rap album with an emo twist and when I say pop rap emphasis on the pop because the only thing the track hate me needs to be a song of the summer is a faster tempo and some bright quarter note piano chords splashing all over the chorus but cleaning up peep sound and making it more accessible is a double-edged sword because while there really arrey production on this thing is well put together and i guess it gives peeps vocals a solid platform the sound of this record is also really bland and inoffensive and unremarkable just really unreal and sanitary and while I can't say I'm a fan of peeps pass material it seems almost antithetical to his style to clean his sound up to the point where it just sounds like a bad blink-182 song a wash and reverb and wrapped in tacky synth strings like on the closing cut fingers what's worse is I think the production contributes to one of my least favorite aspects of peeps music up until this point and that's a sexy portrayal of some pretty dark themes there's totally nothing wrong with addressing things like heartbreak and depression and addiction in your music but the focus on these topics with come over when you're sober part two is softer than it's ever been to where these issues don't sound like problems that need to be faced but soap opera lovers that need to be embraced and stared into longingly even when peeping multiple overt references to his own death on this record it comes off more edgy and seductive than it does chilling or disturbing because he's actually passed away and I don't think this juxtaposition or peeps infatuation with dying is displayed any clearer than it is on the song sex with my ex it would be one thing if I felt this record was authentically displaying the dark realities of these problems the instrumentals with their basic trap beats and heavy bass and bittersweet strung out guitars certainly aren't doing that and neither are the lyrics which most of the time are frustratingly surface-level even when peeps seems to be at his most personal like on the track life is beautiful which is one of the more reflective cuts on this entire record even if the rhyme scheme the aaaa rhyme scheme of the track is tedious I mean sure some of the song structures on here could be better the hooks could pop a little bit more but really it's the content of these tracks that I can't really get into the lyrics on the song broken smile read like something the Joker might say about Harley Quinn in the midst of the Suicide Squad movie and honestly I still don't really care for the nasally dejected affectation that Pia puts on his voice when he's saying granted his vocal performances on this record I think are more dynamic than come over when you're sober part one who's instrumental palette is way more one-dimensional to certainly the sequel over here does feature some better singing does feature some heavier more luscious instrumentals which I think take the edge off of his voice a little bit with his vocals being sunk into the beat a bit more I also like the chorus in the grungy aesthetic of cry alone the song llenan also stands out as one of the better tunes on this thing also I don't give a f--- some of the lyrics on that track I found to be a little intriguing with some nods to laptops and monitor technology the creative process and the digital age emotions in the digital age but outside of that there's not really a whole lot about this record that appeals to me and partially I guess I could chalk that up to maybe this just not being for me but honestly I could easily see my way to liking something like this if the instrumentals were a bit more raw or had more variation or these song structures just had more peaks and valleys or if the lyrics were a bit more thoughtful but as it stands I can't really get into the plain writing and the bland instrumentals and just the general ethos of this record at all though it's far from the worst thing I've ever heard and certainly one of the more appealing things that I've heard come under the little people are I'm feeling a strong for tool like five on this

Dmom8_-isQA,ah hi everyone luckily cracked Hanano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new album from jeffrey lewis and the deposit returners works by Julie Cooper Berg 1923 to 2010 this is the latest full-length album from New York anti-folk veteran Jeffrey Lewis and his band a man who has long been under appreciated in the New York music scene and it's kind of understandable as to why as Jeff's sound is not really for everybody his voice his guitar playing the instruments he chooses to surround his songs in have a seasoned and yet very rickety quality to them that could only be honed through decades of going against the grain and being greatly influenced by generations of artists who have done the same pioneering raw forms of freaky funk and proto-punk just to name a very select few The Velvet Underground David Peel holy modal rounders as well as a group by the name of the Fugs who featured poet cartoonist songwriter - Lee Cooper Berg whose works are the basis of this very covers album right here - Lee and the greater part of the 60s 70s New York underground scene were introduced to me by Jeffrey himself about a decade ago with a captivating performance of poetry and music about a loose history of the scenes major songs and players and progressions a lot of which is typically forgotten in favor of a lot of the big names to come out of punk rock in the late 70s as if this movement and this genre of music just kind of came out of nowhere but Jeffrey very much remembers and celebrates this lineage and embodies it in his music - maybe more than any other anti folk Act to come out of New York in the late 90s or the 2000s even when the scene was kind of peaking around 2007 when the Moldy Peaches were kind of dominating that hit Juno soundtrack now while the songs on this record are in fact covers for a lot of young listeners these might as well be originals because Jeff has pulled some real obscurities out of the abyss on this one as his renditions of these tracks are now like the first thing that pops up when you try to search for them plus the way Jeffrey has updated and revised these songs they play very nicely into his creaky nasal voice his disheveled folk rock instrumentation the somewhat out of tune guest singers the only thing more raw than the sound of this album are the lyrics early on you can hear this is not an album that's going to take itself too seriously and will address some very weird and awkward topics especially considering the opening track is essentially about wanting to start a friendship with someone after an orgy what are you going to do after the orgy I want to make friends with you after the og the messy group vocals and kind of chaotic folk rock guitars on this one make groups like the Violent Femmes sound slick and there's a good handful of other tracks on this thing that are equally absurd like the track I want to hold your foot which is essentially a topical remix of the Beatles song I want to hold your hand but this new take on the song is is four foot fetishists complete with a little vocal break featuring some members of the band talking about what they feel is the sexiest part of the foot and then there's one of my favorite cuts on this thing this is a hit song a rowdy low fight punk rocker with distorted bass and jamming piano chords with these manic group vocals all chanting this is a hit so I'm gonna make me rich why don't you buy it you son of a bitch and being a New Yorker through and through what with this Jeffrey Lewis album be without a plucky folk tune about the decaying New York City subway system on this train is bound for Brooklyn also another catchy and supremely upbeat highlight on this thing but one of the oddest cuts on this entire record has to be the song hypothalamus which is literally about the hypothalamus region of the brain the instrumentation the tune is very repetitive very sour and odd not all that catchy meanwhile mixed in the chaos of the music is Jeffrey Lewis rattling off all of this encyclopedic knowledge of the hypothalamus it is hilarious and informative there's some more serious cuts on here that range from being joyful to addressing some of the worst sides of mankind whether that be the song try to be joyful which seems almost like joy as an act of resistance in the face of a horrible and callous world also love and ashes which is a chilling ballad set to what sounds like of news broadcasts and speeches with lyrics about dropping the atom bomb during world war two war and death and so on and so forth and that is juxtapose against love and marriage and people somehow I guess just finding a significant other in the midst of this world full of turmoil however the message of the song doesn't really seem like hopeful or inspiring or anything like that it just merely seems like a very dark contrast there are quite a few for lauren cuts on this record to dealing in death and mortality and so on and so forth and i get the sense that this album is also kind of a delayed send-off for tule by jeffrey and his band as he wasn't just simply an inspiration on Jeffrey's artistic works written sung and drawn jeffrey also knew the man personally so there is certainly an unshakable feeling on this record that when Jeffrey and his man are singing about things like life and death mortality it's done out of respect for to Lee's legacy and art especially when Jeffrey can shift the focus or the lyrics on this album toward him like on life is strange and listen to the Mockingbird now there are also some moody or more low-key moments on this record that I think are essential for building out a quality varied tracklist but these songs also serve as some of the roughest listens on the entire record and not for their lack of heart or emotion either but in kind of keeping with the spirit of some of these very freaky folk tunes and the era of music Jeffrey is trying to emulate on this record there are a lot of spots where him and the band will throw in these very freaky goofy background vocals that honestly don't fly over that well make the tracks difficult to listen to they kind of sound like Brack from space ghost coast to coast like wailing away in the background especially on tracks like carpe diem or seize the day and I was much mistaken whose original version doesn't even really call for vocals like this yeah unfortunately that element of this record does really take me out of enjoying some parts of this record it does and I can understand the difficulties of trying to recreate the freakishness of some of those older records in in the modern day because some of that weird singing in a group came over in a smudgy or recording which I think gave you more leeway then these days when you're kind of you know throwing vocals on to a digital multitrack generally though I did enjoy this album quite a bit it's a pretty captivating set of funny and emotionally cutting renditions of the ripped tattered torn lost and ignored pages from the American Songbook and even though there is some instrumentation and singing on this record that is a little too flimsy for me simultaneously that also adds to the appeal of so many other tracks on this record so you know I guess you win some you lose some it is what it is I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you

5vXVnzY_zn4,know anybody but my imagine this new imagine dragons album he's gonna do it he's gonna do it no it's not good origins is the fourth full-length album from las vegas nevada pop rock band imagine dragons who up until this point I've not really been a big fan of because of their reputation and and typical sound basically overblowing the trappings of pop rock to the point where they are arena sized soloists I can't say I've heard a single imagine dragon song that I didn't think was overly dramatic overproduced blown up to the point where the band is making these mountainous songs out of molehills you know in most situations I think I would have just let this album fly under my radar and just went on living my life but honestly I was challenged to try it my curiosity got the best of me and you know worst fears confirmed kicking things off on this record the opening track is actually not that bad it has one of the more solid Tunes on the entire record but what bugs me about this song is that this band is four albums in and yet they don't really have a strong definitive sound I could tether directly to them as the first thing you're showing me here sounds like a bad mashup of Coldplay in the Foo Fighters which is a pretty prevalent mix of influences throughout this entire LP a lot of the time the vocals don't really know whether or not they want to dig down deep and give that guttural David Grohl or just croon really softly and maturely like a Chris Martin and honestly there are some melodies and song structures on this record that aren't that bad but truly what makes this record so distasteful to me is that it falls into a lot of the same traps and cliches that many millennial pop acts do or are trying to write music that sounds so crucial as if this record is defining a cultural moment with its faux cinematic blown out compress to hell instrumentation the melodramatic vocals the fake deep lyrics the song boomerang is one of the most annoying repetitive up-down on again-off again relationship songs I've ever heard and I pray the day they invent time travel never happens because if it doesn't akin the song back to night ninety-four in convincing Peter Gabriel to destroy all of his masters up until that point because yeah it just kind of sounds like an awful modern millennial take on a Peter Gabriel song the song machine is an even stranger headache and combination of themes and musical ideas the sound of this thing is really heavy its clunky it's like listening to industrialised pop rock simultaneously the lyrics are about being a part of some sort of underclass whether that be a social underclass or an economic underclass and I'm just not going to be a part of the Machine anymore bro it's not going to be part of this machine the chorus is a terrible revision of rock and roll so put another dime in the gym as man man so having mentioned all that this song is like a socialist steampunk Joan Jett ripoff whose goal is revolution but all it ends up being is revolting so halfway there and like many other millennial pop acts I feel imagine dragons also suffer on this album from a case of boring verse syndrome where you have a singer or a songwriter or a band structuring a song out and the hook really pops it might have a great melody it might have a grand burst and instrumentation or volume and it hits hard it's an exciting moment it's a great transition but the verse leading up until that point is absolutely boring the singing is super subdued not much of a strong melody to speak of the instrumentation is stripped back to its barest of necessities it just seems like these moments are meant to put the audience into a boring chilled out low so once that chorus finally hits it's bad what makes the problem worse for imagine dragons though is they're putting too many eggs into too few baskets the baskets being the choruses and the courses aren't even that great in fact most of the time they're annoying this is like the worst Bon Iver chorus imaginable mixed with a touch of chill wave I guess with the instrumentals kind of glistening retro synths also by this point on the album I've kind of realized that the mix sucks the mixes on these songs are awful not only because the vocals are not really good enough to be this upfront and in-your-face but also because the compression on these songs is Wow to the point where even the softer tracks on this thing sound blown the hell out super smooth glacial walls of synthesizers and bass just kind of crushing down any vocals that are mixed into it once the instrumentation swells on the hook making the vocals sound like they're being pulled through a trash compactor another unfortunate thing about this album because if the compression was not quite as bad if the hooks and even a great deal of other parts on this album weren't so brick walled I think a lot of these songs would be more listenable and listen I'm not some soldier fighting the other side in the loudness war a lot of the time I don't really mind modern music production I think compression can be a great tool and it has its place it has its time but there are moments in which it is blatantly overused and this is a prime example of that the awful and corny choruses on this thing keep coming and coming and come back I'll blblblblblblbl blblblblblblbl do as cuz honey not only does the song West Coast make me feel like millennial pop acts have just ruined folk music but it also reminds me of avicii's wake me up but it doesn't turn into an EDM banger then we have the song zero zero from the wreck-it Ralph Ralph breaks the internet movie this track is an odd mix of things I'm catching whiffs of we didn't start the fire and then there's like this radio rock this pop punky radio rock song from the 90s of the 2000s that I cannot place when I listen to this thing but god it's killing me whenever I listen to it once again I can appreciate that imagine dragons pull from a pretty wide array of influences across the pop spectrum but God they throw them into the worst repackaging hello hello let me tell you what it's like to be a zero zero this song sounds like if Coldplay didn't take themselves too seriously and just decided they're gonna go full Smash Mouth that being said I could foresee society moving into a dystopian future where basically wreckit-ralph replaces Shrek in like meme culture and this song essentially becomes the new all-star now if it wasn't enough for the choruses on this album to be terrible the instrumentals actually start getting awful too and keep in mind the mixes and compression are still absolute garbage the lead vocals on the song bullet in a gun are really distant really raw and overacted they are surrounded with this very skeletal instrumental with a kind of lo-fi stuttering bit of percussion I really can't place stylistically where the band was trying to go with this it sounds kind of experimental in a way like something he might find in a one at Rick's point never or a Death Grips or maybe like a an mi a song back in the day I have to admit I do find the very dark themes of bipolar disorder and depression and suicide and lyrics on this track kind of intriguing specifically filtering these feelings through the pressures of being an artist dealing not only with accusations of being a sellout by your fans but maybe also some negative criticisms too so I guess let the record show that I don't totally mind the messaging and the intention behind this song but the musical package that it's held with him doesn't really make it any easier to swallow the song digital is maybe my least favorite on the entire record as it features the messiest song the most blown out chorus on the entire record it's like this album with it's awful compressed production is a really long elaborate bass boost meme that gets heavier and heavier and heavier as it goes along and after multiple listens I'm still not sure if I can make heads or tails of this song there's very little about this specific track that is coherent not just because of the production and the sound and mix but there are multiple vocal lines that don't really match up the breakbeat percussion on this cut is absolutely horrendous the folk gear passages seem to clash really heavily with the more electronic passages it's really garish and one of the most awful amalgamations of ideas and aesthetics I've heard in a while thankfully the band really kind of lets listeners off a little easy with some more easygoing songs toward the end the way the tracks stuck kicks off if I squint my eyes and I just pretend them in a different place I could kind of see my way to it being like I don't know a Vampire Weekend song produced for Taylor Swift fans that is until on the hook we get one of the worst vocals on the entire record featuring this totally strained horrendous time goes ba yeah this is not a great vocal performance between these three words we have such an incredible boost in volume and aggression time goes blah the closing track is kind of cute though in that yeah it's another kind of blown out chorus awful sound it's basically like pops answer to tinnitus but the song hilariously ends off with this refrain where did we all go wrong literally at the very end of the track and yeah I mean I I agree if if this was something that I had a hand in that is the first thing that would come to my mind once it was finished with where did we all go wrong yeah this imagine dragons album it's not good 
e4zQHNTEqEw,ah hi everyone oh bloody Oh blood tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sun Kil moon record this is my dinner this is the newest full-length album from singer-songwriter mark Koz Lex Sun Kil moon mark is an Ohio native who has been in the industry for years now and the third and current act of his career has been one of the most interesting artistic trajectories of any songwriter out there patient and contemplative music have always been a part of Mark's repertoire going back to his days fronting slow core gods the red house painters and he's still a pretty thoughtful guy now but his songwriting style has become radically different over the years recently I'd say it's been evolving faster and faster thanks in part to a very prolific release schedule the overwhelming age of information that we live in as well as Marc's very unfiltered lyrical style a lot of this can be traced back to a handful of records that came out in the first part of this decade perils from the sea among the leaves and marks most popular album in years Benji also an influential factor in this evolution I think was the beef that mark found himself embroiled in after some offhand stage banter that basically put him in a sensationalized beef with the band the war on drugs mark also did not hesitate to put himself at odds with both music fans and journalists as he trolled them mercilessly with both crude lyrics and commentary a lot of this drama culminated into a one-off tune named after the stage banter they got mark in trouble in the first place recording a 7-minute diatribe about a mostly made-up conflict that would have evaporated in a week had you ignored it for some songwriters that might seem a little too specific a little too niche but an extreme focus on minutiae has become a key feature of Mark's music ever since whether that being his solo stuff or his Sun Kil moon stuff the various collaborations he's explored for the past few years like with Sean Heaton as well as Justin Broderick just to name a few now going into this new LP I was not sure if Mark could get even more meta given his last album it was a solo record that he put out just earlier this year the album featured a series of very serene semi ambient guitar backing tracks with mark waxing poetic for seven to ten min at a time about his hometown his past boxing interactions with various people and even lawn maintenance I don't mean to oversimplify Marc's approach to songwriting in this era of his career but the simplicity of it is part of its beauty the rawness of it how in the moment it feels and how unedited mark is when it comes to the details he surrenders in his lyrics or the topics that he chooses to approach on top of it none of this would be as compelling as it actually is if Mark was not a talented storyteller because I can't really name any other songwriter so I would listen to just rail on and on and on for two hours or 90 minutes and I would actually enjoy it that's definitely something to behold as is Marc's heightened sense of self-awareness and his utter demolition of the fourth wall over the past few years to the point where I just don't even anticipate it to exist anymore on a record that he makes but for mark tearing down the separator between the artist and the audience is not enough because on this is my dinner I would say he's tearing down a fifth wall as well and transcending the actual medium that he's making art within I mean I don't think anybody would categorize this album as anything else other than music but I don't really enjoy this album the same way that I typically enjoy music because with marks tangents on this record getting more rambley less focused less edited and with the instrumentals growing even more inoffensive and repetitive I don't really feel like I'm focusing on or enjoying the musical aspects of this album at all I'm more or less just reading into the ongoing story of Mark kozilek which I've been pretty deeply locked into for almost half a decade now because honestly listening to this album it feels more like listening to a podcast or a totally raw unending youtube vlog where the host just divulge 'as any and all personal information that they possibly can and I don't think I'm alone in observing mark crossing over this imaginary line because there's literally a point on this album in Mark's lyrics if you could even call them lyrics because he's barely even singing again he's really just more rambling his way through these instrumentals there's literally a point where he admits that what he's per for doesn't really make for much of a song and honestly I just took that as a statement of fact as opposed to him trying to beat his detractors to a criticism because there are a lot of things I like about this record but a lot of the time they just revolve around whatever story mark is telling on a track or whatever story within a story he's telling or whatever story within a story within a story he's telling whether it be experiences he's having while out on the road in Scandinavia which narrative Lee makes for a great deal of this record whether Mark is talking about the setting the scenery the towns the people he's meeting his moodiness his jetlag a lot of this really ties the album together especially in the first half then we have some moments where he's shouting out some of his favorite but also his least favorite music whether it be queen or the Eagles also a foreign boxer he admires disgraced by his fellow countrymen for not matching up to Mike Tyson in a fight there's a pretty memorable point on the album where mark is singing about a little girl dealing with like some kind of call for breathing issue and he actually goes on to mimic the sound of this problem in the song really something I wanted to hear in 2018 there's also an interesting story on this record about mark burning an old apartment down by leaving some candles out while he left the place also mark not being able to finish a song that he was typing out on his computer on an airplane because the stewardess told him to close his laptop after which the refrain that he goes into refers to the song itself being unfinished on the plane that he is flying on at that very moment I could go on but again little of what I like about this record and what I remember from it as well has little to do with the music on it and when the music does stand out it's not always for the best reasons like on the song Linda Blair the blippi stuttering guitar lines that plink and plunk their way through the track at least the first leg of it anyway are tedious and annoying there's also a really funny one minute cover of The Partridge Family theme song on this album - which plays into the previous track on the album which is part David Cassidy tribute but also part long-winded introduction to the cover which mark refers to at least a few times on the song saying hey we're gonna play this cover also in which mark highly the David Cassidy autobiography come on get happy but mark doesn't really get too bogged down in the details of David Cassidy's story as it seems like he really does want his audience to buy and read the book which I guess in a way just intensifies my feelings about this album just vibing a lot more like a podcast than a record because literally throughout this thing I'm getting book recommendations Hotel recommendations some music reviews a little bit of a travelogue some documentary and storytelling and a sense of existential dread that rivals that of Marc Maron when Marc starts singing about how boner pill commercials are suddenly appealing to him because his peepee don't get as hard no more this thing is a unique and also a truly strange listen but also somewhat disappointing because while I do enjoy Marc's lyrics I enjoy his storytelling I enjoy his personality but I also enjoy the man's musical talents which I don't think are adequately showcased on this record as a lot of the time it feels like the music's only directive on this record is to be as basic and as loosely structured and is out of the way as possible to just kind of let Marc sit on top of it and rail away I mean there are some cute musical moments on the record like some of the group refrains on the bluesy this is not possible some of the noisy guitar freak outs on the track chapter 87 of he also the elongated vocal notes on the cut rock and roll singer which is hands-down my favorite track on this entire record the tried and true country chords of the David Cassidy track are also kind of quaint but all of this is barely enough to drive me back to this album honestly so while I respect Marc kozilek expanding his storytelling abilities on this album and completely break down the rules of what it means to write record and sell a song musically speaking I think this album is also one of his less interesting in recent memory I'm feeling a decent to a strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit

oHIXPOHr6JI,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Metro boomin album not all heroes wear capes Metro boomin is a hip-hop producer songwriter DJ from the great city of st. Louis who has become one of the biggest most in-demand and respected names in this current wave of pop rap and trap since the earlier part of this decade now to be completely honest I've never really been that huge into Metro boomin production though there have been numerous songs over the years that I just happened to like the track that he's producing for or maybe his beat just stands out to me I think one of my favorite metro beats so far has been what he placed on Kanye's father stretched my hands part 1 with Kid Cudi so Metro certainly does have these moments where he stands out and puts forward some bold production but a lot of the time stylistically he's much more known for putting out these various skeletal simple trap beats based on some very basic ideas and musical fundamentals which texturally are not really that bold they're not really that loud or aggressive or intrusive the best thing you could say Metro does consistently is serves as a very complementary platform for the many artists that have become very well known thanks to the beats that he has made for them people like Kodak black and future and migos young thug also 21 savage and Metro is connection to 21 21 does talk to his very simple and Spacey and basic approach because one of Metro boomin 's most notorious projects is his collaborative effort with 21 savage savage mode not a record I'm super enthusiastic about but it still stands as one of the most popular and yet strip back to the barest essential trap albums to date so regardless of whether or not I find his beats to be all that bold it still remains that Metro boomin is one of the most xian'er defining producers that trap has had to offer through his production through the choice of artists he has decided to work with through his writing so it came as a shock and a big disappointment for a lot of people when about six or seven months ago Metro boomin announced that he would be retiring from music I guess which is kind of strange considering just how much name recognition and hype that had around the time that he decided to quit but now not even a year after making this public statement we're here with a new help and you know it's it's fine I'll take it I'll take it so Metro boomin not all heroes wear capes what is this in a lot of ways this project is like a lot of producer guided Records where they just grab an array of features from some of their favorite artists that they work with over the years hopefully they put their best production forward and you mostly kind of focus on that and hopefully the whole thing just comes out listenable typically I find a lot of these producer guided projects to be a bit of a mixed bag and I think that's also the case for this new Metro boomin though there are some interesting aspects and highlights to it that if they had carried out through the rest of the LP I think this could have been a more formidable project even if there are some moments on this thing where I do think the beats underwhelm a little bit there is actually some standout production on this thing Metro boomin does go a little bit more above and beyond then it seems like he's willing to on some other tracks that he's produced in the past whether that be through implementing a beats which up where he introduces a new rhythm a new set of tones or since or a sample or something bored by just kind of beautifully building onto the track with some new keys or harmonies like in the case of the gun and young thug track lesbian so musically in instrumentally Metro boomin he is kind of stepping out of his comfort zone a little bit and is willing to outshine the guests artists that he has on this album a bit more and honestly I wish it was something he did a bit more routinely not just within the context of a record like this that's named after himself because it's not like a lot of people are listening to these artist voices for the lyrics anyway they're just kind of in it for the inflection the emotional presentation the melody that they might be singing especially in the case of young thug and gonna and Travis Scott so why not get a little bit more out there with the drums and the sense and the string samples are like a little bit of horns some of the trap rhythms on this thing might be a little basic and formulaic certainly nothing that you haven't heard before on a previous Metro boomin single but some of the keys and atmospheres that he conjures on this record are gorgeous tracks like the only one interlude with Travis Scott as well as the previous cut featuring Travis Scott and young thug are some of the most psychedelic and surreal trap music that I've heard in the past few years rivaling anything that I've heard off of a railroad rodeo or his previous LP Astroworld also another thing to mark the instrumental creativity of this record is how seamlessly a lot of these tracks flow together as Metro comes up with a lot of synth and sample-based segues to bring one track into another to really make this record a pretty cohesive listen so yes there are some cool beats on here Metro does arrange some interesting synth passages that are some great segues here and there it's a pretty cohesive project aesthetically but there are moments where falters either where a metro boomin is delivering production or allowing artists to give performances on his tracks that are just utterly average the track 10 a.m. slash save the world featuring gucci mane you can really kind of place this track anywhere not just on this album but i think anywhere on the metro project on a gucci project and it really wouldn't stand out in any way shape or form outside of Gucci means somewhat silly inflection on the track there's not really a lot about it that stands out and there are some other features on here that range from being either run-of-the-mill or pretty horrendous whether again it be the redundancy of gonna and young thug on the same track lesbian which again those synth and piano passages that he adds into the cut really the only thing that makes that track exciting in the second half dreamcatcher featuring sway leav Rae sremmurd Fame and Travis Scott is probably the weakest Travis appearance on the entire record sway Lee doesn't have a single good performance on this thing in fact he gets worse on the track borrowed love featuring wizkid which is not only a really awkward transition in a more of a dancehall sound but sway Lee's vocals on this track it's absolutely awful and codec black doesn't really do much better on the cut no more unfortunately is his one appearance on this record is not one of his best features in a while he's particularly off vocally and sui key for a while now it seemed like some of the more recent features were a bit more on point and coherent but it's like he's almost lost grip of that once again with this latest one also let me talk about the redundancy of the appearances by many of the same artists on this record I get the people like sway Lee and Travis Scott and so on and so forth are some of Metro's favorite artists to work but for the sake of the album's variety could we have not gotten some more artists in here like some other members of migos or Big Sean or even future where is future on this thing future is nowhere to be found outside of of course the the watermark if ya Metro done just consistently the best person on this record honestly is 21 Savage every verse he drops on this thing is cutthroat as hell it is fire and that whisper breakdown on don't come out the house is is necessary yes in the midst of his performance on this track 21 savage just literally just breaks into whisper raps literal whisper raps so as I mentioned earlier we do have Metro boomin attempting a really awkward dancehall track on borrowed love the following cut with wizkid and offset sees him embarking on maybe like a bit of a Latin pop vibe J Balvin is on the track as well whose feature is also one of the least notable on the entire record and you know that's the thing while Metro does bring forward some good production on this record a lot of this album's appeal does come down to whether or not the performances on top of these tracks by the rappers and singers that he brings on is all that good because yeah while you can make the argument and it has been made over and over and over none of these rappers would be anything without these producers make good beats for a man yeah that's true but I mean the material on this thing is only good as the performances that someone like gonna is doing on top of it and honestly the track that he has on this record it's actually not one of his worst but still not stupendous enough to really stand out so unfortunately the Achilles heel of this record is really that it's it's a bit of a one-trick pony and I think Metro put too many eggs in too few baskets by syncing a lot of airtime into a very small collective of rappers unfortunately some of whom actually did give some really incredible performances on maybe one occasion on the record but every other moment they would return was noticeably weaker generally I thought this LP was pretty likable it doesn't try to overstay its welcome either overload you with too many tracks and at this super simple and spacious style of track production is your thing I definitely recommend trying this record out because it is pulled together in a superb fashion on air for sure in its best moments anyway I appreciate the segue as the cohesion the production quality the best moments from standouts like 21 savage but really all of that was not enough to make this record fire from front to back I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have

_VopAZBC4Ok,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another weekly truck roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week we're all linking them down there below in the description box for you guys of course along with our support page link where for the rest of this week this is available for the rest of this week and

it's okay you know life goes on and we'll have more shirts coming down the pipe I'm sure we also have down there our Amazon and turntable lab associate links hit up that turntable a blank grab yourself a colorful pressing of a record a turntable some audiophile gear some speakers we get kicked back from it supports the channel supports the segment and let's get into a few shout outs first integrity have interestingly enough dropped a cover of bark at the moon by Ozzy Osbourne and the band's sort of grimy metalcore stylings apply to this heavy metal classic this hard rock classic pretty nicely so there is that there's also a new sort of dubs EP of gorillas toss tracks that have been thrown up on to band camp that are relatively Spacey weird and interesting that I highly recommend you check out if you've enjoyed guerrilla tosses last fling thread which I gave a very positive review to and also audio Mac in collaboration with Chief Keef in a full symphony orchestra we have Chief Keef performing love Sosa over a full symphony orchestra and it's a quite interesting I'll leave it at that quite interesting all right let's again - lets get into the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks least interesting tracks this week for one this new extract bad which is a posthumously released song which is set to be on his very soon to come posthumous album and yeah I mean it just seems really short and cobbled together and almost as if like X was just vocalizing over a beat and not that he had like a strong lyrical direction or idea for this track in any way shape or form it just kind of seems like vocally he's riffing they probably touched up the production a little bit to make it sound more finished and complete and unfortunately it just seems like the label is doing what it can to just release more music after his passing to just make a buck off of it which is kind of unfortunate given given the state of the the material that that that seems to be getting released so far you know it would be one thing if we were hearing tracks that sounded and felt exciting and complete but that just doesn't really seem to be the case for me with this bad single and saying bad I mean the title we also have another track from Tyler the Creator from the grinch sound track this one I am the Grinch and once again it just kind of sounds like a flower boy left over with lyrics about the Grinch on I mean yeah I can't really say I'm all that interested in this I mean I love musically the direction Tyler has been going in lately love flower boy but just kind of taking those sounds and that vibe in that direction and just working it into a children's movie blockbuster film just seems like the worst use of your time in your art but hey you know dude's got to get paid I guess moving on from there not really caring all that much for this new panda bear single the song dolphin which yeah I mean there are some interesting ideas flowing throughout this track at the start I do like some of the water drip samples I do like some of the vocalizations on the track but the vocals are incredibly up front and naked much more than you would expect from a panda bear track and without the few layers of reverb and all the distance that usually a sort of is is sort of washed on to panda bears voice the the vocals just sound really bad they just don't sound good they sound awkward and the beat I mean as novelist some of the ideas in it are like the water samples they do get really annoying and stale after a while and I can't really say I care for this one all that much and it makes me even less excited to hear this new full-length album though I've never been known to love that much animal collective solo stuff anyways so I digress moving on from there Ice Cube arrested the president yeah all I can really say is this track is trying too hard it's it's trying way too hard I mean I understand the point and the urgency and the significance of the present of the present but I feel like this track doesn't really bring us any closer to the goal of what it's seeking to spread the message about it's just a kind of cringy and awkward mess unfortunately despite the fact that I think the flows and the instrumental are not that bad it's just really the messaging and the tone that's kind of obnoxious and difficult to swallow moving on from their videos sound machine with this new track titled Basquiat which really just kind of sounds like and totally unfinished and boring left over from their last full-length LP I just really don't know what to say about this track other than that it just seems like a really unfinished snippet a very vague completely unpressed idea that shouldn't have seen the light of day until it got a bit more time attention development structure and I don't know some kind of standout melody or something it just kind of seems like a very bland bass sign jam from this band who previously have made some really inventive and cutting-edge takes on Afrobeat that I think are really cool so hopefully future tracks are a lot better let's move into the songs that I thought were kind of meh we're blowing me away you know weren't blowing me away but certainly worth mentioning certainly worth talking about kicking things off with smee no new track clink previously i wasn't really all that huge on this Midwestern rapper thought he kind of drown in the influences of his contemporaries specifically out of the chicago area wasn't too crazy about that however this new track over here sees him being much more eccentric and out there in terms of his vocal delivery his inflections the flows are pretty speedy and nutty and strange I don't think this track is one of his strongest songs though which is kind of what's holding me back from really loving it there were some strong tunes off of his last full-length record but personality-wise they felt a little bland however he continues down this road I could certainly see a point at which he's combining this more adventurous sound and delivery and rap style with some better tunes and hopefully that ends up being the case moving on from there Smashing Pumpkins have a brand new track out from their forthcoming album Knights of Malta is the title of this new track and it's actually not too bad certainly not as disappointing as the previous Smashing Pumpkins track that the band had released truth be told this song sounds a lot like something out of The Melancholy era you know it's it's not anything too refreshing or new for Smashing Pumpkins but it sounds like a really nice piece of orchestral backed like alternative rock with a pretty passionate chorus like Billy Corrigan's vocals on the track a lot it's just not really anything all that new or exciting conceptually and I think it's the best tune Billy's ever written or anything like that but it's certainly a bit more interesting and exciting than I think some of the recent stuff he's been writing under the Smashing Pumpkins name so it's cool to hear the band kind of reform almost in totality and and get back to releasing some pretty decent music so moving on from there mineral the legendary emo band has come out with their first song in about 20 years and the title of the track is Aurora can't say I'm all that crazy about it I mean it does have an ambitious length and structure to it there are some pretty huge and I guess emotionally gripping guitar passages on the track but honestly the song sounds a lot like a really lackluster Christian rock song but the Christianity is like nowhere in sight which is really odd typically I feel like this sound comes with much preacher lyrics and much less twang II lead guitars but yeah it didn't really care for the super clean aesthetic of it all that much and obviously their older material material is pretty great but I'm hoping that they released something with I don't know a bit more anything to it than what they've just kind of put out not really digging the new Ice Age track that much either I mean it's decent it's got a good groove to it it sounds lowdown it sounds dirty it sounds filthy but like a lot of the lowest moments off of their last full-length LP it just kind of feels like the band hits a bit of a groove a bit of a stride and they ride it out and there's not much of a tune to it there's not really that much of in the engine not not that much in the way of interesting lyricism on the track either it just kind of gets lost in its haze and lost in its vibe and then it fizzles out eventually it's really not one of their best tracks to be fair even if again I do like the the sound that the band continues to conjure and let's move on to the tracks that I thought were some of the best this week the songs that really stood out to me first off saba who is also a rapper that previously I've been a little underwhelmed by he just dropped this new track over here featuring Xavier Omar and Mick Jenkins it actually hits pretty hard the features are great the instrumentals cool a lot of things to love about this track definitely try it out especially if you've seen me underwhelmed by his work in the past and thought yeah you know maybe I won't try that but now I'm asking you know definitely come around on the dude maybe you know give him another chance give another chance moving on from there little wayne has seen fit to drop a few sort of extra bonus tracks from his latest full-length album the Carter 5:1 has post Malone on it there was another track as well but the track that I would like to point your attention to is this one featuring gucci mane in this house definitely one of the could have been one of the best tracks on the album had it been released along with the rest of the songs you know really the Carter 5 it's it's truly a bloated record and I don't know man I feel like it could have been one of Wayne's best had it been pared down a little bit you know had it been pared down a little bit because truth be told it does feature some of his best material in a long time moving on from there yeah this this new weird kpop tune from League of Legends this League of Legends made-up group K / da pop / stars featuring Madison beer gee I do Jerry a Byrnes yeah I'm not really all that deeply familiar with like where this coming from who this artists are who these artists are so you know don't look to be the sort of inform you about this track all I can tell you is that this song is a total frigging banger the sassy vocals the chorus is really bright and fun and fantastic the beat is awesome yeah I say just give in to it I guess this thing is like a total League of Legends answer to guerrillas it's it's quite fun it's quite fun JPG mafia and kenny beets have gotten together for a brand new single titled Puff Daddy and it is a total frigging banger JPG mafias voice is just on the edge not as best lyrics but his performance is certainly there and Kenny beats production is glitchy it's wild it's off the rails it's distorted it's absolutely nuts I mean if you've enjoyed some of the weird aggressive beats this dude has come out with four reco nasty you want to listen to this track because not only does that hit that hard and maybe even a little harder but also I think he does his best to match the kind of noisy distorted weirdo aesthetic that JPEG mafia is known for so really excited to see these guys together and hope fully distract lands on something a bit more significant moving out from there a jid and j.cole have come out with a brand new track titled off DS and Jesus Christ this song is hard the flows on this track are amazing and Col totally keeps up jid kills this friggin track like he's just ah he's just a fire on this song again not just flow eyes but also lyrically too and you know I don't know if I've ever heard coal to be so excited on the song honestly you know him and Kendrick have collaborated in the past and honestly they typically come off a little sleepy er you know those those crossovers that I would like them to be and meanwhile get over here with Jake holes just really like lighting a fire under his ass and Cole's just really trying to push it as hard as I guess he can push it just to keep up to kids level on this track dude is really coming out with a lot of impressive materials so it's gonna be awesome when he drops his next full-length move not from their health and youth code give us the crossover that we never knew we wanted if you're not familiar with the experimental and in harsh kind of noisy but someone also poppy music group health I highly recommend you give their stuff a try go into their back catalogue but also they've been dropping a lot of impromptu and totally surprise collaborations with an array of different artists over the last few weeks and youth code seems to be the latest of them sort of industrial noise punk outfit youth code and the to complement to each other really well on this abrasive compelling and somewhat catchy hellscape so shout out to health and youth code moving out from their new earl single which i gave a full length review to on the Fantana channel go subscribe there if you haven't and yeah this this new track whoo-hoo I'm being so dumb it's titled nowhere to go and yeah it's a pretty sweet cut with some very interesting psychedelic surreal mind-bending production Earl's voice kind of dipping in and out of the beat disappearing reappearing it's really strange and and I think the song has a pretty strong message in terms of kind of losing track of yourself wanting to find yourself knowing yourself understanding yourself and certainly this could potentially lead to a really interesting new full-length album very soon so I mean I know there's a new album on the way but it'll be interesting to see how this track ties into the rest of it given it is so short and could potentially like segue into other cuts or just kind of add to an overall seamless vibe across an entire record especially if the production is pretty consistently trippy and weird Conor Oberst has dropped a brand new sort of acoustic piano ballad guitar ballad but I think is pretty sweet pretty bitter lyrically and I think it's one of his best ballads in a while moving on from there Anderson pack I think this is the last one we're gonna talk about here new song who are you not quite as synth funky as his last length album but it's a it's a bit more rap centric but it's a still a smooth and charismatic banger Anderson pack really come through with that pure unadulterated uncut charisma and just the good funky groove in a tune to go along with it so those are the tracks that I want to recommend to you guys this week thank you very much you're the year the best here the year the best here the year the best remember hit up those links down there in the description box along with the shirt if you want to pick up that before the week is out and hope all you guys are doing well believe in you love you hugs and kisses see you in the next video Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
tPU_qMbBPTY,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and here we are for a review new take off album the last rocket take off if you didn't already know is one third of the famed Atlanta hip hop trio migos who have each been fracturing off from the trio a bet to do their own solo or collaborative projects whether it be quavo and Travis Scott quavo solo offset and 21 savage on without warning easily the best extracurricular amigos project so far and now it seems to be takeoff stern let's take off shot take offs up to bat take off as a solo thing now so look I saw this coming we knew it was gonna happen eventually whoo they own those even offset may have a solo record in his pocket dropping super soon and if that is the case we will cross that bridge when we get there but as far as take off going solo honestly this is probably the the least interested I could possibly be in a solo amigos effort routinely in MeeGo songs I don't really find take-offs voice to be the most standout sure it's a little smoky I think he carries a tune a little bit better than some of his counterparts but still that is really not enough for me to get excited for hearing another me go solo effort especially with the painful mediocrity of Cuevas new album still suck in my head look ever since amigos dropped culture - it's been painfully obvious that the trio has been focusing more more and more more and more on trying to squeeze as much money out of their hype then trying to make an interesting album full of compelling songs that are legitimately catchy aka culture one easily one of the most infectious viral and to-the-point contributions to the current pop rap and trap meta it's almost as if they had no idea what made that album so good so instead of following with that formula again they just worked for 25 to 45 minutes at a time for a series of songs on the follow-up album culture - until they hit 90 minutes in length way too many tracks to even want to listen to all the way through and then just threw that out to get as many streams as possible and to rack up even more streams what do you do drop a bunch of solo projects as well so given that me ghost motivations are so painfully obvious in releasing so much music in a short amount of time I'm not really going into this new take off album thinking whoa he must have like some kind of significant artistic statement he feels like he can only make on the outside of the group no because that's that's not the case this is yet another just wash rinse and repeat album that sounds like much of what the migos have been doing up until this point just without the other two members I will give a few things to this album it is just about 30 minutes and change this is not overloaded like Cuevas record was this was not overloaded like culture 2 was so this album is of a respectable size and it seems like takeoff doesn't overdo it on the features it feels like he focuses a bit more on hooks even if some of those hooks are pretty bad and are just merely him repeating the words I remember I remember over and over and over there are a few tracks on here where it does seem that he focuses on a topic sometimes a personal one whether again it'd be I remember where he kind of goes back down memory lane through some personal paths that brought him to this point then there's also none to me which is actually a pretty sad moment on the album where take off can be heard singing about a moment in his life where someone close to him betrayed him in usual amigos fashion you do get some tight mid-paced flows and some kind of animated ad-libs here and there the instrumentals though are really nothing all that special it's just kind of your dime-a-dozen mainstream trap rattling hi-hat subterranean bass those super tight crisp snappy snares I mean it's all here the problem is though that takeoff does not really have an artistic identity outside of the migos camp so it's almost as if there is no point to this album I could at least give quavo some props on the fact that you know as much of a mess as honcho was that record did have some kind of odd instrumentals on it it did have some vocal guests that I guess you wouldn't expect typically on amigos record there were some spots that really seemed like they were coming out of left field and he was really trying to do something different however on the last rocket while this album is not so long that it's annoying it doesn't really feature any huge risks that goes south for takeoff what this album does become though is almost worse and that's redundant because there's really nothing on this album that you couldn't already get out of amigos record but again with less vocal diversity as you're just hearing one member of the trio and I think it's become pretty clear at this point that without another artist to play off of on a track no member of me goes is all that compelling you do get spots on here like Casper where he does seem to get a little bit more personal than the offset or quavo or may be willing to on a track but outside of that this album doesn't really offer much I mean sure you may enjoy it or maybe you might even love it if this is your favorite genre of music and this is all you want to listen to and you don't really care if there's any kind of variance or anything new or anything surprising or anything exciting you just want to hear the same triplet flows and trap instrumentals that you have been hearing throughout the mainstream for the past few years now if that's your prerogative that's completely fine I'm not gonna hate on it but for me there's really nothing for me to sell you on with this album other than that it's not totally awful sure takeoff does have like a really goofy line here they're like that one way he's talking about how he gets high like the man with the afro it's a really weird way to structure that line so yeah he does have some goofy bars every once in a while on this thing but as far as modern trap records go you can at least listen to it I guess if some of these tracks popped up in a mainstream hip-hop playlist on Spotify it's not like you start wincing or turning your head like what the hell is this no I mean that's really the thing with this record it'd blend in with everything else and doesn't do anything to stand out and given that takeoff as a part of one of the largest groups in this trend I guess there's really no incentive for him to change but from the standpoint of a music fan that wants to hear some exceptional rapping or songwriting or lyricism no matter what form that takes whether your song is smart or narrative or it's funny or its charismatic or it's cutthroat whatever you do in your music to make yourself stand out I'm here to give it a try but what takeoff is offering us here is formulaic pure and simple and that's it so even though when this album is on it's an okay listen I'm just so utterly bored by it what makes this a more interesting or refreshing record than culture or no label - not really anything I'm feeling a strong for - a late five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well or over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana take off forever 
sPloNY4dmnc,hi everyone smile everyday here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new collaborative project from the alchemist currency and Freddie Gibbs Fetty Roma this is a new mini collaborative album from all the people whose names I just said Indiana's own gangsta Gibbs and quite possibly the most stoned man in New Orleans currency rapping over a fresh batch of alchemist beats now despite having featured on a few tracks with currency already at this point even one that has production from The Alchemist on it on the covert coup ep this is not a klabo this is not a crossover that I really saw coming and for a few different reasons the respective styles of each artist here the relevancy the versatility what I see is I guess a relative talent gap no question currency is known for having a pretty cold-blooded flow it's a little monotone he's got some pretty slick rhymes too but consistently over the years I have found a lot of his projects even some of his best ones pilot talk pilot talked to to be a little lacking it's been almost 10 years of one project after another from currency and current day he pretty much sounds the same way he did in 2010 not hearing a whole lot of vocal change or noticeable improvements and since ends meanwhile with Freddie Gibbs if you compare earlier projects like Midwest gangsta box frame Cadillac music to one of his more recent projects it's almost night and day back in the 2000s Freddie Gibbs very much sounded like a product of The Bling era with a huge Tupac influence now of course for anybody who's been listening to Freddie Gibbs for a long time his influences and his roots are still very much there present day but it sounds like over the years he's matured and changed quite a bit if we're talking artistic evolution there's really no contest here on top of it he's far more versatile and animated also how many rappers had a pinata in them not many with no doubt in my mind I am sure that spit ax and Gibbs could rap on a bunch of tracks together but my question is would this album come together into anything other than a nondescript Rhymefest especially since it's it's been noted that this project was recorded over the course of like two days however Freddie and currency's respective talents do actually create some special moments on Fetty the best thing I can say about this record is that each party involved they all complement each other really well Freddie and currency both consistently match each other throughout this project with their ruthless and hardened attitudes meanwhile the alchemists instrumentals on this thing range from being eerie and surreal a little nightmarish to super warm and soulful with a bit of a vintage twist the opening track location remote features peace disembodied male vocal singing calling out in this pretty haunting way really singing out into the abyss then there's this trippy bass line that just rings out it's like something out of the start of a synth prog Odyssey currency kicks the song off sounding a little more ruthless than usual Eastside laboratory coats testing the dope I'm in a location remote ivory coast trying to get as high as I can go the glass ceiling broke kind of shifting narrative from just being this typical everyday stoner to actually being like a drug kingpin which lyrically and topically is a bit more Freddie's Lane but if it adds to the cohesion of the album I'm for it because on some tracks here currency does come off a bit darker that more criminal than he usually does Freddie's verse that comes after this is absolutely brutal I love this spot where he says we're taping Mama's up we're filling them Lamas up making statements is a mana for Papadopoulos that's a pretty great rhyme there Trump sweating bullets on diet coke sniffing powder up and if he build the wall we're gonna bring that dope underground with us this track and many others on here they are merciless they are sharp they are witty there are no poppy bells and whistles surrounding these tracks either there's a bit of an instrumental intro maybe with a vocal snippet or something there's a verse an instrumental break the next verse and then there's like an outro it's just bars on bar as far as the highlights on this thing continue with the cocaine inspired the blow Freddie drops quite a few standout lines on this one most notably about to take a trip got coke and dope on my grocery list oxy Conan pack I'd be switching rackets like Jo like Djokovic which is easily one of the best tennis references in hip-hop song in 2018 currency shines on the track new things where he says bars like pulled up into what's this came back and what's that I'm in a suite in a Westin in a notebook sketching new designs for the season Fashion Week we gonna sneak him also Freddie Gibbs mirrors that bar with his own reference to the The Westin in his verse so it is nice to hear that him and currency on a lot of these tracks pretty much on all these tracks there on the same page meanwhile the tracks Saturday night's special sounds trippy surreal and again nightmarish I'll use that word again and you know I'm sorry to Freddie I'm sorry to currency on this track but it's really the alchemists production that truly steals the show on this cut the droney ethereal and hypnotic instrumental on this thing is gorgeous so given the brevity of this project and I guess it's creative process of course there was going to be a point at which if faltered there's the song now and later Gators which is the first solo cut on the album Freddie Gibbs just kind of embarks on a lone mission here to sing very badly over some vintage R&B bass glamorous pianos and vocal samples it sounds like something that would have been like a leftover joke from his last freddie project but instead he's just sort of thrown it on here if he was gonna have a solo track on this thing I would have much preferred Willie Lloyd even though that track doesn't really have all that much structure to it the eerie guitar arpeggios and the relentless flows on this song are actually pretty exciting there are a few moments on the track where Freddie drops some of his best bars here and on top of it his voice just sounds like it is about to crack very rarely does Freddie sound like he's kind of on the edge of just like vocally losing it and this is one of the rare moments where that's the case meanwhile currency goes solo on the song no window tints and it is easily the most lackluster and forgettable song on the entire it's not even two minutes long his verse is spotty at best and it really just sounds like a bad interlude or left over after this very spotty set of solo outings the album kind of regains its footing in what little time it has left I mean both tracks feature good flows some standout lyrics here and there good instrumentals especially to patio but neither of these tracks really ascend past the very casual and raw vibe that some of the best songs so far have delivered though there is a pretty loving Mac Miller shout out on the closing track here that's pretty nice if gritty druggie raps with great flows and classy instrumentals with lots of samples interest you then give it a shot personally that's very much my thing but I still kind of attribute the success of this project in part to how short it is I think currency and Freddie don't really give themselves an opportunity to overstay their welcome or put themselves in a position where they have to change it up or do anything different or challenge themselves as a collaborative to really go above and beyond because again this thing was recorded in a couple days and in a way it sort of sounds like it and it's only a tribute to how solid Freddie and currency are as rappers and lyricists that this thing is as good as it is despite its short recording time because all and all this thing is pretty good it's an interesting crossover and I would say to a degree Freddie and currency do bring a little bit of the best out of each other though I would still hope that both artists still show more potential going forward I'm feeling a strong six to a late seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which would I review next hit the like

lqax_kwYL3A,hi everyone Papa Denis Eady to hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new papi record mi a girl this is the latest full-length record from multimedia project papi what is papi papi is a lot of things papi is a YouTube channel an internet personality a singer and a songwriter a way of life cal of pappy cal of papi cal of pappy cal of pappy most people who are aware of papi know her from the hundreds of viral and iconic videos that she's made with director and producer titanic sinclair and now with a few hundred million video views under her belt her and titanic have been focusing on the music side of the poppy brand signing to Mad Decent records last year's Poppy computer was a huge step toward poppy defining herself as a serious force in music more than just some kind of weird hokey YouTube novelty the record might have been a little all over the place stylistically and quality-wise there were also moments on this thing where it seemed like poppy was drowning in her influences a bit though there were multiple songs that I loved on this album that seemed to build up the lore and the story around the poppy character let's make a video and computer boy and software upgrade songs that featured heavy references to celebrity culture and the internet cybernetics and simulations which added a lot of character to the album and just made the world of poppy seems so much more vivid thankfully and I a girl is a noticeable improvement on Poppy's last record and it doesn't necessarily achieve that by building up the mythos of poppy instead it just surpasses poppy computer by simply being a better synth pop record snappier songs punch your production weirder lyrics and a wider array of influences the opening song to my ears feels almost like something m.i.a would have rocked over back in the 2000s but maybe a bit sleeker and a bit cleaner I like these sassy and girlish lyrics all over the track the smooth sent bassline all the shimmery glitchy synth notes that take up the mixes extra space then poppy immediately drops a few synth pop cuts that to my ears feel a little run-of-the-mill for the genre iconic and fashioned after all even if there are some lyrical bits of these tracks do you think add to the poppy character and I guess in a weird way I do kind of like how fashion after all sounds like it's been pulled right out of the Chromeo playbook however later on the record there are a few spots where Poppy's lyrics gets so brash and weird and unapologetic that I can't help but have a strange magnetism to them like on the track chic chick whose song title is a total eyesore and I admit that I thought this track was completely ridiculous on first listen but after a while the proclamations of I'm my own bodyguard bow to your matriarch I found to be both hilarious and endearing I'm a sheik chicken you don't like it suck that am i a girl it's a hilariously braggadocious song that's part self empowerment but also part power trip also poppies vocals on this track and many others hit a weird spot for me where they feel a little awkward but it's like that's kind of meant to be in the programming as if she's supposed to be this super sexy fembot or piece of computer code I don't know the song girls in bikinis oddly enough reminded me of something Gwen Stefani might have dropped immediately after splitting off from no doubt the flirty absurdity of the lyrics and the vocal melody sounding something that would have killed it on radio in the late 90s or early 2000s also the boys in bikinis to twist and lyrics in the last leg of the song was pretty cute but overall the tune and the beat of the track it's just pretty basic and fun and bubbly nothing too weighty it's nice while it's on but it's it's not really anything that I'm dying to go back to really this album gets better when Poppy's lyrics get a bit more substantive or the instrumentals go completely insane into a direction I would have never anticipated the song time is up featuring Diplo does have one of the hardest beats on the entire record but really what makes it stand out is that it's essentially an environmental banger a tribute to mankind destroying itself through destroying the planet with poppy singing about dead bees and dried-up rivers on the hook through the lyrics we also get the sense that poppy is kind of waking up in the midst of this dystopian future she's been programmed or wiped and she's confused she doesn't know where she is or why she's here why things are the way they are then as we get deeper into the track it's like she's writing for the perspective of a heartless robot who at this point sees no better future for mankind other than for it to just die off the song aristocrat instrumentally reminds me of that Ace of Base song but she wants the story of the song seems to be about this poor kid finding herself in the midst of this upper crust party she's the hottest thing there by her sheer personality and beauty and she's kind of undercutting the other rich girls there the whole thing reads as a metaphor for Poppy's infiltration into the inner circles of Fame through her weird YouTube personality so I enjoy the narrative of the track quite a bit as well as the cute ukulele transitions into the verse and that it explodes into a synth pop passage meanwhile the song hard feelings cease poppy reflecting on her own creation why was she made did this person who made her create her in the image of someone that they once loved given the references to committing crimes and being a copy of a copy in the lyrics one might wonder whether or not this song is in reference to the Mars agro allegations against poppy and titanic's and Claire that have dogged the do of this year I guess it's also worth noting that this track synth-pop passages meld really well with these soaring and heavy alternative rock guitars on the hook and this is not the only point on this album where aggressive rock guitars seem to take over the instrumental side the title track is a gender bent banger about male/female stereotypes and assumptions with poppy tossing categorizations and suppositions out the window with some metal sized guitars that hit pretty hard on the hook meanwhile one of my favorite tracks on this thing played destroy featuring Grimes it sounds like an evanescent song yeah this track literally has tons of chugging new metal guitars poppy and Grimes transition these heavier spots into these really beautiful glistening synth pop moments that sound like something off of like Grimes visions there are like some weird demonic screams held within some of the guitar passages too I also love how tongue-in-cheek and edgy some bits of this song are like the the moment where I believe it's Grimes who says it's time to die I couldn't help it it's it's so incredibly catchy but also hilarious and self-aware and creative the tract X is even heavier it actually kicks off with Poppy booing against the heavy metal guitars at the start and going heavy it sounds like something out of a babymetal track but like even more badass and with a hint of irony to it too and once again poppy transitions out of these incredibly pummeling guitars into some wonderful heavenly sunshine pop before circling back around into these guitars with a sinister refrain of the song eventually it's this like pop punk bit at the very end and it's a genius way to finish the song and the album especially with poppy saying at the end of the record take me to the place where we began allowing you to kind of loop the album back around right at the start overall I thought am I a girl is a pretty great pop album it feels like poppy is getting even better at building some of her own personality into her songs the story again lore there are way more creative instrumental left hooks on this new LP too though still I have to say the whole feminine robot trope on this record and in the poppy universe in general is not that refreshing of a concept and in a way I'm still kind of waiting for the moment where Poppy's music and her videos coalesce in such a way where they almost feel one in the same to the point where when I hear a poppy song it gives me the same kind of intimate chill that I get out of one of her videos though I'm not really sure if that's ever going to happen because it would seem antithetical to Poppy's pop leaning intentions in her music if you're looking for a pop record with some zany and off-the-wall lyrics some interesting topical tracks here and there as well as some exciting and strange instrumental twists and turns toward the finish you give this thing a shot I'm feeling a light 2ds and seven on this transition have

E93gYPKfC8U,hi everyone both the boat and oh here vote vote vote vote and it's time for a review of the new Rosalia album el mal cutter this is the newest full-length album from Spanish flamenco singer Rosalia who blew my mind totally out of nowhere last year with a gorgeous and dynamic set of folk songs on her album Los Angeles and in the short span of time since the release of that record Rosalia has undergone a pretty large and significant artistic evolution because she's gone straight from recording these Spanish and gypsy folk tunes to turning the world of flamenco into a pop sensation both being decades old flamenco pop and flamenco nuevo are nothing entirely new but Rosalia's incredible talent is certainly making it feel like they are as she stirred international interest in this music in a way that few artists have with some pretty great singles leading up to the release of this album namely tracks like mal amante as well as pienso and Tamara both songs mix Rosalee is incredible old-world voice and flamenco handclaps with sensual pop production synthetic beats and bass really strong hooks the third single on this thing demon hombre actually features a shot of auto-tune on the refrain just to add a bit of a vocal variant I guess and it actually fits in really well with the songs building synths and background vocals and persistent handclaps rarely do these new and old worlds of music come together in a song so well at least not without dumbing the production down to the point where it's obvious that you're trying to make it appeal to like the widest audience possible the the same audience of people that would immediately buy a Taylor Swift record I think we can attribute Rosalia's musical transition on this album at least in part to her bringing on fellow Spanish musician and producer el gancho who has dropped several solo albums over the past decade or so dabbling mostly in neo psychedelia psychedelic folk psychedelic pop and even though that's obviously not Rosalia's wheelhouse that's not the kind of music she even seems remotely interested in making on this album he plays a very positive forward-thinking and an incredibly supportive role on this record a lot of the instrumentals on this thing feels if they're assembled like any other piece of modern pop or even hip-hop and there are maybe a few spots on this record where that does feel a bit limited like on the track que no saga la Luna where Rosalee is wild vibrato and just bound realists voice her incredible singing on this song it's just so expressive and it's just so like free and just ah it just makes me burn like this is so far from a typical pop vocal and just sort of throwing it on top of a quantized track doesn't really make all that much sense to me I would have much rather some more organic instrumentation or just a straight guitar like on her last record because in my opinion the subterranean kicks and the nylon guitar loops and samples that are played throughout this track even when a low-pass filter is thrown on top of them doesn't really cut it even if there are some elements of this track namely the background vocals that I think are a really nice touch meanwhile there are moments on this record where the additional instrumentation the more modern production style feels inventive and even freeing allowing Rosalia to embark on some new sounds ideas and flavors there are even moments on this thing where there's a Justin Timberlake sample worked in an Arthur Russell sample worked in or on the track day aqui no Solis I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly where the track kicks off with all of these siren sounds revving engine samples cars just driving or starting it's like Rosalia's the Charli XCX of forward-thinking flamenco pop eventually the track progresses into this straightforward be in these chopped and pitched up vocal samples kind of playing out this fractured melody against some subterranean bass on the next song Rosalia throws it back a little bit where she is singing this beautiful traditional flamenco melody over this gorgeous thick full-bodied string section the way she plays against this classical style arrangement is powerful not only is it a great song a great moment on this album but it also serves as a reminder that there very few artists out there in the pop field currently that could match Rosalia's range volume power sense of drama and when you're talking about songs and vocals of this quality the language barrier that most people watching this video are obviously going to hit when they give this thing a listen because I don't speak Spanish many of you don't either yeah that language barrier it's it's pretty much irrelevant because the production on this thing it's beautiful the vocals are beautiful meanwhile on the song Baghdad we have a very refreshing and intriguing mix of several things sure those elements of folk and flamenco music do pop up but also there are some vocal licks at the start of the track that read like something out of an alternative R&B tune meanwhile there's a vocal buildup in the last leg that comes off like a church hymnal the song is truly worthy of having the song liturgy liturgy at the back end of its title if you notice every song on this record does have a bit of a title in parentheses after it sort of mentioning what exactly the emotion or the vibe or the direction a certain song is going in or sort of what part of I guess an emotional ongoing story that a track might play in the whole of this album which I thought was kind of an interesting way of parsing all of these songs out even if overall stylistically it does seem like a bit of a jumble a bit of a mixed bag however I do appreciate the versatility and that much of what her and ginko embark on on this record is done really well the song nana is a very stripped down vocal peace with these subtle pitched background vocals and chorus effects sort of placed into the background which creates this very beautiful but surreal and alien ish sound it's kind of James Blake esque the song is pretty moving in its intimacy and its relative nudity Rosalia kind of goes for a similar effect and sound on the closing track of this thing as well but the pitched background vocals there that sing along sing in unison with her lead vocal are much louder stranger more overbearing it does have a uniquely haunting and nightmarish quality but I'm not really that crazy about it as a song or even as the closer so while I do have some complaints and critiques of this record and I think overall the consistency and flow could have used a bit more work it is a little scant at 11 tracks and just 30 minutes still the vast majority of songs on this thing are great they're fantastic they're gorgeous and Rosalia has made a very fast and impressive transition into taking these folk sounds and styles and just making them work really well in a pop context I guess if you're in the market for some fantastic vocals for an album that is just very bold versatile Spanish pop with some strong folk roots give this thing a shot what do you got to lose it's a great record I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I

already planning on buying the record you love the record it's one of your favorite records of the year BAM helps the show helps the band gets a record in your hands that you want easy as that alright let's get into the tracks I thought were the worst this week that was relatively painless oh come on come out of worse tracks come on oh ok Jesus Christ this new Nicki Minaj single with with Tyga yeah it's it's a it's absolutely gross most mostly because Tyga Tyga kind of makes the song grosser than it needs to be his lyrics and just his demeanor his whole vibe on this track are just just just a little slimy and I don't know what it is Nicki Minaj I just feel like she's in a a weird state of limbo right now like she's not coming out with her best stuff she is beefing with people she doesn't need to beef with she is collaborating with people she doesn't need to collaborate with and yet she's just doing it all and it seems like she's just trying to I don't know just just make her brand look as ridiculous as possible as quick as she possibly can so unfortunate nav no me nav sounds as sleepy and as boring as ever if you've ever heard nav on a feature or have not heard nav on a feature because his voice was mixed solo or sounded so boring that you didn't even notice it you pretty much already know what you're getting out of this track have no idea how this track is so hot right now because his voice sounds this flat and his deadpan his lyrics are as uninspired as they ever have been nav easily the the sleepiest rapper in the game moving on from there imagine dragons machine they have a new track out you know granted this is one of their more rock-and-roll ish songs that they have dropped in a while you know some some like kind of real somewhat edgy rock instrumentation actually turning up in this song but it says flavorless and is overblown as usual for imagine dragons don't expect anything surprising don't expect anything refreshing it's imagine dragons oh yeah going backwards now we want to go forwards next this new collaborative track from Action Bronson featuring ASAP rocky yeah I'm not feeling this as a single honestly it's it's really washed out it's kind of flavorless the instrumental is a total mess and I'm just not really seeing the appeal of this at all like doesn't really have a strong chorus a few bars from Bronson here there that are kind of memorable but I can't help but feel like we used to guys in a very short period of time unfortunately are just really past their prime if we were talking about like 2011 2012 2013 rocky or Action Bronson I'd be like hell yes hell yes but right now in 2018 they're sounding surprisingly stale over the again there's a very lifeless instrum mental and let's move on to the tracks I thought were kind of meh not blowing me away but not terrible either certainly worth your time if you're into this sort of thing first off Tim Heidecker has a new political satirical track out Ballad of the insel man like usual with a lot of Tim's recent work the lyrics and the topic and the story are again satirical they're on point it's smart it's pretty funny it's observational and very socially charged but again the instrumental presentation is just kind of whatever it's a little plain it's a little DIY it's a little flavorless but you know if you're really just there for the song the story the point the political message of the track you'll most likely enjoy it quite a bit moving on from there there is a brand new track from Thundercat featuring Flying Lotus and bad bad not good out which is set to be released on a forthcoming compilation of music for brain feeder records because they have a big anniversary coming up and they're putting out all of these songs on this comp from all the flagship artists to just celebrate all the people they work with over the years and it's it's not a bad cut certainly not one of the best tracks Thundercat has come up with and not the boldest contributions I've ever heard from fly low or or bad bad not good but it's it's how often do you see these three brains sort of coming together on one single track you you don't you don't that often so make sure to give it a shot moving on from there Pedro the Lion is back Pedro the Lion of all bands it's been a long time since we've heard from Pedro the lion and this new song over there's over here which is a title the yellow bike is not a bad track some pretty bold guitars on this cut lead vocals sound pretty fantastic - I've never been a huge Pedro lion guy but I will say I did think that this track for a return song because this is gonna be a bit of a comeback album again it's been a while since we've got a full length record from a pager of the Lion for a comeback song it's it's pretty bold you know definitely putting their best foot forward on this one I thought even though it is just kind of standard in the Iraq affair in a lot of ways moving on from there Flatbush zombies new world order a creepy eerie little trap banger with some good flow chemistry between the respective members of the group good energy it's kind of dark not the freshest production I've heard on a fbz track but it's so pretty good and also shout out to deer hunter who have a brand new single and a brand new record on the way certainly not as trippy and as sound rich as some of my favorite records in their discography but if you're looking for a straightforward indie ballad with some nice pillowy production on it give this thing a shot because it's a pretty sweet tune I still think to this day Halcyon might stand as my favorite deer hunter record do love the production on that thing quite a bit if you have not heard that record please do give a listen to that album it's fantastic unfortunately the again the sound of this new tracker here isn't isn't quite as adventurous or as surreal but um so Bradford Cox is a songwriter pretty talented dude and certainly comes through on this new track over here and Carly Rae Jepsen party for one brand-new song from her copy production the the instrumental was a little run-of-the-mill on this one sounded very kind of dime-a-dozen mainstream pop not really anything special as far as the instrumental goes but still I thought the hook was really sticky yeah it does have a great hook it does have a really good hook and once more Carly Rae Jepsen does bring a song does bring a song topic that deals essentially in just kind of being by yourself unrequited love party party for one just for one because that significant other they're not there and also shadow to our a grande who has dropped a kind of interesting track not really huge on it melodically or instrumentally but this is a very personal song for her because she's pretty much diving into just her relationship with Mac Miller and saying that she's thankful for her ex and just basically everything that that relationship had meant to her and the impact that it left on her so for a lot of fans and listeners who have been kind of wondering what exactly her whole side to all this is given Mac Miller's recent passing she puts it into song pretty well and I don't know I feel like she kind of closes a loose end or ties up a loose end so to say in a way on this new track because I think she kind of answers some of those questions and the lyrics and the and in how emotional her delivery is on this track so I guess if you're an ariana grande fan just generally a pop fan or if you've been Mac Miller fan who's even in a cursory way curious about sort of what her thoughts and sort of experiences have been sort of being one of the few people out there who was connected to him and the way that she was give this track a shot and let's move on to the tracks that really grabbed my attention this week left a pretty heavy and positive impact on me first off this new non-album track from young fathers it's titled Coco sugar so yes it's a non-album song and yet it is titled after the album that they just dropped so maybe it was going to be a title track but they ended up cutting it but this is your song over here it definitely would have been one of the more upbeat cuts on the new record I love the way the vocals come together on this one look how grimy the instrumental is kind of reminds me of some of the more lo-fi and brash cuts earlier in their discography maybe they felt like that wouldn't have meshed with the rest of the album but I still thought it was a pretty nice standout track and certainly serves as a reminder that the trio did put out a pretty decent record shiron did get quite a bit of attention they had that nice Apple music advertisement that their music was placed in and it seems like they've gotten quite a bit of positive press and some some longtime listeners out of that cross-promotion so that's good news that's great you know it's it's good to see these guys doing well because they are one of the most unique music groups to come out of Scotland moving on from there Silvan look you who whose last album I wasn't all that huge on because you just sounded super young who sounded like he was wearing his influences on his sleeve didn't really have a strong sense of direction or anything has this new song and video out titled 333 dropped a little while ago but still his flows on this track are fantastic instrumentals great love some of the cheeky references to his contemporaries in the rap game and just music in general seems like he's really kind of starting to come into his own on this track over here and and again if you give if you give this track a listen it is some very smart underground hip-hop with some great flows pay attention to the flows the flows are fancy they're super nimble and certainly putting me in a position where I'm like whoa I really want to pay attention to this dude now I was a little interested before given who it was clear he was listening to but now it seems like he's really starting to take shape a little bit moving out from their new Slipknot track surprisingly I enjoyed quite a bit all out life is the title of this new song over here yeah you can look at this Slipknot song in a lot of ways say you know Anthony this is kind of your standard Slipknot affair and in some ways it is I mean the drums and the guitars and the riffs sound very much similar to that of many huge Slipknot singles and and maybe even a little bit more stripped back as the usual percussive bells and whistles that you get on a Slipknot song are not as dense or here in in full as as they tend to be on other Slipknot tracks and there is like a weird vocal spoken-word passage that's like cringy as hell and it's supposed to be I think it's supposed to be a motivation or something it's it's basically the the songs replacement for a bridge and yeah I think it's like it's a moment on the track that really falls flat on its face but that being said the guitar work on this track is fantastic the structure is great it's so immediate it's so catchy it's so goddamn hard and Corey Taylor's vocals on this track kick ass as well so I don't know for me I like the track a lot I think it all kind of balances out and it's easily one of their best lead songs that I've heard in a while I didn't really care for much of anything off the band's last album to be completely honest and hopefully this new record is a bit of a return to form as far as like going back to a grimy or harder sound because this kind of felt like the band really kind of lighting a fire under their ass again in a way but not from their Rosalia she has a new track outdo me nombre which I gave you a full length review of the second channel on the Fantana channel I'm not going to get too deep into my love of this track right now because her new record did just drop this week and I am going to do a review for it so I highly recommend a track don't miss it it's a great little blend of modern pop music and flamenco and her vocals on the cut are great and you will hear me gush more about this album very soon moving on from there poppy and Grimes have a new collaborative track out a song that they have been teasing for a while for a little bit now even hearing the poppy and Grimes are gonna be dropping new music that they're working together so on and so forth and I guess this is do so over here titled play destroy is the culmination of their efforts together and it is a weird fusion of both of their respective and strange approaches to pop music and then on top of that all of these like overbearing heavy nu metal riffs it's insane that all of these sounds and ideas are kind of coming together onto this one song and I guess maybe I'm mostly into it for the novelty of it and just how nuts so it is to hear all of these sounds and influences on this one track and and also to simultaneously see poppy and Grimes existing and coexisting in the same universe but still that being said even even though I am a little bit into it mostly for the novelty I do find it very enjoyable moving on from there LSD labyrinth SIA and Diplo who had been dropping song after song single after single after single for a while now have yet another this new one is titled mountains and honestly even though I think labyrinth SIA and Diplo have hit kind of a formula at this point and this song features those typical whoa was and the gargantuan drums and percussion x' that you typically expect out of a Diplo song I actually think this track is one of the best pieces of Mullen of millennial pop that I've heard in a while like the tune is really friggin good I love labyrinths vocals I love the transition into the piano and CEA's voice it's actually kind of beautiful it's beautiful it's gorgeous you know again those those usual millennial pop cliches do do leak into it but I think they're executed tastefully or at least they sound pretty good so I don't know I mean look here's the thing I think more often than not the singles that LSD drops are pretty good some of them have been a little horrendous but this is a very unlikely trio here and I think it's pretty awesome that they're just like keeping at it LCD soundsystem have a new record on the way The Electric Lady sessions which I'm pretty excited about because I I do like some of the studio session work and you know kind of kind of the live session feel and vibe that comes through on some of their records that go down that path I feel like if their last full length record was missing anything it was kind of that raw post punky vibe that some of their best albums have and this new one is gonna be coming out soon and the single that has been released from it is actually a cover of the group head in 17 and the song is we don't need this fascist groove thing and their rendition of it is actually pretty fun again pretty raw love the of the in-the-moment performance and everything can't really complain and obviously the song topic is pretty timely as well I do you know cover but still the the song they chose to cover obviously has its reasoning behind it and envy Japanese post-rock and screamo outfit envy one of the best to ever do it in this particular genre are back with a new single al Nair in August it's a pretty powerful wonderful just like throw shredding lead vocals and some grand heavy crescendos awesome structures and progressions throughout these tracks - they're pretty epic they're pretty emotional they're pretty powerful if you are an emo or a screamo fan and you have not been listening to envy Jesus Christ not only do you have a lot to catch up on but you know this song I this song this new sort of single that the band is just rapped I actually think is a maybe not a bad place to start and then once you do that go back and listen to their first several records because they're great so shout out to envy and also shout out to Clarence clarity who has dropped to like post think peace non-album tracks just a little while ago this week he has seen fit to release these songs they are titled anthropic principles in telenovela I'm not as crazy about the latter as I am the former but both of them just sound like really weird cutting-edge freako freakazoid pop with some zany production which could have easily fit on to his last record no now and also shout-out to Andrew bird Bloodless new record on the way and one of my favorite singles that he has dropped in a while it's actually pretty powerful and tasteful ballad and it's nice to hear Andrew bird coming back and in dropping a song with some real conviction behind it because for a while I feel like he's kind of been lost in the woods with a lot of the very flowery instrumentation that he surrounds his tracks with and while it is very pretty to the ear the song themselves just sound a little dime-a-dozen and just kind of met to me as far as the songwriting you know perspective goes this new track over here was one of his best in a while so screw me man excited to see another Andrew bird record apparently so I'm gonna leave it at that nice baroque indie pop ballad with a bit of a social edge to it don't miss it and that is it that is it for our weekly track roundup everybody make sure again to hit up that turntable ad link if you want to grab that iridescent pre-order and also again shout out to C geek if you want to conveniently grab some tickets to some shows that you want to see from around the web all right again all the songs that talked about in this video linked down

Ccq9Eu8bojY,
iWiKSNULvPc,[Applause] hi everyone fancy instrumental here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Giulia halter album aviary this is the latest full-length LP from singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist composer Julia halter and while julia has not yet amassed a mainstream following this decade she has proven herself to be one of the more creative and consistent voices out there delivering one album after the next of dreamy elegant progressive art pop laced with dense Baroque instrumentation some of her past work has dabbled more in ambient and experimental music like 2011's tragedy going even further back then that album reveals even more abstract projects then we had the following ecstasy sin 2012 which was a kind of faint exercise and dream pop pretty straightforward for the genre a little underwhelming though I do admire the album's aesthetic consistency 2013's loud city song is really where holter first wowed me this record featured smoother rounder production some very smart nods to jazz music through the compositions the horns the upper a bass halter wasn't exactly shy about showing off some of her classical influences on this record - also her gentle gorgeous and intimate vocals on this record are ear gasma kits like art pop ASMR halters next full-length album in my opinion would be her most clearly defined and impressive I'm not sure if there's a dream pop or an art pop album of this decade that I would put above this the fancy opulent instrumentation on this thing that transcendent atmosphere julia halters voice as wonderful as ever this record is luxurious this record is intoxicating listening to it transports me to a magical cloud land where the Sun is beaming all the time and everything that is of this earth just doesn't matter anymore except for the track how long that track is the devil in disguise so given Julia's recent artistic winning streak of course I was excited to listen aviary especially since this record looked like it was going to be her biggest and most ambitious undertaking yet at 15 tracks and 90 minutes of material and certainly this album does sound larger than any album she's put together so far right from the start as the track turned the light on presents this cloud of monolithic instrumentation all creating this busy cacophony just to show the listener I guess how panoramic these tracks are gonna be I love the sea of heavenly vocals on this track the tumbling pianos the scattered drums strings that are either spinning and flapping through the air like lost birds or just kind of focusing on a single note or a drone like a burning laser the track not only presents a grand sound but also holders classical influences playing a larger part in her songwriting my main issue though is that compositionally I feel like this cut leaves a lot to be desired mostly because halter and company conjure this gigantic sound and then it just sort of evaporates out of nowhere into nothing and it's over without any real sense of satisfying progression or resolution and I only bring up this issue so early in the review because in a way it is a bit of a pattern with multiple tracks here with holter leaving some of these songs off with compositional dead-ends and cliff hangers or stringing tracks out to five or six minutes with a hodgepodge of sections and ideas that don't really segue all that well like on the track sheet you switch I'm not even going to pretend I'm pronouncing correctly but still phase one of this track is a beautiful classical piece with beautiful layers of strings and Reed's dancing together politely while also hitting some pretty tense harmonies here and there in Phase two the instrumental shifts into these totally absurd piano phrasings and wild upright bass leads Poulter's voice placed very high in the mix getting right there into the microphone echo drenched voice and just saying joy joy joy joy joy joy I felt like I was listening to a combination of like a not-so-good vaporwave song and Laurie Anderson's spoken word piece meanwhile phase three of this track feels aesthetically like the heavenly art pop that halter is known for but the instrumentation is totally deconstructed though it's not one of the most cohesive spots on the album the scattered bed of horns and harps and percussion and halters howling lead vocals are pretty beautiful and that's the thing even when there isn't a whole lot of clarity to the compositions on this record aesthetically it's still super enchanting and there was something kind of wonderful and mysterious about how impenetrable some of the cuts on this record are again there were moments on this album that reminded me of Laurie Anderson but without the the heaping helping of futurism and instead we're given an instrumental palette that reminds me more of like fairies and magical beings that live in a forest personally I don't really mind a long sprawling album but the length does become a primary issue when I'm waiting for your track to gain some kind of momentum or sense of direction or cohesion but that seems to be far from halters true intent on this record much of the time aviary does not present the clean and primped songs of her earlier works the most abstract spots on this album make the most experimental moments on loud city or tragedy seem straightforward because a lot of the material on this thing depends on these winding impressionistic instrumental performances all coming together into a puzzling sound piece that does have some structure to it but still it's it's very envelope and immersive and sometimes patience testing but I would say for the most part very gratifying like on the track voce Samuel which is this mind-bending vocal piece there is this amazing heavy powerful overwhelming chant in the second half of the song with all these vocals layering on top of each other it's nightmarish but it also makes me feel like I'm I'm weightless I'm floating through the air through a mystical forest it's also moonlit fireflies everywhere so this album can be pretty evocative when it wants to be and it can be pretty surprising too as this album is loaded with instrumental and stylistic directions that I would have never anticipated from holter like the crying screaming relentless read notes on the first half of the song every day is an emergency the song really does live up to its title as the first leg of it really does feel tense eventually these reads give way to a forlorn vocal and piano passage that delivers some very dark lyrics and instrumentally grows more in more atmospheric and ominous and sour as if it were a harrowing instrumental passage from a god speed record the song underneath the moon son breaks into this weird funky Jam it's like if somebody asked a classical ensemble to recreate like a dance passage from Talking Heads speaking in tongues meanwhile the track led you to you features these jaunty piano and drum parts they're upbeat to the point where they sound ridiculous they happen right at the midpoint of the song and they sound vaguely post-punk II holter singing at this point in the song sounds totally batty and pairs really well with the kind of eccentric sound the song another dream sees holter singing against a whole sea of different synthesizers some are chai me some are glitchy some are smooth and Rhoni the chords and the shape of the sound bed are ever shifting and the track eventually ends up it like this really heavy apocalyptic finish again it's a moment that compositionally I'm not that enthralled with I wish maybe was paired down a bit or got to the point a bit faster but again it does sound super intriguing really the first sign of a truly straightforward song on this entire record maybe comes around the midpoint the track I shall love to which feels like a fantastically lavish reinvention of a track that could have been on like the first two Nico albums toward the end of this record we actually see a bit of a reprise of this song with massive vocal layers and drums it's another moment on the album that gets kind of transcendent with all these layers of voices on top of each other it's it's almost like a religious experience and I do actually think the songwriting on this record does happen to gain a bit more focus after I shall love to at least enough for halters consistently abstract ideas to come off a bit more cohesive and engaging for example the track ecology at a while this song does have a really weird kind of boundary-less like quality to it it is one of the larger tracks in terms of some of the build up some the crescendos the payoff it does have some grand amazing moments on and I would love continually for this track to be just washing over me much more than some of the more meandering cuts on this thing look guys this record is huge this record is a lot it's a lot to take in it's a lot to process and it's a lot just in terms of its size and its scope it's a jug or not it may not appeal to you immediately especially if you're looking to grab hold of and completely understand everything that you're listening to right away if that's what you're demanding of this record it's it's gonna be a frustrating listen but again what I can say is even in its most perplexing moments this record is gorgeous this is a record that you can really swim in I will say though I do think the album is a tad bloated and there are some tracks on this thing that I don't necessarily think benefit from the average track length of six minutes like the closing track like in gardens mutinous one more thing I didn't address all that much in this review are halters beautiful and poetic lyrics all over this thing and the multiple languages she delivers them into the English on this album the French the Latin all of which add to the mystery and the versatility of this record I did love this album I do think this is a special album it took a lot out of me but I did love this record if you just have the time and the desire to just totally dive into and sink into the depths of pure beauty that is not working on anyone's schedule then I highly recommend that you give this thing a listen it may not be as immediately thrilling exciting or emotionally impactful as some of halters recent works but it's without question one of the most special albums she has delivered to her fans so far I'm feeling a light to decent 8 on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did

DO5pcLp8-HM,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busy yes to be a second 'red and it's time for a review of the new daughters record you won't get what you want this is the new comeback album from Providence Rhode Island band daughters who we haven't heard from as far as studio albums go for like almost a decade not since the band's 2010 self-titled record which at the time was supposed to be their swan song which was a big change of pace from a lot of the noise and mathcore the band had been dabbling in for the first half of the aughts even though I don't find daughter's first two albums to be incredibly interesting what was supposed to be their final album over here was easily one of the heaviest and most refreshing noise rock albums to come out in a long time and not just because of the fad pummeling riffs and percussion and the tight performances to but also the bright shrill sour insane guitar tones all over this thing which to this day still sound crazy it's like it puts my brain on fire my brain is on fire I got fire brain so considering where we left off with daughters I was pretty excited to hear this new album I was also pretty impressed with teaser tracks like Satan and the wait which showed the band going in a darker subtler direction it also showed the band stringing their songwriting out to 7 minutes which for daughters is kind of crazy their debut full-length album is 11 minutes in length it's an album with numerous songs on it and it's 11 minutes this whole new record is an undertaking in length for daughters it's approximately 50 minutes which is almost twice as long as their last album given that the new sonic territory the more ambitious song structures I was pretty excited to hear what this album held for the band and I'm happy to say this album was not only worth the wait but it's also far better than its predecessor holy crap holy crap holy crap holy crap holy crap holy crap what is this I thought this record was going to be dark and abrasive and strange for sure without a doubt but I had black hole I will be tumbling down on us and torturing demented sounds they're subject to the violence plays auditory abuse this thing is like all the cacophony of the last record but with more body more atmosphere more versatility more influences not just noise rock but industrial rock and no wave and art punk it feels like I'm listening to the spastic explosive brand of rock music that used to permeate the underground in the 2000s thanks to bands like daughters but then it got tossed away into a sewer drain left to ferment and mutate for eight years and now it's grown into a 30-story monster come back to destroy everything in its path the whole thing starts off with the track city song which feels like a heavy industrialized take on a suicide track or maybe even something throbbing gristle would have done back in the day with these rollin throbbing overblown hits of percussion which are super distorted clipping that's paired with some warping rough synth notes some deadpan poetry and these three simple elements by themselves create such a creepy atmosphere already so early on the record the band has set an utterly disturbing tone I love how weird and off-putting and flat the vocals are it's like they're kind of difficult to read they feel so soulless and so aloof I love the way the band builds up the momentum with extra percussion the additional eerie ringing tones and then we get a breakdown of near silence before the band explodes back into this final ugly crescendo it's like this nuclear bomb of cathartic hideousness the guitar tones at this point in the tracker so freakish and deafening and maddening they make me want to slam my head through a wall it's like I'm being slowly smothered to death this track transitions very quickly after the long road no turns which is an absolutely harrowing song features these twanging nightmare funhouse circus organ type guitars skipping over these marching tom drums again just a few seconds in and it already sounds like one of the most messed up things I've heard in 2018 and the band only goes on to make this song sound even more deranged as it progresses especially with lyrics like everybody climbs a pie that falls real far a little is all takes a little is all it takes I don't know what to say when people come apart the road is long the road is dark the track to me just reads like this internal monologue of snapping becoming unhinged being on the verge of a mental break and the song really builds up some mean tension with the driving bass the crashing drums the guitar freak outs also loving the multiple phases of this song to the direct delivery it has me on the edge of my seat but I'm not sitting on it I'm standing on it and there's a noose on my neck the track Satan in the weight kicks off like one might expect it to given the two previous tracks with spaced out Tom drums and grime cake bass and these guitars that are just melting in the mix then we get lyrics like that bastard had a head like matchstick a face like you'd been sucking concrete through a straw some faces not even a mother can love says the spit and spatter of broken glass from above it's one of many moments on the album where we get the grim and fevered delivery of a Nick Cave but also the poetic license of a Tom Waits eventually this track kind of loses its edgy demeanor and actually blossoms into some legitimately beautiful guitar lines that have a nice sparkly Sheen to them at this point the track becomes super atmospheric almost like something out of The Twilight Zone and given the track's mantra of this world is opening up it feels like I'm slowly being sucked into something the song known as the flammable man is a blistering labyrinth of busy guitars and drums outside of a few momentary breathers on this cut it is absolutely relentless and even though you could say this is one of the more straightforward cuts of the bunch maybe not quite as experimental as the other songs on here the band does work in a really nice and interesting stuttering wall of noise in the last leg there's not a single song on here where daughters completely forgoes the sound play it's always consistent it's present it's on point we are left off again with another haunting mantra on this track is something burning here or is it me the Lord's song is a horrifying no wave rager with whipping twisted guitars it sounds like something out of a battle song but from hell meanwhile the Glacial walls of dissonance we get another point in the song sound like something out of the most sickening murder scene in movie history the song less sex is a much needed cooldown point on this album it's almost Trent Reznor ish with it's very deadpan intimate lead vocals it's synthetic drums its industrial atmosphere there's a little bass groove in there some sinister walls of noise various points of the cut also the forlorn vocal leads with the structure of the track - it almost reads like kind of a blues song maybe even something some zeal and ardour fans would appreciate not to mention some fetus or maybe a little this heat either way they're really sharp ringing guitar tones that plays throughout many points of this album on this particular track they actually gain a very beautiful dark sense of harmony not nearly as off-putting or as horrifying as they sound on many other cuts here it's actually gorgeous the song daughter carries a lot of the mellow energy of the previous track with a very simple bass groove and a drum beat that sounds almost bossa nova' ish but darkened up a little bit given all the material up to this point on the album I think the first leg of this track aside from the swarm of detuned guitar tones is a little unsuspecting but then the band breaks loose in the second half into these glorious glamorous gothic harmonies that are fantastic it makes me want to wear black for the rest of my life the song the reason they hate me is maybe the most straightforward rock tune on the entire record not only in terms of groove but it's verse-chorus verse-chorus instrumental bridge refrain on the outro it is one of the catchiest and most direct moments on the entire album with its driving bass and the manic rants coming out of the vocals also the guitars on this thing sound like the dissonant shots of strings from the psycho soundtrack but on steroids especially on the hook where they literally go dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick it's like I'm being stabbed but with a sound ocean song offers a change of pace in that it is a story song hinged upon the dejected shouting of frontman Alexis Marshall the track lyrically is a surreal description of a man coming home and being overcome by some great terror he is hit with this desire to run just run as fast as he can away from his house I guess away from his life the lyricism is fantastic I would even say literary his shoes come off his feet and shadow him for several yards ghosts of why he was desperate to keep up until gone now the road punching upward into his sock naked feet the band hits the listener with yet another 20 story tall wall of sour guitars which yet it's obviously happened a lot of times up until this point on the album but this is one of the nastiest examples of it so far it actually reaches kind of a deafening fever pitch with some really tense drum fills and some acoustic guitar worked in there too it really does kind of give you the feeling of of being chased this song kind of turned on my fight or flight reflexes the track eventually coasts out on this meditative repetition of these riffs and drums it's almost little swans ish it's a very powerful ending but believe it or not the band actually saves the best for last with the song guesthouse which at this point for me on this record I'm feeling crazy because I'm playing a numbers game in my head and I'm thinking everything up until this point has been so watertight what are the chances this band is just gonna stick the landing here I don't know what the chances were but I guess they were in daughter's favor because this ending what do I even say about this ending I'm honestly out of words because I it's it's so overpowering this track is one of the ugliest things I've ever heard the relentless guitars on this thing are terrifying and Marshall screams of the fear in agony in his voice on this track is palpable and then the madness of this song is given this grandiose presentation with what sounds like some really beautiful and rich horns and strings it's like orchestral sighs I think maybe these additions might be synthetic in some way shape or form but either way they coast out beautifully especially when the guitars and drums kind of disintegrate to let that orchestral instrumentation just kind of bring this record to a close it's like the calm after one of the most tumultuous musical storms I've been subjected to this decade and not just tumultuous because I've heard a number of very noisy chaotic albums this year in many years up until this point but this record is really visceral like you really get into it physically it's not just this wall of noise that you just stand on the outside of and doesn't really have any kind of emotional baggage to it this is a physical album and on top of that this record is so terrifying amazing finish super consistent but terrifying sound what a terrifying album what a terrifying album and like a lot of great horror movies I feel like this album almost comes to the conclusion that we are the monster the monster comes from within because all the horrible and scary things that are set in the lyrics on this record mostly seem to be rooted into this internal darkness that one can't really shake this record is the horror of losing control and becoming that monster you work every day so hard not to be and I feel like your ability to deal with that and and tolerate such such ugly sounds is is going to be deeply connected to whether or not this album actually even appeals to you feeling a strong 9 to a 10

Nev2-f2cfjo,hi everyone long thony triptan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new current 93 album the light is leaving us all this is the latest full-length album from UK neo fulk godfathers current 93 which is a musical project founded in the 80's with like a bajillion albums founded by poet and frontman David Tibet who got his start in the UK music scene piling around and collaborating with some of the best and brightest coming out of the industrial music revolution on set by bands like throbbing gristle psychic TV nurse with wound now given that it would only make sense that David Tibet's early work under the current 93 name would have kind of an industrial tone to it like on dogs blood rising or nature unveiled but slowly current 93 would eventually transition away from a lot of these industrial and ambient atmospheres and involved into a sound that was more akin to English folk music keep in mind that Tibet has been the only creative constant in current 93 from start to finish and each sonic metamorphosis the band has undergone has sort of come off the back of a change in personnel at least to some degree that being said though by the early 90s Tibetan company had fully developed this dark and poetic strain of folk music with a medieval twist and a theatrical edge most notably on albums like thunder perfect mind of ruin or Sun Blazing Star and all the pretty little horses albums that feature not just winding gorgeous mystical folk guitars but also violins psychedelic drones pianos woodwinds bells hand percussion but easily the most standout thing of these records and the current 93 discography in general is David Tibet himself the dude is a showstopper and not just because of his totally batty and can't be delivery style he sounds like a wild ass and PC from an old English RPG where you're like spelunking caves and pillaging like weird thief coves and learning some boss ass spells again it's not just his delivery that makes David Tibet so interesting but also his Lear laced with occultism paganism really religion and spirituality of all stripes mysticism esoteric historical figures philosophy mortality also cats and since the 90s Kurt 93 have worked a lot of other genres and sounds into their folky repertoire whether that be noise rock or hymns or classical music I recommend you check out the album soft black stars which sees David Tibet over a lot of lovely pianos or the band's last proper album in 2014 which sees them embracing really everything but the kitchen sink an album that at the time flew totally over my head but now that I have a better grip of their back catalogue I now appreciate just how weird of a left hook this record was for them so current 93 has undergone a lot of changes over the years as most groups who have been putting out music for about four decades do but for most of it the band's arcane tendencies and Tibet's bold poetry have remained at the center of whatever they're doing now 2018 so far has been a pretty busy year for current 93 as Tibet has released a spoken word sound collage piece he also put out a collaborative record with the Italian experimental rock metal and jazz bands ooh easily one of the most instrumentally ambitious records yet to be attached to current 93 and now we have this the light is leaving us all a record that by the standards of current 93 s recent output is kind of scaling things back returning to the more organic and kind of medieval folk instrumentation that put the band on the map but it's not just an old school or a throwback current 93 album as there are some unique characteristics to this record that kind of make it stand out for one this is easily one of the most fluid and cohesive records in the current 93 discography as many of the tracks on this thing seamlessly flow into one another and there are some really clear lyrical themes that pull the entire record together whether it be witches or birds bird singing birds leaving field recordings of birds also the title of this album is kind of a lyrical mantra that pulls us through numerous tracks on this thing - as David Tibet waxes poetic on things like loss and changes and cycles various sorts like to dark shifting seasons it's like he's spinning a series of enchanting vignettes around a central but cryptic set of themes in front of a series of instrumental backdrops of varying intensities whether it be the plucky gentle string melodies intertwining on the policeman is dead or the frigid electric piano arpeggios on bright Dead star which come off super forlorn heart-wrenching I also love the guitar and xylophone combo I think it's a xylophone on 30 red houses these curious little melodies dancing around each other are matched with one of the most sinister vocal deliveries that David Tibet brings on the entire record then there's a thousand witches which features this very sparse funeral march percussion some chilling woodwinds and rich piano there are also some stunning and swelling walls of sound on this thing - whether it be noisy and dissonant like on the very surreal the postman is singing which features some horns and strings and raw guitar chords or with the kettles on which has some sour layers of fluttering strings there are a few instrumentals here that meander a bit and don't progress all that much but even on the tracks where this happens it's not all that bad as it still contributes to this albums gorgeous aesthetic and strong sense of place there is a wonderful sense of immersion to the sound and the style of this album as it makes me feel like I'm transported to another place another time however I will say the consistent lyrical themes of this record I do think are a bit of a double-edged sword it doesn't come off as unpredictable or as alien as some of the wordplay and topics that David has presented on previous releases which could be really good for newcomers occasionally David might even drop some lyrical food for thought - and if a man blinds a man his eyes blinded if a man breaks the bone of another man his bone is broken if a man knocks out the tooth of another man his tooth is knocked out which I kind of read as a statement on the futility of violence as a means to an end generally Tibet's words on this album are pretty evocative however I did find after multiple listens to this album some of the lyrical themes do grow a little stale and I start getting some deja vu in a way I do prefer how puzzling and obtuse some of his lyricism was on previous efforts I think a slightly large instrumental presentation would have been a nice touch on this record - as there are a handful of cuts on here that are lovely but meander a little bit musically bench in the fetch your future cartoon and policeman is dead to a degree those are really my biggest complaints with this album though it's a lovely record lovely endearing strange and pretty unique - maybe not in the grandeur current 93 discography but still after all these years there are so few groups out there that are doing exactly what David Tibet and company are doing which obviously contributes to current 93's obscurity but simultaneously it's part of the reason they have such a passionate fan base to begin with because where the hell else are you getting this I'm feeling a strong 70 - a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is a another review that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana current 93 the light is leaving us all forever 
cEkJziOSNzs,uh hi everyone slept and he smacked Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kurt Vile album bottle it in this is the latest album for Matador Records from Kurt Vile 'men no that's that's not his name him just kidding he is a singer-songwriter and essentially a veteran of the indie scene at this point as I can remember back when the late-2000s blogosphere was in full swing and Kurt was turning heads with a variety of mp3s and albums like constant hit maker and childish prodigy he kind of made a name for himself in the trendy ocean of Lofa musicians with a more psychedelic and funky sound and Matador Records early investment in his music paid off heavily when he dropped his breakout record smoke ring for my halo an album that at the time resonated much more with other indie fans than it did with me I liked a lot of the trippy and hazy walls of sound that this album offered but I found a lot of the songwriting underneath this to be utterly average but over the years Kurt songwriting did mature a little bit in terms of structure and lyricism and kind of reached a peak in 2013 on his album waking on a pretty days still my favorite record of his so far hands down a record loaded with these blissful hazy day tunes with gently psychedelic instrumentation and lyrics that offer just a little bit more food for thought Kurt vials very weird drawling singing voice started to gain some real swagger his influences began to really shine - whether it be Neil Young or Tom Petty or Willie Nelson or a lick of krautrock however Kurt stripped a lot of the psychedelic and layered instrumentation back on his last full-length album believe him going down to deliver his songs and I guess a more raw format and while there were some great standouts on this album like pretty pimpin and I'm an outlaw for the most part the humdrum lyrics and chord progressions didn't really stand up with this more naked view especially on the more mellow cuts here bottle it in however is another change of pace it sees Kurt bringing more instrumentation back in but not going so crazy with the effects that it becomes super trippy or surreal it's at a tasteful midpoint it sounds more mature like his last record but still should appeal to fans who have always liked the more ethereal qualities of his albums it is also his longest record yet at about an hour and 20 minutes stylistically Kurt is still very much in the folk rock Americana acoustic ballad wheelhouse but occasionally you might catch a bit more banjo or some xylophone or even some synthesizers and I think occasionally on this album Kurt does step it up a little bit vocally and lyrically right from the opening track on this thing loading zones which is a strong opening for this album and a bittersweet piece of folk rock with a really strong sense of place as Kurt goes on to describe his dirty little town the loading zones being there and getting his shopping done and then he's having these weird and mayoral fantasies I also like the lush rush of beautiful instrumentation toward the back end of the track the shadowed refrain a pop for free next track sees Kurt embarking yet again on one of these kind of Spacey rock tunes with a driving set of drums a lot of speed on this song it's tight it's driving there's a lot of angular guitar melodies feels like the remnants of Kurt's former band the war on drugs working itself into his music yet again I also love how rich and jangly the guitars all over this track are also Kurt's voice really pops out of the mix on this cut to his quirky personality really shines through these songs one-trick ponies and especially rolling with the flow showcase some of Kurt's best songwriting yet rolling with the flow is a bonafide old-school country tune with a beautiful tried and true chord progression some really high gloss guitar leads and the strums on the acoustics are gorgeous they are crunchy they just they're springy yet defined it's it's lovely I love the lyrics on this track too about ageing his friends kind of moving on and living their own lives meanwhile he's just there doing his own thing rolling with the flow a keep on rolling with the flow god I hate myself then there's the track check baby which features this gurgling bass a really groovy lowdown beat it's like a mix of Fulk Barb and rock-and-roll but industrial to Kurt's swagger on the song is something to behold and the lyrics are borderline badass amphetamine amphetamine you know what I mean she's got a real kick to a some real Velvet Underground bass-ackwards is a song on the album where Kurt kind of embarks on this slice of life songwriting his diatribe reads like a diary it's like he's kind of giving you a day of his life over some trippy reversed instrumentation he's on a radio show of the friend he's doing a bunch of other things too but all the thoughts kind of string together coherently I'm slightly reminded of Sun Kil moon and Mark causal ex recent work but I feel like the difference between what Mark is doing on his tracks and what Kurt is doing here is I guess the difference between listening to a book on tape and like a relaxation cassette basically folk rock ASMR also keep in mind that this track is one of three ten-minute cuts on the album and if Kurt's gonna be using these three tracks to add this much runtime to the album they've all got to be essential right unfortunately these longer songs the other two longer songs are where I think the album falters the most the title track bottle it in really should have bottled it in I get that the point of this song is to be as chill as possible but it's just so comatose the instrumental become so redundant tedious and lifeless I might as well just be listening to some kind of mechanical noise on an endless loop and it's not exactly like Kurt's vocals on top really steal the show there's lots of dead air lots of weird awkward craning it's not exactly like the song progresses all that much across its 10 minute runtime either though as Kurt says on one-trick ponies I guess he does like repetition lyrically I do like the sentiment of the song about just kind of being afraid of being hurt by a significant other and you're afraid to kind of reveal yourself or let your intent or feelings be known but I feel like this message would go over so much better and and hit so much harder had it been packaged into a more succinct song something is instrumentally gorgeous and flavorful as rolling with the flow and again even bass ackwards doesn't go over that bad because the groove is great Kurt vocally is much more captivating the the long ending tracks skinny mini suffers from a lot of the same issues namely mind-numbing repetition though I do applaud how Kerr approached this track instrumentally the barely legible minimalist percussion that really stark singular guitar line Kurt drawing all over the track with some effects that makes his voice sound like he's kind of calling out over a loudspeaker although I don't even want to get into the lyrics I want to give me a kiss girl I want to wow would you look at that I want a damn she sure is fine I want a damn she just blew my mind and it's not just the lengthier tracks on this album that are kind of weighing this album down it's a lot of material in the last leg like on the song mutinies and come again both tracks that drum up some really cool walls of sound but the tunes are just okay not nearly as catchy or as sweet as many that came in the first half of the record though I do like some of the banjo licks and Kurt's lyrical musings about planets and bones and modern technology the song cold was the wind is another decent track on the album but for the most part it's ruined by all of these really gimmicky sound effects that it's wrapped and namely some weird scratchy turntable noises that are just really unnecessary in a lot of respects I think this record is kind of an improvement on the last record I mean the instrumentation and the production is lush and full and fantastic this album also features some of Kurt's best material to date but unfortunately the entire album is bogged down by a lot of cuts that really could have been cut either cut entirely or just cut down to a more respectable length as dragging these songs out to ten minutes doesn't really add to their appeal this is truly an album that I think would have been better off with less I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition

9UPA4YgRVhU,hi everyone kiss Anika Stano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand new jouji album ballads 1 this is the debut full-length commercial album of YouTube meme Lord gone alternative R&B superstar Joe G aka George Miller one of the biggest names on the 88 rising label a status he rocketed to last year when he dropped his in tongues EP a little project that carried an admirably moody vibe but was severely lacking with it's mostly nondescript vocal performances and very rudimentary production even though there were some parts of this EP that I liked for the most part it was pretty bland and unmemorable so as far as this new album goes I was kind of hoping that Joe G would bring a huge improvement on all fronts or else I would be in for yet another snoozer and for a second it felt like we were going to get a truly exciting album from the smell of some of the teaser tracks to this thing namely the single slow dancing in the dark easily one of joe g's most fully realized songs yet far better than anything he had put out up until that point in terms of lyricism in terms of vocal performance also the sound and the instrumental of this thing I love the dreamy arpeggios colored all over this track very smooth basis well the vocal lines on this cut have kind of a vintage feel explosive hook as well with a wall of very bright ringing synthesizers the track was sad and romantic and captivating and held way more emotion than anything on that EP so that single was a really good start and now that I'm hearing the entire album there are some things that I like about it I love ballads ones very simple loaf i recording style even if it is a bit of a double-edged sword on some tracks for the most part this records very rough aesthetic adds to how sad and moody it is I think it gives a lot of the songs on this thing kind of an edge and a bit of personality to occasionally that loaf IH is oddly missing mostly on the track test drive which in my opinion mostly just sounds like a lazy post Malone ripoff or it can't occasionally go overboard like on the opening track attention which in the middle of the song features these huge rumbling clipping overblown bass notes that suck up the mix so hard that the vocals basically become distorted fuzz doubt and unintelligible I appreciate the attempt at doing something a little experimental and a little weird here lord knows there are tons of weird lo-fi and distorted songs and albums that I enjoy quite a bit but I would not cite this song as an example of it being done well most of the time the lo-fi aesthetic of the production on this thing reaches a healthy middle ground like on the song wanted you which features these 30 kick drums and kind of scattered dirty filthy high hats some sunburnt guitars wailing out definitely makes the track sound woozy and overwhelming and bittersweet then there's the track can't get over you which features clams Casino a song that features a gentle but very funky beat with a super mini ature kick and snare pattern some slick bass and what sounds like some very plucky keyboard notes hard panned in to each Channel it's endearing it's cute it's kind of sweet and then there's the track why am I still in LA which at the midpoint features this rush of distorted guitars and some pretty heavy bass some driving drums too then on the verses we get these lonely glockenspiel notes honestly it almost sounds like something out of an old mount eerie song so there are elements of this album that do remind me of lo-fi indie and then there are elements of it that remind me of similarly moody alternative R&B artists that also have rough productions surrounding their tracks how to dress well or spooky black / Corbin I think the sound that George is shooting for on this new record though is is much more mesmerizing almost to the point where it feels like a narcotic and this consistently sad and moody and kind of druggie vibe is really the best thing that this album has going for it because it's still a very flawed project not only because it has numerous tracks that don't really develop all that far and duck out prematurely to the point where they basically feel like filler talking about can't get over you which is just a minute and change or the track xaniix or the track r.i.p with trippy red which fades out prematurely and the song la - even though this track is not one of the shortest on the entire album it is pretty odd that it hits this really distorted intense crescendo point in the middle of the cut and then it just kind of coasts out into oblivion after that is if it doesn't reel know where to go next believe me there are other examples of much more coherent songwriting on this record and occasionally even when Joji does try to string these songs out into a more satisfying length he has to get there by patting the track out in a really weird or awkward way like on the closing track of this thing which features two completely uncomplimentary pieces of music faded into one another in this really jarring unpleasant way and even though this album does feature some vocal improvements on Jody's part the vocals still do leave a little bit to be desired as they range from totally forgettable like on the track yeah right or off-key and awkward like some of the really god-awful auto-tune background vocal riffing on the closing track some of the vocal layers on the track wanted you are a total mess too thankfully the really odd beat on this track and the song is so sharp that it kind of balances it out still it does not change that although we and vocal harmonies I guess you could call them that are really slurred throughout the track they don't really come together all that well they're terribly unflattering even if I do like the raw display of emotion that Joji brings here I also have a really odd attraction to the track no fun I like the bouncy beat the simple lonesome message of the song is cute too the lyrics might be incredibly reductive and maybe the rhyme scheme isn't that amazing but it's still incredibly catchy and I love how that pre-chorus moment where Joji is singing and I keep with myself don't fuck with no one else it sounds almost like something out of a j-pop song this thing is twelve tracks thirty-five minutes doesn't really overstay its welcome I like the vibe I like the aesthetic but overall I'm pretty on the fence with it again I like the sound I like the aesthetic I like most of the instrumentals some of the songs vocals still remain to be an Achilles heel for Joji unfortunately and the writing can be really hit or miss but I do like some of the sonic risks that he took on this record I can definitely say that this album in comparison with his EP was a little more interesting certainly more adventurous seems like he's coming into his own a bit more artistically even if there are some cuts on here that feel very dime-a-dozen and trendy this thing is pleasant it's pretty it's somber but there's not a whole lot to dig into beyond the intoxicating energy that it radiates when you're playing it feeling a strong v to light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana jouji ballads won forever 
m89uoXuylag,this new Greta Van Fleet album it's not good the brand-new full-length album from Michigan band Greta Van Fleet given my feelings on the band's previous material and my negative takes on nearly every track that has been released prior to the drop of this album along with some very notable and negative reviews this album has received since it was put out you might have seen this video coming but I have a feeling that this is going to be a very different not good because Greta Van Fleet is a unique band in a unique situation this is not like most videos in this series where I will just totally rip on an album because the production is garbage the singing is some of the worse that I've heard this year and the instrumentals or the performances are just that is actually very much the opposite for Greta Van Fleet when it comes to musicianship I'm not gonna say this album is the moon and the stars or anything but these guys are very capable they play pretty freakin well and the production is actually pretty tasteful by modern rock standards it's nowhere near as squeaky-clean and soleus says what you might find on like a imagine dragons album there's a nice human touch it does have a cool organic quality to it even if sometimes it does come off slightly bland so yeah the production musicianship the performances they're not really all that bad sitting down and listening through to this entire album while there are a few duds in the tracklist it's actually pretty Pleasant not excruciating by any stretch of the imagination but the headache that Greta Van Fleet gives me is more of a contextual one now if you didn't know up until this point Greta Van Fleet is pretty much a hard rock band mixing groovy bass and drums with wild guitar riffs and leads and soaring bluesy vocals very much a 70s throwback and a quality one at that in that there is a lot of attention to style and detail but Greta Van Fleet in this album are not just merely some 70s Hard Rock pastiche the ideas and the sounds and influences behind the music on this album are so dead specific you could really widdle greta van fleets pretty much their entire sound down to one band and that's Led Zeppelin I mean of course there are some elements of songwriting and musicianship where they fall painfully short but honest to god there were deep cuts on this thing that if you told me they were a long-lost Led Zeppelin b-side I might just believe you the imitation literally goes that far I mean the imitation went too far on the band's previous release already and it seems like with the years that they've had to hone their sound and the increase in production quality they have only spent this time this effort this money in emulating Led Zeppelin sound further only becoming even greater of a ripoff but my major issue with this record does not merely come down to the fact that one band that's new is influenced by another band that's old because as you know there are dozens of reviews I pop out every year many of them being positive where there's a very clear influence being worn on the sleeve of that artist for another one that I'm pretty familiar with as well merely being influenced by another artist is not a sin especially if we're talking about the case of Led Zeppelin because few artists stole robbed and cheated their way to the top like Led Zeppelin did as there are numerous tracks in the band's catalogue where certain pieces musical ideas or entire songs are just blatant ripoffs of other shit so it's not merely the stealing the borrowing or even the plagiarism of a particular sound or idea or aesthetic that really kind of gets in my craw over this record because in the creative process of any kind of art you're always going to be influenced by something even inadvertently as the creative process doesn't happen in a vacuum but instead of making something that's essentially an amalgamation of all the ideas and experiences from each respective member in Greta Van Fleet the band has decided to base their creative output on the vision of a single music act and again that's Led Zeppelin there may be a few parts on this album where a guitar lick or vocal riff might sound a little bit like Geddy Lee or a little bit like like an Aerosmith track but for the most part this album just sounds like a bunch of Led Zeppelin cuts to the point where Greta Van Fleet is a cover band but without the covers as the quality of the songs on this record are okay but weren't nearly good enough to make the cut of great Led Zeppelin albums like three and four and Physical Graffiti there's nothing on this album that goes toe-to-toe with a black dog or a stairway to heaven or even a communication breakdown in terms of performance musicianship wild energy so the band's own mission to emulate this sound in a way has failed as the end result here doesn't really entice me to listen to the album over again but rather it just feels like I'm pre-gaming to go listen to an actual Led Zeppelin album because whenever I put this on that's pretty much what I'm in the mood to do despite again the musicianship on this thing not being all that bad and I do find it pretty impressive that the lead singer on here has literally mapped out Robert Plant's whole vocal range in his vocal cords from his strained raspy and passionate eyes to his kind of saucy and sultry lower registers but even sounding exactly like another huge band and falling short on a quality level isn't even the biggest annoyance that I have with this record and it has nothing to do with now the rock and roll used to be about rebelling against your parents and now with this record it's about pleasing your parents it's not really about that either my biggest annoyance with this album is that conceptually it spits in the face of artistic evolution because again while Led Zeppelin some of the biggest thieves and rock music they at least had the foresight and the smarts to cover their tracks and at least put some sort of twist on what it is they were ripping off without at least that baseline level of minimal effort to recontextualize what they were borrowing you wouldn't have Led Zeppelin even though originality is not the be-all end-all of great music and a record that is purely original and separate from any and all contexts and musical cultures and movements that we are currently familiar with would most likely turn off most listeners the struggle to be original and the struggle to stand out is what pushes music as an artform forward because there are plenty of genres and musical movements over the years that we could name that have essentially become cultural dead-ends red herrings or just completely died out as dead as something can be in the Internet age because it failed to evolve it failed to progress forward it failed to challenge the listener and it failed to engage a new generation of listeners on their terms with something different so even though presenting new ideas are sounding unlike anything else out there does not guarantee you an audience or a great album without all of us or at least most of us attempting to to attain that there's literally no reason to listen to any new music ever again because we would literally be in a situation where it's just all been done before because the unoriginal 'ti of this band in this record is deafening and its outright shocking and again this has nothing to do with borrowing directly from Led Zeppelin I mean I enjoy for the most part that rival sons record pressure and time and there are tons of tracks on that album that sound pretty much like Led Zeppelin tracks however I would never mistake those songs for Led Zeppelin song or a Led Zeppelin recording just as I would never mistake an aerial pink song for an R Stevie Moore song just as I would never mistake a Kurt Vile song for a Neil Young song and just as I would never mistake an Earl song for an MF DOOM song again it's not similarity and influence that's necessarily a bad thing here even to the degree that Greta Van Fleet takes it because hey you know cover bands can be pretty entertaining but I would never buy a cover bands album or ponder the artistic intent of what they're doing beyond that they're just here to lightly entertain people while they're getting a hit of nostalgia and just kind of drinking the night away the problem with this album is that it openly poo-poos the guiding artistic principles of recontextualization change reappropriation as this band has chosen to work from one of the greatest rubrics in rock history and have literally put no twist on it whatsoever outside of slightly more subpar musicianship and songwriting maybe some of you feel like I'm overreacting here but I truly do find this bands unashamed coattail riding on another artists creative journey to be pretty aggravating especially since the final result pales in comparison to the original and isn't really that interesting this Greta Van Fleet album it's not good [Music] 
aB82w8SdQvg,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week first off I want to give a shout-out to our sponsor the good people over at the ridge they make these nifty metal plated elastic banded money clipped wallets that fit nicely in your front pocket way better than your old disgusting leather wallet again hit that link in the description box replace it and use promo code Fantana to get 10% off your first oh also down there are our Amazon and turntable lab associate links especially that turntable lab one hit that link up buy yourself a colorful pressing of a record we've reviewed on the channel a turntable some speakers some audiophile stuff we get kicked back from it supports the channel and let's get into a few shout outs we have trenton molar dropping a new cover of the Neil Young track really kind of pulling it back into the strange corners of the Neil Young discography hear the track transformer man which was created on a record that came during a time where Neil Young was a little interested in weird futuristic synth pop with a lot of like Robo vocals and stuff it's actually pretty intriguing if you're a hardcore Neil Young fan you haven't really been there yet in the Neil Young discogs also preoccupations has been covered by the band proto martyr of the song forbidden is also linked down below which is actually pretty cool being that I do like material from both of those lovely little post-punk bands let next let's get into the tracks I thought were the worst this week least favourite tracks of the week I actually have quite quite a few of them quite a few these favourite tracks this week first off new song from yung lean forthcoming project named poison ivy dropping in November and yeah this cut was pretty much an attempted I think going a little introspective but it just ended up being a total mess his flow does not sound all that solid does not sound all that great and it's just really all over the place and amateurish and unflattering is is probably the the worst thing I can say about this track it's unflattering in in disappointing because I did like quite a bit of the material off of his last record and it seemed like overall he was starting to embark on some kind of major improvement here but this new song over here leads me to believe that maybe that is not the case moving on from their new track from the new the grinch soundtrack with Danny Elfman and Tyler the Creator teaming up for the euro mean one mr. Grinch theme and this is awful this is a terrible rendition of this song it just sounds like in like a really bad track off of flower boy but with those Danny Elfman strings surrounding it and maybe the biggest disappointment of this track is that the original features such a bold memorable and strong vocal that really embodies the darkness and just the meanness of the character that the track is about and there are a few rappers out there of this current mainstream that I think you could pull on that if you were going to go a rap direction with this song could kind of embody that voice because tire the Creator when he wants to he has a pretty dark foreboding and ominous and edgy vocal but he chose not to embrace that side of his voice at all and he's just kind of doing a very low-key semi soulful again it just sounds like he's still pulling on a lot of those flower boy sounds to kind of pull this track together and yeah it just sounds really undersold I don't really think it does much to build up the I guess the personality of the character that the song is about which is really the worst thing about it ultimately original paints the character to a tee and makes you really feel like this this character is a bad guy this new song makes me feel like doesn't really embody the character all that well just doesn't really sound like that mean of a guy just sounds like a really weak tune alright moving on from there this new cardi B song money is it's pretty much trash which again kind of disappointing considering that I like quite a bit of the material off of her debut full-length album but there are so many things that are a total mess about the song her flow just sounds really amateurish like she hasn't been rapping all over the place all over every track for the past couple of years like ever since she blew up like it sounds like she's just starting number one not only in terms of her vocal delivery and flow but also her lyrics on the topic of money are pretty freaking basic and finally the the cherry on top is really that the instrumental is awful it's really rickety its Hollow it just seems kind of thrown together of course there are some gimmicky and weird fun little vocal samples thrown into the mix that make it pop out a little bit and make it sound kind of original or unique but for the most part the worst thing about this track is that it just seems really shoddy shoddily produced shoddily rapped shoddily written not really sure where we're going here with cardi B just seems like she's not really trying here and that she's just pumping out a new single just to pump out a new single moving on from there the new cake song sinking ship is yet another ongoing installment of 90s band comes back to put out political song that's really not that good because the guitar riffs on this thing sound like something out of a bad ZZ Top song the lyrics are absolutely frigging inane and the the base which is usually one of the stars of the show on on a cake song on a cake album as doing really nothing interesting whatsoever so really kind of an L for me in L and of course take off of me goes fame has dropped a new solo single quavo was not going to be the only solo me go in 2018 I guess maybe he's got a new album on the way I really have no idea I'm especially not interested after this new single over here which even though I did like what he did with 21 savage on without warning this new track over here is about as generic as new trap singles get lyrical content the beat the flows I'm pretty much convinced now that not a single member of the migos has any solo viability so might as well just keep it together guys just please keep it together the solo thing it's not gonna work let's just let's just keep it as a trio moving out of the tracks that I thought were kind of math not amazing but not terrible either potentially worth your time if it's your thing first the new Toro y Moi single has just dropped a new project on the way and Chaz has treated us to a song by the name of freelance and I do like a lot of things about this track I do like the throwback electronic kind of synth funky instrumentation the groove is undeniable and fantastic but the lyrics and especially the vocal performance I could really have done without especially the inflections where Chaz is just like wow well I'm just like really pushing it vocally and sounding utterly ridiculous and the auto-tune on his voice makes him sound a little preposterous as well I just think again vocally this could have been a lot better moving on from there Nick zmuda of the books has a brand new track out which is slated to be released on the new we the animals soundtrack it's a nice little cute electronic ambient ish piece that has a lot of nice texture in it and everything structurally and compositionally it's not blown the Iranian hue or anything but it's it's very nice on the ears name of the track is tonight work we'll go for a ride stumbling all over my words they're moving on from there a dude by the name of Mike Crowell has some new music out via merge records the name of this new tune is little drama and if you're into some really hard-hitting slightly loafie garage rock that is very much in the vein of artists like Jay retard for example I think a really dig on this new song over here vocals are not maybe as bold or as stand out as I would like them to be but they do sing a pretty pretty catchy melodic line and again that guitar tone is kind of to die for it's really skull-crushing moving on from there Mick Jenkins has a new promo track out featuring Ghostface Killah his latest record has just dropped make sure to check it out I'm probably going to cover it at some point this week I think I think I think and moving on from there homeboy Sandman has a new short little project out with Eden the production now the thing is absolutely insane especially on this new cut over here titled the gut do make sure to give it a shot it is pretty fun if you're a hardcore Stones Throw fan and you do like that left-field production you're gonna get a lot out of this I'm not all that crazy still about homeboy Sandman's delivery neither Eden's either but they do have kind of quirky again I'll see the word left-field personality is that underground rap fans do do tend to enjoy some movin on from there Zac Condon of Beirut Fame is is back under the Beirut name and has seen fit to drop a couple of tracks this week in promotion for a new record and his last under the Beirut name no no no I was totally not into it all I'm not exactly seeing things panning out for the better necessarily with these new couple of tracks they're not absolutely awful but one of them corfu just kind of seems like a very short and throwaway instrumental meanwhile galley op elite galley Polly Gallipoli which I totally butchered the pronunciation of so I apologize the tune there is just really comatose and forgettable I do appreciate some of the very nice and lovely trumpets and sweet layered instrumentation he has put on to the track as you typically do expect out of a beirut song but the songwriting is really some of the most nondescript that he's put out in years so I'm just really not sure what we are anticipating from this project at this point and miraculously the new AFI single titled get dark is is really not that bad if you like some very catchy fast-paced rock music I think you'll dig on it I think it'll dig I it's pretty sweet never been a big AFI guy honestly but this new one's not too bad it's got a nice got a nice edge to it and let's move on to the tracks that I thought were some of the best this week really kind of stuck out to me you know not too many this is a week that I was more disappointed than blown away I guess but let's let's get into it Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk Fame has put out like a new lengthy techno track which is over 14 minutes it's maybe not one of the best loops I've ever heard in my entire life but he does undergo some interesting little rhythmic shifts and progressions throughout the song that I think are really cool so this Riga take five track is actually pretty awesome if you want to listen through the whole thing and really really kind of soak in soak in the vibe of it you know again nice little techno cut moving on from there these skiffle players which is a band that Cass McCombs is affiliated with have a nice kind of old-school blend of folk and rock and roll and it's it's pretty sweet it's pretty sweet and they have a new track out and this new record is out now actually so do try to give it a shot but this new song titled local boy is is is a nice little funky rocky banger with some sweet vocal harmonies on it too so you know if you do like your rock kind of rootsy give it a shot and 9th wonder has a new 90-minute project coming out soon which is a bit of a compilation of sorts where he brings on a series of artists and of course he's doing the production and their guests on the songs - and there's a particular track on there titled sojourn er which is sort of masterminded by rhapsody and it features Jay Cole and actually complement each other on the song really well and Rhapsody brings great bars Jay Cole brings great bars so no real complaints and of course ninths production is pretty great as well you know just just a really good trio on the song good good try team on this track some good heady thoughtful soulful classy hip hop music with a lot of flavor so do give that track of tribe and a Gerard Way Gerard Way the Gerard way of My Chemical Romance Fame has a new little single out titled baby you're a haunted house and it features a quirky little music video for the most part the track kind of sounds like a low five piece of garage rock but there's a nice bit of balladry to the song that i think is really nice really sweet and even though again i think the production the sound overall is a little one-dimensional or maybe run-of-the-mill as far as the the garage punk or Lofa garage thing goes it is a pretty fun tune I do think it is a fun - and it is nice to hear Girard kind of growing into his own I guess as a solo artist because I thought his last solo record was a little all over the place a little underwhelming this new song over here though felt kind of fun one more thing I want to fit in this section is the new trippy red single Topanga this SoundCloud rapper has come through with I think one of his best tracks in a while certainly his best since I guess Dark Knight demo the rich and gospel inspired instrumental on this one which is loaded with some fantastic pianos is really nice and I think the vocal lines he delivers on this track are great - I'm not gonna say the lyrics are amazing that they're the moon and the stars and everything like that they are a little lackluster but I do think if he continues on this trend of just better and more unique instrumentals and work quality vocal performances he's going to stand out in the current wave of soundcloud rappers in a great way so digging song digging this direction incredibly catchy boo-boo-boo-boo and hope to hear more like it and finally I think this is the last yeah the last one I want to give a shout out to a band camp artist by the name of Michael Oher it's like dot Michael dot and this song over here off of this Bandcamp page I really want to quit my job is one of many on this record that are short feature some lovely guitar work also mixed with some woodwind and some funny meta and introspective lyrics as well this project has a lot of quirk a lot of personality a lot of I guess I'll say low-key heart and so give it a shot give it a shot it's very cute and I guess sort of endearing as well so that's it that's the the weekly track roundup guys I've got to make sure to hit up our good friends over at the ridge wallet and all of the links everything that we have linked you guys down to below in the description box as far as music if it so interests you as well I will catch you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup 
DIvhuTE9jeI,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another y-you know review where I go over a series of albums that I that I wasn't able to touch down on in a formal review I talk about them gauntlet style in a video like this and you know what it is at this point because we've done it many many many many many many many many many times so let's get into it Bob a confidence man is a music duo from Australia that I wasn't really all that familiar with up until this point heard a few tracks here and there that kind of piqued my interest overall the album is a little one-dimensional and maybe not as great at doing what it's trying to do as it might think it is but if you're into alternative indie flavoured dance music with a lot of sense a lot of strong drums and grooves and kind of a tongue-in-cheek silly sense of humor and some quirky song topics and concepts then give this thing a try just don't be surprised if sometimes the humor doesn't really land or maybe comes off a bit corny or that the duo's musical skills are a bit limited and don't lead to very dynamic tracks to be honest this is the first album from the heavy metal revived band Satan that has really kind of stopped me in my tracks I mean the the band has some pretty good material from back in the day they made a comeback not too long ago I've dropped a few records since but this new album over here has bigger campy er vocals more captivating soaring melodic guitars catchy ER songs the one huge glaring flaw bout this record is that the drum production absolutely sucks like there's a bunch of ambient noise around it it doesn't sound that good the percussion just pops out of the mix and a really janky awkward way like it doesn't really blend with the vocals and the guitars all that well to the point where really ruins the atmosphere of these tracks that really should feel huge and creepy and an in ghoulish but unfortunately that they don't and the sound of the drums really does ruin things maybe I'm a little overly picky maybe it doesn't bother you all that much but if you're a huge heavy metal head but you're not a production snob or anything give us a shot because it's actually pretty well written the new chief keef project is easily one of the dudes most insane outings period like the production that he finds himself on there's some legit like house songs on here like EDM style beats that he's trying to do this thing over and of course like that's that's not the case for every track here there's a beautiful ballad on here as well titled chiraq that I actually think is one of his better songs in a long time it's all over the place like this is so insane and obviously not in the best way because it is very long project there are a lot of tracks on here they don't last very long though but a lot of tracks on here all over the place stylistically not a lot of rhyme or reason for some of the worst tracks on this thing it's ultra inconsistent but if you like hearing weird records that go in every direction in terms of style and also quality then I guess give it a shot the new thrice album over here I've never been a thrice guy and I feel like this album just kind of continues to add to the reasons why I mean this record I will give it to thrice is not as overblown and as annoying as some of the Vans more classic and slightly more progressive records but even though they've toned things down a little bit on this new album over here I feel like what they provide here isn't really of any interest to me - I mean this just kind of sounds like if the Foo Fighters were a post hardcore band you know you kind of have some of the interesting percussion and angular guitars but at the end of the day it just sounds like a bunch of alternative rock songs written underneath that that are pretty bland and run-of-the-mill so yeah post hardcore Foo Fighters is pretty much how I'm feeling about this record you know atmosphere record is one that I was kind of looking forward to which was interesting considering that I haven't really enjoyed an atmosphere record in a long time and I will give it to slug and ant that this is definitely one of the better atmosphere records in a while it's pretty emotionally consistent the production is grimy but pretty cool fits the emotional tone of the album and this is easily one of the most introspective records under the atmosphere name in a long time but as much as I like some of the lyrics on this thing the wrapping the delivery it comes off really bitter and indignant and not really in a compelling way sort of in a grading way which after a long span of time across the album just makes it really a trudge to listen through even if I do like some songs here and there but collectively as an album it is a very arduous listen unfortunately despite the fact that there are some cool qualities to this record I could see hardcore fans being much more into it than I am though Joyce Manor drop a brand-new album another one since the band pretty much transitioned slightly away from their pop punk roots into doing a more toned-down power pop endeavor and yeah this is pretty much another helping of that it's okay the tunes are a bit more well written and fleshed out than they were on the band's last record but it's it's still a pretty bland predictable sound and the tunes while decent there's not really that much to the delivery of the performances of these songs which I feel like if they had been a bit better or more energized could really kind of light these Tunes up because I think some of the lyrics are cool I think some of the course is really pop but the delivery is so subdued and so underwhelming it's like the band doesn't really find their own material that exciting to begin with Kyary Pamyu Pamyu a new album a little disappointed in this one frankly because it is not nearly as animated colorful or creative as anything she has dropped up until this point which is kind of shocking usually by j-pop standards Kyary is a little bit of a rule of thumb in terms of just eccentric personality off-the-wall cuteness and color but by no means is the songwriting and the sound and the production of this record as bold or as chock-full of personality as everything she's done up until this point I feel like if she is going to continue releasing music under this name under this style it's gonna need to be something with a bit more personality to it because this is just so lacking the new cat power record despite the fact that I was looking forward to this album especially the collaborative Lana Del Rey cut on this thing that I thought was pretty good ended up being a little underwhelmed by it it seems like Shawn Marshall just stripped back the tunes and the instrumentation on this record to the point where it's so soft and meandering and indirect I don't really get a whole lot out of it and not that I'm against in principle stripped-back singer-songwriter records I think Feist certainly provided a really low Phi and stripped back approach to that sound that went over really well on her last album but this again I'll use the word indirect it feels like it's just darting back and forth avoiding eye contact not really sure of what direction it wants to go in and really the the delivery and performance of this album just feels like a soft mutter not not really that's strong so I don't know it just feels like a like a light breeze that just makes you want to turn on the heat and go inside sludge metal band sumac is back with another full-length album this year you might remember the collaborative record that I reviewed of theirs earlier this year that was pretty thrilling however I feel like the band has gone back to almost their standard sound over here while I have always appreciated that sumac is very heavy their sound is very crushing I haven't really found a lot of the progressions in their tracks to be that engaging and I feel like this new record over here is not really an exception to that issue that I've had in fact this record really kind of feels like the collaborative record they dropped earlier this year except sans the experimental vocal and guitar freak outs that were packed throughout that album so now you have these monolithic gigantic Dorjee atmospheric sludge metal songs that are really heavy but they just draw on forever they don't have a strong sense of direction and their volume and their viscera does kind of grow numbing after a while it's this album contains four cuts the entire album is an hour-plus so you're talking about four incredibly like juggernaut sized sludge metal songs over here that really could have been abridged into something much more interesting technical death metal band beyond creation has a few really solid and celebrated albums in the metal scene so far and their discography this new record over here however feels like a little bit more of the usual from the band but in a slightly diminished capacity I feel like the production on this record while it is not that much different than their past couple is not really doing them any favors as the drums and the guitars and the vocals really pummel the mix to the point where I think they're competing for attention in the mix and they really drown out the bass frankly and the fretless bass that typically dominates in the mix on the band's previous records brought a lot of sound dynamics flavor and personality to the whole beyond creation sound and I feel like that's being a little lost on this record despite the fact that I think some of the songs and the compositions on this album are pretty solid the vocals are pretty brutal and the performances are aggressive as hell I think that the the way this album has been crafted to sound pushes the band into a more generic direction which is kind of unfortunate without a doubt these guys are still one of the better technical death metal bands out there but I much prefer their previous two records even if by comparison the sound is a bit more raw at least the writing and the performances and just the balance of instrumentation was a lot better well the upside of coming out with your worst album is that you hope that it can only go up from here I guess Animal Collective tangerine reef a soundtrack record that is not necessarily in my view sort of a core group album but still will let it slide I've been putting off listening to this album because I haven't been particularly excited to listen to an animal collective album since their last couple have felt like duds to me and this one is going in such a weird and unexpected direction I'm also not a big soundtrack guy on top of it and lo and behold I didn't really enjoy what the group was producing here it just feels like a series of very abstract ambient pieces whose Prime sounds are really shrill and very tense this is not an ambient record that really kind of makes me relaxed or puts me in a daze or a haze or a hypnosis or anything it just really puts me on edge in a very obnoxious way and not that I'm against drone or abstract or experimental music that kind of takes that tone but the abrasive and kind of experimental tendencies of this record I don't even feel to be cathartic in any way shape or form this record a lot of the cuts to me just feel vaguely annoying and the addition of vocals every once in a while on this record doesn't really add to the appeal of it either it just feels like total slop maybe along with the intended visuals of this album it goes over so much better but that is part of the reason I don't dive too deeply into soundtracks a lot of the time anyway so dsi classic death metal band if you want to get into death metal I highly recommend you check out their first couple of records because they are classics however this new record over here feels pretty much standard pretty much part of the course for many groups that are around the age of deicide and are still plugging away and are doing so through the most basic super robotic solace and cacophonous production available for the current death metal market just feels like me and potato's death metal by the numbers super speedy super chunky super brutal and aggressive not really all that much about it that I find to be that catchy especially the riffs which are pretty dime-a-dozen it's okay how seriously did you think I was going to take this I mean it's a meme and a meme that I've already reviewed mind you a meme that I have already reviewed new metric album over here easily one of their best in a while not quite as squeaky-clean and his solace and is by the numbers as their past couple of efforts the synth pop songs on this thing really do pop and a couple of the tracks that go into a somewhat dark edgy post-punk agathi direction are pretty cool too the album overall isn't incredibly consistent but it's it's definitely one of the more satisfying metric records to drop in a while still not one of my favorite bands of all time and I do feel like while this is an improvement on recent efforts it's not exactly blowing me away or anything but you know if you're looking for some standard straightforward pop and pop rock I see no reason to avoid this record there's some good highlights on it give it a try give it a shot I've been getting a lot of requests to talk about this ghost main album and I'm just really not hearing the appeal of it while I do appreciate in concept how he's bringing together elements of trap rap at metal and goth music and and all that stuff there's something about it I find to be kind of funny and in an unintentional way I think because a lot of the really deep growly campy vocals throughout the album just sound like something off of like a Halloween tape or whatever if I was going to listen to a record that was trying to sound this dark and this freaky and was just totally overacting in a funny way throughout the whole process I would just listen to like the great Malenko from ICP or something at least they seemed sort of conscious of the fact that they were being hokey and weird and silly this to me seems unaware of the fact that it sounds silly and that it is falling very short of being as sinister and as devilish as I think it's intended to be especially on cuts where you have these switches from like some really dark instrumentation and then it'll like swap immediately into some vocals that are like just rapping with these little boy vocals that the triplet flows it just sounds funny I can't not giggle at it I just couldn't take it as seriously as I think some people are huge fans of it are which is why I didn't end up covering it formally because I just don't feel like pissing on anybody's parade today I'm mixed on this thing I mean I'm glad that I've gotten a lot of requests for this album because it seems like people are paying attention it seems like people care about Cypress Hill and what they're trying to do on this record and even though I do admire the fact that they are trying to experiment on this album I do think a lot of those steps outside of their comfort zone don't really go over all that well and just sound horrifically awkward and yeah I guess that's just how I feel about the album it just feels really awkwardly produced awkwardly performed and wrapped it doesn't feel very tight it just comes off really disheveled this new ybn tape total flop total flop for the ybn crew which is kind of disappointing considering how good the members are respectively and and how much great material they've been dropping as of late especially Corday but I feel like if they're going to build success from here they need to drop more solo material there needs to be like a big series of solo mixtapes or albums from these guys to really like show their solo viability because sure while hip-hop fans young hip-hop fans understand NC ybn as a brand around like as a brand as a crew they didn't blow up by dropping all of these like huge gigantic Posse cuts or anything like that so why they would think a collaborative album where they're all kind of doing their own thing is going to build their name and build their brand I don't know I feel like they kind of blew up with their own respective songs and I feel like if they're going to continue and grow they need to stay on that trajectory and if they are going to drop a collaborative project like this of this magnitude there actually needs to be more creative crossover between all of them on the album and it can't be this like hour-long Plus experience loaded with frigging filler like make a focused cohesive project that showcases the talent that I know you guys have don't just drop this hey we're just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks project Chicago rapper Joey purp is back following up his eyedrops project with quarter thing and while I did like eye drops quite a bit and I was anticipating this record this to me just doesn't really carry over any of what made I drop so entertaining to begin with the soulful and wonderful and captivating production the quick wit in the lyrics and the load of personality coming from perp himself I feel like he tries to go super eccentric and quirky on this record but he doesn't really have the songwriting ability or the sense of humor to do so to me this record actually almost sounds like a mediocre injury reserved album it's like he almost wanted to copy injury reserve with the bombastic kind of flavorful colorful beats the tone of the lyricism some of the playful poppy flows I mean this thing isn't a total departure from what made Joey purp interesting in the first place but I just feel like he sounds really goofy and awkward on this album and I can't 100% explain why it's just not a very gratifying release New Boston oz record this band is an American black metal outfit that I have been interested in in a cursory way for a while now as they do tend to drop a few songs here and there that I find to be pretty cool and this is a pretty brutal and aggressively played black metal album I don't care for some of the production on this record all that much is I feel like some of the symbols on the drums which are played very aggressively do tend to swallow a lot of the mix in a really annoying way but still I do think this is a pretty noisy cacophonous very muscular black metal record with a lot of punch to it so if you are looking for some western black metal that is a little artsy a little weird a little noisy give it a shot the new massive fucked up record over here is an hour in 20 minutes long and as much as I did enjoy some of the singles leading up into this album this record is just far too massive and inconsistent for me to freak out about it I mean it has its highlights and this is easily fucked ups most adventurous album yet in terms of sound style musical composition because some of these tracks here play into a lot of genres that the band doesn't usually dabble in a lot of the tracks on this thing are multi-phased and bring a lot of different guitar tones and vocals into the mix like it's it's a pretty versatile album but does every track on this thing play out not really I think a lot of the songs on this thing actually fall flat on their face which is why again sort of underwhelmed by just how inconsistent this record is and again unfortunate because I think this record if pared down to its best tracks could have been one of fucked ups better releases so I don't know so such it such as life or I'm going to leave it at that that has been the latest edition of the why you know review

-n60eP_iDvw,ah what rang a knee I don't know what to do I feel like a dope I feel like I've lost uncle Emory of Hope Oh bars and now I'm upset I'm all in my feelings and I just don't know how I'm gonna be dealing tell them with all these emotions because I'm inside an ocean of emotion Oh fire fire fire flames and I wish to motion your honor for this case to be put on recess because I'm upset by the lack of progress okay you should step now it's getting cringe hi everyone depressed and I'm here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little yadi album nothing to prove you should know who rapper little yadi is at this point he's been one of the biggest things in entrapped music and soundcloud rap for the past couple of years since he burst onto the scene with one of the most promising mixtapes of 2016 I'm talking about his little boat tape a project that I caught a lot of flack for liking but I still get a lot of enjoyment out of it even today the goofy fun exuberant joyous personality of yadi on this tape is something to behold I love the bright shiny soaring sunny inspiring beats all over this thing certainly not a sound palette that a lot of yachties contemporaries hop on top of the lyrics generally on this thing we're sort of braggy but also showed a kind of vulnerable and emotional side to yachty to also so many ear worm choruses that I just cannot deny across this project as well I mean sure it's a flawed tape it's kind of messy it's kind of amateurish it sounds a little weird and awkward I get why a lot of people don't like it and don't take it seriously but I still had high hopes for yachty coming out of this project even if I didn't think my enjoyment of this thing was maybe a little bit of a fluke because there is a bit of an element of it's so bad it's good going on here and simultaneously yachty is still a young artist who knows if he's going to be all that consistent or stick to an idea a narrative a sound whatever so following this we had yadi summer songs to mixtape which was a total mess all over the place quality wise I mean the the fun upbeat happy-go-lucky goofball personality was still there it seemed like his heart was in the right place but a lot of the songs were just trash like he wasn't really trying didn't really put that much effort into the project but hey maybe he's just kind of doing some spring cleaning throwing a bunch of tracks out there just kind of keep fans held over until he drops something a bit bigger more ambitious and that's where his debut commercial album teenage emotions comes in easily one of the worst albums of that year it is clear that yadi had a big budget on this project had a lot of artistic freedom and just given those things this should have come out amazing but instead it features some of his worst songs some of his worst bars whenever I think of that cello line my brain wants to implode this record was like all of yachties worst artistic tendencies given the biggest platform and the biggest budget imaginable and he just stretched it out over a bloated tracklist to the point we're listening to the entire thing is just excruciating I pretty much enjoyed his following tape little boat - it was a record that I hoped would live up to the hype of the original little boat tape this project saw Gotti sensibly scaling things back from teenage emotions hopping on top of darker slightly grittier production wrapping a little bit more the little boat little yachty dichotomy had mostly melted away on this thing unfortunately though I still liked the instrumentals across this thing I thought a lot of yachties flows were pretty catchy I thought the hooks were pretty infectious and despite the mood shift on this project it felt like yachties free-spirited personality was still very much intact and then we have nothing to prove which really does live up to its title in that it feels like yadi literally has nothing to prove he is putting in as little effort as possible just delivering a bunch of diamond doesn't flows on top of some very skeletal and very strict backtrack beats not so stripped back in minimal to the point where it's strange or experimental or kind of a new vibe or sound just enough to the point where it's just really uneventful and bland but even though most of the beats on this thing are bass as hell really the biggest loss in the most upsetting thing about this record is that yadi sounds jaded even after just a few years in the spotlight and I'm not really sure if he's lost the passion for it or if there's just very little incentive for him to put any thought into these songs because his label or his audience aren't really expecting all that much from him either way that free spirit that goofball fun and unique attitude that yadi would bring to a feature a record an album and anything is just not here at all I mean there's one track where he does get a little lovey-dovey and slaps the auto-tune on and reaches into his upper register it's the song worth it which is actually one of the better tracks on the entire record even though some of the lyrics are kind of patronizing like oh girl I love you even if you don't get surgery I love you the way you are girl I mean it's mostly fine it sounds like it comes from the heart but still outside of that a lot of this project just kind of sounds like yadi trying to sound really hard and aggressive over some basic ass beats and look and trap music there's really no shortage of aggression at the moment and there are a lot of other artists doing it way better than yah Diaz it just seems like he's doing everything he can to blatantly avoid what exactly made him so unique and so special and so attractive when he initially broke onto the scene and sure there are tracks on here or maybe some of the lyrics are a little silly or a little dumbed down like on Riley from The Boondocks or on the Mac but still these tracks are really lacking in quotables they mostly feel off-the-cuff their courses are really awkward and I mostly just want to skip them when this record does dish out some decent moments it's mostly because the beat is good or the guest on the track steals the show whether it be get dripped with playboy cardio which mostly just sounds like a playboy cardi song with a yachty feature or the track Yacht Club featuring juice world where juice and yadi trade some melodic and fun bars and eventually hit a few verses toward the end of the track where they are going back and forth about getting a girl pregnant and then just like having a baby out of wedlock are really weird flex but okay the beyond we out of here is pretty hard but offset and cardi be on the track who want the smoke totally outshine yachty outside of a weird spot or in the back end of the track where he kind of reaches into his lower register it zones really voting and the last several tracks on this thing forever world with trippy red no Lea with Kevin gates fallen in love with gonna stony these are among some of the longest and most arduous and most long-winded tracks on the entire record incredibly uneventful there had been on the malware side yadi sounds even more uninspired than he did on a lot of the previous tracks which is upsetting to say because songs like stony and tracks like the little baby track on this thing see yachty taking a slightly more personal approach to the lyrics but even when he's rapping from a slightly more introspective or emotional standpoint his lyrics and his delivery comes off flat not just emotionally but sometimes when he's singing - like literally on a pitch level not that's anything new for yachty anyway but you know it was easier to overlook when his music was actually fun to listen to and not to say that yadi just needs to flip the fun switch and become a clown on record for me to enjoy it but I don't really find the tracks on this record to be that dark or emotional either it mostly just sounds like yachty trying to sound cool and trendy when really I think the path that made the most sense for him was to embrace what made him so unique to begin with and nothing2prove just sounds like the complete loss of that the complete loss of the little boat narrative so yeah I'm just not really sure where yachty goes from here but if yadi is going to put out a quality record ever again he needs a few things one you need songs the little boat tape had songs it had some great songs on it and even on teenage emotions even though a lot of the tracks on that record were a mess it sounded like you were trying to write some memorable songs some hits this record very clearly had either no or a very short writing process I'm not even sure if there was much forethought put into this record to the production needs to be more memorable more unique fit your actual personality something that people are gonna hear on other records 3 do not just pad your album at with super trendy features this is your record this is your artistic statement it's not a hip hop convention and for finally the most stunning and memorable thing about your record needs to be you you cannot be buried in the beats outshine by your guests you need to come out there with all guns blazing so that you leave an impact leaving an impression on the audience and again that's just not happening here because very little in terms of writing the choruses fall flat the beats are memorable and this is easily yachties most underwhelming performance yet while I have had my issues with a lot of yachty projects so far it hasn't been until now that I felt like he's not really trying and it's unfortunate because when yadi first came out I thought this guy is one of the more unique voices out here really excited to see where he's going but now it just seems like he's going with the current which if he continues on that path eventually he's gonna end up washed up ashore I'm feeling a decent - strong - on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you should check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana yadi nothing2prove forever 
oCYzQoqadRI,hi everyone can theny do tan oh here the Internet's loudest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little big album anti positive part 2 this is the newest mini album from Russian dance music outfit little big they have been added actively since 2013 and they are pretty well known at this point for their provocative satirical and over-the-top music videos many of which have racked up millions of views at this point and have become viral sensations across the eastern bloc and Europe and wildly group has gotten some attention over here in the States a lot of people have mostly written them off as like a Russian D Antwoord and I guess there's good reason for that their big premiere live performance was opening up for them they have a similarly goofy look and demeanor their whole aesthetic and popularity is heavily reliant and dependent on their music videos and they're not just simply a music group but kind of a multimedia endeavor but having said all that I do think there are some artistic qualities that clearly separate these two acts even though there are some surface level parallels their whole music style is much more specific to Eastern Europe and rave culture it's not a horrendous ten car pileup of all these international mainstream influences just smashing together in the trashiest way possible not to say little bigs music and music videos are tasteful though being trashy and looking trashy is kind of part of their aesthetic and it's not like there are no over Western influences in their songs either I mean they're certainly not beyond working some rattling trap high hats and rapping into their songs too and on their previous records the group has dropped songs that have been blatantly influenced by break be hardcore punk and dancehall and industrial rock and obviously house music I feel like little bigs whole sound is pretty much if you tried to produce eurodance music but for people with kind of a nihilist streak who had a very deep hatred for the world sure on the surface while you do have beats and choruses that are very sweet and very poppy a lot of the lyrics and visuals do cut pretty deep into some sexual taboos violence war and world politics and of course Russian culture as well whereas a lot of the lyrics and visuals of their south African counterparts have kind of devolved into extending the lure of the characters that Yolandi and ninja have respectively come up with which can be fun but it's something I don't really get all that much out of these days because the personality is they've developed over the years of gotten kind of stale and annoying for sure little big does have a lot of oddity and bombast and pomp but I think they actually take the edge off of that a little bit with some self-awareness some in-your-face and legitimately catchy choruses and a dark sense of humor now anti positive part two is the name of the group's latest endeavor over here and it comes out off the back of one of the group's biggest viral hits today and that is the song skippity a track that is a very bold blend of pop and house with some sexy versus some ridiculous courses that are laced with samples of dogs and cats and birds synched up with a series of lyrical onomatopoeias boom boom pop beauty Wow the track is catchy it's hilarious it's utterly absurd and the music video contains one of the worst viral dances I've ever seen in my entire life with the group pushing fans and viewers to also take part doing this ski BD challenge and honestly the whole thing seems like a very conscious parody of the the idea of the viral dance craze come out with a catchy song that basically means nothing it's so silly and it's so preposterous that it just earworms its way into your head and then come out with a dance that's so simple nearly anybody could do it but make sure it looks so ridiculous that nobody could really take it seriously and anyone who takes part is just kind of look a social experiment which this track very clearly is it's borderline genius and impeccably executed sadly the rest of the material on the EP isn't nearly as sharp or as impactful I mean I did love the opening track lyre which features a super zany beat these layered vocal calls of dog that's on the hook of course the verses by contrast are really sassy essentially dropping lyrics about military service and becoming cannon fodder for a rich oligarch class it's a short sweet banger with kind of a side of politics to it lee seong follow me featuring Tommy Cash is not as hard-hitting or as memorable as the group's previous collaboration with the Estonian rapper give me your money but the track still comes loaded with an undeniable house beat a bouncy synth bassline and a hook that comes straight out of the euro dance playbook which I think a lot of the ideas on this song do but little big does experiment with it enough to put their own spin on it it does feel like this is about the closest we're going to get to post rave or art rave or post euro dance in 2018 the record does take a slight nosedive after this point though there's a remix of the opening cut right in the middle of the album that doesn't really add that much variation to the LP and seems somewhat unnecessary it just puts a really unfortunate lull in the middle of a project that doesn't really have the room for a snoozer meanwhile real people hits pretty hard features some aggressive lyrics some traditional call-and-response vocals though it's not nearly as eccentric as some of the other tracks on here and the personality of little big continues to melt away on tracks like Mona me and little boy where the group is essentially delivering some really run-of-the-mill electro pop I mean one track does feature a refrain sung in French where the group are propositioning someone for raw but sex and the other I guess is a piano laced rap ballad that is legitimately a tribute to mom with the lyrics singing I'm your little boy and how you know you wouldn't be here if not for moms love and care and attention sure there's some elements of the track that seemed unnecessarily dark and tortured and morose and there's something oddly sexy I think about the vibe too but on the surface of it it still does feel like a full heart a tribute to one's mother overall I think this is a decent EP and it's one of two the group has released this year I think quality-wise the previous one they put out an T positive part one is a tad bit more consistent and if you like some of the material on this EP over here I would highly recommend that you go try that one out that and I would most definitely give a shot to their funeral rave album that dropped in 2015 which features some of their biggest and most creative tracts an album that in retrospect I wish I was aware of it at the time so I could have covered it but overall I'm just really liking the fun creative and nutty and again satirical personality and delivery of this group on the best tracks on this thing certainly reminding me of some of my favorite groups from the 90s and 2000's like Atari Teenage Riot and Rammstein and maybe just a touch of Mindless Self Indulgence - now even if a little big does continue to drop somewhat spotty projects I still do like their music videos and singles quite a bit and if that's where a majority of their focus continues to lie going forward so be it because honestly I do think in the current mainstream musical landscape they are a force that I like the presence of I just really enjoy their crude mockery of everything establish norms taboos good taste societal BS and hopefully they continue to do that and do it well on forthcoming projects I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best butch and i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan oh little big

0lapNx5xza8,hi everyone assassination attempt here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new open like Eagle ep what happens when I try to relax this is a new EP from one of the wittiest underground rappers operating today open mike eagle who has been killing it as of late with his last few records being some of his best so far especially his previous on mellow music brick bodykit still daydream one of his most emotionally potent projects so far where he goes back into his past into his childhood into his stomping grounds raps about where he grew up and even though this album is really good Mike's latest latest effort see him scaling back to a more independent hustle whether it be his demo cassette the dark dark purple tape or this new self released EP over here the reason I bring up the change of pace and how mike is releasing his music is because it's kind of an important part of his personality type he is a self-starter he's a doer he's a podcaster he is a hands-on creative which is something that might not necessarily come across right away when he is entertaining his followers with brainy rhymes and left-field beats but this new EP is not your typical open mike eagle release the production has a very glossy Sheen to it it's very glimmery it is very synthetic like open mike eagle is broadcasting his rhymes from a digital utopian future or maybe just from inside his head in which is located a cybernetic brain and I see where in mike eagles head on this release because this is easily one of his most personal and intimate and revealing projects so far has a good chunk of the bars on the CP deal directly with Mike's plans and concerns and aspirations is anxieties getting to his own core through song with his audience definitely seems to be a focus on the opening track relatable I'm not really that crazy about the wintery computerized beat but I do think it is a somewhat interesting contrast from open mike eagles over-the-top delivery and his fluid triplet flows and as the song title suggests the track is about relatability with Mike bringing up what he watches what he wears where he lives and it feels like he's bringing these things up because he feels like he's not being he feels invisible to a degree I don't know if this is as a result of some kind of performer complex or just generally feeling like somebody who is isolated or lonely either way it makes the track really bittersweet because there are these underlying implications of desperation but simultaneously some of the lyrical content about Mike's very average life talking about having a vegetable stuck in the garbage disposal and needing to call the professional it's really funny and honestly makes for one of his smartest tracks conceptually so far Mike's whole thought process through this song is also very fevered it's tense and I think truly gets to the heart of what the title of this EP is all the weird busy distracting existential thoughts that fly through Mike's brain whenever he's not on or he's not trying to actively entertain anyone and this is displayed by all of these dreamy easygoing soft and pretty synthesizers paired with very antsy and passionate rapping we also catch the same theme all over again on the track every single thing where Mike is essentially rapping about his audience or the listener understanding accepting I guess getting to the core of who and what he is pause me learned me 100% predict me get me 100% complete me eat me 100% defeat me delete me another attempt at least that's my read on the track also keep in mind that the hook of this song according to Open Mic Eagles Twitter was video game inspired given the repetition attempt failure trial tribulation there are also a lot of lyrics on the verses of this track dealing in racism and marginalization the track also features winning bars like the economy killed the rhyme star I'm privileged born with the silver timecard that as high as I held my heroes I put my chips on myself like Pete Rose the track is also paired with an enchanting chorus these chai me lead synth melodies that faintly rang out against a very deep ocean of bass as well as super atmospheric synth chords the song single ghosts is kind of a weird topical shift for the EP the track seems to feature this fictional exchange with a ghost asking why are they here do they drink there's a point where Mike's lyrics imply that there's like a bit of a romantic connection going on here between the ghosts and then there's a portion of the song where it seems like he's remembering back to a time when this person was alive as if he knew this person before the sound and vibe of this EP stays relatively eerie on the track southside eagle though lyrically the track is more focused on mike's attempts and efforts as a creative and an entertainer talking about checking last year's numbers seeing kendrick but not saying anything because this underground hustle that he has is adjacent also saying that with his music he's trying to reach black kids but in a room or with a room full of whites basically getting to the heart of this disconnect in intention or just reception in that he has his audience he wants to reach but then there's the audience he's actually reaching there were a few other tracks on this EP slash album it's it's a project open mike eagle isn't strictly calling it an EP it's it's it's a bunch of music on a thing there are a few songs on this bunch of music on a thing that I found a little underwhelming mostly because of the production there are moments where compositionally I think it's really fitting and pretty but the aesthetic the sound of the drums the sound of the sense how light and airy and Hollow a lot of the beats on this thing feel it doesn't really do all that much for me not the best set of instrumentals that I've heard Mike on so far though I do appreciate he does stick to a pretty clear instrumental style for this handful of songs I still like the EP quite a bit though I think it's an interesting mini chapter in the ongoing Mike Eagle saga considering the topics at hand it just feels like Mike is is barely scratching the surface with the handful of cuts that he's offered I think most of Mike's hardcore fans will get a lot out of this project the lyrics certainly put a lot of what I have known about him through his music into perspective though personally I prefer and would first recommend any number of his most recent releases over this to a newcomer to a new listener I'm feeling a light seven on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the

9Ibaafl2_-I,"hi everyone hath any head tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you doing well and it's time for a review of the new collaborative juice world and future project world on drugs this is a new collaborative album from two of trap music's biggest voices at the moment the king of codeine one of the biggest rap stars of this decade essentially a veteran at this point future Hendricks and emo wrap up in comer juice world while both are usually druggie auto crooners flowing their way through kind of trippy watery beats I'm surprised this crossover even exists on the surface it seems like a really odd pairing especially when you take into account futures flashy macho grit and juice worlds kind of nasally boyish voice and heart broken lyrics this record is 16 tracks 49 minutes so quite a few songs on here are on the brief side and what this album lacks in the substance that it obviously wasn't going to have it kind of makes up for in vibe this thing has vibe in spades it feels really good it's pretty wavy which i think is a testament to future in juice world working together effectively on this project as they consistently hit some pretty catchy flows over some pretty quality production while the percussion on these tracks is pretty much part of the course for most of the trap instrumentals you've heard over the past few years you have those snappy 808 drums and the rattling triplet high hats some of the instrumentation on top of the beats though is kind of sticky maybe a little unusual and sad whether it be the watery and plucky guitar leads on the track jet lag or the eerie and metallic clanging melodies cycling away on the track a red Bentley there are also some wailing sad and melty guitar leads on the track oxy there are also a few cuts on here that come off kind of ballad like their refreshingly melodic vocally and very harmonious and sir mentally whether that be the cut realer and realer or the closing song - generally what the songs on this album lack are any kind of lyrical or topical focus or even if they were just going to be general and just featured juice world and future verbally riffing for a few minutes at I'm at least dropped some bars that are worth remembering or are kind of funny or entertaining or gritty or something while having lyrical substance isn't exactly the mo of this breed of hip hop it certainly does prevent some of the best moments on this album from being appreciated beyond just a surface level as the lyrics on this album pretty much feature the usual suspects brand names money cars women drugs in theory this is not necessarily a bad thing as long as the writing is good or maybe future in juice world come together as a duo to create something that makes up for the lack of lyrical memorability here but it's just not the case because for every track on this thing that features are great instrumental good flows and a few quotables there's at least one other song that's generic as hell or another that's so comatose and skeletal that it's barely worth remembering like on the track 7 a.m. freestyle and the point of this song might be for juice world and future to sound barely alive but it doesn't really make for an entertaining track to your juice world and future push it to the point where they're like in a zombie-like state and they're rapping just has no fire and whatsoever then there's also the song no issue whose instrumental and flows are so skeletal and bare that the song sounds painfully awkward because I mean let's admit it future and juice world as much as they have some good ideas and some distinct vocal characteristics these guys need strong beats in order to make their songs work the song shorty is well very melodic very moody but strip back to the point where it just feels hollow like it could have developed a bit more instrumentally and sounded so much better again I'll say future in juice world they don't really converge on this EP to create something that they couldn't just have made separately the best I could say they do on the good tracks on this album is just complement each other effectively and prevent the album from going totally stale and completely tedious by just bouncing off of one another although that is a quality that this album losses on the handful of solo tracks on this record like on the future song afterlife which comes off like a filler cut from any number of his past records and these so short it's basically pointless make it back there are a few other future tracks on here that have guest features from little lane and Nicki Minaj the song oxy is essentially future taking the weird high-pitched raspy flow that became a huge meme off of J ROCs Kings dead and just basically turning that into an entire song and admittedly it does make it one of the most hilarious entertaining and quality tracks on this thing little Wayne's performance on this track is especially melodic definitely one of the more tuneful guest verses he's had in a while but hands down the worst track on this record is easily the title track where futures vocalizations are particularly bad the song also has the dumbest most obvious lyrics like I get that you guys make druggie music you make songs about drugs it makes sense it's your aesthetic it's your thing but I feel like this song is just being listeners over that with it to the point where it's obnoxious or that you think your listeners are so stupid that you need to make your intentions this obvious also easily the worst instrumental on the entire album with these horrid farty synthesizers cycling in a really busy nonsensical pattern for a good deal of the cut also totally awful vocal melodies being bounced back and forth between future and Guice world world uh-huh drugs all that being said though this record does have a good handful of highlights that I liked quite a bit I just wish they were larger in number the album starts off will be relatively strong jet lag and astronauts which features some of the most infectious flows and beats on the entire record there is an awesome momentum to both of these songs and future in juice world actually create a bit of chemistry some kinetic energy bouncing bars off of one another just quickly swapping back and forth I mean it's it's not the most lyrical track you're gonna hear this year but the flow and the energy between these two is electrifying then there's the amazingly catchy fine china which feels like a track that could have been off juice world's last full-length record goodbye and good riddance with a vocal melody where he kind of cries out in his upper register with a super infectious vocal melody and ridiculous lyrics show do you like $1,000 pay fine china tell her that she's beautiful every day I remind him but further down on this chorus he says that it's her body or no body I refuse to compromise so if she leaves imma kill at all she she died did I say that out loud I'm so crazy about mine I mean it's obvious he says those bars with a hint of self-awareness like he's just saying I'm just being crazy I'm just playing but simultaneously these these are like Insel bars these are some real insel bars this is a little bit creepy it is time to read the song realer and realer is an oddly beautiful cut on the album not only because of its gorgeously moody chorus but juice world and future also get a little introspective about their drug abuse about the excessive lives they lead also rapping about loved ones dying too and lyrically they match up a little bit at one point with juice world rapping about a Balenciaga jacket that has a lean stain so he's gonna give it away get rid of it give it to a friend and future has a Gucci shirt with a cum stain so he just throws it away the closing track hard work pays off is one of the sweetest and catchiest on the entire record honestly sounds like a hit I would potentially say it's like a song of the summer if it wasn't coming out in October the vocal melody the chord progression is so tried and true and familiar and and warm it feels like a loving blanket being wrapped around me by a cutie total cutie patootie love some of the bittersweet lyrics on the track too but honestly that kind of does offer highlights to me on this record the other tracks that I mentioned earlier were really some of the lowest points here and meanwhile the other cuts just falls somewhere in the middle like many of these other suddenly dropped collaborative albums from top name rappers this thing is very much a mixed bag it feels rushed it's not nearly as sharp as like a without warning or especially a kid see ghosts doesn't really feel all that collaborative a lot of the time well there are some good standouts here we're future and juice world do find some cool creative overlap for the most part just kind of seems like both guys riffing on some very dime-a-dozen trap beats with a supremely good flow hook or instrumental popping out here and there I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and don't cry hit the bail as well over here next to my head is another video you can

v5xXGsufPic,hey hey hey everyone anthony Fantan oh here glassed up hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track round where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week toss them all down there into the description box for you where you can check them out on your own and yeah let's get into it with no hesitation so so so so so we also down there have our Amazon and turntable lab associate links treat yourself to some colorful vinyl using that turntable lab associate link we get kicked back from it supports the segment and supports the channel a few other shout outs there is an amazing Kendrick Lamar AHA remix of the backseat freestyle and me and it's a pretty fantastic it's a very entertaining very very funny and there is a king Arthur remix of Janelle monáe's pink featuring Grimes it's pretty Dancy pretty funky and highly enjoyable all right where's track this week let's get into it the worst tracks this week tracks that were some of my least favorites this week starting off with the new song from Zane fingers kind of another somewhat interesting play on love in the digital age however despite the fact that I think this is one of Zane's more solid Tunes and lyrical topics in his discography so far his voice is still absolutely soulless boring and unnecessary his singing unfortunately since he has gone solo has just turned really bland and he just kind of sounds like a really washed out atmospheric alternative R&B singer still without much personality or flavor to what he is doing moving on from there there is a new vic mensa song titled empathy and this track essentially seems like a bit of a an explanation and a Mia culpa after the whole xxx 10th ASEAN BT freestyle dis thing where he's kind of fine found himself in a bit of drama and some hot water and a bunch of people calling him out as being a hypocrite and this track sort of seems like him trying to explain away his mindset and trying to point the finger a little bit at other stuff too it's just a totally just unreasoned mess and and that's really all I can say like it's really boring as a song his flow is pretty decent he delivers the song pretty passionately but still the logic behind the track and the reasoning behind the track is really shaky and obnoxious moving on from there this new collaborative cut for the new animated spider-man movie the track features sway Lee and post Malone and it sounds like both of them are kind of coming out with like a really dolled up piece of synth pop and it's a kind of horrid so I'm just gonna move on from there because you know a lot of these commissioned pop pieces for uh for major movie soundtracks are typically pretty awful and I guess this just kind of continues it continues down that road moving on from there Joji test drive I did a little track review of this song over on the second channel the Fantana channel long story short I think vocally and instrumentally it is one of the weaker singles from his newest album so far and all in all it just pretty much sounds like a post Malone ripoff like a really weak post Malone ripoff which is kind of unfortunate because I felt like with some of his other recent tracks he was kind of heading in a more original and memorable direction hopefully this song is a bit of an anomaly in that sense on the ballads one release but I guess we'll see and Jimi urine has a new record that has just dropped Jimi urine if you're unfamiliar with the guy was the or I suppose is I'm not exact and what the status of the band is though it's been a very long time since we've heard of some new music from them but still we're talking about Mindless Self Indulgence one of the weirdest and most tasteless bands of all time and now it's frontman has returned with a solo record that is an equally bad taste and he has a new single out with crimes and vocally instrumentally it's a mess it's horrid but you know that that's just kind of Jimi style to make music that is again it ends in such bad taste and while I'm talking about this album it also features two of the worst covers that I've heard in my entire life of what a fool believes and weathering Heights two very unlikely cover concepts for an album like this and an artist of Jimmy's caliber too but I give it to the guy he must have good taste for him to want to pick particularly on those two songs but I digress and finally cult leader have a new single out they have been teasing toward their latest record on Death Wish and cult leader has displayed themselves to not be your average metalcore act they're a bit more technical a bit more versatile a bit more adventurous and this new song over here certainly shows that although I'm not exactly sure if the territory they've wandered into is all that fantastic this new cut over here to oculus oculus Greek goddess being referenced there in the title is a cleanly sung very dreary downtrodden ballad that is super drawn-out super awkward I don't really think the vocals go over all that well I can appreciate the kind of dark and gaavai the band is going for but it just seems really off the mark in my opinion alright going into the tracks that I thought were mmmm not amazing not mind-blowing but not terrible either certainly worth your attention Thom Yorke is continuing to drop new tracks from his upcoming suspiro sound to Suspiria excuse me soundtrack and he is really just gonna spoil the whole record before hits out this new one is a pretty dreary ballot that eventually fizzles out I do like the vibe I do like some of the vocals although there's not really that strong of a structure to it moving on from there nina cherry new record out featuring production wall-to-wall from none other than four tet new song over here is natural skin deep she just dropped it as like an Adult Swim single - and yeah it's an OK track this song to me there are a lot of great things about it but I'm sort of mixed on it overall which is really what my feelings on the the new album in general are while I do like some of her vocal melodies and some of the lyrics on the record and for tetes production more often than not does steal the show but outside of that I feel like so many of her vocalizations across this album just seem really awkward it's it's kind of hard to describe I mean it's really expressive but there's something about the melodies that she's trying to sing the execution of them it's a little off you know just seems a little shaky I guess and it's it's sort of off-putting for me personally definitely not as sharp when it comes to vocal performances as some of the more legendary recording is that she has done in the past or the myriad of different artists on a myriad of different records moving on from there little peep has a new posthumous song out come over when you're sober part two is set to release later this year the new album has a teaser track here like I said posthumous cut cry alone is the name of the song did a track review for it on the Fantana channel make sure to check that out if you want my thoughts a little a little bit more in depth on this track but in a lot of ways this song is very much in pip in peeps excuse me typical vein but if anything really makes it fall short it's that the chorus and the verses on this thing just feel a little too similar leaving me to believe like maybe this could have been built out a little bit more or something I do like some of the dark isolated depressed lyrics on the track obviously you have some nods to drug abuse and addiction in the song you have some nods to his doubters and his detractors and the rich kids from school saying oh yeah if they could look at me now which is a kind of dark and chilling in bittersweet considering his passing and the instrumental and the the vocal melody on the track give us off a strong Nirvana like a strong grungy kind of vibe which I thought was a little more refreshing than some of the emo directions that he had gone in on some of his past material I wish that was just more to it you know honestly I just it was just wish it was more to it as is there are some cool things here but I don't know it just feels a little scant moving on from there kid kitten kitten kin the pop band kitten had a new track out it has titled oh my god not one of my favorite tracks from the band's so far honestly they have been dropping some buyer singles as of late this new cut over here it's got a big bright huge gigantic 80s pop new wavy type of sheen on it it's pretty fun aesthetically but I think the tune really is one of the weakest that they have done so far just wish the melodies were a bit sharper and that and that the hook seemed a bit more thought provoking or something it seems like a lot of the cut is kind of swallowed by the chorus too like there's too much of a focus on that one moment and there's really not much going on outside of that and again as I said the hook isn't even that mind-blowing so I do like the aesthetic as usual the van does bring high energy but I think on the writing side of things it's not one of their best cuts moving on from there J Mascis has a new solo record on the way Webb so dense even though J does have a very same evoke Allah livery and songwriting style every once in a while he does manage to jam out a pretty great and heart-wrenching ballad and this is certainly one of those instances again stylistically pretty predictable but the the song the song is there and if you're unfamiliar with dinosaur jr. J Mascis please do give this track a shot because J is J's a pretty solid and consistent singer-songwriter moving on from there Empress of new album out now one of the more promising up-and-coming independent pop singers making waves at the moment one song that is kind of grabbing attention right now as being recent released is I don't even smoke weed the vocals on the cut were a little nondescript but I still thought overall that the the instrumental was pretty fantastic a really solid and hard-hitting synth pop instrumental and shout out to Action Bronson who has a new track out Prince Charming maybe a new project on the way soon or something I thought some of the bars on this track were pretty sharp even if as a tune as a song it felt pretty under written all right let's get into the tracks they thought were the best this week was it really grabbed my attention blew me away surprised me I tracks that I enjoyed tracks that entertain me tracks that I felt positive toward um first the 1975 miraculously enjoying their latest single over here I think this is the first single from their latest LP here that I really loved it's not worth living if it's not with you a lovely little new wavy eighties pop tune with a gargantuan chorus some really feel good and passionate vocals on the verses that's really exuberant song with a powerful performance and some good quality production too given the previous single so far I know it's probably not going to be an album that I love it's most likely gonna be all over the place in terms of enjoyment but hey I can at least come down to this song over here and say this is catchy as hell and engorges moving on from there please forgive is the latest song from Powers pleasant an artist I wasn't really familiar with up until this point but this new collaborative version of this song features Denzel curry zombie juice Zilla Comi and idk kind of a badass posse cut here so give it a shot it's a trap banger with a lot of energy and a lot of decent talented lyricists back to back to back to back so it's not often you see guys of this caliber in the underground all converging onto one single track so don't miss out on it it's pretty great moving on from there this song over here gave me nightmares this is Nicole darling ganger song it's it's been a while since I've thought of her music she had a band camp album the while ago that was pretty dreamy and eerie but this is new single and music video of hers titled lemonade is a really odd track it's very washed out it's very atmospheric but simultaneously it's pretty gorgeous and the lyrics are very sexual and dark so despite the very atmospheric and kind of feminine demeanor of the song there's something incredibly sinister about it - that's worth taking into account moving on from there lil Sims UK rapper lil Sims has a new song out titled boss it is a very low fie and grimy lyrical banger loved the instrumental of her screamed and strained and passionate vocal performance on the hook and her bars are sharp as well so do give this track a shot it's really fun and Oh Julia Holt her new album on the way looking forward to this gigantic and probably gorgeous new release I feel like Julia her songwriting on this track and maybe it's just my first impression here once I hear it more that this may not in fact be the case but I feel like her songs are almost getting a little too swallowed up in a way by all the gorgeous instrumentation she surrounds herself with but that being said this was a wonderfully dizzyingly beautiful track and I'm looking forward to seeing how ambitious she's gonna get on this new full-length album because that's that's definitely the tone of the instrumental on this track for me it really sounds like she's getting a little bit more intimate on the vocal side not being washed out in as much reverb and getting kind of dense with some of the instrumentation and and nimble with some of the instrumental passages and compositions on this thing - so looking forward to this this album net just to kind of tell you guys the name of the track his words I heard moving on from their cheer drug church this band has been getting hyped up by a Stereogum and they have a record coming out via pure noise and this new song over here is just a really nasty fun I'll say exuberant and catchy bit of pop punk and shoegaze and noise rock it's really exciting tunes sonically but there's a really solid I guess just song behind all the noise and all the lighters of sound as well that are pretty cool but not from their babymetal starlight there has been a lot of press on babymetal for the past week or so and new single here obviously the track is easily one of the heaviest the band has dropped so far it's a little over produced it's a little overdone but still incredibly fun and certainly put a smile on my face and there's a really weird jammy super-heavy gentie like a little bit of instrumental bit toward the back end of the track but outside of that it is just just pomp it's just soaring female vocal harmonies it's just so frickin over-the-top you know while it's not maybe my favorite take on metal music I do understand why people hear babymetal and they say man the the Japanese they just do metal so much better they just do they just do it so much better I understand why some people say that just because it's a killer killer and exciting and and an electrifying tracks like these alright and finally I want to give a shout out to the band they have a record coming out via polyvinyl and dark dikko vests poochy third record this is going to be they are a pop punk outfit and this is a song over here freaking you out is easily one of the most fun rock songs that I've heard this month don't know if I could say much more about it than that than the playing the execution is really tight production is sweet but grimy the vocals have really captivating personality to them that is really amped really energetic and the tune and lyrics are really fun as well it's kind of uh it's got a lot of personality it's little tongue-in-cheek it's a little silly but uh but still pretty fantastic all right I think that has been it for our weekly track round up this week thank you very much for watching hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this episode I will catch you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup [Music] 
ORMZmOHPpWQ,[Music] hi everyone Slappy's Latino here the Internet's busiest music nerdy and it's time for a review of the new high on fire album electric Messiah California sludge and stoner metal outfit high on fire they are back eighth full-length album now even though it has been 3 years since the release of the band's last record luminiferous I did not anticipate to hear from high on fire so soon because it has been just earlier this year since Matt Pike was totally killing it on the brand-new sleep album the sciences the famed stoner metal outfit came back for a comeback record that was pretty excellent easily stoner metal album of the year with it's beefy riffs and meditative grooves some really wild guitar soloing and leads as well just really great to see a band of sleeps profile come back with a great record meanwhile though high on fire over here brand new record kind of hitting a point of predictability though despite what sounds like their best efforts to kind of change things up a little this second act of high on fire's career so far has been an interesting one after pretty much spending the entirety of the 2000s sounding like a heavy mucky smoke-filled version of Motorhead that preferred weed and cerebral grooves over speed and thrills the band cleaned up their sound a little bit for their 2010 release snakes for the divine a skinnier but admirable album that didn't quite have the heaviness and the girth of the Bands previous efforts which still helped clear the way for faster more dynamic and muscular records like diver Meese mysteries one of the most punishing sludge metal records of the decade maybe not as progressive or as flashy as like a Mastodon album is still pretty fantastic then following that we had the anthemic luminiferous where the band presented some of really their catchiest and most soulful and melodic material yet while again still maintaining that pretty heavy and sludgy sound and meanwhile electric Messiah sees the band going back into a speedier and more aggressive direction again but now on the production end it sounds like they're in a position to add a bit more clarity and depth and layers to everything here the tone and performance style doesn't sound too much unlike mysteries especially on the title track to this thing which really has as much Thunder and throttle as any song off of that record and as much as I do love this thing the mix is pretty grimy I could see it being improved with a bit more layers a bit more harmony a bit more body however electric Messiah is not just simply high on fire as usual which is kind of an issue I have on this album with tracks like the opener as well as the track freebooter the songs that really in the overall high on fire cannon sound really standard and occasionally on this record the standard is really just not enough the band wants to change things up they want to do something slightly different whether it be switching up their instrumental styles though always not to the benefit of this record like on the track the witch in the Christ which features some horribly tedious drumming have never really heard drumming this one-dimensional and boring on a high on fire record but here we are but the band also sees fit to embark on a few longer tracks on this record and not that the band have ever been shy about busting out these six or seven minutes sludge ragers which successfully managed to stay entertaining from beginning to end but now on this record we're getting a few tracks that are 9 minutes 10 minutes a few minutes difference between these songs and hi on fires usual song length doesn't sound like a big difference but what's odd about these cuts is that they're vaguely proggy sanctioned annihilation and steps of the ziggurat have multiple phases worked into them some build ups to a lot of compositional shifts but high on fire really fails to display the nuance and the dynamics to really kind of pull this grandeur larger more scaled style of songwriting off all of these really large and sludgy guitar passages get really tiresome after a while don't really create the epic feel I think the band is looking for another thing that's kind of head-scratching about these cuts is if they were as melodic or as dynamic as some of the softer or more subtle cuts off of luminiferous I could see what the band is doing here panning out but despite all the changes happening across these tracks the riffs the vocals they're not that catchy they come off a little one-dimensional and just overly long-winded there are some tracks on this record that offer a change of pace and some good songs and are a manageable length like the pallid mask which features some really fantastic slow slithering guitar chords which transition very nicely into some driving drums and heavy riffs certainly one of the most evil sounding songs on the entire record and Mack Pike's vocals are particularly angry gargled and strained on this song much more than on a lot of other tracks here the the vocal intensity of this track really sells it and with its triumphant guitar leads the closing track drowning dog is actually pretty good too the lead vocals strike me as being much more passionate than they are on a bulk of the record kind of took me back to luminiferous a little bit the drums punctuated the heavy riffs of the track really well and there's something about the pacing and the groove and the again the guitar riffs of the track that have a pretty cool heavy metal style and with matt Pike's lyrics on this track like the numbers cross the lines in the sand the pools of human rats their tails are twisted and tied eat of thy poison divine and goddamn you you're the shadows of men and goddamn you for it's kill or be killed in the end a little Iron Maiden esque I have to admit despite the slightly improved production quality and the couple of changes and risks that they took on a couple of songs that didn't really pan out this is very much a standard high on fire record a handful of cuts I really loved a few others that just were a little middle-of-the-road to me for them and a few that I think could have been greatly improved had the band taken a different approach to tearing and building and structuring these longer cuts still though I think it's a pretty solid record it does have its highlights it does have a great sound but I hope the band's next offering is better than what they brought here I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here

fdryZIr7Cp4,
pLjeA3MdYHA,hi everyone sleep in these snooze Tanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the collaborative Zilla commie and Sousa moolah project city morgue vol 1 hell or high water this is a new collab album from two of the meanest nastiest rappers out right now Zilla commie and so Smola who have been building a name for their little duo over the past 6 or 7 months with a handful of pretty hot singles off of WorldStarHipHop tracks like skate head and thirty-third black glass these heavy loud trap ragers that bring new meaning to the word banger the duo hits this level of extreme without necessarily going to experimental or jumping out of the rap genre entirely I mean Zilla commies vocals on this project sound more like something that would front an industrial metal band before a hip hop duo the evil instrumentals on this thing a lot of them are packed with these heavy grinding distorted new metal guitars it's almost like a new iteration of rap metal but the roots of this sound are coming more from the hip hop side than they are from the rock side and with the rise of trap we've seen a lot of aggressive shades of hip hop over the past couple of years not just Zilla commie and Sol semilla who have also collaborated on a three-track EP earlier this year but also 6-9 jpg mafia rico nasty ex ex extant aussi own horror and little gnar and scar Lord in this new hyper aggressive blend of trap the battle to be heard is getting louder and it's being fought with volume and Zillah and so's blow away much of their competition with the tracks I mentioned earlier on that front the beats and the vocals on this thing there turned up to 11 there turned up to 13 there turned up to 6 6 6 because this album is so edgy but I think in the process of going as hard as they possibly can across a good deal of this record I think Zilla and sews have lost sight of any lick of nuance this thing is 14 tracks it's 30 minutes a lot of the songs are about 2 minutes and change not a lot of room for fluff or error not a whole lot of room for changing it up either as it feels like these two are merely just trying to copy over the formula from their three biggest singles again and again and again and again until they fill out a whole record which I guess is not a bad starter a bad taster if you're a new fan and you just kind of want more of that hype sound that might have gotten you into the duo in the first place it certainly does establish a sound an idea a style but failing to provide even a little bit of quality and significant variation across this album does lead to a lot of one-dimensional muck and the only thing that really cuts through it is when Zilla and sews manage to bang out another super high-quality track with an incredibly memorable hook or one of the most extreme vocal performances on the entire record I mean there are some really infectious refrains off the singles that I mentioned earlier put a nail in the coffin lay them down for a minute put a nail in the cuff and lay em down for a minute and there are some deep cuts on here that hit equally as hard whether it be arson or PTSD or the track grave hop grave however there are a handful of cuts on this thing that seemed to ease up on the gas a little bit but it's not like there's so much of a vocal and instrumental or an emotional change of pace that they provide that much counterpoint from some of the more hard-hitting tracks on this thing they just seem like slightly less abrasive tracks with flatter hooks that really pale in comparison to the more explosive cuts on this record talking about tracks like nuka-cola and Lamborghini getaway law which has easily one of the clunkiest and most long-winded choruses on this entire record there are a few tracks on this thing that I think suffer from severe missteps as well like be cut Ken Park which has this really weird feature on the back end from black Kray he sounds half-asleep on this song he barely sticks out of the instrumental and the song so what which features this Zilla verse on the back end that is so distorted and fuzzed out and swallowed into the instrumental sounds like a total mess it's barely even legible his flow comes off really sloppy as well generally though the flows on this album are pretty catchy however on the lyrical front I'm not gonna say the bars on this thing or garbage but they're super general the level of violence and sex and drugs that Dylan sews put forward on this project is it really that much deeper than what you might catch on a number of different trap albums so topically it's kind of run-of-the-mill and in terms of word choice and style it's not really that refreshing either occasionally one of these guys hits a really over-the-top simile or reference like so talking about how he's Bob the Builder but with a big tool that was pretty funny but given the tone of the music and just the overall sound of this thing I would have figured the lyrics would be a bit darker stranger more tortured more disturbed but that just doesn't end up being the case overall I like this project I think there are a lot of good standouts on it occasionally so sins illa can really drop the fantastic chorus they hop on some extreme over-the-top mind-blowing production that sounds metal or punked out as hell the whole thing is really aggressive it's in your face it's blowing rocket launchers out of your car windows while driving off of a cliff to your death but as hard as the duo goes on this album there's not a lot of substance here not a lot of versatility here there's very little in terms of long game because by the halfway point of this album you've pretty much heard everything the duo has to offer aside from their three best singles which they see fit to put at the very end but you know what I'm saying so while I do love a lot of tracks on this record I like its style I like its aesthetic I just wish there was a little bit more to it it's a lot of bark but not a whole lot of really anything else I'm feeling a light two decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

x28E4mYBdwI,mm hi everyone lovebug here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new quavo album quavo honcho hey you know it's it's not me that's definitely you it's quavo that's it's quavo what's a quaver he's amigo okay listen here amigo that's you that's definitely you this is the newest album from one third of the hot Lanta hip hop trio migos ever since migos exploded into the mainstream fans and critics alike have been going back and forth talking about what is their favorite member of the group and which one might have the most solo viability if they break off from the trio and we've gotten whiffs of that up until this point with each respective member doing a variety of features we have take-offs intruder single offsets collaborative record with 21 savage without warning quavo actually had a recent collaborative record drop with Travis Scott as well but no member of the meego so far has shown themselves to have the wherewithal to carry an entire project on their own or had even taken the risk to show if that was possible until now quavo typically the member that sticks out in me goes various recordings because he has the highest vocal register in a somewhat goofy voice and he's not only decided to drop a solo album but a 66 minute solo album which considering Cuevas lyrics typically his artistic track record and migos recent output it's not that exciting of a prospect I don't really think it's out of line going into this album to assume that quavo doesn't really have it in him to dominate and entire hours worth the material and have it be fire from front to back but surprisingly quavo kind of holds his own across the length of this record it's not nearly as bad as I thought it might be going into it he doesn't exactly reinvent himself or take any huge risks or anything but he does show that his due tendency on takeoff an offset maybe doesn't run that deep because he seems entirely capable of drumming up the catchy flows and weird animated ad-libs that you typically catch an amigo song entirely on his own not that it was ever rocket science or anything but I think a lot of music fans and critics assumed that there was some kind of secret sauce or special recipe to what the migos did that couldn't just be recreated by one man and it turns out you pretty much can with the project actually sounding slightly more tolerable than me ghosts recent album culture - which by comparison with quavo honcho was overloaded with way more tracks and safer a few catchy tracks that broke out his hit singles the album mostly felt like the trio just resting on their laurels going through a wash rinse repeat cycle until they hit almost two hours of material on quavo honcho though it seems like there's maybe more of a focus to keep the record at a reasonable length he can't just rely on the other two amigos to just pad these songs out and kill time and Cree filler as a result of that it seems like he works a bit harder to pick a greater variety of beats and a lot of features to kind of break up the monotony of this project - it feels a bit less like he's throwing as much shit as you can at the wallop just to see what sticks the best think wave oh and this album have going for it is that there are a number of tracks that drum up a pretty good vibe bring some quality production and some pretty cool features on his feature 21 savage hits one of the most aggressive deliveries and fastest flows that I've ever heard him drop on a track also that Yee slides line was pretty funny he pretty much makes the whole song because for the most part Cuevas lyrical contributions to this track are boring and borderline trash especially when he just devolves into skirts [Music] I'm sure there were a few people out there thinking quavo he wouldn't just half-ass his own album he wouldn't just half-ass his own debut but you got the Drake feature on this thing is pretty cold-blooded obviously takeoff and offset when they appear on this record it's a pretty natural fit cardi B is pretty slick but really the stunner on the traction yeah Ron Cey is actually a Madonna yeah Madonna's is literally on this album singing in this very squeaky high-pitched nasally voice that is a kind of weird and mystical it's kind of sweet she's like a weird sexy female robot on this track the groovy glamorous beat on this song is quite nice too quavo also goes toe to toe with Travis Scott on a cut on here with both of them just soaring with reverb and auto-tune on their vocals through a spacey trap B and quavo even goes a little personal dark and introspective on the closing cut over here with Kid Cudi the worst feature easily on this thing is little baby on the song lose it once again he sounds like a boring comatose generic brand young thug like imagine young thuggish fruity pebbles and little baby is whatever the store brand is but even though the feature on this track stinks it's really the song being one of the weakest on the entire record that makes it unlistenable the second worst song though easily has to be the track swing which sees quavo trying to make some really bad gentrified westernized dancehall overall the guests on this album do a lot to make this thing palatable many of them outshine quavo and they give him the ability to kind of change up the style and the mood of the album without having to carry a lot of that weight on his own because by himself he's really not that versatile because when he's totally on his own with these tracks he kind of falls into a pattern of just making really boring MeeGo songs by himself the song lamb talk is a relatively big single going into this album but with its skeletal trap beat and its triplet flows it pretty much sounds like your run-of-the-mill migos track without the other two amigos it's kind of like a bad and boozy part too on the song working me quavo doesn't even sound enthusiastic to be on his own album even with the titillating topic of the track and on the song shine for some reason he is desperately ripping off playboy cardi's whole shtick his whole style then there's the painfully awkward big bro which just sounds like a bad Travis Scott song and what's even stranger is the concept of the track quavo essentially taking this inexperienced kid under his wing because he's an OG now though I don't know who in their right mind would take life advice from this guy as the information he passes on is pretty basic he also kicks the song off with these weird bars that seem very specifically in reference to little peeps death which a lot of fans took as a diss but considering the cautionary tone of the song maybe it's just him trying to impart some again advice on to this fictional kid under his wing that he's talking about the whole structure of the track is a total mess - there's a point where the kid tells him oh they got my chain they got me for my chain and then he's like okay alright I'll help you but then he doesn't actually help him he just kind of continues and goes on with the song so that whole weird storyline just ends up being a diversion and doesn't go anywhere and that's the thing there's not really much here in terms of strong topical tracks and even when quavo does drop one it's not really getting to the heart of anything not really all that focused fuck twelve I think is another example of that which does have some direct references to police and racism and being black in America but ultimately the commentary is just so surface level that doesn't add up to anything there are a few solo standouts on the album like the song biggest alley-oop which I think is mostly great for its haunting love vocals sampled and the beat on top of it quavo does get a little introspective and personal in terms of how he artistically and personally formed into the artists that you see before you making this solo album there's also the track honcho dreams arguably the most focused concept track on the entire record which is essentially a lyrical response to nicki minaj's barbie dreams where quavo essentially talks about them having a secret relationship and pulling on her weave and pipe in it the song is kind of playful but it also comes off kind of crass like if they did in fact have this relationship that he's rapping about that he's really bitter about the whole thing breaking up and oddly enough the song go all the way on the album is one that I found to be so bad it was actually kind of good it's like this really bad club song with these robot manipulations on Cuevas vocals as he's rapping no get the call and response vocals on the hook are horrendously amazing you know what of Cuevas few advantages is just how weird and expressive and animated his voices and it was kind of shocking to hear that he doesn't really use that to the degree that he could have on this new album which I think resulted in a lot of these songs just feeling really drab and boring yeah you know the record really isn't all that good and I think maybe I like it a little bit more than culture too but I think that's only because this record wasn't so long I wanted to die because track for track I think quavo honcho has just a bad as many highlights as that record did just less filler and less crap but only by virtue of just having less songs overall and I did really like the variety of the production and guests on this thing you know most of the stuff that I liked about this record doesn't really have much directly to do with quavo which I think really says a lot about the quality of this album I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana quavo honcho forever 
mFXDzNcsUcg,hmm hi everyone sweatband here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Clarence clarity album think piece this is the newest full-length album from singer/songwriter super producer Clarence clarity a London native who blew my mind several years ago with the release of his debut full-length album no now I listen to a bunch of various debut albums throughout the year just to check out what's new what's interesting and rarely does a first album put me in a position where it's like I'm hitting the emergency brake I'm hitting the emergency escape pod I'm hitting the the fire alarm for good measure because know now is not only a really impressive first record but also a very inventive and mind-bending take on modern pop music and R&B especially pop and R&B from the 2000s this thing is experimental it's futuristic it sounds like he's taking ideas from Britney Spears Christina Aguilera Justin Timberlake the boy band era of that decade glitching them out warping them layering them maximally I meanwhile know now is not a concept album it is such a goddamn statement I cannot really think of any other albums this decade that sound like it it's special and clearance clarity is special but this album is also a lot to take in but no now slowly gained a bit of a cult following online also the production Clarence has done for pop singer Reena saw young over the past few years has certainly turned a lot of heads toward him too and since the release of know now he's been randomly dropping singles here and there for this new album tracks like naysayer Godslayer fold 'm vapid feels and more most of all these tracks end up on this new album some of the cuts clarence has seen fit to release before this record came out over a year ago though so I feel like my listening to this new album is almost like me recontextualizing these tracks I've been familiar with for a while fitting them into this record and just trying to get a clearer picture of who exactly Clarence clarity is an artist now that I have another record to dive into because with a debut album as long and as experimental and as versatile as know now there's no telling where any of this could go next and after multiple lessons of think piece there are several things I can definitively say about this record one it's not a huge stylistic change of pace from know now so if you were looking forward to seeing Clarence kind of stick to his guns whatever those weird-ass guns are then you should be happy unthink piece Clarence is still sounding pretty poppy odd kind of futuristic but also kind of nostalgic this is also a much shorter and a much more accessible album to I wouldn't call a 39 minute album short or scant or anything but I don't know there's just something about this album that feels so much more like a breeze or a walk in the park in comparison with the very dense and massive no now especially since I think a lot of the tracks on this album are easier to take in easier to make heads or tails of and I think that has a lot to do with Clarence actively reeling the instrumentation in a bit on this album the layering is not nearly as insane which yes I did really enjoy about the last album but simultaneously it was probably turning a lot of potential listeners off so while maybe the overall sound of think piece isn't as overwhelming and here gasma k-- some of the tracks i think are a bit catch here for the change and it's interesting to hear Clarence actively make this adjustment on think piece because prior he was an artist who was just doing too much trying to do everything in the world and now he's just toning it down a little bit to achieve some more accessible results which for the most part are still pretty creative and off-the-wall because even in this toned-down State Clarence is still a pretty unique voice in pop music with his quivering vocal harmonies and funky alien instrumental palates also loads of psychedelic effects and edits weird sonic and instrumental transitions between songs within songs which are not exploited to the degree that they were on know now but they're still here the highlights on this album for me kick off with the track we change which sounds like a fusion between a futuristic pop banger about love and the opening music to a halloween-themed kids cartoon Clarence incorporates all these freaky kind of frightening synth patches monstrous pitched vocal harmonies and a post hook instrumental passage with these heavy dark synth bass notes bump really giving me goosebumps literally it sounds like something out of the show goosebumps the song at the chord this track is still pretty sad as it seems to be Clarence reflecting on a love that is is doomed to fail because while he might be interested in this person or she might be interested in him her mind or he could change and then the love would be over and it's like the fear of that is being translated into this spooky weird instrumental style that is still pretty colorful and off-the-wall as I said earlier the song naysayer arrives back on this record I loved it when it came out still think it's great now once again on this song Clarence is straddling both the future in the past and this one instrumental with more beautiful quivering strange vocal leads and harmonies and a killer groove that sounds like the 80s but it's loaded with things that that never could have existed in the 80s it's like nothing but neon pinks and headbands hairspray and sweat and tight workout gear but it's all happening on the Deep Web now Clarence has kind of altered this track in its current form on the album and that he's transitioned it into another song magic obey now it's not just one track it's a two-part song this portion of the track features some soaring synth solos an undeniable bassline I love the glitchy transition in between these two moments - clarence keeps throwing it back to the 80s on this record with vapid feels ain't vapid attractive features a fun fast rigid robotic but funky bass line and i love how these moments on the song melts into these beautiful drippy syrupy choruses there's kind of a change of narrative on these songs next which reads like a statement of Clarence's creative intent fed through a narrative lens of love as he is singing about not just being the next big thing or the next best thing but the best thing and I think he could in fact be if he keeps busting out infectiously catchy tracks like these I also love how the song ends with Clarence singing about how if he can't be the best then he'll be dead but he cuts the word dead off and mid word the song is over now unfortunately I think this record kind of trails off past the halfway point I don't hate the track fold them with schastye but I feel like this song was a somewhat awkward but admirable first overt attempt at trying to incorporate hip-hop into his usual style and not only have I not warmed up to the song all that much but the track feels kind of out of place amongst all these songs that are super poppy take on somewhat of an aged throwback vibe the over-the-top rapping doesn't make its inclusion into the album go over any smoother and this is another song that suddenly has become a two-parter on the record too although its second half is I don't know just a mere ambient ish outro that doesn't really stick out to me as a highlight on the record if Clarence wanted to pop a track like this into the record where he is doing more of a hip hop thing I don't know why it wouldn't be rafters which was a single he came out with recently featuring a j.crew and again track produced and Clarence's usual style a bit smoother a bit poppier and obviously a hip-hop edge to it kind of seems like it would have been a lot more harmonious on this new album on top of that there are some mellower spots on the second half here that don't really hit quite as hard not just because they're more subtle but because maybe the ballad the melody the songwriting isn't quite as captivating namely the closing track 2016 which seems more like a motif than anything though I do appreciate what I think Clarence is trying to do on this song in making a statement on just how awful of a year 2016 panned out to be and the effects its continuing to have on the world at large singing over and over on the track in time we'll learn but yeah I thought Law of fives was an okay ballad meanwhile true love is so easygoing and and incredibly lacking in anything all that quirky or eccentric about it it just feels like Clarence is emulating some really bland pop music rather than experimenting with it overall I thought think peace was a pretty good listen it feels almost like a simplified abridged version of no now slightly plainer slightly more straightforward but also in my opinion slightly less interesting however among fans it does seem to be pretty well received as it should be because there are a lot of good tracks on here and with many of the songs on this album being pretty digestible in their delivery I think this record might have a greater chance of carrying over to some new fans even if I don't find it to be as satisfying and bold but honestly I think my issues with the record could have been easily overcome with some stronger more powerful ballads and shows of instrumentation in the second-leg because while I'm not super crazy about the change of pace that Clarence brought on this record I think it's biggest issue is that it does not end as strong as it starts I'm feeling a light to decent seven on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to

our Amazon and turntable lab associate links especially that turntable lab one get yourself a record get yourself a turntable get yourself some audiophile gear we get kicked back from it supports the segment supports the channels all right the worst tracks of the week let's do it first off this brand new single for the venom soundtrack from run the jewels let's go the Royal we thought it was painfully boring its underwhelming me even more than it did when I originally did a little side review a little side track review for it on the side channel the Fantana channel just really mucky instrumental LP doesn't even sound like he wants to be there and I don't know just all around not really that great or groomed of a song but it is just some kind of one-off single track off of a blockbuster film soundtrack they probably got paid a ton of money for it and didn't need to put in that much effort into it so you know but whatever that's it's not the end of the world and it certainly probably will not be a reflective of the duo's quality going forward moving on from their new bad bunny song mia featuring drake but it is on Drake's ovo label and Drake essentially here trying to capitalize on the rising popularity of reggaeton and Latin pop and it's funny even though this is not another one of Drake's horrible dancehall numbers the instrumental palette of this song is like the same boring drab gentrified like totally flavorless instrumental palette that that you get out of those same songs except now he's doing more of a Latin flavor and yeah it's it's kind of a trash song I've never really been a big fan of bad bunny up until this point like I thought his features were okay but he sounds particularly tone-deaf on this track I don't know what it is about his vocal inflections but they just sound like really off and awkward and Drake does his thing in espanol on this track so if you ever wanted to hear Drake sound awkward in another language I guess you have your opportunity to do so here moving on from there little dragon have come through with a brand new single and easily one of my least favorite tracks they've ever released in years the name of this one is lover chanting you know while I don't mind Naga knows lead vocals on the track and the instrumental is okay but the incessant refrain the place throughout this track is really obnoxious and to me just felt like it was really a below the band just kind of felt like they were writing under under under their weight I guess and the final track in this section is from Cass McCombs who in a weird way is getting political on this new song this track titled noise suite for the Green Party I can't imagine this track is going to make anybody a convert it's kind of a mess and I didn't really quite get much out of it it just felt like a really boring sound collage alright the tracks I was mad didn't blow me away but I thought they were worth mentioning one another track from the Thom Yorke Suspiria sound track he has been dropping track after track after track from the soundtrack and this one is not as tuneful or as cleanly organized as the last single was this new one titled Volk is a bit more of an abstract sound piece it did have some really interesting moments though do you give it a shot do give it a shot zzs isn't the sudden new song from kodak black featuring Travis Scott and offset this is the infamous little like mini a chair clipped meme video song that has been making the rounds on the internet for the past week or so where Travis and Kodak and you know the whole crew they're all in the studio you know these nice little sunny like steel drum melodies playing in the track and it's actually kind of a fun song I like the instrumental Kodak black doesn't sound bad I've actually enjoyed how he's been sounding as of late on his singles and on his features like he sounds a bit more lively and doesn't sound as sloppy you know he sounds like a little bit more kept together and on tempo though you know still his his very distinct unique drawl is there and his weird kind of creaky melodic flows they definitely feel like a bit more focused so I'm definitely liking that I'm definitely diggin that but honestly in my opinion it's it's really Travis Scott who I think ruins this track is his vocals are just way too overpowering on this song and I think while the lyrics are not all that deep on the song generally I feel like he really wasn't trying on the lyrical front of of this track and just sounded kind of goofy really next health and perturbator team up for a new single if you guys remember the last health single was also a collaborative one it seems like maybe this new record they're gonna be doing it maybe maybe a lot of collabs I don't know this new one over here didn't turn out too bad just kind of sounded like they were doing a bit of a weird experimental shoegaze e darkwave thing obviously with perturbator in the mix on this one but I didn't really care for how buried the vocals were and the mix all that much although that's typically Health's mo but it's consistently been one of one of my least favorite things about their sound and about their style but still it's not a bad cut moving on from there Fiddler's have a new record and new record on the way new song out and the title of this new one over here is can't you see kind of a middling little rock psyche Rock Garage psych I guess ballad from the band that's not too bad and definitely not as wild or as bold as the past couple of tracks they've been teasing toward this this release with buchen gays have come out with a kind of cynthy ballad from their newest project titled Derby and it's not too bad definitely more tuneful and engaging than I think the last single they dropped and let's get into the tracks I thought were the best ones of this week also simultaneously I do want to give a quick shout out to the new yung lean single like me featuring little dude Nast nasty little banger nasty little banger although kind of short not a whole lot of substance to it but it is a decent banger and it is cool to hear lean drop tracks that have a bit more teeth to them first of the best tracks this week Willie Nelson vote him out coming through with a little political track it's kind of gener'l ideologically though even though willie has come out to support better or ork so you know if you are in the Texas area and do plan on voting in the midterms which I highly recommend that you do you should probably vote out smarmy ass Ted Cruz because he's a pile of garbage but even though he did step out for bado he kind of put out this general vote amount song it's a cutesy little country tune about half you don't like people in office boom out remember it's cute it's nice it's fun I like it a lot moving on from there we xur brand new single that I praised quite a bit on the Fantana channel when I did a track review earlier last week this cut is from the band's forthcoming black album and can't knock the hustle is the title of the song feels like a bit of one of those a 90s throwback swear it was a menagerie of different genres coming together some rock music some pop music soul and hip-hop coming out of some of the beats in the production style and in some of reverse most meta lyrics in a while too in terms of Weezer their trajectory their success his songwriting process Fame attention selling out staying true to yourself artistically but wanting to make a career in the industry it's an interesting little track maybe I enjoy because I'm deep into the Weezer meta and a lot of the sounds off this track are nostalgic to me but I still like it I dug it I want to give a shout out to a band with a track out that has been around for a while it's it's not a brand brand new track but it's brand new to me and I thought it was really great it's from a Swedish group by the name of Viagra boys and they have a noisy weird little experimental post-punk er rocky noise rocky new album out that dropped not too long ago and this song over here that I love to point your attention to is called sports it is hilarious as hell it's one of these weird stripped-down abstract kind of groovy and wordy noise Garage tracks that are very tongue-in-cheek and sort of ironic it's very fun it's got a weird personality to it Sports cigarettes you'll get a kick out of it I'm sure and the music video is hilarious as hell so can't say enough nice things about it excuse me this track comes from a rapper who I'm just becoming conscious of who goes by the name of quadri 104 p.m. is the title of this new song and it's kind of like a weird fusion between abstract hip-hop and like some indie rock style guitar sampling it's very tuneful it's very moody it's kind of personal and beautiful and I like quite a bit also wanna shout out this new cater not a produce song from Mick Jenkins seems like Mick is really kind of getting back on his thoughtful lyrics his more Stern vocal deliveries his tight flows I thought his last record kind of saw him floundering stylistically and I really kind of saw him drifting away from what made him appealing in the first place and it seems like he's really getting back to what made him great to begin with on some of these new tracks over here so I'm kind of digging that little gnar has a new project out that is not too long it's kind of got a more aggressive streak to it and then a mellower streak to it to kind of I guess do a little bit of something for everybody it's not a bad little project but there is one song on it that stuck out to me that I would love to point you guys to it's titled man down and features Zilla commie who you guys know have a hoo hoo you guys know I'm sure some of you has a new collaborative project out this week that I'm hoping to cover at some point soon but this inner song over here is is kind of part of the course for a lot of these track bangers that are coming out these days where you get these heavy like industrial metal new metal like extreme metal guitar samples placed throughout the track and it just makes it sound super fucking gross and gnarly and heavy and badass and disgusting and like in a lot liking it a lot you know it's definitely heavy it's definitely in your face there's a huge energy to it and I'll just I'll just leave it at that it's a fun track it's a heavy guitar driven banger and finally I think this last track Cloud Nothings so right so clean I think this is the first first or second track off of this forthcoming record that really kind of blew me away yeah there was one other song off this record that kind of a grungy shoegaze e tone to it this one however is a bit more of a stripped-down ballad but it's got a great vocal melody to a good chord progression too and I'm definitely looking forward to it which is great for me considering how underwhelmed I was by the muddy production off of the band's last LP this new set of tracks definitely sound like they have a better sound going on and I will leave it at that all right this has been the weekly track roundup for this week everybody hopefully you got a lot of a lot of good recommendations out of this video hope everyone is doing okay and I will catch you in the next one remember all of the songs that I talked about her legs below along with the good people over at the ridge wallet support them support the segments and your the year of the year to you the other you're the best anthony Fantana weekly track roundup

Sh1JemfxBkc,Sippi hi everyone sweet that Amy Danno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new horrendous album idol this is the fourth full-length album from American death metal band horrendous making their season of miss debut maybe you haven't heard of these guys before but they have been together as a group for 10 years now so they are nothing entirely new their past three albums were released right under my nose this ass-kicking band existed the whole time and I didn't even know and while horrendous fits pretty squarely into the death metal genre they're pretty versatile group with previous albums taking on more of a heavy metal or a thrash metal style melodic death metal is also a sound they've dabbled in here and there meanwhile their debut is actually a very mean potato's death metal album from the buzz saw guitars to the guttural growl vocals I mean pretty much a standard death metal album in comparison with their newest LP they sound like a totally transform band yes still a death metal band but if you told me the these two albums were made by the same group just based off of a blind taste test I'd have a hard time believing you so horrendous has undergone quite an evolution since their debut LP to the point we're comparing the sound of their earlier albums to now is almost apples and oranges though going back into their discography each horrendous album up until this point is pretty good in its own right however idle in my opinion is a serious achievement for the band a band that sounds like their skills and their creativity are improving greatly with each new record and it's kind of ironic that this album sees the band diving deeply into a more technical death metal sound which usually is not my cup of tea a sub-genre of death metal I am very picky with because if it's too clean it's too predictable it feels too robotic and perfectly produced it's an instant turnoff it's a no from me dog though this decade so far has not been without some great tech death releases from Gore guts or Dying Fetus also beyond and the first artificial brain album I'm into a little obscura and ulcery but I can only really take so much of their material at a time but this new horrendous album quickly became one of my favorite tech death releases of the decade and it's so fun it's so quick it's so thrilling to listen to there's a lot of tight and flashy playing all over this record with a nice human touch aggressive performances the guitars are played like these guys are freaking animals the drums just get beat to death on this record - and the guitar passages while technical in spirit are also really catchy lots of dark sticky melodies coming out of these guitars also tons of fretless bass with a tone that really pops out in the mix it's rare that you hear bass standing out in this particular genre of death metal or really in death metal at all which I guess is a big similarity between this record and some of the other tech death albums I mentioned earlier the Gorgas record has some pretty strong bass lines on it beyond creation is also known for their use of fretless bass but I think horrendous is application of it as well is pretty sharp and creative a lot of the tracks on this album are multifaceted intricately written great flow from segment to segment to segment and some animalistic vocals great vocals on this thing not the typical guttural growls that you'll catch on a lot of death metal albums or horrendous first album I liken the singing or the screaming on this album to be more like that of I don't know a strained angry werewolf or like the vocals on a weakling album let's say if you've heard the band weakling before if you have it please listen to weakling although it also depends on the track you're listening to as well because occasionally the band does work in some campy clean vocals to live in a track up or add some variety add some harmony like on the closing track or on divine anhedonia which also comes complete with these creepy Vincent Price s spoken word vocal passages which are kind of weird I love them though they certainly send shivers up my spine also some very eerie clean vocal harmonies on soothsay ya that I think are pretty great too even though some of the clean vocals on the second the song devotion I found to be pretty awkward I think a lot of the smoother singing on this record adds a lot of flavor to the album another thing to know is this album is 40 minutes long and 8 tracks in length so it's pretty straightforward pretty punchy not a death metal album with a whole lot of room for error and the band certainly seems aware of that as this is a very no b.s release with very little in terms of flab on it there is a dramatic little intro cut on the album a short instrumental threnody just before the last cut of the album so essentially there are six core songs on this record that rip from front to back each of which seems meticulously assembled as the band just doesn't really put a single lull anywhere into any of these songs it's so goddamn watertight it's relentless mayhem and when I say that I don't mean it just sounds like the band is just endlessly beating the crap out of their instruments because there are certainly a method to the madness because there seems to be a lot of forethought going into every riff every note every drumbeat every transition they're not just letting it rip on a jam they are playing through very aggressively and very fluidly these intricate little tech death ragers the idolater for example kicks off with a very nice open space II ominous intro some sparkly guitar arpeggio shimmer very nicely against some expressive bass soloing then the band explodes into the main theme riff with some really expressive drums they hit this groove at full speed in the main section of the song where they kind of bring out like a thrash metal flavor for a second later some really interesting chord phrasings as well as mathematical guitar leads also love the way the track fills out with these harmonious background vocals again this is one of many tracks on the album that works in multiple phases but each phase really keeps the momentum high as for track after track after track the band hits great grooves they build up fantastic tension they break out into these surprise passages that either slow things down or present a new idea entirely I mean some of my biggest gripes with the tracks this album is that I I wish they were longer like the track divine hand adonia that I mentioned earlier the the cut is five minutes and there is so much packed into it it feels almost half that length and again I just love how the band can throw so much into a song throw three songs worth of ideas into one song and yet it all sticks out it's all processing really cleanly it's not like just a bunch of random crap to disorient the listener to make them feel like they're hearing something really interesting the song devotion is another highlight on this album for me though nearly every track on here is it kicks off with one of the most badass throttling riffs of the entire record it's one of the few moments on this album that not only reminds me of some of the other tech death bands I mentioned earlier but also the technical thrash outfit vector which bully me that is not a bad comparison to get that is not bad company to keep the closing track also a highlight is an eight-minute monster in the band really does save the best for last and while eight minutes is not the longest metal song in the world that they pack so much into this song that it becomes an explosion of color yeah I'm just so highly impressed with this album I'm just loving it and yet I'm also starved I just want more I would love to hear the band get more ambitious with how all of these tracks come together as an overall idea or a concept here a bit more interesting flow in between these songs but as is this is a really great release so much guts so much focus on this record so much raw energy but also the maturity to hone it and focus it into these really creative compositions as this album is not just visceral and physical but it's also cerebral it's very much a head game - this thing is just waltz while fantastic writing production performances definitely one of the best death metal releases I've heard this year I'm feeling a light two decent nine on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did

Xl5r-2xMQb0,"this new little baby and gonna project it's not good drip harder is the new collaborative record from two of Atlanta's up-and-coming voices right now little baby and gonna one of them comes from the quality control camp also known for their associations with migos and little yachty and so on and so forth the other is on young stoner life records which is young thug's offshoot you might remember me mentioning that when I talked about young thug's latest compilation project and how many features is gonna had all over that record to be completely honest I haven't really thought that much about little babies music or gun as music up until this point because I haven't really had much of a reason to I've heard a bunch of different singles and features from both of these guys over the past year on a handful of different projects and honestly I haven't heard a single thing that was worth committing to memory and because of that I thought well this is just probably a passing phase or a fad and there's not really much reason to think too deeply about it let's just let it run its course and it'll be what it is but now we have this new collaborative record over here YSL and quality control essentially thought hey what happens if we put the d-league out onto the court well you get a d-league mediocre record like this and what's even funnier is the illusions of grandeur behind this project because so clearly this album is trying to be in some way a sequel to the young thug and future collaborative project super slimy but cover art is stylized in a similar way and keep in mind this is not the original cover art over here this is a weird mspaint type drawing of it because I actually legit saw youtubers talking about this project getting copyright notices just for showing the cover art of this album but still the cover hour of this thing the way that the tracklist flows and you have collaborative cuts moments where little baby or gonna will take the track by themselves a few notable features here and there Murli shimmery moody glistening production so it's like these guys really kind of see themselves as what like the next wave the new voices the the the Atlanta artists who the torches should be passed down to as if they're like the next iteration of a young thug and of a future and I could see that connection to an extent insofar as gonna sounds quite a bit like young thug as does little baby at points but here's the thing while I do see vocals similarities between them and thugger neither of them are as creative vocally neither of them have anywhere near as much personality versatility I mean look young thug he is a standout artist in my opinion but also one who is lacking in a lot of departments but mostly I think that's due to his emphasis on quantity over quality with a lot of his discography I think that if he really hunkered down and was forced to write some straightforward super catchy coherent songs that he most likely could baby and gonna on the other hand I don't think had that ability not only because they haven't really shown it on their projects up until this point but also both of them fail to even reach the baseline levels of talent that thugger has shown on his previous projects as the beat choices on this album totally worthless boring as hell bland bland bland bland bland bland bland this is like the most cliched one-dimensional uninteresting set of beats I've heard on any project this year if you've heard a handful of young thug or me ghost records or a handful of trap albums that have hit the top 40 you've heard these beats before and you've heard them done better and look let's face it on albums like these the beats carry the songs the hooks carry the songs if there's not a great instrumental there's almost no point in listening to it because it's not like gonna and little baby are bringing great vocals and great lyrics we all know that's not the case let's not kid ourselves let's not pretend that these guys are bringing some some fiery flows just listen to little baby on the song deep-end the flows on this track are trash they're absolute garbage he has barely any tempo or sense of groove or rhythm or anything on this song it's two minutes and 50 seconds of slop not only that but his voice is mixed like ass on the track - it totally overpowers the beat doesn't sound good at all it's very whiny cuz he gets a lot of weird inflections making the track basically sound unlistenable there's almost nothing aesthetically appealing about it these songs were baby is playing opposite - gonna on this album are at least a little less annoying because gonna does provide a slight touch of vocal variation as his rapping slash singing is not nearly as nasally but still even the tracks were these guys double up do get obnoxious because who wants to be listening to two guys in an endless struggle to see who can do the best young thug impersonation and the competition keeps going on and on and on and on because it's always a tie at the end of the track because neither of them are good at it because again neither of them have the command of flow that thugger does neither of them have the vocal range or the vocal personality I feel like baby and gun I have the same exact problem that designer did when he initially came out onto the scene in that he sounded exactly like future but for whatever reason nobody wants to admit the obvious biting that's going on on this project I mean maybe because thugger obviously approves this project he's featured on a track he has signed one of the artists on this record the one time that gonna and baby collectively drum up a fast interesting kind of ear grabbing flow is on the tracks biggest single drip too hard in a way I also have to give credit to little baby on close friends because he at least focuses in on a topic on this track but here's the thing how devoid of anything thoughtful interesting artistically bold or stand out does this album have to be for the bare minimum of a love song to register as a standout track and as long as we're talking about standout moments on this album Drake's appearance on the front of the song never recover is actually pretty hard but if I'm going to cop this album overall because there are very few things I can compliment it on for the appearance of another artist I also have to talk about what is taken away from this album by the appearance of another artist and that is little dirt on the opening track off white V alone where he drops a couple of interesting lines one about how she has to suck dick if she's on her period because you have the mindset of a child and you can't deal with the natural functions of the female body you look at women the same way that toddlers look at broccoli but on top of that he says that you can't say no I ain't hearing it you got a suck dick on your period and you can't say no I'm not hearing it so we have consent issues as well which is an even bigger problem obviously you have to be painfully lacking in cultural self-awareness to hear this verse and not only think that it sounds good but think oh yeah that's dope put it on the record well just let that slide and that's the thing with this record in general I I think I think it's painfully lacking in in self-awareness because if it were self-aware it would know that in the grander scheme of things it's not really that special it doesn't really stand out with its branding its titling and its cover over here it seems like it's greatest ambition is to be the mediocre follow up to a mediocre collaborative album which received mixed reviews and only sold a measly 75,000 copies only 15,000 of which were actual physical sales because nobody wanted to buy this thing it wasn't good it was just passable but unfortunately this record over here fails to even match that bar as this album is completely devoid of anything that I would call even remotely original or creative the singing is below average the rapping is below average the pen game is below average the production is mediocre as hell like what is it about this project that's special I'm really not hearing anything outside of some some really messed up ours about consent a Drake feature the young thug feature sees thugger performing at a higher level than baby and gonna but we already knew that was the case a kind of fast somewhat memorable flow toward the back end of the record on a somewhat successful single I mean guys look I don't like to think I'm that picky a lot of the time I do enjoy a little yachty I do enjoy a little pomp like music obviously doesn't have to be super deep in order for it to be entertaining or connect with me but this is just this is just too little meat on the bone this is too little meat on the bone this is just the bone and it's barely the bone just two guys with really similar vocal styles trying to copy another guy's vocal style just warbling away with auto-tune vocals over the most formulaic trap beats you've heard all year it's not exactly an exciting pitch this album it's not good [Music] "
vmOjFuDulwY,ah hi everyone check the knee Wes Chan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Shrek Wes album mud boy welcome everyone to the new Scheck West album you might be thinking what the heck is a Scheck Wes well Scheck wes is a new york-based rapper the latest signee - Travis Scott's Cactus Jack label dude has a few viral tracks out like live Scheck West - Equus and Mo Bamba he's had a pretty sudden rise to fame I've gotten a lot of suggestions to check out his music and he seems to have a pretty eccentric delivery so my curiosity got the best of me had to talk about it this thing is 14 tracks it's 49 minutes and it is easily one of the otter trap albums I've heard in a while and when I say trap I don't really mean in the traditional sense this album is not purely about drug dealing or anything like that rather check is very much on the loud aggressive absurd and over-the-top hardcore wave that many rappers from the SoundCloud floating up in the SoundCloud have found themselves on check Wes is much more likely to attract the fan of a little pump than he is a TI so if you're gonna listen to mud boy it better be for the bangers because that's much of what this album delivers but that's not to say that sheykh Wes doesn't have his own weird way of going about bangers for one the instrumental tone of this album I guess is sort of grimy a little dark definitely making this album live up to its title with subterranean bass a lot of very glossy shimmering eerie synthesizer leads some of these tracks are steeped in an ominous atmosphere - I mean he's not the first guy to take a dark approach to this particular sound a record like ASAP Ferg's trapped Lord certainly comes to mind as I do find a bit of artistic overlap between this project and in that one in that they both feature vocalists who have a very masculine tone and a very wild demeanor very kooky expressive voice some strange singing very blunt lyrics and chilling instrumentals as I said before the bangers on this album really are the bread and the butter of the record and there are some pretty good ones like the Afro mentioned hits live Scheck Wes die Scheck Wes which features a lot of strange blinky synth leads and a shouted infectious refrain live check Wes bitch I'm dying check West's because when you lives a person you oftentimes end up dying as that person too and also get used to Scheck West referring to himself in the third person he does it all the time and while I know he's not the only rapper out there who does that on a regular basis in his songs he just really seems to overstep that line to the point where he's constantly reminding me of it anyway some of the gritty lyrics about Scheck West's upbringing in Harlem are pretty sharp he definitely has more conviction when rapping about stuff like this then he does when other rappers are may be spinning bars about what their dick goes in or what their money is spent on which also goes for Scheck West himself when he's kind of doing that same thing the song Moe Bamba is is not a bad banger either it's a ridiculous track where Wes finds himself with this elongated flow really singing out these extended notes on a quirky somewhat over driven instrumental seems really off-the-cuff seems raw as hell but his delivery is kind of electrifying and there are a number of tracks on this album just like this that don't seem as detailed or as preconceived or as as written it just seems like Wes is running off pure momentum tracks like Kyrie or Gmail where he goes off on a random diatribe on why he says the word bitch so many times in his songs because I guess it just gives him that nice angry feeling that being said though I do want to mention there are ad-libs all over this record check really does love his ad-libs especially mmm which is the weirdest quietest saddest ad-lib I think I've heard all year and there's also the song danimals which couldn't be more random with Scheck essentially rapping but also talking about yogurt dave chappelle family guy references this track is so casual he's pretty much just dicking around at this point and it's kind of fun but am i dying to come back to it anytime soon not not necessarily the bangers continue on tracks like chippie chippie and wanted as well as the antisocial and paranoid fuck everybody then there are some moodier numbers on the album that i think are pretty decent where he works in some of his personal struggles or trials like growing up as a young man in new york city with roots in senegal on the chilling never lost he talks about all the places his talent and efforts have taken him he also raps about his cousin's kind of rubbing off on him with their bad behavior and his mother threatening to send him back which she actually does on the track where Scheck finds himself back in sin ago with no ID no passport he's stuck there he has to reconnect with a strange family he ends up adapting making his way breaks into a verse of wool off' and the second half of the track that's pretty impressive if more tracks on the album were this focus and spoke to Scheck's personal experiences on top of that emphasized what makes him special and unique as a rapper this would be a much better record because while Scheck does have a lot of personality and I mean a lot on this album to the point where it kind of overcomes the very same e somewhat generic production and the lack of coherent songwriting the lack of coherent versus their tracks on this album that I enjoy purely for sex energy as well as his perspective there's great potential on mud boy but it's all in the raw barely any of it is refined or groomed or honed in and the barely existent songwriting and the so-so beats aren't exactly bringing it out either and while mud boy is a decent start if Scheck west keeps putting out material at this quality level he could disappear in the next few years because that's how long it's going to take to get another rapper on the mic who sounds as crazy if not crazier and saying things that are as ridiculous if not ridiculous er and most likely with better production but I don't want to see that hopefully Scheck comes through with something a bit more thoughtful and potent and mature next time around this is fun for now but this is not very long-term and not just because I think the tone of the album is silly or that Scheck is too over-the-top for example little pomp is pretty silly he's pretty over-the-top but he's got bolder production he's got stronger choruses and I think Scheck could be a way more appealing artist if he had that going for him I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen

r_WKzCe2Tc0,hi everyone Dick Cheney is evil here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Marissa Nadler album for my crimes this is the eighth full-length album from singer-songwriter Marissa Nadler I've been aware of her work for a while but it's only been until recently that she has turned me into a believer in her very wintry approach to contemporary folk music I like her haunting and gentle voice I like the refreshingly dark and luscious direction her music is gone and since switching over to sacred bones records her last full-length album was easily her most instrumental II dense record in a while and one of my favorites in her discography and with her latest record four sacred bones Marissa Naylor continues on this dark path with a pretty atmospheric and space he sound bordering on gothic a few times but she takes a much different approach in instrumentation and writing on this new LP for one this is Nadler shortest album in a while at 34 minutes and while July and strangers saw her embracing more instrumental layers for my crimes sees her stripping them back some songs on this thing don't really feature much more than a gently strum guitar and some chilling background vocals and Marissa Adler's typical lead maybe there are a few ethereal tones hanging here and there throughout the track for a bit of embellishment but that's it sometimes this record feels downright skeletal and I think she's taking a simpler approach on the lyrical front of this album - as some of the stories she tells on this album are surprisingly blunt the closing track is a cute and funny goodbye to a car that she used to drive explaining at one point that it took a bullet in the roof in New Haven which is why they call it gun wave in New Haven and she's singing about removing her things from the car taking the plates off the blown engine over some throbbing strings and some plucky guitar lines and a really catchy hook one one nine six five seven in the engine the opener a title track on this thing sees Nadler singing from the standpoint of somebody who seems like they are about to be executed for some horrendous crime they committed at one point of the song Marissa telling the listener please don't for me it's it's quite sad it's pretty dark and some serious got that country vibes also coming off this track too while the track is not that long and there's not a whole lot of instrumental depth to it I do have to say that I think the story and the tale the concept the narrative of the song it does have a lot of impact it does feel really strong it is haunting other tracks on this record feel like Nadler is almost writing hits but with kind of a nostalgic flair songs that sound like they could be placed in like an old-school jukebox but only if that jukebox were the saddest loneliest most depressed jukebox in the world songs like I can listen to Jim Clark anymore lover release me or all out of catastrophes which features some of my favorite lyrics on the entire record which are pretty humorous Marisa's not really known for her sense of humor in her music she rarely trots it out but I'm glad she didn't on this track because it worked pretty well saying at one point in the song that in his sleep her lover called her by another name and saying that that was the nicest thing he had ever said to her there's something almost Johnny Cash ish about the track that I like a lot considering that I should say that I think a lot of songs on this record could actually go down pretty well with country fans if only they were laid out with peppier instrumentation but I don't know if you're a country fan but you don't mind some mellow music you don't mind some music with an easygoing instrumental palette I think you'll dig on this because personally I don't really think these songs are any less enjoyable in their current state because in their current form they're delivered almost as if they are like a sad little secret or something nad lers instrumentation does get kind of thick though on the track blue vapour with some droning electric guitars and strings it's a slow burner but moves at a steady pace the guitars certainly propel the track Nadler dark vocal harmonies create a sense of urgency if I'm reading into it correctly the track seems to be about Nadler lusting after somebody in her head who she just can't get out of there but the relationship she had with this person is pretty much over at this point and she's pretty much coming to terms with that I think it's one of her strongest songs in a while despite the incredible tremendo simplicity I also like the heavy drums and strings that come in toward the ending then there's the incredible bliss of the track dream dream big in the sky also digging on the quaint but sad folk number you're only harmless when you sleep another moment on the album where she seems to be singing about a dysfunctional love where two partners seem to be a total polar opposites and there's some kind of irreparable damage to this relationship that they just can't seem to get past and while I'm not as enamored with the tune the lyrics on the track flamethrower seem to go down this road as well but hit even harder literally singing about this person faking his death and wanting him to burn burn burn burn so while there are a lot of upsides to the simpler approach Nadler takes on this album there are some cons to it too the album overall is pretty scant while I do find a lot of the tracks on this thing to be endearing simultaneously I wonder if their impact could have been made greater if they were longer or had larger instrumentation on them and again speaking to the length of this album and these tracks I think there are some cuts on here that have somewhat fizzled endings like all out of catastrophes and lover' release me which is unfortunate because I think these two songs have some of the greatest potential out of any tracks here as the shortcomings of these tracks are partially made up for with their great lyrics they're straightforward delivery their sense of humor the the dark tone of the track and I guess there are a few tunes on this album I don't really care for at all like are you really gonna move to the south I do enjoy the personal story that this track delivers but the chord progression the vocal melody just seems really man during and an interesting sort of like Marisa sacrificed the melody of the track so that she could kind of tell this story the song interlocking I found to have a similarly meandering quality as well even though I do enjoy the drama in her voice overall I thought this was a pretty enjoyable singer-songwriter album for sure Nadler simple songwriting style and chilly vocal delivery it's not going to be for everyone but I happen to like it I think it's pretty compelling I think it's pretty beautiful I think the simpler approach he takes on this album mostly pans out also again liking the gothic direction she's heading in on this one a little bit too I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this one Trey ition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which and I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the only two subscribe to the channel Marisa Nadler for my crimes forever 
GTuTUfMe64Q,hi everyone yeah take the NEET okay okay okay all right okay good uh hi everyone tik the NEET octan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new 21 pilots album trench this is the newest full-length album from music duo Tyler Joseph and Josh dun twenty one pilots they've been at it for almost a decade under this name and up until this point I haven't really taken the project all that seriously their breakout album vessel didn't really do all that much for me and their following album blurryface in 2015 didn't sit too well with me either I thought the album's basic blend of rock and pop and hip hop and electronic music were a radio-friendly watering down of bolder and more interesting sounds across the popular music spectrum also taken to account the duo's typically melodramatic and twee instrumentation and songwriting with a side of gentrified reggae and this is just not for me even though blurryface was far from the worst thing I'd ever heard twenty-one pilots were not really a group I anticipated would come out with a record I enjoyed anytime soon but the teaser tracks to trench began to make that feel like a real possibility the very moody my blood was not a tune that blew me away at first but I was pretty impressed with the instrumental and the production on this one with these songs grimy bassline and super crisp drums then they do a smooth transition into the series of disco beats with glistening atmospheric synthesizers on the hook it was a nice touch it was pretty sweet then there's the song levitate which legitimately features some of the best production I've heard all year it's a track that features some super tight drum loops stuttering sent samples flying in every direction the track aesthetically almost feels like something off of the battle's album then what comes as easily one of the most compelling verses from Tyler Joseph that I've heard so far in sampling twenty one pilots music it's basically a super wordy critique on our culture of saturation and celebrity I just wish it was longer not only because the track approach is one of the most stan shil topics of any song on this album but also because Tyler's flow on this track is great I would actually say his rapping which on previous records I didn't think was all that good has gotten much better on Trench his overall delivery sounding much smoother and more confident so as a result of those tracks I did go into this new album looking forward to hearing a potentially better 21 pilots with a more mature and tasteful take on the duo sound so far and keep in mind what I'm saying their version of the duo's sound so far because I don't think to make a great record 21 pilots need to completely overhaul their sound I like the fact that they make pop music I just happen to think they could have been doing it better and Trench is that better album in fact I think Trench is their best album and by a large margin on Trench twenty one pilots cover their usual genre basis but they do so with a lot more attention to detail instrumental depth and immaculate production this is a more vibrant a moody or a sterner a grittier twenty one pilots the lyrics every once in a while still come off pretty simplistic but it does contribute to a lot of these songs being as instantaneous and catchy and as sticky as they are plus there's a lot of lore behind the lyrics of twenty one pilots that I haven't really appreciated up until this point and trench sees the duo diving into that Laura more deeply than ever with some of the lyrics and perspectives on this album being tied to a fictional character by the name of clancy who lives in this place called dima and there's more information about this place that you can read if you follow the various Easter eggs and shreds of cryptic information the band has peppered around online but long story short Dima is a place that Clancy used to hold in high regard as a child but as he's grown older he sees it now as almost like a system that he is trapped inside of he's grown disillusioned with it and this could be an allegory for a few different things maybe either religion as there are quite a few songs on this album that do deal in God and an afterlife and faith or maybe it's Fame as there are quite a few tracks here where it seems like Tyler is reflecting on twenty one pilots popularity in mainstream culture or maybe this whole thing is set up by Tyler to explore some personal political or social issues as some of the songs and imagery on this record do take us somewhat revolutionary tone I'm not totally sure about any of these options and I don't really think right now at this point there is a definitive way to be but all of this is definitely a vehicle for something as there are tracks that dive more deeply into the narrative of this world than others like the song Nico and the Niners whose lyrics are about the people in power positions in this fictional place or the song Bandido where Tyler seems to be portraying himself as somebody who is in like the underworld of this land or who is uh I don't know almost like a resistance type character possibly I don't know there's also a lyrical point on this track that I think is pretty pivotal where he talks about having created this world in order to feel some control and he can destroy it if he wants so maybe all of this has been drawn up just so Tyler can sing about his personal experiences and ideas without writing or delivering from such a direct or egocentric place and I'm sure the audience is meant to project their own feelings onto this narrative blueprint too as there are quite a few outsider underdog freethinker type tropes that I think a lot of listeners will gravitate toward but even though the narrative elements of trench are pretty cool I wouldn't say they are 100% required to understand every facet of in order to enjoy this record because if this album is anything it is a consistently catchy and thrilling set of songs from the roaring opener jumpsuit whose bass riffs and drumbeats sound like something out of a death from above 1979 song which transitions into these eerie verses later some ringing siren synths some dubby echo effects to the sound of this track is heavy and powerful it's gargantuan it's crushing and I love the way the band kind of pulls back instrumentally - on the bridge and reveals these cute shy little lead vocals that sound like something out of a postal service song then they bring it back for a mega heavy finish it's a good structure the band structures and writes some good tracks they're very meticulously pulled together and yet they have a nice visceral vibe to them you song morph is a really nice blend of pop and hip-hop with a lot of the song's lyrics dealing in death mortality what comes after and also I guess morphing into someone else a bit of an identity crisis I haven't quite figured out how all the themes on this track but I do love the mix of instrumental pallets on this song quite a bit as the hooks on this thing have kind of a glammy and very atmospheric tone to them meanwhile the verses feature some harder beets and some soulful jazzy instrumentation the song chlorine features one of the most addictive hooks on the entire album which is kind of funny considering the track seems to be about chemical dependency and mood alteration to fit on snake Dobby I love every bit of this track - those chunky hooks to the psychedelic dreamy outro the whole first leg of this album is pretty much fire and the hits keep coming deeper into the record with only a few tracks I would call minor missteps the song smithereens is kind of a cute and quaint tune of love and devotion dedicated of course to tyler significant other the sound of this track isn't as wondrous as many of the other songs on here are however i think it's slightly forgivable in some of the tunes hilarious meta observations singing about how he had to put a song like this on the record i'm also not super crazy about the track cut my lip given that it is 21 pilots and their past records of course they cannot help but do a weird updated reggae number at some point on the album and yeah it's it's kind of just watered-down pop reggae with a rock steady beat and a piano with an emphasis on the upbeat some dubby effects too but in the duo's defense this is easily one of the best tracks they've done that is in this vein so I'm actually not even that bothered by it really the weakest thing about this track is the tune because the production it is pretty fire the song Bandido even though I do like lyrically what the track is doing and the very pretty area instrumental finish there are some points especially in the first leg that do get a bit drab and the clothes are on the album even though it does a good job of bringing things back to the clancy dima narrative they set out for this record i do wish it was a bigger finish and was a little bit less of a cliffhanger because it's like i'm being given a to be continued for a story that that didn't really get that strong of a start to begin with still all that being said though i loved a number of songs to come after the halfway point of this LP pet cheetah is great a track that very much seems to be a meditation on fame fame and Tyler's creative process with multiple musical and instrumental shifts across the song which are super creative the song hype sounds instrumentally unique compared to every other song here because it feels like a 90's Britpop throwback to me it's like a futuristic oasis song I also kind of dig how Tyler is lyrically getting into his mental demons and talking about his ability to get through them has very much to do with his friends his support system the people who are around him which i think is kind of an important takeaway for a lot of people who get a lot of emotional catharsis out of twenty one pilots music and as long as we're talking about throwing it back to the 90s let's discuss the song legend which for whatever reason there are a few spots where the vocal melody resembles very much that of the hook on ever clears I'll buy you a new life I will buy you a god and where your flowers can bloom I also like stylistically how he's pulling together very tastefully some elements of soul and pop and rock music and one of the most standout songs topically on the entire record has to be neon gravestones a track that's essentially about the glorification of an early death or suicide with Tyler waxing poetic on how he could boost his image and his popularity if he killed himself and this song is not just some kind of outside bitter critique but also an attempt by Tyler to filter through his own suicidal thoughts as well telling listeners that if he succumbs to these desires if he loses to himself to not mourn him and just move on so yeah surprisingly I loved listening to this album and I just felt like I got more out of it every time I return back to it every time I started it at jump suit all over again I was picking up more stuff about it lyrically instrumentally and yet the album is so catchy is so addictive is so sweet but also very dark and emotional and personal too I think the appeal of this record runs in a lot of directions which is certainly one of its best qualities something I think the band had in spades to a degree with how in past efforts they were able to incorporate so many genres of music into their songs but this newfound maturity the duo are shell in their production in their songwriting in their lyrics is certainly creating a greater appeal for what they're doing too and before I finish this review let me say one thing and this this comment may not age well and a lot of you may totally disagree with this and if it does that's fine this very much comes from a personal place but listening to this record I very much had like some of the same sad angsty almost like teenage feelings that I used to back in the day when I used to listen to Linkin Park's the hybrid theory and I don't know I feel like there are so many artistic parallels between both of these groups in that they cover so many genre bases and I feel like twenty one pilots speak to a very similar emotional palette to Linkin Park as well and in a very similar demographic of listeners to just in in a new generation again maybe all of you totally disagree with that comparison and if you do that's fine it's just a my personal opinion they're just like everything and these reviews are anyway so I'm pretty much feeling a decent - strong 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

k4CPORq9x7M,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here who the internet's busiest music nerd and you know who it is and it's time for a weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week first off I want to shout out our sponsor in this video the good people over at the rich wallet they make these nifty metal-plated minimalist wallets with a money clip

one get yourself a colorful pressing of a record I have covered on the channel we get kicked back from it helps the segment helps the channel and a few more shout outs the pains being pure at heart have done a peppy in-your-face little Tom Petty cover that is linked down below along with all the other songs that I am talking about in this video be great if you check that out also a John Prine cover of a Stevie Wonder track that is a pretty lovely and there is a little live video of our boy Louis Cole who came out with a great little synth pop synth funk record earlier this year it's it's it's a bit of a session in I don't know if it's his place a place but there's a full band and he's playing on the stairs and he's playing drums and there's computers and loops and everything of all of its it's pretty incredible how how much they're able to accomplish just totally on the fly it's actually quite amazing all right let's get into the tracks I thought were the worst ones this week worst tracks this week we got a handful one PewDiePie has come out with a diss track against t-series which is quickly overtaking his channel in terms of overall subs now t-series if you didn't know is music channel out of India and features multiple songs from solo artists from I guess across the mainstream music spectrum over there and since they're kind of gonna overtake his channel most likely in in the coming days with the channel netting somewhere around like 2.5 billion views a month it seems like pewds is kind of dissing them too I guess cause some drama but they're most likely not going to respond as they're just a random music channel and this track isn't even really that good it would have been funnier if maybe his discs were a little bit more centric toward what the channel is about but it's it's not really it just kind of seems like him just get getting some views just getting some views next housey has a new track out titled without me it is a very bland and uneventful piece of electro pop it's very dreary electro pop ballad with very little in the way of flavor moving on from there Greta Van Fleet new song out titled anthem I know I've kind of rag down the band before for sounding so much like Led Zeppelin but at least on prior tracks there emulation was at least somewhat accurate this new song over here sounds horrendous I mean it's a ballad an acoustic number and the lead vocals are laughable I do not get the appeal of a track like this I could sort of see up until this point okay if you're just nostalgic for the past and you want to hear something that sounds like something you've already heard before and you wish the good old days had come back then maybe a band that sounds like exactly like a group such as Led Zeppelin would appeal to you but at this point I feel like they're not even doing a good job at recreating the sound but whatever let's move on to the track so I was kind of met on was it wasn't blown away but I didn't think they were terrible either Thom Yorke has ended another track from the Suspiria soundtrack which Thom Yorke had his fingerprints all over should be dropping soon and this song sounds like a kind of weird spacey psychedelic experimental vocal piece it's it's not too bad you know if you enjoy the atmosphere of Radiohead's last record you're probably getting into this but there's not really that strong of a song behind it or anything but it's it's got a cool vibe to it moonface spencer Krug's music project has a new album on the way this has been announced to be the project's final album walk in the circle walk the circle in the other direction is the name of this new track and this long multi phase spanning like piano art rock piece with some pretty impatient vocals from Spencer and a great bit of sax in the track and the last leg too which was a very nice touch felt a little indirect to me and and I haven't been super crazy about a lot of Spencer's songwriting under the moonface name but it's it's not bad Kurt Vile has a somewhat underwhelming new number out from his latest full-length LP I've been talking about it in in these videos I'm pretty excited for the new full-length album even if this new track isn't as hard-hitting as some of the other songs have been it's a nice easygoing piece of folk rock you know with Kurt's usual quirky lyrical style Joe G has a new song out can't get over you clams Casino featured on this one and yet it's alright the structure of the song is kind of weak it's a bit of a short track the vocals are recorded in kind of a funny silly lo-fi way which which definitely adds personality I could see this track being a nice little silly detour in in the track listing it certainly is is cool to hear him taking things and a bit different a bit rougher and in weirder direction but the song is not really that strong which is kind of the unfortunate part to it moving on from there jesse we're over time brand-new single jesse pretty much sings her heart out over a nice pop house blend not the best tune i've ever heard her on but it is a nice bouncy danceable little track and iron Reagan crossover thrash act iron Reagan has a moshing banger of a new track out titled the devastation off of a brand new EP and gez miraculously has a pretty decent new track out and the summer freestyle with yg like the beat the beat has some crazy and a very fun off-the-wall samples laced within it some of GE Z's one-liners are actually pretty clever and entertaining shows he has a bit of a playful side that he doesn't dole out on tracks all that often and in yg is a nice touch on the track too so I actually enjoy this quite a bit so shout out to G easy you know still it's it's Gerald so it's a little corny but it's it's still not a bad cut seems like he's on a bit of a roll since having uh taken a dump on him Machine Gun Kelly but oh and a Clams Casino teaming up with Pluto Nash for a new Adult Swim single which is not too bad it's titled - gravity it's a detuned like slow motion very basic experimental trap stuff it's it's kind of cool and 6:9 has a new track out titled stupid with bobby shmurda featuring Bobby Bobby Bobby shmurda and it's actually not that bad I think it's kind of a little too short and there's not much of a structure to it but six nines very brash and in-your-face delivery kind of makes up for that the instrumental hits hard and I actually like the way they incorporate Bobby into this track now of course since Bobby ISM is in prison they recorded his feature over the phone but he has flow over the phone and I feel like the track is very rough and abrasive and and kind of gritty and I think the the recording of the phone quality vocal on the track actually works in favor of the song quite a bit so I'm not against it I'm not against it alright let's get into the tracks I thought were the best ones this week best tracks this week best ones quite a few remember these are all linked down there in the description box for you to check them out BAM Swizz Beatz new track out featuring young thug much better than the track here the single he had a little while he had out excuse me a little while ago with little Wayne 25 soldiers and really what makes this song is the young thug performance like thug errs flow and his very intelligible lyrics on this track and his kind of deeper inflection on this cut is is certainly a refreshing change of pace for him Swiss as delivery isn't too bad either I wouldn't say that the hook is all that strong on the track but it works in a few different phases and it's kind of a dark moody Orkut which i think is pulled off pretty well moving on from there Sharon Van Etten singer-songwriter Sharon bayonet and comeback kid is the name of this new track over sheet over here she has dropped I feel like it's kind of a rite of passage for indie singer songwriters if you are going to I guess keep doing the whole singer-songwriter thing there's going to eventually come a time where you have to like start writing synth pop or something or you have to start incorporating electronics into your repertoire and that's kind of thing with this new track over here it's punch here it's more straightforward there since in it but I like the fact that Sharon has not lost her kind of rough and very organic edge that I typically enjoy on a lot of her recordings so Sharon definitely coming through with one of the catchy or song she's ever recorded but again remember it's it's a bit of an instrumental change of pace which i think is is pulled off well moving on from there but banger alert from little pump and little Aussie vert multi-millionaire it's a silly dumb ridiculous over-the-top trap banger don't expect it to be deep it's just kind of a fun lesson moving on from there rock Marciano and DJ Muggs have a new project out shit I'm on is the name of this new track and I'm absolutely in love with the cycling soulful very serene instrumental that mugs pulls together on this track rock more rock Marciano complements it beautifully and of course Marci is deliver his usual subdued rap style so it's it's a very thoughtful low-key cerebral hip-hop cut so you know keep that in mind and double entendre is galore Jaden Smith Goku new banger from Jaden it's kooky it's weird it's in your face it's got a bit of an EDM breakdown too but I actually think it's pretty fun I enjoyed it it's not deep but it's fun moving on from there hi on fire have a new Adult Swim single out a new album I'm going to be covering this week the name of this new track over here is spoon from the earth give it a listen if you are into heavy badass chick in-your-face sludge metal holy ghost have a brand new track out synth-pop outfit Holy Ghost anxious is the name of the cut it's a bit of a synth pop electro pop throwback to the 80s and it's a quite nice wondering when holy ghosts are going to come back with a brand new record because I feel like we need that we need that in our lives Courtney Barnett small talk is the name of her new track and this new track this new cut over here is going to be released on a compilation from mom and pop records celebrating the the labels founding so this new song will be featured on the compilation and it's a nice little fun track literally about small talk and Courtney kind of goes over that topic in a very clever and somewhat cheeky way it's it's cute and Clarence clarity shout out to Clarence clarity he has a new track out that I would love to point you guys to down below it is titled to Adam and the evil I'm not going to go over it too much because he does have a new album out which I will be covering this week at some point and Charli XCX and Troye Sivan have teamed up on a brand new track titled 1999 it is a great electro pop tune literally about the nostalgia of 1999 and wanting to take it back to 1999 which is why both of them are dressed like they're lost in the matrix in this in this album cover but they pull it off well I wasn't too crazy about Troy's new full-length album album but I think they they complement each other well on this new track over here behemoth have a new track out which is actually surprisingly melodic and harmonious I could see this definitely being a powerful moment a powerful somewhat more low-key moment on their new full-length album Bart's Adele is the name of the track I'm not going to go too deep into it as I do plan to cover the band's new album this week on the main channel and Anderson Pat Kendrick Lamar did a little track review of this track on the Fantana Channel awesome piece of synth funk on this cut it's beautiful it's wonderful it's groovy it's exuberant its charismatic loaded with swagger instrumentalists top-notch Anderson PAC is wonderful and Kendrick Lamar definitely lends a lot to the charisma of the song - and ladies and gentlemen that has been it for the weekly track roundup a pretty tight 14 minute weekly track roundup

9NYrsLKHDvg,oh boy he's back young senators back cooped overdue the fourth why hi everyone smudge Denis Bob tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new logic album young Sinatra for this is the latest commercial release from Maryland rapper logic and what he says is the final installment in his young Sinatra series referring back to some of his earliest mixtapes and singles young Sinatra young Sinatra undeniable young Sinatra - young Sinatra three projects and songs that are pretty boom-bap centric lyrically and instrumentally throwing it back to the Golden Age of hip hop in the 90s and young Sinatra for pretty much follows suit in that tradition this thing is 14 tracks well over an hour much longer than I would want to be listening to a logic album but there are just a handful of unnecessarily long songs that kind of contributed to that factor and it's something that I'm kind of smiling and laughing about because when it comes to logic albums I personally feel like I am perpetually stuck in this constant ground hogs day like stay each new logic project is me waking up to a new day and I swear to myself each time this time it's going to be different this time I'm going to love it this time it's going to click this time all the positive feelings that I have toward logic will be manifested into a glowing review but it just does not turn out that way and I'm not trying to say that logic makes the same album over and over and over I certainly don't think that but roughly I end up having the same feelings and experience over and over and over and it's frustrating to feel that way generally each time because for the most part I like logic he seems like a pretty nice guy seems like a positive dude seems like in a lot of respects a breath of fresh air in mainstream hip-hop despite boldly wearing his very contemporary influences on his sleeve on past records I think he's a pretty talented guy dude can really rap and even though people try to derive him as corny for speaking on issues like racism and colorism and depression I think his artistic efforts on those fronts for the most part have been thoughtful and with good intentions plus I think his album so far have had far greater shortcomings than his personality his positive outlook or whether or not he says anything about being biracial he does have a funny bar on this record though talking about how since he's gone platinum he identifies his bicoastal I thought that was kind of a funny shot back at that whole thing that being said though a great deal of the appeal of logics music is couched in his positive outlook in his good vibes personality I mean just listen to the intro track on this album thank you it's not a song that I love it's sort of a bland spacey piece of glamorous boom-bap with a bunch of general motivation bars trying to push listeners to I guess be the best version of themselves and follow logics example in fighting for your dreams and chasing after what you want the track is kind of predictable but my biggest issue with it is that a great deal of its runtime is taken up with just a clip show of all of these fan voicemails just telling logic how much they love his music what it means to them which if you're not inducted into the cult of logic it's it's probably not gonna mean all that much to you still though I'm sure these fans love that inclusion and I'm sure the fans generally love this inclusion and if you listen to what the fans are saying in these messages it highlights exactly what I'm trying to say here they say he's so inspirational his music means everything to them you show me that anyone from anywhere can be anything they want to be and there are a few different groups of people who might see this message as a little corny those who are just really negative Bay the negativity they're just hateful dirtbags people who understand that life can be really unfair and that maybe there are systemic oppressions at work that might prevent certain marginalized individuals from achieving greatness and people who are self motivators who don't really need logic to throw empty platitudes at them to go out there and make the best decisions for them purse I kind of fall into that last group but I don't ultimately see logics positive message as being one of the biggest issues I have with his music at least on this album anyway if there's a graver problem I have with young Sinatra for its that the boom-bap sound logic bathes in on this record is presented in a kind of weak fashion logics approach to boom-bap is kind of squeaky clean it's a neutered and toothless take on this classic East Coast style it's far from the soulful urban rugged and gruff sound that came through on records like Illmatic and 36 chambers strictly business ready to die the infamous this thing is like the Disneyland of boom back records essentially logic does his best to embrace the sound he goes as far as to get every living wu-tang member on one track of this thing and titles it would hang forever which I'm sure took a lot of effort on logics part and it is one of the somewhat better moments on the album the beat hits pretty hard it has some pretty exciting verses here and there though a shockingly short one from GZA u-god Inspectah deck and even Cappadonna I think lead to a bit of a lull in the track and RZA for some reason sounds more awkward than everybody on the song I don't know why they wouldn't have done another take of his verse he just sounds really really off really the track is more exciting in name than it is in practice and not to say that there aren't quality tracks on this album I think there are the song everybody dies which transitions really well into the return these tracks are pretty much rapid-fire mixtape logic back in full form dropping bar after bar after bar after bar about his reach his motivation his work ethic his versatility talking about modern music coverage essentially being wrapped TMZ dropping memorable bars like I had a lot of dark nights I've been bane so those two tracks pretty catchy pretty great energy good flows from logic I also liked the track the glorious five which is a bit of a moody or more personal number tones it down on the instrumental a little bit logic rapping about his family ties and his issues with his father on this track wishing he played a greater role in his childhood on this song logic also struggles with enjoying the life that he's built for himself now an understanding that his upbringing brought him to where he is but simultaneously wishing things had been different I also appreciate the similarly positive message on the track one day but personally the glamorous pianos and the Ryan Tedder hook on this track it's it's it's a little too much like this is not a Macklemore album this is not an Eminem album this is the last thing I want to hear this is glitzy to the max and it gives me a headache though when logic said no class like bomb threats that's a bar we get more sweet and peppy pop rap on the track ordinary day which features a dance be some speedy rattling hi-hat super artificial synth chords a super weak singing voice from logic at some points this is just not a track I'm interested in at all really my least favorite song in the entire album and even though at about this point on the album I'm about to succumb to a sugar coma I do dig the humorous tone the funk be in the Roadrunner flows on the track 100 miles and running even while a on this track is pretty good and the vocal harmonies that pop in just before his verse strong Michael Jackson vibes coming off of that I'm not typically somebody who was super impressed by fast rapping but even when logic busts his fastest flows toward the end of the track I was like wow good boy good job Bobby good job Bobby with the title track on this thing I can see what logic is trying to do here but it just feels like way too much of a rehash of young Sinatra 3 there's so much common ground between these two tracks right down to the NAS sample that I just wish he went off and did something different especially considering there's a great beat switch in the middle of the track with some fractured jazzy piano chords and some of logics best bars on the entire album as he breaks into this riddle like verse where he is rapping from the standpoint of money but he's not telling you he's money until the very end of that verse saying things like I'm the reason the Titanic sank I'm always there for you yeah when it comes down to the wire and some people will even tuck me away until they retire I usually come around on the 1st and the 15 so all these little money hints and clues the thing is that money does or the things people do for money and then we reveal that at the very end super smart super sharp an example of how creative and focused logic can be as a rapper but it's such a pivotal and interesting point in this song it really overshadows everything else the track does I just wish logic pulled this section out and just made it its own track because it was so well executed and such a cool idea the song Street dreams too was kind of alright it's like listening to the rapped synopsis of the most intense action scene at the end of a bad blockbuster film there's a car chase and there's police and there's gunfire and the car flips and his friend gets shot his wife was abducted he gets back to her and and then he was the one who abducted her the whole time oh my god what a twist well that's horrible twist and then at the very end of the track lot logic wakes up because it's street Dreams it's a it's a dream it was it was some real groom worthy M night Shyamalan reveal type at this point on young Sinatra for I think some of the songs and ideas are beginning to wear thin a little bit The Adventures of Stoney Bob is essentially a generic stoner track and while I don't mind logic hopping on to this theme on this very bland boom-bap beat what I do mind is just how boring and lifeless all of his friends and featured guests on the track are like the talent gap between logic and these guys is very wide and very apparent as their performances on this tracker pretty awkward though again I kind of get that on this thing logic is even though it's a commercial album he's in mixtape mode he's just kind of kicking back with his friends he's doing whatever he wants he's indulging in the whole boom-bap thing legacy though I found to be a strangely sad track where logic lyrically goes over his work ethic and how that is kind of working against him as he is focusing more on his music and his legacy than his health and his family and his loved ones and even though the point on this track where he's rapping from the standpoint of his own son and his significant other it just sounds like rushed and off-the-cuff and and really bad I do find it interesting that it seems like he's playing at his own personal issues in a different scenario because of instead of leading a seedy lifestyle or getting addicted to drugs he's more addicted to his own fame his again legacy his his music his work the song last call is pretty much logic telling his life story in relation to his come up in hip-hop music he kicks the track off saying hey Kanye did it cold did it I couldn't wait to do my own last call track so if you're not 100% wrapped up in logics backstory and everything that it took for him to get to this point then this song might kind of feel a little underwhelming for you especially at ten minutes in length I know it grows tiresome for me especially as the song essentially devolves into him telling a story about the first time in tenth grade his dad brought him to the music studio but what I find hilarious about this track is how logic fans will typically jump down my throat saying like how can you say he sounds like Kendrick how can you say he sounds like coal how could you say you sounds like this guy despite the fact that on this track he literally admits to and says hey I just like grab my ideas from these other artists who are my contemporaries whether again it's on this song or it's on the Mac Miller shout out earlier on the album and look I'm not trying to say that he sounds like Kendrick Lamar all over this record in fact I didn't really catch any spots where I thought he was kind of pulling off a Kendricks song or a Kendrick flow like he has in the past but it's painfully clear that logic listens to the artists around him he's a fan of them he grabs ideas from them and sometimes the the the stench of the artists that he's borrowing from is very clear on a particular track I mean you wouldn't say on wu-tang forever logics not trying to sound like the wu-tang clan still though I think last call is kind of a heartwarming end to an album that his most hardcore fans will most likely get a lot out of certainly more than they did Bobby Tarantino - I'm pretty happy for the guy it seems like he's continuing to see a lot of success even though there are a few moments on this thing where logic might seem like he's lacking in a bit of self-awareness in regards to his own fame or might be feeling himself a bit too much to the point where he's pretentious generally he seems just sweet as pie on this record just like a really genuine authentic likeable dude and this album here is kind of like the hip-hop equivalent to a self-help speech which is not necessarily a bad thing but at the end of the day I just feel like logics music is just okay I wouldn't say it's dumb it's certainly not offensive he certainly has a good baseline level of talent to execute the things that he does but artistically I don't think it's the most profound and and philosophically I feel like that's also the case it's just very middlebrow I guess I'm feeling a strong five to light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which an ayurvedic i'm and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is

ErQy1u8wT6g,ah so thin me down here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cara cara benito album time and place this is the second full-length album from UK pop kerokero bonito it is also their poly vinyl records debut the band if you remember made kind of a splash back in 2016 with their debut full-length album bonito generation which was one of the most fun bubbly and youthful pop records of the year pretty diverse as well as the album incorporated elements of synth and electro pop J pop even hip hop music in a series of songs that were like these cute and heartwarming ODEs to growing up moving on moving into the next phase of your life and adulting while trying to maintain your childlike innocence and a positive enthusiastic outlook something I need to remind myself for sometimes so I loved the album instantly the trio had become a group to look out for but then just earlier this year the band started to tease toward new material and a new direction with their took toe tap EP a little release that saw the band embarking on some indie pop and indie rock numbers that were sort of breezy I didn't mind the overall switch in style but I hope that if the van were going to continue in this direction they would do something that was a bit more bold or brought out the the personality that I loved hearing so much on their debut record now that EP did turn out to be a bit of a taster of things to come because on this latest record over here kero kero bonito are very much drifting away from some of the j-pop and electro pop influences that permeated nearly every single track on bonito generation and that's getting swapped out with things like alt rock and power pop the trio are digging into their UK roots as well and delivering some twee pop a style that actually complements Sara Benito's gentle voice very well there are even some noise pop tracks and passages on this thing however this record is not a complete departure as there are still quite a few synth pop numbers on this thing plus the band's catchy songwriting and endearing lyrics are still very much here in spades some fans might react - the change that kirakira bonito bring on this new record but I think the shift in sound is really only skin-deep because a lot of what made bonito generation great also holds true for time and place the band are now just trying out some different musical styles which I might add they do very well it would be one thing if they try to e pop and they were just garbage at it but they're actually not because miraculously this is one of the better records I've heard in a while that embraces that style there are quite a few standout singles on this thing like time today which features a sentimental set of keyboard chords and a sequenced swinging beat as Sarah sings longingly about how she will spend her free time that day getting things done putting things off kind of being in her feelings a track that is very much in the spirit of a typical kero kero Veneto song in that it is in a way celebrating and observing the little things in life the song make-believe is one of the best fusions of the band's debut album sound with some of the indie pop and rock influences on that EP that dropped earlier this year the song pretty much feels like some very fancy free indie pop a bit of a Belle and Sebastian vibe I would say some great instrumental transitions candy-coated chords and the lyrics on this thing all about trying to maintain your innocence your ability to make believe but real life kind of gets in the way the song only acting I read as a very smart track about performing and being an artist having an audience the track has a quirky little indie pop intro but eventually explodes into some roaring alternative rock and power pop a bit of a Weezer vibe coming off the guitars and there are also some really insane experimental noisy transitions on this track from one section to another sounds that I can only begin to imagine the process of creating and the end is like this complete sonic 15 car pile up with just noises and what sounds like maybe even samples just kind of crashing into each other it's an absolutely freaky ending and shows that Caracara bonito on this record are as experimental as they are accessible I found many of the deep cuts on this album pretty gratifying as well these songs sometimes is a surprise lo-fi acoustic number about how life can be pretty unfair the song is both love and quaint also great the glistening synth-pop of the track dear future self yet another song in the band's catalogue about growing learning changing and essentially coming to terms with that now listen I would hate to in this review just tediously go over every single song explaining what it says and does but it's a little difficult to not give in to that temptation because there is so much versatility and diversity on time and place pretty much every track sounds different has its own personality which I admit was a little off-putting at first especially since the band's debut record was so clearly defined it had such a distinct sound and typically when a new group or the debut album breaks through with a new sound that's pretty recognizable they stick to that going forward this however it just does not hold true for time in place as the band dabbles and some instantly recognizable noise and twee pop on tracks like flying away and outside and while these musical styles are pretty tried and true and Caracara bonito stick very closely to the blueprints of each of them the harmonious and fuzzy and blissful scents and guitars they work into these tracks are really bright flavorful fun far from bland and generic even if the band's intent on some of these tracks is to sound kind of easygoing there are a few tracks in the track listing I thought were just okay but the closest the entire album comes to delivering a dud has to be the song dump and the track does have some cool elements to it I don't mind Sarah's vocals I think the gurgling synth bass on the track is cool the moody chords set a nice tone but I just wish the song built up from its very meager low-key intro just a bit more than it actually does the song visiting hours sonically is a little middle-of-the-road and the closing song rest stop is almost experimental to a fault with the instrumental at the midpoint of the song totally breaking down to the point where it essentially devolves into Sarah singing quietly against a cycling sequence drum beat with a lot of sputtering glitching noise and Static as unpleasant as some parts of this track are I actually really admire the risk the band took here and the left hook that they pulled the rug they pulled out from under everybody at the very finish of this album overall I love this record I think it's sweet I think it's really fun it may be a change of pace that some fans are not ready for that they don't want and maybe I was even feeling that way a little bit on my initial listen but after visiting and again and again and again I cannot deny that this record is pretty much on par with bonito generation in that it features really quality songwriting solid performances colorful and creative production thoughtful lyrics sticky melodies sweet instrumentation and it's just really cute as hell okay and now all of these things that have been great about kkb are being complemented with a really noisy somewhat experimental veneer I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given

c_oRpnnMVIs,ah hug me hug tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for Iravan ooh Tim Hecker album kono yo this is the newest album from Canadian native experimental music super producer and the creator of my favorite album of 2013 virgins Tim Hecker he has returned to his longtime label cranky to release his ninth full-length album kono yo definitely one of my most anticipated albums of the year especially since tim has produced some of my favorite records in the ambient and drone genres although I've had my issues with those accurate but not entirely descriptive labels for Tim's music while Tim's albums from haunt me all the way to love streams do have a particularly droney quality about them with many vast evocative soundscapes that just wash over the listeners mind and have taken on numerous shapes over the years whether it be the bright and overwhelming walls of sound on an imaginary country the apocalyptic piano dirges of rave death 1972 or the blurry and blissful fuzz of love streams but the very active and engaging sound play and compositional elements of Tim's tracks always read to me as being a bit more than just drone with many of his tracks featuring some pretty compelling melodies and chord progressions direct and to-the-point song lengths especially on virgins I wouldn't say Tim's music exactly hangs in the background plainly either as many of his best albums up until this point had uniquely and successfully straddled the line between direct and abstract ideas creating these strange but riveting sonic vignettes that typically weave together into a pretty cohesive and otherworldly experience as an entire album though I would argue this new record over here is kind of a change of pace for Tim in that comparatively I think it's a bit more of a challenge a bit more abstract a bit more formless than a bulk of the material tim has released over the years rather than hitting audiences with an experimental but brief into the point idea he really lets the open spaces on this new set of tracks speak for themselves with him embarking on song lengths not often seen on Tim Hecker albums with a few songs near ten minutes the closing track is 15 minutes the entire thing is 7 tracks long and rounds out at about an hour Tim does really give himself quite a bit of time to explore the musical and sonic themes he sets up for himself on these tracks removing the strong sense of urgency and direction that his albums are usually known for that set him apart from many other artists in the ambience onra in a way I think kono yo lives up to that genre label more than many other albums and Tim's discography do which by no means is necessarily a bad thing with the overall sound of this album I think Tim does embark on a slightly different style and aesthetic overall I would call the vibe of this record alien very clean and pristine for the most part and deliciously dystopian sure while this album is moody it certainly doesn't sound like the end of the world like some of Tim's best albums do and while it is textured I wouldn't call the sounds on this album harsh or distorted or super abrasive on top of that consider that this album was recorded in a temple just outside of Tokyo Japan with an ensemble of Japanese classical musicians and I'm not talking about Japanese musicians playing western classical music but Japanese musicians playing Japanese classical music and this traditional Japanese instrumentation does turn up on this record quite a bit and greatly influences the overall sonic aesthetic of this thing at some pretty pivotal points now musically speaking I wouldn't go as far as to say Tim has turned a new leaf or anything as he packs the songs on this album with the beautiful eerie and bittersweet chords harmonies and melodies that he's pretty much known for at this point even though there is a different instrumental delivery method on this thing and a sharp recording where each drum and string and a glitchy synthesizer and drone can be heard with crisp clarity this album for Tim Hecker fan should sound like pretty familiar territory there are a handful of moments on this album where I find the sound palette of these tracks to be a little underwhelming and not quite as refreshing as I would have hoped given the new setting and the collaborators Tim brings onto the album on moments like in mother earth phase and is a rose-petal I wouldn't say the compositions on these tracks are just indirect they're kind of aimless which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if the sounds or the instrumentation on these cuts were a bit bolder just had more to sink your teeth into but the ideas sonically and musically are pretty faint even during the emotional peaks of these tracks I don't really find the glacial and seamless synth drones on the track sodium codec aids to be that engaging either that being said though I do think on some of the tracks Tim does manage to make some very bold musical statements I have really come to enjoy the plucky glitched and fractured lead melodies of the track keyed out even if I do think the instrumentation doesn't really come together into a supremely cohesive way on this track in fact I would say that's part of the appeal of the song at least after I've listened to it so many times it's like every sound is doing everything it can to just not come together and yet it's all creating this incredibly potent moody space very successfully a similar sound palette comes together on the song death valley but in a much more cohesive composition the way the songs echoed chords and bass notes kind of balance off of one another as if they're kind of tumbling down into a cavern the track is like dark blissful ear candy it's gorgeous it's sublime and some of the synth passages on this track - sound like something out of a soundtrack to a desolate landscape in the 1980s like you know a 1980 sci-fi film the song this life in my opinion is a really gratifying opening track almost sounds like a better version of the electro-acoustic experimentations that ended up on Tim and Daniel low Pitons collaborative record instrumental tourists the track features these strange high-pitched harmonies that are constantly ascending and descending it sounds like they're literally melting in the mix pair those sounds with dark synth bass and some very strange eerie lead melodies and it's it's a wonderful sound the song across an O yo is a somewhat intriguing finish to the album it has multiple passages to it a light drone some odd instrumental samples and clips some freaky and almost unpredictable synth melodies that are really distorted really fuzz down a fuzzy distorted heavy drone that kind of loses weight over time and eventually gives way to another set a very high-pitched harmonies ringing out into oblivion the transitions between all of these portions are kind of sudden a little awkward don't exactly build up that much tension or momentum it just sort of seems like Tim is slipping from one sound to the next though I do find the the Tambor's of the instrumentation to be kind of intriguing and it does have a strong mood to it overall I would say kono yo it's a pretty decent album and somewhat interesting attempt at bringing some new sounds and ideas into Tim Hecker's catalogue the fact that the compositions on this thing are a bit more vast and open yes it's a change of pace and maybe not my favorite approach for Tim to take but I feel like the the greatest misstep that this album makes is in its handful of moments because there aren't that many tracks on this record the instrumentation can't come off occasionally kind of bland lifeless the sounds just ain't that bold and really sit in these lengthy cuts and soak them in is something I think I would be much more excited to do if Tim's sound play were just a tad bit sharper and it is on some of the tracks here but on at least several of the cuts a little underwhelming and with kono yo featuring just seven tracks far fewer than many other Tim Hecker albums that means a lot of eggs are being put into fewer baskets all that being said though I don't think it's a bad album I think it's pretty decent and most certainly hardcore fans are gonna love this no matter what I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this one

EHNTRu_ocH4,it's here it's here it's finally here it's here it's here it's finally here it's here it's here it's finally here it's here it's here it's finally here it's here finally here it's the near tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new little wayne album the Carter v this is the long-awaited fifth installment in little Wayne's the Carter series and now my knees been waiting years to release has been teasing for a long time now after an incredibly dramatic series of ups and downs between Wayne and his former collaborator business partner and mentor Birdman Wayne and Birdman actually just wrapped up a lengthy several year legal battle which ended in Wayne now fully owning Young Money Records so now with Wayne and full control of the label he is free to release music on that label as he pleases and thus the Carter v has arrived now back in 2012 when Wayne was originally announcing the Carter five he simultaneously was talking about this potentially being his last album not sure if calling it quits is still the plan at this point especially since he hasn't exactly been quiet on the music front during his inability to release c5 he came out with the free wayne album a t-pain collaboration a 2 Chainz collaboration the sixth installment of his dedication series and also the no ceilings two mixtape not to mention the reception of c5 so far among fans and publications has been pretty positive in my opinion Wayne's return on this record has served as a reminder of the deep ripples of influence that he still has on new artists today from young thug to little Ossie vert Kodak black Drake and of course Kendrick Lamar and I say that because Wayne is kind of back in rare form on this new album reminding listeners of what made him so compelling as a rapper in the first place lots of inventive and hilarious one-liners and wordplay infectious flows a very creaky voice and odd personality and an for melody and topical songwriting when he wants to focus on it and there is a fair deal of all of that throughout c5 but maybe this album is taken to the point where it sort of wears out its welcome as the entire project is about twenty three tracks long and almost ninety minutes and even though Wayne is historically a pretty versatile artist I don't know if he's the kind of artist that can truly fill up 90 minutes of engaging material just kind of seems like he's giving in to the trend of overloading your records with too many tracks to rack up those streams although in this case I kind of understand Wayne's situation considering how long it's taken to get this album out maybe there was just a lot of material build up because if he had dropped this album in 2014 there are definitely a good chunk of tracks on this thing that that would not have even existed to be placed onto this record like the song let it fly featuring Travis Scott which considering the song pretty much features Travis's trademark sound is very trippy psychedelic trap style pretty much sounding like something off of his 2015 record rodeo or his next record burns in the trap the year later there's no way this track could have been on this album had Wayne originally released it in 2014 and even though the track is a little much thanks to Kendricks over-the-top performance the song Monalisa pretty much sounds like Kenny right in the midst of the - pimp a butterfly era mostly due to his flow his vocal inflections and his sheer willingness to get right into character in the song as Kendrick pretty much plays the victim of a setup chick set on to him by Wayne and I do want to mention that even though this song for me at first was a little weird and off-putting I have come to appreciate Wayne's flow and performance on this track a lot more it's pretty intense and impassioned meanwhile the tracks start this off right sounds like a very smooth radio-friendly relic from the bling era nevermind 2012 if you told me this track was recorded in 2005 I might believe you especially since Wayne took the time to dig up Mac main and Ashanti on this thing it's kind of catchy he has a very high nostalgia factor not exactly the best track on here though and lyrically underwhelming in comparison with a lot of the other cuts hear the song open safe also has a similarly dated and stale style still though the Carter five does have a lot of fire tracks on it many of them appearing in the first leg of the album the song don't cry featuring xxx tenth Ozzy owned a haunting and surreal starter song to the album with Wayne pretty much rapping about his life his mortality I've never really been a huge xx accident asean fan but i do have to say I was pretty impressed with how he took it to the emotional limit on the course of this cut as his singing is pretty chilling the song dedicate is Wayne sounding more charismatic and energized than ever over a very funky trap instrumental with a piano emphasizing the upbeat Wayne pretty much delivers relentless flows lots of playful bars funny and quirky references I love that one line he busts out on this thing where he says something like give me time I'm the bomb also the series of bars where he continues to come back to the word rock but in different contexts and shapes and forms it's all pretty sharp and witty song uproar with Swizz Beatz banger alert banger alert boo boo boo banger alert holy crap the screaming crowd samples on this thing the twang e ringing melodies the kick clap patterns this beat thumps and wanes flows are pretty great not that they're super flashy or super fast but they hit a great groove this thing is especially satisfying considering how much of a dud the recent Swizz Beatz single featuring Wayne was I was kind of assuming that this track would give similar results the Afro mention let it fly with Travis Scott is a highlight on the record Wayne and Travis I wouldn't say they go down new territory or anything but they certainly complement each other really well with their respective styles and then there's Dark Side of the Moon with Nicki Minaj which unfortunately is not the lyrical onslaught that it could have been given that it's Wayne given that it's Nicki but instead this track is a very moody and intergalactic love song that's actually not that bad I mean the lyrics are pretty flowery and compelling and pretty the choruses very glossy and the vocals soar and paired with each other really well Wayne and Nicki harmonized quite nicely I really do think Wayne puts his best foot forward on this record however it doesn't take him that long to create a low on the album with a series of very forced and formulaic slow jams and a couple of filler tracks like these song problems which pretty much sounds like a plane trap number where Wayne is vocally and lyrically riffing his performance seems pretty sloppy and unkempt not nearly as laser focused and electrifying as some of the other cuts here B song what about me is an attempt at a very glitzy and heartbroken trap ballad with these artificial glossy lead vocals that sound absolutely sanitized and horrendous Wayne's cringe-worthy cries on the song for affection don't really make swallowing the track any easier what about me open letter is another interestingly introspective moment for Wayne on the album but the song pretty much feels structured like a diatribe about some pretty urgent issues death and his depression and his children but without a strong instrumental and a strong song to carry it the message kind of loses impact the momentum on the album kind of picks back up around the Snoop Dogg track the feature on that cut is pretty great but the whole record never really regains the consistency that it had in its initial moments even though it does continue to dish out highlights here and there like the cold-blooded banger hittas which almost sounds like something Drake could have done on if you're reading this but Wayne brings so much more edge to this track that B is incredible - speaking of which where is Drake on this record where is Drizzy we need Drizzy we need champagne poppy on this thing regardless I think the song used to is also pretty hard-hitting in fantastic also took his time which is this loving track about fate and God and Wayne essentially being thankful the two to a higher power for taking taking time on him which is a pretty touching sentiment also the track features a winning vocal line which pretty much makes the entire song and then the album has a triumphant somewhat feel-good closer where yes Wayne does seem to face death and talk about how essentially right now he's kind of living a second life he's come back but the songs ultimate message is kind of about him persevering and letting all the bad things in his life as long as he continues to push just work out the issue though in the second half of this album as many great moments as there are each fantastic track on this thing is met with somewhat mediocre or underwhelming one B song mess lives up to its title for completely unintended reasons the song demon features the most Awkward application of a flow on the entire album especially during its initial moments I can see what Wayne technically was trying to do playing off of the groove of the beat and fitting into the tempo in an odd way but it just sounds really awkward and out of place overall I think this album is a decent comeback for the Carter series it's certainly better than the Carter four and actually surpasses a good deal of the commercial material that Wayne has been releasing since the Carter three that is not exactly a super high bar to jump over though and given how long this album is it's pretty inconsistent and very much a mixed bag in terms of sound style quality I can appreciate that Wayne tried to bring a lot of variety into this album to prevent it from being boring and for the most part I think that works but the whole thing is really too inconsistent to be enjoyed from front to back and the best moments of this album leave a diminished impression because they're surrounded by so many tracks that are just okay I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music music music forever 
LbhRrs9mQcw,duh buh duh buh duh buh buh hi everyone dance Sonique raise tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the brand-new sort of new Lupe Fiasco album drogas wave this is the newest full-length LP from Lupe Fiasco a quick follow-up to last year's drogas light project which for some reason feels way further in the distant past than it actually is but yeah just came out of 2017 I did not love the first installment of drogas but I thought there was a lot of good material on it it certainly surpasses what Lupe has delivered during the dregs of his career lasers and food and liquor - and friend of the people but since releasing his conceptual and multi-phased Tetsuo and youth handful of years ago Lupe has been back on a nice consistent quality level so I was definitely looking forward to this new album over here Lupe's past missteps though still do haunt me to this day so I did go into this new album a little worried about a few different things will Lupe pick good instrumentals and featured artists on this album will he avoid the annoying insanitary glitz of some of his past and worst records and with this album being even longer than Tetsuo and youth like an hour and 40 minutes will every track on this thing be great because yes this album is yet another huge undertaking from Lupe for his fans with 24 tracks and unfortunately this album doesn't really have a grand concept pulling all of these songs together or numerous phases to separate them into various parts it just sounds like a collection of various tracks and personally I wasn't really all that compelled by Lupe's Twitter explanation that the record is kind of a double album I mean it certainly explains how the first half of the record has a stronger narrative and set of themes to it than the last half but it doesn't change that the record loses focus at one point after a little vocal snippet interlude sonically and stylistically it's kind of all over the place even if on a lyrical level Lupe does continually return to themes of racism and injustice the african-american experience also motivation and self-preservation on the front cover of this record Lupe depicts a manila bracelet casting a shadow these bracelets were actually used as a form of currency for purchasing slaves a subject matter that Lupe explores on several of the most powerful tracks on this record wav files gold versus the right thing to do and Manila there's also the slave ship interlude which is this eerie beautiful and weepy violin piece that lasts a bold three minutes and is a very unique inclusion into a hip-hop album any hip-hop album my general view on the production on this record though it's pretty sick Lupe makes a lot of great beat choices on this thing whether he's hopping on top of layer jazzy instrumentals with kind of an old-school flair or maybe even some spacey psychedelic or mystical trap the sound of this record is not that bad I'm not going to say the production on this thing is futuristic or cutting edge or inventive it's not but it's certainly tasteful I guess it's a bit more layered and thoughtful than a lot of the more generic track beats that you may run into there these days and it certainly provides a very colorful and dramatic platform for loop Bay's lyrical concepts gives them a bit more urgency weight a sense of emotional significance I will say this thing is 24 tracks so there are at least a couple of spots on this record where I think the instrumental really ruins the appeal of the album and Lupe is lyrical efforts like on the track EXO which is really just one dubstep breakdown away from sounding like Lupe is rapping over yet another piece of overproduced EDM which the track might as well be especially with Troy irons artificially glossy vocals soaring on the hook there are also numerous tracks on this thing that feature vocal contributions from one Nicki Jean a singer that prior to this album I don't really think I was all that familiar with and it's not that she comes off as a bad singer but on nearly every track that she is featured Lupe and his Purdue apply her voice in pretty much the same way they wash it out with tons of reverb they layer to the point where there's a lot of psychedelic bleed and it just sounds really messy granted there are some spots on the album where this application makes sense like on the track down which lyrically is a song that is filled with nautical themes so I guess I appreciate this effort to make the song sound like it's underwater though I do wonder how sensible it is to be rapping and singing affectionately about dolphins and the Kingdom of Atlantis right after depicting slaves being subjected to a watery grave on a sinking slave ship I get the conceptual transition that Lupe is trying to make here but I just wonder if it really makes sense to go from a really awful and grim and dark reality to in ocean fantasy but again this isn't really the only song on drogas that sounds like this by the time the songs stronger hits this watery washed-out Reaver be vocal hook formula that Lupe has worked out with Nikki Jean is really getting tired old and wearing out its welcome even if Lou Pez bars do somewhat make up for the drab instrumental sound now as far as the rapping goes on this record we all know at this point Lupe can't rap especially when he has a topic or a focus in mind every once in a while on this album Lupe dishes out a semi woke words salad with some good lyrical gems here and there that's really when lyrically he's at his most underwhelming there's also the track stack that cheese which in my opinion is the musical equivalent to a faceplant it's kind of a satirical meta number about becoming a rapper with a tedious flow a basic beat and in winning bars I get what he's trying to lampoon here and that the song sounds really tongue-in-cheek in order to make a point but while I appreciate Lupe satire and some of the jabs he's throwing out here in the attempt to kind of parody what he's making fun of I I think he's just really made an unlistenable song all that being said though I do love a great deal of what Lupe does on this album the first leg of the album from Manila to wav files is incredible and actually combines together into sort of a store and a narrative a narrative that I wish Lupe douve into a bit further beyond the handful of tracks that he does in fact I think it's one of this album's greatest disappointments that Lupe breaks the streak that he has going on with this songs and fractures this album into a million different directions still though I do love the closing track on this thing mural jr. it is a powerful finish to the album propelled by marching drums and soaring strings almost sounds like an old school college dropout Eric Kanye track lupus flow on the song is great his delivery is really compelling all of his lyrics kind of touched down on what seems like humanity's potential and mortality and faith the song imagined features a very laid-back instrumental and a fat B this B is fat it's a fat as hell but you just had to stress that and the song is actually really funny interesting trip backwards into who pays come up in his career and despite the the lows that he is hit along the way he pretty much decides that he wouldn't change a single thing then I would like to point attention to the tracks Johnny love forever and Alan forever two powerful tributes to young lives lost one a baby girl the other child refugee both are amazingly produced the former features a lovely vocal sample from the one and the only soap and skin by way of a vocal feature from another track both songs are haunting their triumphant they're gorgeous they're sad they're also hopeful as living lyrically reimagines both of their lives as if they had lived and fought up the great things that both of these children might have gone on to do the song kingdom is an interesting blend of trap and reggae featuring some guest vocals from Damian Marley as well as what sounds like a giant child chorus loop a lyrically tributes places like port-au-prince and Kingston and South Central depicting these places as kingdoms and getting down to themes of self-preservation and the sanctity of life specifically when it comes to the black communities that live in these areas Damian and Lupe's vocals come together for a very powerful instrumental finish toward the end of the song with their voices layering on top of each other in building these on cripple is a luscious jazz back throwback with some fantastic flows gorgeous flute melodies from Elena Pender Hughes who you might remember as a Christian Scott collaborator and the track quotations from Chairman fred is a multi-phased motivational diatribe that tries to inspire listeners not just on a personal front but also a political and a spiritual front too and these are just a few of many highlights on this album overall I think this is yet another quality record from Lupe in what is a pretty consistent and third act of his career so far although I think this album could have been made better if it had been stripped back to its best moments that being said though for the 90 plus minutes that this thing lasts there's not that many tracks I would disregard as total filler again themes of freedom and struggle and self-preservation and racial and justice come up again and again and again on this album but I think a lot of these stories and ideas would have had greater impact had Lupe just brought this album down to its best moments thankfully though even though this record doesn't have a tight flow or a strong narrative concept running throughout all the songs a lot of these tracks individually are pretty strong on their own whether or not they all connect and work together in some sort of grand fashion doesn't necessarily make or break the album but still it would have been nice feeling a light to decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it to je8 it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which an Eyre view

GlTGDXpFiHE,ahem ahem ahem hi everyone anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and you know what time it is it's time for a weekly track roundup where i go over what i felt were the best and worst tracks of this past week first i want to shout out our sponsor in this video the good people over at sea geek if you didn't know about them they are an app that aggregates ticket prices from all across the web to make ticket purchasing simple they put a 0 to 100 score on each ticket to let you know if you're getting a good deal or a bad one Green is good red is bad and they're in app view from scene lets you see where you're going to sit enter code drop to get $20 off your first order click on the link in the description below to download the app and get more info sea geek ba-bam all right also of course of course of course of course as always our Amazon and turntable lab associate links are down below hit up that turntable lab link get yourself a record turntable speakers some audiophile stuff we get kicked back from it supports the channel supports the segment and a few more shout outs want to give a shout out to this new track from the one and only st. Vincent this is a slow slow disco so she's kind of come out with a another version of the song slow disco and now this new track is like a very stripped back and lovely little piano ballad version it's quite nice it's quite nice Matthew Deere electronic music producer and songwriter Matthew Deere has seen fit to remix every single song from the new MGMT album we have linked you to one of the tracks below give it a shot try it out pretty neat also Colella a track from her last full length record which was definitely one of the more abstract R&B albums of the decade the track waitin has a new Kate Renata mix out do give that a shot and Fleet Foxes the famed indie fulk outfit Fleet Foxes they had a b-sides collection from 2006-2009 dropping and there's a song below linked in the shout-out section from that that you can try out too and Deerhoof have a little band camp up attached to a 7-inch where I guess they play the music of the shining you can preview a track from it pretty interesting not something I would have ever expected from Deerhoof but what do you know alright let's get into the tracks I thought were the worst tracks this week making good time in this episode alright a few minutes then are any in the worst tracks but BAM let's go this new track from ti featuring young thug titled the weekend is a very messy trapped auto-tuned pile of blah and TI absolutely sounds dreadful on the song young thug does his thing very predictably as you kind of would guess he would given the high profile feature and the generic trap beat it's it's really just spectacularly unspecial and offensively so next the band spiritual cramp have come out with a brand new single the erasure which I found to be horrendously awkward and demented to the point where it was just unenjoyable some of these weird or more experimental elements I think worked to their benefit on the police-state EP next to my head over here that dropped earlier this year but for whatever reason I think a lot of those elements are totally working against them in this new song and music video moving out from their new song shallow from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper from the upcoming film a star is born a retelling of an older story from an older film by the same name it's essentially about two fictional country stars who were once regular folk and they're being played by a rich girl from New York and the son of a stockbroker a peak culture if you ask me they live out their love in the spotlight and it's it's just an an emotional rollercoaster I guess is all one can say can't can't really say I cared that much for the overly dramatic and showy ballad can't say I am interested all that much in the storyline and the plot it's just gonna have to be a film that I don't know maybe maybe I'll read boxed in one day after after a binge on something illegal moving out from there a new coheed and cambria track old flames which sounds like just really annoying prog pop emo just never really been in the band sound and they continue to prove to me exactly why I've never been into the band sound alright let's get into the tracks I thought were meh not terrible but not blowing me away either but certainly worth your attention I thought if you're into some of these artists let's go number one now unknown the blue moon let's learn to talk unknown mortal Orchestra have a new record on the way the new song that they have released here is called Han way oh six and it is it is one of many tracks named just in you know numerical order Hanna why oh six oh seven oh eight it's basically an instrumental album that the band recorded while they were in Vietnam with a guest collaborator and it sounds like a trippy jazzy experimental wild little session and kind of thinking the first taste of it over here is pretty neat give it a shot definitely an interesting turn of creative events for unknown immortal orchestra didn't know this would ever be a style of album they'd be interested in recording or releasing moving on from there a tear mellows have a new track out Lemon Grove Rob Crowe and Yvette Rob Crowe appears on the track yeah the guitar work is interesting weird grooves and riffs and time signatures and that sort of thing Tara mellows is a math rock band you know what you're getting but I didn't really care for the way that they layered their vocals on top of the rock instrumentation although that that typically ends up being the case for me with Tara mellows but for longtime fans that they're probably fine with it they probably like it at this point moving on from there Mick Jenkins Chicago rapper drops a relatively short but wordy and smart track titled elephant in the room looking forward when he drops a new full-length project again so he has been pretty active keeping his name out there so I'm sure that's going to happen sooner rather than then later moving on from their Kodak black if I'm lying I'm flying a brand new single from him where the production and his vocal recording and his flow just sounds a little bit more straightforward cleaner and more enjoyable than usual Kodak sounds a bit more I guess on the ball not as kind of falling all over the place vocally you know not not that I don't mind a bit of an accent or a drawl on my vocals you know that's completely fine but there are some moments when I hear him rapping it just sort of sounds like he's not all there in the studio you know or he's obviously inhibited in in some kind of way which I think hurts his performance but here it sounds like he's a he's really clean and focused and I think it's resulted in a better listen moving on from their Juicy J and Travis Scott team up on a brand new single titled neighbor travis has uh some pretty big showy vocals on the track and juicy de j handles the verses on here it's it's pretty much to be expected not really the explosive sort of collision of names and worlds that I hoped it would be given just how great juicy was on a Travis's rodeo but I guess they can't all be winners moving on from there J IDK with Q to fool on this brand new track electric I thought would be a bit more exciting but it's just kind of a standard trap flavored piece of pop rap the instrumentation is a bit easier then then maybe your standard track in this style though Irian moody is is kind of the flavor of the day pretty straightforward into the point and hooky for jail though I'm not sure if I will predict this track is sort of going viral or anything like that and Empress of has a nice little synth pop single out titled love for me maybe not as memorable as the single she dropped just a few weeks ago but um still pretty sweet still pretty sweet alright let's move on to the tracks I thought were the best ones this week best tracks best tracks quite a few because a lot of songs did stand out to me this week first production from Kenney beats rappers Zack Foxx Square up this thing is a nasty disgusting gross violent banger that totally crushed my skull and blew me away really impressed with Zacks over-the-top and aggressive performance on this track Kenny's production is as hard-hitting and I love how distorted and heavy and just I went the the beat sounds but I love how he leaves a lot of space in there for Zack to go completely insane and for a lot of his bar so just really stick moving on from there this new track over here comes by way of a recommendation from a good friend of mine on the internet a man who goes by the name of Clun er he turned me on to this rapper who goes by the name of what her her name is tiny jag and I'm not familiar with her work but she has this new kind of like double-sided track out titled riding and cut her hair and I thought it was really goofy and awkward at first and the only way that I could come to describe it is that it sounds pretty much like Grimes doing a trap song or basically like somebody wants to make trap rap but is is really hugely into Grimes music and in the the second half of the track she almost has like a bit of a princess nokia vibe I would say but I do think she has some clever lyrics on this track the beat is really eerie her melodic flow and her inflection is very odd again even though this comparison for me was really obvious I can't think of a whole lot of rappers that sound just like her so I don't know shout out to her shout out to her its it sounds like she has some cool shit going on with her music and it's definitely something I'll be looking out for in the future moving on from there got to give a shout out to the good people over at accelerator they run a really great electronic music blog and they turn me on to this great great great producer out of Detroit who has a couple of really sweet tracks out titled void and corruption guy by the name of sins star and I definitely want to point you guys to this corruption track it is an insanely intricate rhythmically complex piece of electronic music that's maybe a little drum and bass influenced it's super minimalist as well as there's not a whole lot of layers to it but the layers that are involved are very busy and very hard-hitting I love how just simultaneously the track feels like I'm processing it very intently because there's so much going on and yet it almost feels kind of skeletal it feels really really stripped down in a way and raw and exciting so really kind of loving what this this guy is doing with his production so far it just seems like some really no BS very focused and very cutting edge electronic music moving out from there shad rapper shad has a new track out a very urgent track with a lot of socially charged lyrics these stone throwers stone throwers is the name of the new cut there's a lot of very important and if I didn't use this word already you know excuse me but again urgent issues that he addresses on this track and he does it in a very smart and a lyrical fashion you know to me this song as short as it is though it's it's very much like sounding the alarms like this shit is not okay this shit is not fucking normal like what the hell it's it's a pretty significant track and definitely one of the most fiery and I'll say it again urgent songs that I've really ever heard shad drop and typically it stuff is you know can be pretty uplifting can be pretty inspiring you know and not to say that if someone makes that kind of music they always have to make that kind of music but this song definitely struck me because it really had a strong note of darkness that I think a lot of his other songs don't don't usually have moving on from there I got turned on to this artist via the good people over a Stereogum Rose doll hush just awesome really creatively layered and off-the-beaten-path indie folk over here with some gorgeously composed vocals and instrumentation not the boldest and most out-there sound I've heard in this genre but but very nicely assembled and again the melodies are very pretty I'm moving on from there shoutout once more to the good people over at an accelerator they turned me on to another song over here from producer by the name of Purdue Sarah mosa is the name of this new track and it has a driving kick drum and what sounds like a lot of acoustic primal instrumentation all over the track it is a nice piece of electro acoustic production with a great groove great beat and a lot of interesting vocal samples a lot of interesting foreign vocal samples laced into it too moving on from there Muse have a brand new track out simulation Theory forthcoming record very soon if you guys have been checking out the single so far you know that they are on a bit of a an 80s synth e throwback jag and believe it or not I think this new track they have just chops is pretty great it's called pressure and it's actually a really fun pop rock single the the the whole ad shtick is is limited a bit more to just the music video than the song itself but the guitar leads and the the hooks on the the the the the the hooks vocals is basically what I want to point out here are actually pretty sharp and again pretty fun even though it is a very tightly and cleanly produced piece of pop rock there's still a bit of an edge to a good group sounds very lively and kind of enjoying it there's a sweet bit of CAM penis to it that i think is is really fun interesting to see muse and a point in their career where they're not taking themselves too seriously I guess moving out from there want to give a shout out to this metal outfit by the name of Joe vara I hope I'm saying their name correctly they have a new record out with several tracks on it this is one of them the putrid stench of rotting flesh it is a lengthy brutal and hard-hitting piece of what sounds like black metal fused with crust punk it's pretty nasty it's pretty freakin nasty and the performance is animalistic too far too often there are a lot of black metal bands out there just sort of seems like you know they hit the fast strums they hit that blast speed and they just kind of hang there and then after a while it just becomes white noise these guys it really kind of seems like they're putting a lot of muscle into every drum hit into every guitar strum into every lick every vocal just really seems like everything's up to freakin 11 and I'm liking that one more fucked up Dosher dreams new record on the way and they have seen fit to drop some more material from that album the song that I wanted to point out is accelerate and you know I'm actually kind of impressed with what the band is doing with this latest string of material because it seems like they're putting in more effort to build multiple phases into these songs build more vocal versatility into these songs and also with the way that they layer noise and guitars on this track it's actually vaguely shoegazing and kind of experimental too though still the drums and riffs are very hard-hitting very straightforward and keep the I guess the energy and the the impact of the song high but there are a lot of interesting little sonic tidbits lace throughout some points of the track that that make it a little cerebral and kind of interesting to dive into and kind of explore - so it's throttling it's adrenaline pumping it's exciting but there's some cool shifts and compositional phases in it end us interesting sonic experimentation - so shout out to them you know and I'm actually looking forward to this record and it's the first time in a long time I've been looking forward to anything this band does because in and not to be mean and nasty and pick on the band but I've just always thought they kind of overdid Punk to the point where it's like we to the point where it I feel like they've kind of lost the appeal of the genre but to me this doesn't strictly feel as much like a punk record as much as it does like a post-punk or a noise rock or kind of an experimental punk record or an experimental rock record with some Punk elements thrown in there you know seems like a bit more of a sensible balance of influences in my opinion moving on from there I think there's the last track no second last track that I wanted to shout out Clarence clarity has a new single out a new record on the way if you guys haven't heard fantastic pop producer real I mean I can't even just say pop because he does everything but a amazing producer Clarence clarity new record on the way rafters with a j.crew is the name of this new single now Clarence in the past when he has in the recent past when he has worked with rappers in his music while the results had been decent I have been a little skeptical as to how this would pan out into the future though for a guy like him as versatile as he is I could see the temptation to do that and and given the current zeitgeist I see and I understand the need to do that but despite my skepticism and my worry this new track with a j.crew is actually fantastic not only does AJ kill it on this track but Clarence is approach to producing this beat which is a fusion of like pop production but also hip hop production - is absolutely insane kaleidoscopic overwhelming exciting and eargasm ik this great beat and i cannot wait for this dude to drop this this new full-length album i hope more people are paying attention to his music in general into this forthcoming record that then his last record was paid attention to because i feel like he just not get enough respect on that record because it really was such an inventor pop album and finally want to shout out bad bad not good and little dragon teaming up for a brand new single the single is titled tried and it's a funky laid-back beautiful little ballad with some some nice vocals from little dragons some cool drumbeats from bad bad not good I just kind of seemed like a pretty plain and obvious fusion of the both of them and their respective sounds and styles but the tune is good so can't really dislike or fault the track for any clear reason just kind of seemed like a pretty funky straightforward chill laid-back ballad that was very nice and pleasant on the ears you know certainly a collaboration that I think could have gone over much worse than it actually did I'm pretty pleased that this turned out as good as it did so that has been the weekly track roundup everybody those are all the tracks that I would love to point your attention to remember to hit up our sponsor over a seat geek if you want to get some tickets in a convenient fashion because again they do support the segment they do support the show and I hope y'all are doing well hope you got some good recommendations out of this video remember all the songs we talked about are down there linked in the description box and I will catch you in the next one love you forever 
cLBp15wFKkE,okay okay okay hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well it is the end of September we are getting into October before we dive too deeply into the month and I start diving into all of those releases and reviews I would like to get out a great albums video where I go over my favorite records of the past month and a little bit from August as well because I didn't cover all of August with my last great albums videos so let me list these off you can find links to check out reviews for all of the records I am listing in this video so please do not let these albums slip by you because I do think they are pretty sick I do think they are worth your time for one the new George Clinton album this record is a lot of different things it is an electronic release it's kind of a shoegaze ear Elyse it's a synth pop release it's also a breakup album of sorts I don't think it quite sticks the landing it's a little short and in a bit of a meager release I wanted a bit more out of it but I still think it's a quality album that has some great tracks on it and has a pretty unique combination of musical styles and influences coming together on its its high points are incredibly high even if it doesn't end up being one of my favorite favorite albums of the year next the new Louis Cole album time if you are into very soulful playful tongue-in-cheek jazzy pop music give this thing a shot guys got a lot of personality and I think the Thundercat fans will like it the new HM Ltd ep these guys were kind of taken goth rock and pop to a new modernized level with this short series of very fun and entertaining tracks they're kind of throwing it back to the 80s in the UK very tastefully with some great production and songs also want to give a nod to the new blood-orange album Negro Swan which is a beautiful gorgeous luscious and dreamy mix of throwback R&B and synth funk definitely Devante Heinz best record yet under the blood orange name some pretty socially charged lyrics and song topics on this thing too and it's it's a very seamless listen as well with a lot of the tracks flowing into each other and creating this very atmospheric wavy intoxicating experience next the new guerrilla toss album twisted crystal some of you may remember me praising the band's last full-length album GT ultra where they embarked on a lot of the freakier more experimental elements of art pop and post-punk you know think Devo think XTC but much weirder and a little bit more fun in some respects this new album over here twisted crystal it carries over a lot of those same elements but the band are working out some more experimental musical passages some more psychedelic musical passages I do think that hinders the accessibility of the album a little bit but it is I think a bolder statement than their last album which is certainly saying something moving on from there Armin hammers new record paraffin which is easily one of the best abstract hip-hop releases you're gonna hear this year Billy woods and a lucid trade excellent and esoteric bars all over this record against really creative and surreal unsettling and very strange dark and grim production cannot overemphasize how fantastic the beats on this record are next they new no-name album room 25 if you love your hip hop soulful thoughtful conscious passionate low-key intimate close to the chest this record is gorgeous it is beautiful it is personal and will will most likely if if if not become one of your favorite albums of the year it will certainly read to you as a very memorable and a very unique musical experience for the year that you will most likely have a positive experience with because the there a there ain't a whole lot of this going on in hip hop music right now I'll say that much it's a beautiful little record it is a wonderful again intimate personal little album next really enjoy that new effects twin EP the collapse ap Richard B James puts together some of the most intense dense bustling and experimental IDM that he has released in a while short collection of tracks but again super super enjoyable very sharp and complex too in a great way moving on from there the new idols album joy as an act of resistance the UK art punk and post-punk band is back with a very sharp and very political very socially charged and heavy and punchy and exciting collection of songs that are just blistering their revolutionary I think they speak truth to power I think they challenge a lot of really shitty present-day social norms and simultaneously speak to the the good and potential of mankind so I'm enjoying that quite a bit next I enjoyed also the two new igloo ghosts EPS he recently dropped the sister EPS one I prefer a tad bit more than the other but they are both two more installments of igloos already incredibly bold and imaginative sound of very bustling and futuristic and kaleidoscopic electronic music the beats are just wonderful do just continues to kill it and again is one of the more unique and cutting-edge producers out there today in my opinion also want to shadow the new hermit and the recluse album Orpheus versus the sirens this is a collaborative hip hop album featuring Brownsville zone kha who I have reviewed on the channel quite a few times before I have noted and have celebrated his very unique dark deep Spacey and very minimalist rap style dude spits rhymes at a very very low pace at a very very understated delivery however his pen game is incredible his double entendre is his word choice the coded language and the symbolism he brings to each track on this thing is incredible in the way that he works mythology on this record obviously with the title being Orpheus versus the sirens just something that you rarely see in hip-hop music such bold references to Greek mythology and I am going to leave it at that those are essentially my recommendations for this month hopefully you guys check out these records any of them that again may have slipped by you give him a shot give him your time because again I wouldn't be pushing these albums out there one more time if I didn't think they were worth a shot and didn't stand out some of the more unique releases I have heard this year transition over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or

BbtNEZizabs,
gg0jnJwce3w,hi everyone slam for the jam tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new hosiery EP Nina cried power this is the newest EP from Irish singer-songwriter Andrew hozier Byrne who started turning heads after dropping a surprised mega hit back in 2014 with the track take me to church a pretty good track that kicked off a debut album that didn't really do all that much for me at the time as the album pretty much presented a mix of arena folk some groovy blues rock and pop soul as well as a lot of Hootin and Hollerin gospel music made incredibly melodramatic with a reverb eachine placed on the group vocals the keys the guitars honestly I just didn't really think that much of the full-length album the instrumental presentation was similarly grand in scope and aesthetic too like some of Sam Smith's more organic tracks the vocals kind of fell short for me in terms of emotion and range and personality and the songwriting style just came off as kind of plain underneath the Grande layers of vocals especially with more saccharine moments on the album like someone new now from what I understand this guy has a new album on the way soon this EP is kind of setting the tone for that in a way Nina cried power this thing I think is pretty much floating the title track as a future hit song much in the way they take me to church EP did in 2013 and as much as I like this track I'm just not sure if it will end up making as big a splash as church I could end up putting my foot in my mouth over this but I am going to predict no merely on the basis that this song is not nearly as plain and formulaic as take me to church the lyrics aren't as clear and cliched the instrumental does have some points that get pretty dense and a little overwhelming however I do hope Nina cried Power does well as a song does well as a single because I think it's an infinitely better track personally there are some super punchy drums great groove good clear crisp recording and some great lead vocals to write at the start of this thing the forlorn heavy ringing piano chords are a nice touch on this track to then as the song progresses we kind of get the usual suspects with hozier we get those ghostly gospel sized background vocals that start to take shape as the hook busts in we get nods to Nina Simone Billie Holiday and Mavis Staples who actually turns up vocally on this track when she goes to back Andrew up on the hook to this thing it's actually a chilling moment on the song gorgeous and passionate a very immense moment on an urgent track that once you read into the lyrics of it you will pick up most likely a lot of themes of power and injustice and division the touches of organs on the track are really nice as well there's a groovy bridge on this thing too it is a very tight and meticulously assembled cut and brings a very packed and wonderful three minutes and 45 seconds Andrew takes a much more low-key approach on the following track NF wmb the song features a subtle hypnotic and ominous instrumental the atmosphere is colored with droney organ notes wintery vocal harmonies some sparkly acoustic guitars in a lot of ways the track reminds me of the very cerebral and psychedelic indie folk of the 2000s but just with greater production value grander presentation I also love the subtle heaviness of the song that pops in once the chorus gets going feels like a great show of power but also restrained because as as grand and as thick as the instrumentation feels it could go a lot louder and a lot harder I also love the vocal refrain on this track that whole nothing's fucking with my baby refrain I thought was really funny really sharp and and certainly brought the low-key aggression and darkness of this track home the song moment's silence felt like yet another overwrought piece of blues rock which could have landed on the last album it's like listening to ZZ Top if they were writing music for bearded Brooklynites as opposed to biker chicks and bar flies though I will say the song is not quite as drab as some of this projects previous material has been and the closing track sounds like a mix of a few different things most notably it's it's kind of like a boneless father John misty and lyrically speaking the way drue writes about love on this track it's not exactly exciting thrilling or inspiring it's better than Ed Sheeran but that's that's not much of a bar to pass and those are pretty much the four tracks to this EP I loved about half of it the rest of it I could take or very much leave and I I don't know with this forthcoming record I guess maybe I'm anticipating it a little bit although I just fear that the whole thing is going to be as spotty as what I've just heard here as spotty as the debut album don't get me wrong there are elements of hozier zyk that i think is really cool you know the vocals can be nice the instrumentation can have a real live route see and real feel to it but sometimes the substance of the songs it's a little uninteresting the style the aesthetic it's kind of I guess dime-a-dozen or not all that unique or original and not to say that originality is everything I mean this guy's music certainly stands out in the current mainstream music landscape that's for sure no doubting that not a lot of people at the level of popularity that this guy is at with the types of songs that he's writing but still having said that there are quite a few indie folk artists and indie songwriters who I think have very much done what this EP is doing but in a lot of ways better for the past 15 years or so so I guess I'm kind of wondering what exactly is so thrilling about some of the music that I'm hearing on this EP outside of it's somehow reaching a level of popularity and an audience that has most likely not run across a lot of this stuff before still though that being said I don't think this was an awful listen I'm feeling a light two decent six on this thing transition have you given this EP listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if

MSivWA97EdQ,
E4csHqVYJXo,I just love to wake up to the smell of flannels in the morning hi everyone you know who it is Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Brock Hampton album iridescent this is the long-awaited major label debut album from the best boy band since one direction Brock Hampton who rocketed to relevance last year in the midst of dropping three fire projects the saturation series saturation 1 2 & 3 some of my favorite albums of 2017 blending together elements of hardcore hip hop and pop rap R&B albums that featured creative productions sticky and memorable hooks and verses and incredible chemistry flowing between the group's distinct members iconic music videos and sold-out live performances continued to build the group's profile throughout the year they eventually inked a multi-album deal with RCA Records but shortly afterwards got caught up in a media frenzy due to an ex-member amir van being accused of sexual and emotional abuse by a former girlfriend the group eventually came to the decision to remove van from the group they released this statement along with that announcement and I think a lot of passion of fans pulling Brock Hampton in both directions on this issue really failed to appreciate how difficult of a decision at most likely was for them to do what they did you could a lose someone who a lot of people saw as a pivotal member of the group someone who is plastered all over the front of your three most popular records or you could leave Brock Hampton looking callous toward this rising concern toward abusive behavior in the entertainment industry given the band stated stance on this issue and the way it's been worked into their art along with the social climate and the implied deception in the public statement they released I think the move that they made was a correct one but that still doesn't change that losing a mirror and the conditions under which it happened is still a pretty big change for a group like Brock Hampton to undergo as it seemed like this unexpected ship sort of knocked the group off their balance as they struggled to keep up with live shows and release states and public appearances for a moment it felt like everything was on the upswing for the group as they spent ten days tracking material for this record at Abbey Road Studios in London quite a bit of work on this album was also put in at the Brock Hampton Factory in Hawaii - iridescent keep in mind is also the start of another Brock Hampton series the best years of our lives trilogy so this album is not just standalone outing it is in fact the start of a new chapter whose pages I think are pretty much about adjustment it's a brand new day for the most beloved boy band out there today but this album does come with some mixed results I mean there's some great and refreshing ideas on there that I think Brock Hampton fans up until now we'll certainly take to the cleaner brighter and more colorful recording on this record certainly does sound like Brock Hampton have much more at their disposal technically than they did before the production is punchy or two the drums are harder and heavier the bass is thicker quite a few tracks on this thing feature luscious strings and the pitched and chipmunk vocals that we've heard on previous Brockhampton efforts also carry over on to this new record over here the point I'm trying to make here might be difficult to get but I just think the pitch adjusted vocals on this new record they don't sound as goofy the emotion doesn't seem to be sucked out of the rapping I could still kind of tell who's delivering the vocals it's not nearly as distracting I don't know if this has to do with the amount they pitch adjust or the process or the program they're using I just prefer the way it's being applied here we also hear much moodier performances and verses from the boys on this record - some of the most heart-wrenching material yet in a way I feel like iridescent is growing off the slightly more experimental and poppy tendencies of saturation 3 but the results as an album aren't nearly as dynamic or consistent and they come with a few downsides the first and biggest issue I may have with this album is that the group dynamic has been totally flipped on its head miraculously the most standout members of the group on this record are easily Joba and who brings some of the most intense and memorable performances and verses across the entire record bare face gets a bit more mic time though it mostly seems to just be in delivering these kind of sassy hooks and refrains not really the summery and stunning ballad jury that he has ended previous efforts from Brock Hampton with DOM is as solid as ever so that's good Kevin seems a bit more incognito than usual and Matt champion shockingly has very few in the way of standout verses on this record for some reason there are a good handful of tracks on this album that are severely lacking in the groups usually exciting chemistry and right from the start of iridescent with the track New Orleans which kind of feels like each member respectively riffing on this hard-hitting and droney beat with lots of strange sound effects and samples kind of orbiting the instrumental which pretty much just distract from the lack of a strong hook or unifying anything I mean certainly there are some standout verses from dom and Joba and especially merlin toward the end of the track rapping about his relationship with his heritage in his roots but also the religion of the new land that he's found himself in but as an entire song and especially a starter to this highly anticipated album it's pretty underwhelming the structure of the song Berlin is also odd as well with another instrumental featuring tons of orbiting strange sound effects and odd samples most notably a car engine like revving up it grabs my attention for a second it sounds kind of neat but it's not nearly as substantive musically as so many fantastic instrumentals from the Brockhampton camp in the past even with the dreary cute little synth chords that pop in after the first leg of the song I like Dom's bold opening I liked Jobos pretty strong finish on the track but the whole progression of the song seems pretty nonsensical and awkward where the cash out was kind of an exciting moment for me in the first leg of the album featuring mostly Merlin for the duration of the cut from the insane instrumental to Merlin's voice to the hook there are a lot of things I like about this track but it sort of seems like a lost opportunity especially when this seems like such a hype and exciting track more members could be getting on it mat champions little mini verse on it doesn't really contribute all that much I enjoyed this track I enjoyed the summary R&B transition out of New Orleans with the track thug life where Don actually delivers an incredibly impassioned and emotional verse with a little bit of vocal manipulation on it it sounds odd but I do think it is a beautiful moment on the album but outside of these two tracks I think this album has a pretty slow start I don't think Brock Hampton and the record as a whole starts pulling out all the stops until we get to the track weight which kicks off with a stunning verse from Kevin probably his most stunning verse on the entire record it would have been great to get at least a few verses from him on this album that are this good but at least we got one and it is this heart-wrenching look back on his youth where he is going over not only coming to terms with his own sexuality but also missing the days when Brock Hampton were I guess a bit smaller and more manageable in terms of the amount of attention that the group was getting the luscious strings backing his voice are gorgeous and I love the transition out of his verse into the speedy bustling dance beats over which DOM and Joba do their thing really well and also back up these themes of pressure and stress really living up to the song's title of weight the weight on you the song district though sounds like yet another moment on the album where each member is just really conceptually disconnected over production that is just trying too hard to be glitchy and just packing a lot of bells and whistles vocally matt champion is really under selling it Joba is really overdoing it generally I think the second half of the album is much more solid than the first the group sounds way more focused and cohesive as a collective in the second half it's also where some of the album's most depressing songs turn up I'm not going to say all of these very fast changes have been bad for Brock Hampton but the label deal the attention pressure the Emir thing there are clearly collective feelings over that and the group just happens to sound more cohesive as they are venting on these feelings like on the song tape which features all these stacked self-effacing revealing vulnerable verses also the song tanya which previously was teased as a live performance on a late night show i believe it's it's the only single track outside of joe vera which was released just prior to the album drop that's pretty much the only single that made it onto the album truman wildfire nope none of it but I do think this studio version of the track sounds excellent the piano on this instrumental is great I love the progression of the song I love how each member of the group sort of contributes to the the very moody vibe of this track with their own personal experience and story especially Merlin at the end and then there's my favorite ballad on the entire record and that's San Marcos which is this acoustic guitar backed and powerful little auto-tune ballad also has an amazing finish to with dense strings and what sounds like I don't know what a children's chorus or something [Music] it is nearly tear-inducing and I think brings a powerful sentiment reflecting on the group's artistic and personal ambitions the recent changes they have been undergoing and in the second half of the album because Brock Hampton is also known to be a celebratory group they managed to drop a couple of effective bangers to the track Vivid the very funky honey and as I mentioned earlier there is the incredibly powerful Javert the track which I thought made for a really excellent single for this album Joba really steals the show with one of the most intense verses on the entire record it really is a awesome and special to kind of hear him and Merlyn doing as well as they are on this album even if it is it sort of seems like as a result of them going through a lot of emotional trauma and and really kind of going above and beyond vocally on this particular track Jo but is screaming his brains out over his own feelings of distrust his frustrations over his own shortsightedness fabric I also think is a pretty solid closer and cliffhanger for the next album it's another moment on the album where the group are venting on the situation that they currently find themselves in with nods to over exposure even suicide lack of privacy as well instrumentally there are lots of swelling tones and very passionate manipulated vocals as well to show a really huge Kanye influence now overall I don't think iridescent is a huge misstep or even a disappointment as I like and love most of what the album has to offer but there are some points on the album that I just don't think are quite there we're not delivering material that is up to the bar that they have set for themselves in the past some songs featuring kind of gimmicky production and lacking in a strong hook or a song for the group to rally around but despite those spots where I think the album was lacking I still hear a lot of maturity and progression and creativity on this record songs like wait seemed totally born out of the genre fusions and the experimentation and the beat switches that I enjoyed so much on saturation 3 songs like where the cash at are totally insane off the wall and seemed like new wild territory for the group entirely and the moodier tracks and the ballads on the back end this record are some of the most emotionally powerful and potent material Rockhampton have released up until this point and simultaneously are some of the most conceptually focused material the group has released so far as they have now been given the opportunity to collectively write about experiences they're all going through as a group so while I didn't love this whole thing it does excite me and it does make me look forward to the future of what the group is going to be delivering as they kind of go through these changes and those are pretty much my thoughts on the record I'm feeling a light two DS and seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Brock Hampton iridescent forever 
5x0LjJBRsuk,hey hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week and yeah yeah you you know what it is by now I want to give a shout out to the good people over at the ridge they make these nifty metal-plated minimalist wallets with money clip in

the segment and i want to do a few shoutouts first one richard swift the late and great producer and songwriter multi-instrumentalist has a posthumous album coming out there is a new song from it that you can check out below be on the lookout for that rest in peace rest in power also rest in power to Prince who has a posthumous album out of a solo vocal and piano pieces which what I've heard from so far is pretty stunning pretty gorgeous and passionate there's a song down there below in the description box that you can try out yourself also James Ferraro has the next edition of his four pieces of mirai saga coming out which I reviewed the first piece of which on this channel do check out that review if you haven't it is a thrilling and an adventurous and expansive piece of electronic music so it's gonna be pretty cool to hear him kind of embark on the next edition of this saga you can hear a little bit of a preview get more information via a link in the description box as well and also want to shout out Florence and the Machine who have a brand new cover out via Spotify that you can check out as well ok so give those give those your time give those your attention because there are some sweet little sweet little tidbits in there and by the way it's a a Tory heimo's cover that you can scope out in there alright and oh jeez our boy Dean Blount has a new collection of tracks out all kind of lumped together into this 15-minute span of music and new tidbits ASAP ASAP rocky is actually featured on one of the passages of this long multi-tracked mega song and from what I understand and you guys might remember I loved his last album black metal great record fantastic record experimental passionate little album full of ballads and strange musical pieces apparently the sequel to that album is on the way very soon so I'm pretty excited about that black metal 2 I've been in the need for more Dean Blunt in my life alright let's get into the track so they thought were the worst tracks this week let's kick it off with this new song from the West Coast hip hop outfit sob RBE they have a new song out that is kind of a little slow jam titled made it it's falling seriously short of achieving that slow jam status because the outfit approaches the song with pretty much the same flows and vocal deliveries that they do nearly every song making them sound more one-dimensional than ever sort of wondering if this is how every single one of their tracks is going to come off from now until the end of time not really digging on the new Norah Jones and Jeff Tweedy track a song with no name and believe me when I say that a name is not the only thing that this song is missing a coherent structure quality production and a memorable tune is also what this very drab acoustic number is missing this new quote-unquote collaborative track from little peep in xxx 10 Tasi own is sort of a padded out non song with a hook and not much else it just sort of feels like the label threw this together just to get the names of two very popular artists having a new posthumous song out so they could kind of Bank on that which is unfortunate and new song from Joyce Manor which is in some respects a sweet little indie rock ballad but the vocals and tune are way too drab to maintain interest for any more than a few moments let's move into the tracks that I thought were kind of meh not terrible but not amazing either but certainly worth your time certainly worth pointing at you guys might dig them more than me Weezer has a brand new song out which is set to be on the new soundtrack for the film spell and this song over here goes into more of a yeah yeah bless me goes into a kind of a bright pop synthetic electronic direction which a lot of song was on the band's last LP did but I feel like the way all of those influences are employed on this new cut over here it's it's actually not obnoxious it's actually not terrible it's actually not unlikable and I hope that if Weezer embarks on these sounds more in the near future that the results come out more more like this because I actually didn't mind this tune all that all that much shout out shout out to rivers moving on from there Peter Bjorn and John the indie outfit that helped bring the genre to prominence with that whistle song everybody knows have a new album on the way three tracks out from it the first of which one for the team is my favorite the last of which gut-feeling sounds just like a beach fossils ripoff which I didn't care for all that much but still if you like kind of twangy poppy indie rock type stuff you may in fact be into these songs and want to be looking out for that new Peter Bjorn and John PB&J moving on from there a melon on fire oh this new single titled body mind or rather mind body soul music from nudes is pretty intriguing this is an artist who is combining influences coming from electronic dance music soul gospel and blues it's it's kind of like a clashing of new and old I do feel like some of the vocals and loops did get incessant by the end of the song but it is rare that you hear dance music this passionate vocally driven and grimy you know so dudu give this a shot even though this song did underwhelm me in some respects I am looking forward to seeing with this music projects to delivers into the future and oh the new little Aussie vert song new patek which I like the aesthetic of it I thought some of his flow was pretty cool but in my opinion the the length of the song and the fact that it didn't switch up all that much really worked against him with the song being like five minutes and change way way too long for a new xever song in my opinion with without another feature or without some kind of switch or something or a strong hook but I don't know that's me and 151 rum a track from jid I'm assuming this is gonna be on his forthcoming record at least that's how I've seen a build kind of a scant track a big lengthy verse and some mini verses kind of surrounding it I liked some of the flows the internal rhymes were great some of the lyricism was pretty cool too but I feel like it could have used a bit more structure it just kind of feels like a motif that he just kind of threw out there to get the fans mouths watering and this Beijing folk duo by the name of Gong Gong Gong have a new single out via band camp which you could check out I do like the elements of experimental and roots music that come together on this track quite a bit looking forward to seeing if this duo does anything interesting in the near future also want to give a shout-out to the new gallant track too good to be true featuring Sufjan Stevens and Rebecca sugar not that strong of a tune on this track in my opinion but the very dreary vocal contributions do make it pretty interesting and and sad it feels kind of like a mood piece feels like a cool mood piece and I will leave it at that moving on from there digging on this new Cloud Nothings song leave him now it is a pretty peppy piece of power pop with sharp guitars and a pretty nice hook not all that memorable stylistically but still I thought the song had a lot of good things going for it and want to give a shout-out to Charles the bedroom and Lofa pop artist who has a new endearing music video out shot on iPhone where she's kind of dancing and moving along going down the street it's like she's living in a musical and the song itself I thought was pretty sweet though you know didn't really blow me away but you know you could tell there's a some influence coming from Ariel pink on the production a little bit and that's it's it's a pretty sweet little number pretty sweet little number looking to see where she grows from here and wanted to talk about the new Lana Del Rey track Venice bitch which is a very very monstrous 9 minute piece from Lana and Jack Antonoff of fun Fame who is now doing production for her new full-length album while I did like the acoustic intro and I guess the core tune of the track quite a bit didn't mind the lyrics either the the very lengthy instrumental passages that this track launches into for the majority of its runtime I think take away more than they add to the song at least at the length that they are employed at because some of the what sounds like synth and guitar harmony is just a very heavy dense musical passengers they do fall a little flaccid and they do feel just a little overdone Lana's voice does come back and regain presence toward the end of the and ties it all up I mean I I feel like the track had its heart in the right place I admire the ambition that Lana and Jack obviously had to come into this track with but I feel like the execution could have been cleaner tighter a bit punchier to make the track itself more engaging moving on from there wanderer is the name of the fourth coming Cat Power album and she has seen fit to release another song from it it is a cover it's a Rihanna cover of the song stay and essentially a piano and vocal track it's not bad I think cat Power's interpretation of the song maybe came off a bit too simplistic like maybe she could have taken some more I guess liberties with it but still it's pretty interesting for her to embark on on this kind of on this kind of cover this kind of cover rather and reinterpretation alright let's get into the tracks I thought were the best best best this week the songs that really blew me away want to talk about the new petite noir track and artist a South African artist who I have shouted out in the weekly track roundup series before and some of you guys might remember between nough between petite Noir from his appearance on Danny Browns last full-length album atrocity exhibition this new song of his actually features Danny Brown and also new Kobe tekubi and it's a pretty odd piece of art pop rap with unsettling and very surreal production and in haunting vocals - Danny Brown's verse on here is actually pretty motivational and inspirational as well diggin what's going on here digging in the direction and looking forward to the new album - open mike eagle who is going to be coming out with an independently released record very soon so support him in that venture has a new song titled relatable peak ome and I think it's one of his smartest and funniest songs in a while where he sort of throws out all of this very revealing information sort of puts himself in a vulnerable spot and I don't know it just through this Avenue of self-effacement I guess in a way he makes himself more relatable more human and I really kind of enjoy that element of the song quite a bit his flow and delivery are over the top the beat hits pretty hard although it doesn't really change up all that much I feel like the song could have used a bit more structure but still I thought it was really enjoyable and really looking forward to this new open mike eagle release moving on from there I want to give a shout out to Carol Carol bonito they came out with a song super late last week around around the time that I came out with my last weekly track roundup so I ended up missing it in that video but the title of this song is make-believe now if you guys remember I was a little underwhelmed by the outfits last EP because the sudden swap they did for their typically synthetic and poppy sound for just like a typical indie rock style was a little underwhelming just kind of felt a little tiresome however I feel like they have brought that together with the electronics and the brighter pop elements once again in this new song and I'm kind of liking the the fact that they've been able to maintain all of these influences on one track and it sort of works sure it's not as bright and cartoony and silly and tongue-in-cheek as their their last length LP but still I'm liking what they're doing here it sounds a little bit more mature but still very catchy and interesting cult leader metalcore band cult leader new album on the way and while this is a pretty meat-and-potatoes onra for a lot of artists out there I feel like cult leader is sort of breaking away from that trend with some of the very off-kilter and strange riffs that they lace this new track with I am healed is the name of the new song production is pretty loud vocals are pretty brutal kind of standard for the genre but it's really the weird strong song structure and multiple switching guitar passages throughout the track that that really kind of make it stand out in my opinion moving on from there Javert the new Brock Hampton song single loving its hit hits hard it's badass I'm not gonna get too deep into it though as I'm going to talk about this song and the rest of the tracks from their new album iridescent very soon and Bill Wirtz fellow youtuber Bill Wirtz Mount Saint Helens is about to blow up is the title of his new very peppy poppy jazzy and abstract and freaky and funny new song and single subscribe to Bill words Jesus Christ if you haven't already a bit of an itchy eye over here it's bugging me an electronic artist ash Cuccia has a brand new song out titled Fukushima and the densely layered droning electronics and vocals throughout this track while it doesn't lead to a lot of exciting switch ups or anything like that it is pretty intoxicating it is I guess uh I don't know um Moody and futuristic and beautiful and gorgeous and strange and I'm just kind of liking the the direction his sounds have been heading in recently so I think I'm going to leave it at that ladies and gentlemen that has been the weekly track roundup shut up once more to the good people over at the ridge you can hit up that link below again with the promo code Fantana 10% off your order and once more you can hit up all the songs that I mentioned in this roundup down there - all right you're the best you two best you do vests I will see you guys in the next video weekly track roundup forever
