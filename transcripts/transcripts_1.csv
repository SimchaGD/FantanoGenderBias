Bnu1PHF1HSA,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well well it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were some of the best and the worst tracks of the week before I get into that I do want to mention our turntable lab link down below which we get kickback from if you buy a nice colorful piece of vinyl of a record we have reviewed on the channel also our patreon page is linked down below as well if you want to get some bonus extra monthly content for supporting the channel and of course of course of course of course a shout-out to our sponsor the good people over at the ridge they make these nifty awesome metal plated minimalist wallets that are so sleek and sexy and fit nicely in your front pocket money clip on the back I've been rocking mine for months now and you can get your own using the promo code down below melon when you hit the link that is melon 10% off but BAM alright worst tracks of the week we have one and only one I'm sure there were maybe more worse tracks that came out this week but there was truly one that stood out to me and that is the new Pearl Jam cut dance of the clairvoyants which sounds like an awful combat like never in a million years would you ever want this combination of talking heads an Interpol for whatever reason Eddie Vedder's voice sounds very tight erratic has a strong vibrato on it which is his voice usually does have you know kind of a wavy quality to it but it's almost like this tense David Byrne esque vibrato and and then there's kind of a driving post-punk revival eeriness to it that is really strange it's it's like a goth slightly goth doubt talking heads in a way and it sounds god-awful the tune is terrible and the performance is off and while I do think that a Pearl Jam in a very odd way embody these characters these characteristics that these other bands I wouldn't say they pull them off very well it's a very hideous combination of maybe unintentional influences I don't really know but it is really garish and difficult to listen to all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of meh but still worth sort of pointing out still worth giving a shout out to let's start off with ybn Damir he has come through with a pretty straightforward track banger that sounds like a very rough and rugged soundcloud rap type track it's not bad but you know not the best I've ever heard in this style or anything we also have waxed hacci wax hacci a singer-songwriter who has come through with a I don't know pretty bold and loud too and over here though I'm not gonna front and act like this is one of my favorite music projects it's not I'm I'm not even sure if this new song over here is really winning me over either but I know there are a lot of fans out there who who do enjoy it a lot more than me and hey it's here the track is called fire fire name of the track alright moving on from there we have Rico nasty new single I don't give a fuck it's not one of the tracks that to me is is in my favorite style from her every once in a while she does have this tendency to drop one of these very auto-tune heavy bangers that are super melodic and very glitzy and very glossy and and I tend to enjoy her rougher and more bombastic songs but this one's ok it's not bad you know if that's your vibe if that's your sound you'll dig it a lot more than me next over here we have the song party from the group planet 1999 which is I guess a new act that is putting out some music via PC music and this one over here I thought was a kind of nice nostalgic bit of synth pop though the visuals and for whatever reason the outfits look very 1999 it's a very strange anachronistic combination of sounds and visual and fashion aesthetics but it's it's still pretty fun and sweet on the ears we also had this new track over here from MIT ski from the new turning sound track it is easily one of her loudest and most sinister songs yet the is a quality of it that I found to be too syrupy but still it's it's a heavy one if you wanted to hear myths key go dark she is going dark on this one from this soundtrack and it's titled cop car we also have M Ward singer-songwriter M Ward unreal city is the name of this new track over here I'm liking the sweet tune on this one I'm liking the kind of dreamy indie folk instrumentation is one of the catchiest and boldest songs I've heard from mr. Ward over the years no but it is certainly better than that she and him stuff I will say that we also have over here a new track from Love regenerator and Calvin Harris hypnagogic I can't wait edit it is a very nice bit of acid house with some cool vocal edits mixed in I like it I like it quite a bit let's move on from there we have simmer new track from Hayley Williams of Paramore Fame I'm a little on the fence with this one honestly I thought some of the vocals were pretty good but didn't care for I guess how Radiohead ish the instrumental sounded and and not just that it reminds me of Radiohead but almost like a a watered down version of like some kid a or something I might have heard off of in rainbows or something I'm so looking forward to hearing how this Williams record is going to turn out because obviously Hayley Williams is a pretty high-profile singer and her first major solo outing here is going to be a something to watch out for but I can't say I'm very much blown away by this this first taste going into the track so I thought were the best ones this week the best tracks this week one overcomer royce two five nine Westside gun this track is great this is actually one of the best boys tracks I've ever heard I love how much space he gives himself in this very bare-bones sample heavy instrumental I like how West Side gun sets the start of the track up so dramatically when the drums come in on the hook it's a very nice transition and Royces verse here is not as masturbatory or as like I'm in your face I'm competing with you I'm trying to come up with crazy word combinations to impress you it's it's actually legitimately poetic and you know I think there's quite a bit of um I guess uh I'll say emotional intelligence to a lot of what he's saying on this track referring to his craft the rap game others in it and I just generally I think it's a very smart song I like the direction that he's going on this one I don't know if every song on his new record is gonna sound like this but this was a great one this is a really good one very impressed with a voice this time around and not that there wasn't ever reason to be to not be you know his previous records from him are very solid even if it's not you know typically my favorite strain of hip hop we have a new track from Rosalia who is a Grammy winner now a Grammy winner yes I know she's one of Latin Grammy but still a Grammy winner for her last record but her okay is the name of her new track over here like she's done before this is a new spin on you know a traditional folk song and it's beautiful God her voice is amazing on this track she's kind of going back to riding those acoustic guitars although toward the end of the cut which is very soaked in atmosphere mind you she does do a bit of an auto-tune thing it's almost like if you know she was a trying to do like a Travis Scott take on you know some neo flamenco shit the the auto-tune goes a little overboard I think toward the end but maybe that was just a first impression the song and her performance generally is stunning beautiful she is the only person who is like really able to kill it in this Lane right now and she's killing it to such an extremity she's making this style of music appeal to people that normally wouldn't even want to have anything to do with it that is how amazingly and mind-blowing Lee talented Rosalia is and she deserves all of the credit in the world for them so amazing track great performance and looking forward to more also / a singing songwriting duo who are putting out music under a different name / and the name of this track over here which is very and very lush a methodically assembled piece of pop music is avenue bliss certainly lives up to the name I like it quite a bit also porches do you wanna I've been sort of on the fence with porches up until this point some tracks I like some tracks I don't this one I thought was incredibly groovy fun has a strange music video attached to it but still very compelling and moving and like the vocal delivery I like the kind of sad sensuality of this pop tune as well and yeah just looking forward to more from porches hoping that it's kind of on this level of quality moving out from there I laugh at this cover Mark Zuckerberg is the name of this new track from a band by the name of map eyes this song is attached to one of the most insane music videos I've seen in a while very strange and compelling animation on this one and the visuals with this weird Mark Zuckerburg digital effigy they've created this is it's very disturbing in a way but I do like the twang II kind of psychedelic guitar pop the band is trying to pull together on this one and the very surreal and strange lyrics about never having seen Mark Zuckerburg answer whatever again it's a very weird surreal track that's a kind of tongue-in-cheek as well but there is a kind of a strange genius to it that I like a lot I move not from their beat i TCH is the name of this new fucking Megan the stallion banger love the instrumental love her flow lover delivery and also I like the general ethos of the track about you know you're gonna call me a bitch anyway if I do this or if I do that so you know I'm just basically gonna be like the most real forward tough ass you know like I'm gonna fight for my own type of person who I want to be because you know it's kind of a damned if you do damned if you don't situation so I'm just gonna do me be me I think it's a you know worthwhile message and a good hook as well so very solid new single from Megan hoping for a new record or mixtape this year let's go also 410 has come through with a nice combination of some two-step very groovy beats as well as some sharp little vocal edits as well liking the atmosphere like the energy of this track you know it's it's not the type of stuff he was putting out in the early part of last decade or even in the aughts you know he's very much transitioning into a cool direction and and I'm liking that you know I'm liking them shout out for tet always and Dorien Elektra has come through with a deluxe version of flamboyant that is a handful of additional tracks on it some of which or at least a few of which have kind of a few country undertones to them here and there I'm specifically pointed to the track guyliner part two which is a really cool sequel to one of the best tracks off of the original tracklist guyliner so give it a try give it a shot shout out to Dorian Elektra always and just kind of loving this a revamped version of a very good record from last year also Cage the Elephant broken boy featuring Iggy Pop awesome hard-hitting driving garage psych punk combo going on in the instrumental and Iggy Pop's inclusion around the second half of the song is really cool as well liking the vocal performances on this one and just generally great sound great energy and just a cool crossover between Cage the Elephant and one of the greatest legends in rock music and I think that is it everyone weekly track roundup over you're the best hopefully you loved at least some of these tracks that I've recommended or talked about here they are linked all down below once more with our turntable a blink our patreon link and that reg yeah I'll see you in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
t9vCCWuoF0k,yeah hi everyone Anthony Banton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new puppy album I disagree this is a new album from singer-songwriter multimedia artist poppy who has had a very odd and dramatic creative trajectory over the past five years or so going from unsettling internet cult meme to grimes collaborator and iconic figure on Diplo's Mad Decent and if you don't understand how weird that progression is I encourage you to do a bit of a binge of Poppy's YouTube video catalog and you will get what I mean poppy is still evolving though creatively and her new record here might be her boldest metamorphosis yet completely embracing the sounds of Ault metal new metal industrial and a lot more now if I was naive I would chalk this change up to simply thinking hey these metal tracks from my last record did really well so I'm gonna hightail it with the producers of those songs to a metal label and we're just gonna like do a metal record but it also runs deeper than that because this change also coincides with a split with Poppy's longtime collaborator Titanic Sinclair someone who'd arguably been pivotal in forging the poppy image and character he even is credited on numerous songs from this LP but despite working with Titanic for years and even taking his side in the highly publicized lawsuit from his former collaborator Mars Argo who was essentially poppy before there was a poppy she has now changed her tune on Titanic in a recent statement and in a way is now confirming these allegations of manipulation leveled by Argo with her original lawsuit look it's all very messy but still worth going over because it's all out there in the public already and all this is certainly going to mean a sea change for poppy going forward this new album certainly already sounds like it like I said earlier I disagree is poppy working with two of the most bombastic producers from her last record and making a mostly metal album honestly it's a really refreshing change of pace not just for poppy but also for any pop our is generally to be grabbing and refurbishing these types of metal risks that have mostly gone out with mm the whole record is relatively short at 35 minutes 10 tracks but it packs a lot of punch and that confined amount of time now even though this new metal angle for poppy might look really dark and edgy and mean on the surface the opening track concrete goes to show just how much fun poppy and her collaborators are trying to have on this one within the first minute of the track we get this transition from sequence drums Sirens refrains of bury me 6 feet deep to explosions of grinding syncopated rifts and drums fluttering guitar harmonies what sounds like very cutesy j-rock with references to tasty treats a metalcore breakdown a somewhat faith know Moorish transition and then a passage of sunny vintage pop music that sounds very Beach Boys esque there's even more to the track after that even the weird inclusion of some bad fake crowd chanting poppy poppy which makes little to no sense but ok overall this song is kind of gimmicky and outright absurd but the transitions are still really impressive and I like how the cut really eliminates any perception that this album would be taking itself too seriously poppy is clearly in it for the camp which is totally fine as long as the songs are good by comparison the title track here is a lot more coherent not trying to be as lol random I genuinely love the dark and bacey beat that kicks the entire thing off definitely some industrial undertones to it especially with the freakish guitars that orbit the rhythm here also loving how all this transitions into an incredibly triumphant chorus topped with apocalyptic lyrics of it all burning down being safe and sound the vocal harmonies are also better than what I would have expected given Poppy's last record we also have be much edgy err blood money which sounds like a dubstep drop for people who are still buying Ozzfest tickets plus the song is packed with these unsettling refrains of keep telling yourself that you've been playing nice and go paper but get this vibe Jesus that guys it's almost like a weird Yoko Ono moment on the record respect to Yoko Ono though don't get it twisted there's also a lyric later in the track that really stood out to me never forget the excessive a man because the grabbing hands always grab what they can I'm not sure who poppy has in mind on this track but it is interesting to hear her writing from a place of such confrontation where someone or something is really the object of her anger on a song the lyrics generally across the record though are still pretty cryptic but give away just enough to where you're wondering if she's making some kind of meta-commentary about drama surrounding poppy there are definitely some obvious references to a few things on anything like me we're at least being viewed through the context surrounding this record there are lines that read like they're about the press reacting to Argo the comparisons of poppy to Argo and I would even argue that the hook might be even about being possessed by the character of poppy or maybe personally losing that sense of where you start in the character ends without a doubt the messaging on this one is really curious but ultimately it's the sinister shouts the Marilyn Manson s riffs and the chilling keyboard passages that sell the whole thing the song rage is hard and sounds like you're going absolutely manic because you are trapped in your own personal hell after a cute little intro featuring some throbbing electronics and twangy lead guitars the song fill the crown instantly transitions into a funny break beat and then these massive chugging riffs that sound like they're straight off of a Rammstein classic I'd say the guitar tone is almost identical there's even a strangely familiar background vocal on the track that I can't say as Marilyn Manson it may just be someone who is ripping off Marilyn Manson his very throaty moans and high-pitched screams personally I've been listening to Manson since I was a teenager and if this is not him it's a really really really good impersonator we then get the song nothing I need in the tracklist here which is a sudden change of pace in that it's not a metal track instead it's an ethereal it'll pop cut with a head bobbing beat just imagine if Radiohead's all I need had like a positive outlook on life or if we had kero kero bonito making dream pop with a light vapor wave twist the absolutely insane beats on sit-stay are pretty much in homage to The Prodigy but like every track here it is a multi genre banger where you're not just getting one sadder influence for too long of course there is a point where we do hit some heavier guitars some chunky trebly bass riffs all of which sounds like maybe it's in an odd time I'm not sure it's very oddly shaped groove the lyrics do get a little repetitive on bite your teeth but it's still one of the stranger and more fun songs here with its jump the fuck up riffs and mr. bungle ish transitions into these somewhat tongue-in-cheek guitar leads the more melodic passages that come after this are very pretty to the track sick of the Sun is fine but if we're gonna transition once more away from doing a metal track I don't know why we needed another dreamy cut here even if this one does have more of a rock angle and the closing track don't go outside is easily the longest one here at six minutes and even though poppy and her collaborators could have packed a million breakneck changes into this thing instead they use this extra time to build up something a bit more cinematic a climactic finish with a few glam rock embellishments here and there what sort of lingers with me at the end of the track though is the closing message of you can be anyone that you want to be which i think is an interesting take for someone who has built a career being this character and though on this record poppy is in character I can't help but shake the feeling that on a lot of tracks here she is trying to get through a genuine a personal and an authentic message about her mindset through the eyes of this character there were a few tracks here that struck me as being a little bogged down in their own novelty or just generally being okay a little underwhelming but most of the songs here make for a pretty awesome multifaceted thrill ride though I do wonder how far poppy will be able to take this metal thing I mean I expect at some point in the future she will move on to something else but we could be looking at something that could really just be the tip of the ice berg of some long extended series of albums that go even deeper into this style not sure but either way hopefully what papi drums up in the future is interesting as well I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please

HaKthjg4zYQ,hi everyone squeaky voice taro you the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for love you are the Travis Scott I'm Chuck boy's project Chuck boys Jack boys is a new collection of songs masterminded by Houston MC and producer Travis Scott it's coming through Epic Records and his Cactus Jack record label which he is now trying to extend the roster of with the likes of Shaq Wes Don Tolliver luxury tax Travis Scott's essentially trying to make a boss move here extend his talents and abilities and money-making prospects beyond just putting out his own music but from what I understand none of these guys are working exclusively with Travis and his label so what it would mean to him for any of them to hit it bigger than they are currently now I don't know so ultimately Travis's success off of Jack boys is going to be hugely dependent on whether or not these guys can forge a hit collectively form a musical identity I mean I'm assuming there's gonna be more for Jack boys to develop off of from here because this project that's just been dropped as only seven tracks long so I wasn't really sure what to expect going into this especially since the kick off of this thing is Travis Scott's recent single highest in the room a very mediocre track for Travis with one of his stainless beats and flows since birds in the trap the song doesn't really advance the psychedelic and wonderous world that he's built his brand on and in my original review for the track I thought that it could have used a feature and appearance something originally I was glad to hear that Travis was open to that idea by doing a remix version on this project but the issue is he added Rosalia and little baby to this song which is about the worst pairing that I could ever imagine especially since it sounds like little babies spit his verse on a handheld recorder in a broom closet and then with the addition of Rosalia on this track I love her voice I love her stuff but I think she mostly played it safe follow Travis's Lee it didn't give us the vocal dynamics I she is capable of but I can't entirely blame her because how can you shine over a beat that is this forgettable so ya already on the first track Jack boys is not off to a great start somehow this remix in my opinion is worse than the original there is a cool instrumental outro on the track though that leads into a short interlude and then I guess we really start getting a taste of Jack boys with Gang Gang featuring Shaq Wes who barely feels present on this track honestly he doesn't go as aggressive as I guess you expect check Wes to go on a track given his biggest songs it's got a murky very shadowy vibe there are aspects of the instrumental that are a little unorthodox and cool but for the most part the track features a lot of empty space that never truly feels filled except when Don Tolliver is singing on this track he is such a bold sharp voice the inflection is little throaty and he recently had an appearance on the new Eminem album - screaming that no regrets pretty much every part of this song is mildly sleepy except when Don is just belting out those notes he also dominates on had enough featuring quavo and offset where the two migos provide pretty standard verses filling the gap between Don's voice at the start in the end of the cut which sounds fantastic over these glamorous pianos and hard-hitting drums his hook on this track is maybe the best hook on the entire project but a close second for me in terms of my favorite on this thing is maybe out west with young thug I love the cool little woodwind melodies laced into the beat on this one also thug errs wild rubbery and insane inflections on this track or something to behold even if he does drop some weirdly perverted and obsessive oral sex bars is that pravy it's kind of a short cut though it would be amazing if we're a part of some larger Travis Scott style multi-phase traps I kept ik the song what to do isn't bad a lot of good aspects of this track but having a mellow cut on such a short project that his book ended with two major duds is not you know leaving the strongest impression still I do like the way the Travis orchestrates this one the epic guitar solo he the way that the instrumental gets progressively more and more intense the strings the hypnotic hook and also Don Tolliver appears again here and vocally stuns we have Gaddy with pop smoke closing up this project and I'm not totally surprised with his inclusion here given how hot welcome to the party is but this track is a mess I do like pop smokes very monstrous deep raspy voice but his flow doesn't really complement this instrumental which is a very odd beat the groove isn't all that straightforward even Travis on the track fails to find a pocket that really drives me to Bob my head to it or anything not only that but there's never a point where the track really seems to burst or progress or grow it's like it's forever in trowing something that never ends up happening while there were a few highlights on this thing I fail to see why exactly Travis took this material to separate it off into a totally different music venture because it mostly just sounds like Travis got leftovers with closed musical collaborators on them of course once again for me vocally Don Tolliver was the one that really stuck out which I guess is cool I wish him all the luck in the world and it would be cool to hear him killa I'm more Travis stuff and I guess continue to grow his his own name artistically but even though I enjoyed Don's work on this thing I don't feel like everyone collectively was shining here while it would be really cool for Jack boys to come out with a larger project down the road with a stronger artistic sense of self that feels at least somewhat separate from what Travis Scott does solo I feel like we're not really on that trajectory we're not really off to a good start when it comes to achieving that at the end of the day Jack boys may end up being nothing more than just a weird Travis Scott detour that we hear some subpar Travis got style trap from every once in a while I guess feeling a decent two strong five on this one transition have you given this project to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that upworthy link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Travis Scott jack boys forever 
7ndtSyn6dVg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mac Miller album circles this is a posthumous album from the rapper singer-songwriter and producer Malcom James McCormick aka Mac Miller in September of 2018 Mac tragically passed away of a drug overdose after having undergone one of the most unlikely transitions in rap over the past decade going from a very lovable and commercially appealing pop rap scamp to one of the more celebrated voices in the field of abstract hip hop and then transitioning even further into jazz tinged neo soul and R&B now it's no secret that Mac's past couple of Records had been my least favorite in his discography so far I much prefer the sound and style of tone of faces or good am but I don't have to enjoy a record like Divine Feminine to at least appreciate where Mac was trying to take his music and given Mac's many talents sticking strictly to rap was most likely not going to happen across his career for sure he had already shown a desire to take his sound in other places like on his Larry Love Stein stuff Mac's transition though into the loves teen stuff into Divine Feminine and even swimming in my opinion wasn't exactly smooth despite the music sounding so smooth the somewhat awkward attempts at flirtiness and sensuality on feminine the kind of washed out production on swimming plus the somewhat inconsistent flow of the record switching from subdued funk too woozy pop rap to comatose R&B but circles is actually Mac's most fully realized record in this vein it was originally meant to be a companion record to swimming swimming in circles you get it but it was left incomplete the day that Mac had passed away so then we had multi-instrumentalist and producer John Bryan connecting the dots that were left over on the record and even though John and Mac Miller are not the only producers credited on the record they do make up a bulk of the production on the album which leads to a very consistent sonic vision one that's a lot more intimate and stark than anything off of Mac's two previous records actually this record is the closest Mac has come to completely deviating from his pop - just make a singer-songwriter record and bringing someone like John Bryan so closely into the fold is pretty much a forecast of that change you were talking about someone who has produced music with Aimee Mann Fiona Apple has close ties to Elliott Smith has done a ton of soundtrack work - I sort of got the sense that would be the direction of this album when I heard the teaser cut good news the plucky and muted guitar lines on this track the chord progression the tune sounds more like in my song than anything Mac Miller has done in the past not to mention the tracks intensely sad emotions which play out beautifully in the lyrics exploring themes of abandonment loneliness dejection isolation with Mac Miller performing on the instrumental in a semi wrapped matter-of-factly vocal style that feels like he's just accepting his fate it's a track that is absolutely devastating to listen to after his passing and there are plenty of other cuts here in the tracklist in a somewhat similar vein like the opening track circles whose smooth and serene bass the faint guitars as well as the very subtle embellishments around all of that sounds like something from The Velvet Underground self-titled I like that the instrumental direction of this record generally is very bare very naked it gives Mac's understated voice a lot more power with this intense focus there's not a whole lot between you and the voice it's just right there in your face not in an aggressive way but again in an intimate way later in the tracklist we have the song everybody which on a record like this you kind of expect at one point you are going to get a somewhat sad piano ballad this song is that cut and it's fitted with a spotlit theatrical intro the style of the song from the tune to the mention of a Blues player who's blind sounds decades old it just so turns out this track is actually a cover of Arthur Lee's everybody's got to live Arthur's work I was familiar with from his time in the band love but I was actually not hip to his solo stuff pre this project and I think Mac's rendition here is pretty good considering how lush smooth and melancholic this version turned out in comparison with the original one more tune full stunner on this LP is the track hand-me-downs which is aided by an appearance from Melbourne borrow and it's a beautiful song Mack sounds like a dejected lounge singer who is just too weary to sing above a raspy whisper meanwhile the rap verse he works in on the bridge of the song is like 10 lyrical cuts above anything on Divine Feminine on this moment Mac like really channels his inner andre 3000 from the flow to the delivery to the word choice to even that little um pause that he does in the middle of a line to finish the rhyme off it's just so Andre plus the sentiment of the track generally is very heartfelt with Mack expressing a desire to pass his jeans on like hand-me-downs jeans that you're wearing jeans like you know make making a baby your genetic genes it's a very pretty moment on the record and also tough to listen to given his passing not every song on this record that is in this vein though in my opinion is amazing you do have the song surf which does have its moments but is a little one-dimensional runs a bit long the song I can see features some kind of thin drums ethereal synthesizers Mac's voice is a little buried in the mix it sounds like a lot of stuff I didn't care for it too much off swimming it just feels like vocally he's riffing away in this very pillowy mist of sound I do enjoy some of the sinister harmonies in the chord progression though as well as the surreal themes and the lyrics talking about dreaming and reality and questioning whether or not things are real or wanting to be shown something that's real something I can see and there's also the mid-paced waltz on that's on me which I think the instrumental here is kind of quaint it's cute but I'm not super crazy about the direction especially since vocally and instrumentally the whole thing is performed in such a straight and passive way all of this just makes up one side of the record though because on swimming I did enjoy the occasional funky groove or heavy dose of sub bass and that happens every once in a while on circles as well like uncomplicated who's easygoing combo of smooth bass and fat kicks and zingy synth chords sounds like something from Tyler the creators flower boy I get a similar vibe off of the track hands as well and even though I'm not crazy about how subdued the vocals are on this track I do think they reflect the weary tone of the lyrics being very worn down with life's many complications also the bridge on this track is very heavenly I kind of enjoy the squeaky falsetto vocals that Mack pulls off at this point of the song - I absolutely love the beat on the track blue world I think the stuttering vocal samples are great a little disorienting but fun they pair very well with the head bobbing kick and clap pattern meanwhile Mack wraps with this really cool charisma that he pulled off so well on records like good AM plus you have the slick blissful choruses the track transitions into so nicely good contrasts easily one of my favorites here then with the track woods you have a pretty good combination of groove and gloom with a story of what sounds like a dissipating relationship Mack from his standpoint it sounds like he doesn't want it to be over solid rapping solid singing once again I enjoy how upfront his voices in these mixes it gives his singing so much power despite the fact that he's not like this monumental vocalist no matter what your abilities are artistically a lot of the appeal of what you do is going to come down to how you present it and I think this record is a key example of that this was so good and it's very sad to know that Mack will not be progressing past this point but I'm not sure if fans could have asked for a better musical send-off I suppose even though every track on this LP didn't exactly blow me away this is easily the best album Mac Miller has done in this vein and one of his more solid projects as well from the production to the melodies to the songwriting and the performances the way they're presented and the lyrical focus as well there are a lot of things to love about this LP I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition have you've given this one a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana rest in peace Mac Miller forever 
CRdHP88An2s,haha hi everyone first new review of the new year here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Eminem record music to be murdered by rap legend Eminem comes through with another surprise record music to be murdered by this one all I'm gonna say is that this obviously was not an album I was expecting had I been expecting it I would not have been looking forward to it mostly because it's no secret that m's last couple of records have been a little rough revival a record so bad even his most devoted stands could not rationalize it plus he still seems mad to this day over the reception it rightfully received and how is Eminem going to progress to something better if he can't come to terms with why revival got the response that it did for sure kamikaze was slightly better but only because it didn't go on forever like revival did and the best songs on here were kind of fueled by the anger that Eminem had over the reception of revival so all I really went into this record thinking is that maybe with some time to cool down and collect himself plus with that really good MGK diss under his belt maybe Eminem would provide a new direction a new sound a new something I mean the cover and title certainly made me wonder if he would be going back to more of his horror core roots on this one plus the surprisingly good darkness made me curious as to how morbid or serious in tone this record would be - so there are 20 tracks here over an hour of material a few Alfred Hitchcock vocal snippets in the mix to kind of reinforce this murder horror narrative that the record doesn't really follow through with when you get down to the themes and the concepts of all of the tracks here individually and whether or not they work together to create something greater a bit of a confusing feature list on the album - because after mocking this new generation of rappers on kamikaze I guess Eminem has no qualms with bringing young MA and the late juice world on here who personally I think are both talented and worthy of a spa on any major artists record not sure if mmm would have felt that same way two years ago though as now it looks like maybe he is trying to pick out some exceptions to the rule of his previously blanket statements which ultimately I think is a good thing if you're a major artist and you're not open or scrambling to having someone as talented and as versatile as Anderson pack on your record you have lost the narrative so in a way it does sound like Eminem is trying to give the kids what they want while balancing that with what some of his most hardcore fans want production from dr. Dre Royce two five nine features every member of slaughterhouse except Joe Budden on the last song I will and of course fast fast fast fast fast fast rapping got a rap fast there is plenty of edgy lyricism on the record to which we will get into later but still I have to give Eminem credit on this one for not being so stuck in his ways trying to keep his ear to the ground especially on the production side of things quite a bit of which is actually credited in part to Eminem which was also the case on kamikaze but I think the beats this time around sound a lot better it's cool to hear Eminem outside of his comfort zone a little bit with the simple chai meat rap beat and huge sub base on unaccommodating even if that track is a little under written in comparison with some others here structurally also the booming dusty drums and chipmunk vocal samples on you go and learn are really good too plus the goofy scents and punchy drums on Godzilla or littleengine have a bit of a tongue-in-cheek quality to them which ever so slightly takes the edge off the Dumber lines Eminem spits on these tracks or at least makes the humor of them land a bit better and then there's darkness which instrumentally is a bit of a less-is-more moment lots of quiet sound effects enhancing everything Eminem says on the track gentle trap drums a slow-moving piano passage and a sharp interpolation of Simon and Garfunkel's the sound of silence I know there are Eminem skeptics out there that will outright reject anything happening on this LP instrumentally because it is an Eminem album but try to imagine some of the beats here working really well for other artists the song Yaya is a cool mix of old and new with its prominent Busta Rhymes vocal samples heavy drums out of pocket high hats and buzzing synths honestly it sounds like something Danny Brown would go insane over then there's the monstrous bass and microscope drums on marsh Travis Scott could auto croon over these psychedelic washes of effects and slightly delayed trap drums from lock it up all day and the luscious combo of hip-hop and soul on into deep to me sounds like something that could have landed on Kanye's past couple of records though I know it might be hard to hear that past Eminem's annoying yelled vocal harmonies on the gun on the track something I wish he would stop doing look not every beat on this record is amazing there are certainly a few head scratchers like the Ace of Base ass instrumental on farewell which sounds like all that she wants to me it just sounds like all that she wants oh and also the muddy explosion of organ and diarrhea bass on leaving heaven the chorus on that track really needed to go back to the drawing board it really did not to mention how many hooks with Skylar Grey are you going to do that sound exactly like this so even though there are aspects of this album I like and I think are better than Kamikaze better than revival I'm not saying this album is mmm new because of course there are tracks here where he can't seem to give up his worst musical habits there are songs on this thing where I am struggling not to hit the skip thankfully I can only count these moments on one hand whereas with revival it's like yep I'm countin my toes we have those kind of nights where Eminem I guess is recounting a bunch of sexual encounters he's had while going out at the club taking him back to his d12 days which should have stayed back there especially if you're gonna have edge here and do this lotion II ass hook oh my God my whole iPods filled with your songs I mow my lawn to him it's it's just a very tedious story with lots of references to getting high bisexual women also stunning bars like I'm a candle I'll go out if you're blowing me and getting head in a bucket marshmellow also can't say I'm all that big of a fan of stepdad on this record either I don't mind the anger or even the theme of this track it's a grim story of violence and abuse whose tone is slightly off for one the progression and details of the story make me wonder how much of it is actually being embellished because rarely do occurrences of abuse play out so cinematically with this storyline setup and character establishment and development of violent climax the most garish thing about the track though is easily the instrumental which is like booming loud in your face like this whole situation is really epic and then there's the hook my stepdad again this adds to the tone of a song about being abused just feeling off that in lines like sneak up with a lethal injection and put him down like they did to my dog I'm talking euthanasia like kids in Taiwan call me crazy but I just feel like being abused by a parent or guardian and rapping or singing about that does not beget that sort of lyric the track Marsh not only sports one of the worst choruses on the entire record but some of the worst lines stacked on top of each other - I get dough like Ed Sheeran so call me the gingerbread man how could I hit a dry spell I'm named after the wetlands I look up to myself like a fucking head stand right now I live in an igloo and I'm not chilling the fuck out toward the end of the LP where shady is feeling a bit more introspective we get the song no regrets which is so boring and tedious it should be illegal another song where Marshall is kind of obsessed with not living up to the expectations of his fans who want him to be the old him he then goes on to express regret over his previous attacks focused on hurl sweatshirt and Tyler the Creator though it is refreshing to hear Eminem in a place where he can't acknowledge past transgressions like that much of everything else on this LP is either good or close enough and then is kneecapped by one two or three really bad lines like at one point where he's rapping about other artists who were essentially students of his style saying that it seems like the more they studied my music the more they remind me of eyeballs I'm watching my pupils get cornea cornea though I guess at least em is willing to acknowledge that copycats of his style are really corny and maybe you should take take this as a hint from the the God to to stop on this same track Eminem also drops an ariana grande concert bombing line which at this point are we really even surprised the probability of him rapping about this was about as high as him dropping a bar comparing a blowjob to blowing into a Nintendo cartridge which he also does and that's all just on this unaccommodating track the following cut you go and learn with rights to 5/9 has a lot better vibe even if the first leg of Royce's verse is a bit of a lyrical miracle thing I do like the smart declaration of the difference between segregation and separation toward the end of his verse though and lyrically Eminem is kind of on fire here with the tape flip line the water I walk on Waterloo Line and the way that ties in to the drip drop line I thought that was smart I also liked the hard-hitting Godzilla Eminem's flows on this thing fly like a professional boxers fists the juice hook is slick as hell and even if Eminem does go a little overboard with the fast rapping in the last leg to the point where he's filling the air with lines that just either don't make sense or sound silly I'm not avoidable I'm not available I'm not a toilet bowl but least he's self-aware enough to stop himself in the end and drop a bit of a reference to that joke that comedian Chris D'Elia made it him in that viral video where he's making fun of his rap style you use in too many napkins napkins Lampkin he does put out a simile though where he compares himself with a liar's pants saying he's on fire though it's a bit much once more I am impressed with the attention to detail and the passion that goes into the track darkness the personal parallels the Eminem draws between himself and the shooter on that track I thought were really smart and kind of illustrates to the listener that this sort of thing is just one bad decision away for a lot of people who are suffering from mental health issues drug issues it seems really odd though that just a handful of tracks later Eminem would write a really callous bar about that same Mandalay Bay shooting but at this point expecting Eminem to be consistently tasteful you you shouldn't hold your breath and even though it's not my favorite in the tracklist here I do still want to give props to leaving heaven which not only gives a focused account of Eminem's come up through poverty and a bad family situation but damn he really hates his deadbeat dad completely going off on him in the final verse of the track despite the fact that the the man just died last year sometimes people who are an Eminem situation will say well you know he was good in this way or that way were extra Gnaeus factors but no and Eminem like really wants him liked to be dead and wants to hit him the song never love again is one of the many love songs in the tracklist here but this one is actually just a metaphor for his long-running addiction to pills I love the verses and the instrumental on this track I love how close he is able to get to the topic but still keep the song and the lyricism footed and grounded in this theme of it being like a love like a relationship I like these elements of the tracks so much they kind of overcome just have stereotypically Eminem the hook is the chorus is also mega mega mega weak on I will the track with slaughterhouse which was disappointing because you you really should go all-out on a track like this and and I think lyrically each person here does Eminem does share one of his better verses on this track too and the instrumental in general I don't mind either but it's it's not the firework show I guess I was hoping for still ending could have been a lot worse could have been a lot lot worse and I will say that generally about this record to this record could have been a lot worse could have been a way way way WAY WAY worse album really could have so while there are some stinkers in the tracklist here there are some very Eminem spots that's all I can say about them at this point there are some spots where Eminem does still feel stuck in his ways I do genuinely think that he put out some very good tracks here he put together and wrote on some very good instrumentals he had some good guests while I don't love it and there are spots where he does come off very bitter like on the intro track this this is this is better better than his last couple of LPS assuming you're not the type of person who is repulsed by literally anything Eminem does I'm feeling a strong v to light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head

JFSw-jTRy6Y,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time we are back with the weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week it's been a while our first weekly track roundup of 2020 okay to zero to zero we have quite a few tracks to get to because I'm covering some tracks that dropped last week as well

the ridge yes they're still with us in 2020 these nifty metal-plated minimalist wallets change my fucking life bro now my wallet fits nicely in my front pocket got rid of that disgusting old leather wallet I did actually have a leather wallet because the wallet I had it since I was a little boy and my grandma got it for me and I don't know it just like didn't really fall apart you know it was like the one thing left from my old previant life and there are many things that vegans typically hold on to you know that weren't necessarily vegan before they went vegan and that was really kind of the last part of my life that so that was you know hanging on from that era I've already shared way too much with you so let's go on to the worst tracks of the week let's go to the worst tracks of the week but anyway the the ridge link is down there below promo code Mellon 10% off but bam worse tracks of the way we've got a couple we've got a couple some of which you will know because I've talked about them on the Fantana channel some of which you will be unhappy with but let's go first oh the new king cruel track I am NOT into it I cannot say that I am into it the title of this one don't let the dragon drag on and yet that's exactly what this track does it drags on despite not really being all that long I mean I do like that Archie is trying to instill some sort of mood into this track but just how sparse and impressionistic the vocals and the guitars are it's just very tedious and doesn't really go much of anywhere for me much like everything else that was on the hoos but hey Who am I to say because there are hardcore King cruel fans out there who fucking love those and that's like their least favorite review of mine so if you hated my review of that you most likely hate my take on this if you like that record you will most likely like this moving on from there the new Justin Bieber single is trash really no way to cut it generic trap beat underwhelming vocal performance super under written and boring and mind-numbing hook we don't need it and we have Green Day with a song they're teasing toward their new record with oh yeah is the title of this one and it is hideous just like every other teaser we have heard so far this one a bit poppier I guess then everything they've teased up until this point but I just don't really get what the band is trying to do on this new record other than alienate all of their fans I just don't know moving on from there Drake and future together on the track life is good and it sucks it's basically like two half songs from future and Drake and I just kind of pulled together into one non song and the production is pretty weak too I just don't really get the point of it and then we have Drake with war who let Drake rap like he's from the UK who let him do that for years this man has been whitewashing dancehall and rapping about Tings and all that shit and now the dude is like man this man that man the other thing and he's like I don't know like try to be a super mellow soft lotion he smooth drill wrapper please what the fuck like what why why are we allowing this to happen he can't keep getting away with it song is super mediocre not much in terms of like a strong chorus or anything beat is okay comes in and comes out in a flash doesn't really leave much of an impression and I mean the only thing that's memorable yeah the only thing that is memorable about it is just how silly Drake sounds trying to adopt like a little bit of an inflection and all of this lingo that all of these UK drill and grime rappers have been kind of delivering for years and years and years Drake just sounds stupid doing it I do not get it and then we have Best Coast who is back with a new single everything has changed and while I I do appreciate how in concept this song is a bit of I guess a very meta and emotional retrospective on maybe a lot of the negative emotions that were felt when Best Coast was at its peak of relevancy and controversy and maybe the pressures that were going on from the fans from the music industry from haters so on and so forth all seem to get addressed in a very vague but obvious way on this track and it's okay I mean I guess if you're really invested in the Best Coast narrative but who is I mean most people just listen to best Coast for breezy cool beachy rock music not that there hasn't been any personal best coast music up until this point but this just kind of seems like I don't know sort of beyond what Best Coast typically does and not that Best Coast couldn't come through with a a really cool introspective track but the tone of the song doesn't really fit that either it just sounds like a generic indie rock instrumental with just like you know horns in the air and a some windmills on the guitar chords I just don't get it it's kind of like the Beverly Hills Beverly Hills being the very terrible Weezer single it's like the Beverly Hills above a best coast I don't really get it let's move on to the tracks that I thought were men not terrible not blowing me away but certainly worth mentioning worth pointing out starting with wasted shirt which I guess is a new project that is being spearheaded by Ty Siegel and Brian Chippendale of lightning-bolt Fame double the dream is the name of this track and it's a pretty cool hectic noisy lo-fi punk rager did get quite a bit though there were some aspects of the vocals and the songwriting I think could have been more distinct kind of get lost in the haze and everything but it's pretty fun it's pretty fun it'll blast your brains out then we have the men who are kind of going back to the 80s a little bit on this new wave ish cut children all over the world which should be no surprise considering the men are such an interesting band in terms of all the different musical styles they've adopted over the course of their career we have soccer mommy a musical project that I haven't been really crazy about up until this point but this kind of soft 90s ish moody rocker over here circle the drain and I thought was was pretty decent had some solid vocal melodies on it we also have Morrissey with this new cut over here Morrissey post quite a bit of controversy in 2019 is still dropping music and this one isn't bad he comes through kind of sound and like classic Morrissey a little bit kind of going back to his roots in the 80s and it just sounds like anaesthetic and sounds like a groove that his voice works over very well I'm not super crazy about it but I don't hate it either and I think his vocals are kind of dramatic on a Bobby don't you think they know is the title of it we have also Jenny Lewis we have with Jenny Lewis Habib Quach a and we have artists for peace and justice teaming up on this new big collaborative cut that is is partially quaint indie funky country and then there are I suppose some afrobeat influences not afro beats but afro beat influences that are worked in more toward the back end tract I can't explain how uniquely these different musical styles come together on this track and there are different portions of the song that are influenced more you know by the indie side then there are others which is kind of interesting I'm not super crazy with you know how it came together because it does sound a little awkward at points but hey I mean I would give it an A plus plus plus plus for effort under the super moon is the title of it and the the refrain the under the super moon refrain is actually pretty sweet moving on from there holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck are back with de leaders this track featuring Angus Andrew of liars Fame is pretty groovy a little trippy I I wish the vocals were a bit less washed out and everything but it's still got it's still got a good beat to it still got a good beat to it not the best music from this band I've ever heard but it's certainly more lively than some of the other stuff they've put out in kind of preparation for this new album released in 2020 we also have destroyer aka Dan Behar with a brand new track cue synthesizer which is a very verbose spoken word ish meta musical mood piece that it does get kind of tedious frankly I mean I am still looking forward to this new I have we met destroy your record but it's it's not tracks like this that are really getting me excited we also have BTS with map of the soul 7 or rather a track from it this black swan track and I suppose it's okay I think it's actually one of bts's least distinct songs in quite a while I mean there were even some pretty hard-hitting songs like boy with love off of the last map of the soul and and from what I understand like the music video for this track is like a really cool art piece and for sure that is going to launch this song to incredible new heights but listening to the song and observing just the song it seems like a very boring combination of American trap music with some slightly melodic vocals verses here and there but it all comes together in a very structured efficient blob where yes of course I do hear each member's distinct voice and everything but there's not a whole lot of highs and lows to the way this track is built to my ears it just kind of seems like the unique fusion of genres that usually comes to the table in a BTS song and the best k-pop music out there isn't really here on this track whereas this song seems a lot more one-dimensional than a lot of what was on you know the last couple of records and again the recent map of Seoul project two we also have black MIDI starting a bit of a beef with Ed Sheeran over here on their new track dead Sheeran which is like a weird experimental post glitch beat tune combined with some very raw ed Sheeran insults on the back end as we shift over numerous different I guess B switches and everything it's pretty insane not the best constructed track that black MIDI has ever done and I doubt they take it all that seriously but still it's worth checking and checking out especially if you want to hear somebody insult ed Sheeran so in such a mean way on a musical recording we also have the black lips with their brand-new track over here from their forthcoming country record in a world that's falling apart which I'm pretty excited for I mean country music has always played a bit of an influence on the lips music but to hear them going full country on a full record could be pretty cool rumbler this new song over here I thought was all right not the best song I think they've written but still it does have that somewhat rough and wild genuine country feel I guess kind of a punky garage ish country feel which is you know you kind of expect the black lips to bring that vibe to any song or any tune that they do no matter what the style is so you know it's it's here it's here in spades alright we also have st. Vincent doing a bit of a beck remix over here uneventful days in my opinion one of the most boring tracks from pecs new album again being st. Vincent remixed and I will tell you that the beat on this version is a lot more lively I'm liking the instrumental a lot lot lot lot more I'm not gonna say it saves the song or anything but if you are a st. Vincent fan or if you're a Beck fan who would like to hear this track improved give it a shot give it a listen and we also have Algiers over here which in my opinion this track they have released and even in compare some of the incredibly experimental cut they dropped toward the end of 2019 this track we can't be found I think this may be the weakest teaser of this new album cycle so far I think that there's a lot of tension building on the verses that doesn't necessarily get all that much release on the hooks which I think just don't really hit all that hard but hey the band's post-punk II take two revolutionary rock and soul music is still here on this track and if you didn't really dig that a kind of wild out there piece they dropped last year maybe this will be more to your liking and o7o shake Kanye collaborator who you guys might remember from his yay record guilty conscience his name of her brand-new single and it's that bad it's got a solid hook and a pretty straightforward theme of you know just lashing out at the fact that you were cheated on I suppose and kind of catching that other person in the act I I think the vocals are alright I think the instrumental is so-so I mean while I think the tune at the core of it is solid and I think that the messaging is pretty clear and certainly compelling you know I wanted to hear more about the story and everything going on in the track as I was reading into it but I think the presentation could really use some work I mean shake from what I gathered from her work with Kanye sounds like a pretty unique singer and she's got a strange tone of voice and I feel like that characteristic of her work wasn't really embraced on this track in any sort of way it sounded a little plain to my ears which disappointed me we also have 2 Chainz over here with a brain new track featuring future I like chains very subdued low-key flows on this one sounds almost 21 savage ish in some respects I'm not trying to say that you know 2 Chainz is like a 21 Savage copier if anything savages into 2 Chainz but still having said that that's not bad you know not like the best track he's ever done and the future feature is pretty standard but it's it's pretty good it's pretty good now let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best this week the ones that hit the hardest the ones that left the biggest impression are you ready are you ready let's go first we have u.s girls in a poem unlimited I listed in my best albums of the decade list because it is that good of an album and this new song over here over time is great as well I like how peppy and Abbey it is I haven't read all the way into the lyrics yet but given that it is a u.s. girls track they are as thoughtful as the instrumental linked to this track - we also have Treecko Japanese math rock band sounding as tight and as melodic and as intricate as ever on their brand-new track over here pitch black which I thought was pretty sweet we also have Thundercat with Steve Lacey and Steve Arrington on here funking it up with some great bass licks and a solid groove as well like this one quite a bit and looking forward to hearing more from Thundercat in 2020 hopefully we also have tame impala lost in yesterday talk this track up over on the Fantana channel I am liking how groovy and how lyrically dense all of these new tame impala tracks are turning out I'm liking and I'm like and I'm like in it we also have square pusher with a brand new cut over here I hope I am pronouncing this correctly maybe not but nerve levers this is easily one of the I guess glitchy ax stand I don't want to say glitchy us must bustling and fun tracks I have heard Tom put out in a while so pretty excited to hear what he's going to be doing on this record this new one so hell yeah square pusher we also have a new musical project over here featuring a cross Oh from or a crossover of the body lingua Notah and full of hell okay you got all that linguae full the body and sightless is the name of this project Kings corpse is the name of the track and it is noisy insane it is batshit insane I want to hear more it is absolutely off-the-wall the haunting freakish clean vocals the shots of noise the the weird sequence drums that you would typically hear I think maybe behind a more of an electronic or a hip-hop song or something that turned up on this track it's a very odd combination of everything but I'm here for these guys just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks we also have a brand new track this track is stunning this new Moses some nice song is beautiful it's gorgeous it's amazing it's stunning it's beautiful it's gorgeous it's amazing it's stunning it's beautiful it's gorgeous is amazing it's titled me in 20 years this suit is easily one of the most exciting new faces an art pop out there keep listening keep paying attention birds of prey the album this song is diamonds from Meghan the stallion and normanni you know usually these are kind of movie tie-in songs and you know promotional music and shit like that just sucks and is really bad but this is one of those rare occasions where the track actually goes it bangs awesome vibe awesome energy the chemistry between these two is great and Meghan's flows throughout the track are pretty fucking great too so love this one it hits hard we have Mac Miller with his track over here which this album is already out this is Mac Miller's posthumous record circles but I still wanted to get a bit of a give a bit of a miniature shout out here to the track good news that I reviewed over on the Fantana channel which I'm sure most if not all of you have already seen for reasons that I don't need to go back over in this video but I still am looking forward to listening to this album and talking about it but yeah it's a great song fantastic track obviously incredibly moving for anybody who has heard it or is aware of already my on it but yeah loved it wanted to give it another give it another shout out here and we'll be reviewing this record you know and giving it more listens ASAP we have also want to give a shout out to hire a new Murray this new track fanfare over here kind of sees more horns and more layers of gorgeous instrumentation backing the tents and verbose approach to rock music this artist is typically known for so digging on this one new sound I suppose will there be more like it down the pipe I don't know but we will be here paying attention we also have Frances Quinlan of Hopalong Fame with another teaser from her new full-length album give it a listen give it a listen give it a listen loving this one two and Eminem surprising me with a track titled darkness which is a song that is partially about the Las Vegas shooter partially also about just gun control in general I thought that the storytelling was pretty good I thought the delivery was measured and not obnoxious which is good I thought the hook was solid as well I thought the Simon and Garfunkel interpolation was quality too and I didn't really dislike anything about this track in fact I liked most things about it can't say yet if I am loving this entire new mmm an MLP in full but you will hear my thoughts very soon so get ready I also want to give a shout out to Dan Deacon who has been teasing toward this new record of his become a mountain is the name of this new track and it's minimal it is lush it is amazing I'm liking that Dan is getting a little less shy about his vocal work in this as well because that is actually quite good I am enjoying this new direction for Dan and this is gonna be the first time I think I've enjoyed a Dan Deacon record in years if I do actually end up loving us so I'm I am primed I'm fucking primed for this Dan Deacon record we have code orange with underneath a track that kind of broadcasts a new sound and direction for the band and has upset some fans don't exactly know why well it's different that's why but the band seems to be embracing some elements of new metal industrial metal pop rock as well kind of mixing it all together with a lot of strange transitions and in unlikely passages and change ups and despite all the weird switches it comes together pretty solidly and I like the song I like how heavy it is I like how savage it is I like the more melodic bits I like how versatile the trail the track is and dynamic it is you know I look here's the thing if rock music is going to stay relevant in any way whatsoever artists got an experiment and I think this is a pretty legitimate and interesting you know approach to doing things differently and just trying to keep it fresh just trying to keep things interesting so again liking it we also have buss it this new track from re Lenox they just came out with a new deluxe version of that dreamville compilation that dropped last year there's new material on it this track is one of those tracks and this song is fucking sexy as fuck I love it it's it's sweet its sensual it's it's raunchy too and I'm loving it also enjoying this new 1975 track surprisingly me and you together song which is a very jangle euphoric pretty little pop rock tune with a kind of vintage flare I thought that the songwriting was solid and I don't know I have been in a weird place lately where I'm really really really enjoying some of the 1975 s recent stuff not everything but the when it when it does impress me to impressions pretty nicely so uh I don't know all I can say is I'm just looking forward to this this new project they have coming down the pipe the 1975 sure why not and that is gonna be it that is the weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching again all the songs I talked about linked down below check them out for yourself and I will see you guys in the next video Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup roofer

best and the worst music of the 2010s in this video my top 200 Albums of the past 10 years it's a lot of albums but that's a long span of time to be talking about some music and there were a lot of great records that dropped over the past 10 years even more that honestly did not make this list but still for everyone's sanity and convenience especially mine I am handling the bottom half of this list in a block I will be taking the next quarter in sections and then speaking more about each album individually in my top 50 every record in this list is placed down below by name in the description box so if you're curious about a name a title anything like that it's down there and so with my 100 in first spot at the top my 200th spot at the bottom here is my bottom 100 records here it is you can see it on screen come and see all the albums okay so we are now entering the top 100 section let's go going from 100 to 90 one we have Daft Punk with random access memories the legendary dance music duo's celebration of all the sounds and musical styles that have influenced their stuff over the years Bjork's breakup oriented concept album vuln akira comes next after that it has run the jewels taking a refreshing and an updated approach to hardcore hip-hop on run the jewels - following that Regina Spektor bring some of the best piano based singer-songwriter music of the decade remember us to life FK a twigs LP one awesome and forward-thinking and cutting-edge alternative R&B that was certainly some of the best in that genre of this decade can't also forget the great production from ARCA on this one Crowley's years passed matter a wild technical and experimental black metal record Radiohead a moon shaped pool which really needs no introduction at this point crying beyond the fleeting gales a awesome mix of synth pop twee guitar heroism it's such a weird and wild mix of rock styles and pop styles that I've heard nowhere else this decade and I'm dying to hear more from this band in the near future at 92 the west coast is alive and well on YG's still brazii a narrative heavy hip hop album with tons of great hooks good flows following that it's perfume genius with put your back into it a series of hushed sobering and chilling piano songs going from 90 to 80 one we have period with frozen Niagara Falls Dominic approaches so many different sounds and styles on this very versatile but consistently grim and icy record 89 it is Nicholas jar with spaces only noise some amazing micro house jams and fusions on that one Travis Scott 88 rodeo the way Travis kind of turned trap into an expression of progressive and psychedelic music with the B switches the changes the really wet and mind-altering production was something to behold in the past 10 years following that it's how Anna Marie how Ruto shura an amazing mix of fart pop J pop rock punk hip hop music it's it's really just like everything that you could imagine coming together onto this gem of a record from Japan next MGMT with little Dark Age the duo explorers slightly gothic synth pop and so much more on their best crop of songs yet at 85 destroyer brings sophistic to a new level on put Billy woods one of the most esoteric and shadowy rappers of the East Coast on history will absolve me that one's amazing sons of Kemet one of the best jazz acts out of the UK right now killing it on your queen is a reptile at 82 it's billy Eilish with when we all fall asleep where do we go a pop record that in my opinion is vastly vastly vastly underrated and appreciated among the music snob e'er crowd I mean the production on this thing for a pop record sounds like nothing else in its field right now and at 81 it is wise but with what I think is one of the best baroque pop records of the decade Titanic rising going from 80 to seventy one starting with o2 bouquet beaver e tacoma hits one of the best punk bands out of japan right now in this record is blistering explosive and thrilling 79 it is Dorian Elektra one of the most exciting new faces in pop to drop over the past ten years - with some wild and gender bent approaches - electro pop and bubblegum bass following that it is Rosalia with Los Angeles a fantastic neo flamenco album featuring amazing amazing amazing vocal work one of the best and most thoughtful singer songwriters of this past decade Alex Cameron Miami memory at seventy-seven one of the best rappers in the UK right now little Sims at 76 with gray area perfume genius no shape after that once more at 75 Grave babies crusher at 74 mind-blowing Li loud goth rock record that I am still trying to wrap my head around next Shu Shu plays the music of Twin Peaks on plays the music of Twin Peaks and their takes on key tracks from the legendary TV series soundtrack are something else legendary hip-hop outfit A Tribe Called Quest at 72 with we got it from here thank you for your service these guys are sounding better than ever on this comeback record it is an amazing note to go out on and 71 janelle monae creates a cool series of fusions and crossovers between the worlds of art pop and R&B on the ark android going from 70 to 61 the legendary electro pop duo the knife pull out all the stops on their swan song of an album shaking the habitual following that at 69 liars go full throttle with dystopian post-punk electronics on mess at 68 we have scott walker's final LP bish Bosch which is easily one of the strangest things that you will hear not just this decade but ever throughout the rest of your entire life neck it's killer Mike with rap music which honestly still sounds like an atomic bomb coming out of the south then it's King gizzard and the lizard wizard fusing elements of psych garage and punk on the seamless nonagon infinity next we have the return of none other than D'Angelo with the Vanguard on black Messiah a totally left-field and one-of-a-kind fusion of funk and R&B then it's one of the most beautiful and texturally gratifying ambient and drone records of the decade a double album of sorts we have dream loss and alien observer from grouper at 63 I was totally won over by the intricate and groovy rock instrumentals and impressive vocal guests on battles glossed drop at 62 it's one of the best punter phonics records of the decade 106 point Nevers replica and Algiers speak truth to power with their unique fusion of post-punk and soul on the underside of power and now going from 60 to 51 we have cure and J Kalinin with bravado a record that yes has that big meme attached to it do you know the one the guy was singing in the mountain that one but if you listen to this entire record it does show that Kieran proves himself to be one of the most enigmatic and genuinely authentically strange songwriters out there and very charismatic too at 59 Jack White takes a big fat bold risk on his most experimental solo effort yet boarding-house reach split a lot of his fan base up with this one but still for me it's a great record next we have a unique combination of narrative and free jazz on the Montana Roberts record coin coin Chapter four and with Sun Kil moons common as light and love our red valleys of blood mark kozilek proves himself to be one of the most filterless singer songwriters of all time at number 56 we get one of the most beefed steel and forward-thinking black metal records of the decade with altar of plagues teeths glory and Andrew Jackson jihad knife man the closest thing I think we will ever get to a folk punk rock opera at 54 Kayne West the life of Pablo Kayne is truly at one of the most freakish points in his discography here then following that Queens of the Stone Age like Clockwerk easily one of the best rock albums of the decade at 52 noise hop trio clipping comes through with their fantastic Sub Pop debut and a 51 with tons of ambition and Lofa Rock production will Toledo and company as carci headrests explore how tumultuous one's teens and 20s can be on teens of denial and so we are now going into our top 50 of the decade let's do it number 50 we have death grips with their ambitious double album the powers-that-be one half super jittery insane instrumentals loaded with Bjork samples the other half some of the most guitar intensive work they've ever done on Jenny death at number 49 it is ghost with meliora a satanic enjoyable I cultish metal record that is amazingly catchy and still sees the band's edge intact while writing some of their sharpest smartest and sweetest songs to date at 48 it is Frank Ocean with blonde a record that at this point really needs no introduction or explanation I think as far as its portrayal of mood and emotion it is one of the most reflective of this current generations vibe I guess you could say number forty-seven goes to Caracara bonitos bonito generation an amazing mix of dance pop and electro-pop and J pop that is incredibly bouncy sweet and speaks to a certain naive youthfulness that in a weird way I find a little comforting with number 46 it is the amazing crossover of two kings in hip hop Freddie Gibbs Freddy Kane with mad lib on pinata at 45 beach house give us one of the boldest and most fantastic statements on Dream pop of this decade with teen dream at number 44 we have Nicolas jar yet again but under his against all logic alias 2012 to 2017 where he delivers a bunch of fantastic flavorful dark and groovy house cuts with number 43 we have what I feel is one of the greatest and most exciting new faces and alchemists in the pop realm and that would be Clarence clarity with no now at number 42 we have one of the best bands to ever do it out of Japan melt banana with fetch a mind-blowing blistering and lightning-fast combination of punk rock and noise and with 41 we have what is easily one of the most passionate and thrilling post-punk records of the decade from Ice Age plowing into the field of love number 40 we have one of the most crushing heavy and feral approaches to rock music from dopes body on the record Natural History at 39 we have four tet one of the most dynamic subtle beautiful expressions of micro house in the 2010s number 38 Agalloch marrow of the spirit one of the best american black metal records of this decade in my opinion a passionate beautiful melodic and inspiring combination of metal and folk aesthetics and at 37 we have one of the grandest most experimental exciting and underappreciated records in the black metal field liturgy with haq cue number 36 Flying Lotus expands the possibilities of hip hop of electronic music of jazz on the amazing cosmic grandma and on 35 power violence reaches a level of ferocity and volume and just general aggression that it's never known before on nails unsilent death 34 is one of the most stunningly beautiful records pristine records to drop in the 2010s that is julia halters have you in my wilderness and with 33 it's one of the most disturbing records in the shoo-shoo discography girl with basket of fruit on 32 La Dispute pushes storytelling in screamo to new heights on wildlife and on 31 Shabazz Palaces explores new psychedelic in experimental realms in hip-hop on black up at number 30 jpg mafia experimental hip hop warrior drops veteran at 29 Big KRIT gives Mississippi or continues to give Mississippi a voice with his stupendous double record forever is a mighty long time Ariel pink hones his instrumental chops his production chops and his songwriting on pom-pom and at 27 behemoth with the Satanist they literally make a black metal record that is so good they had to have sold their souls to the devil to make it at 26 we have one of the most eerily beautiful records in indie rock and that is women with public strain at number 25 it's not just some of the darkest music of the decade but some of the darkest music imaginable on the lingua ignitor record Caligula exploring themes of abuse as well as sounds from the worlds of classical and industrial music this is easily one of the most unsettling records of the past ten years at number 20 for its Natalia for Katya with muses volume 2 you can easily put Volume one in this section as well as both records are an amazing expression of various shades of South American folk music you can tell everyone just went into these songs with so much love and so much care and so much passion about how they sounded it is just like my ears being kissed just kissed by little baby angels at 23 we have what is essentially the swan song of the legendary folk tronic and sound collage duo the books with the way out with number 22 English singer-songwriter richard dawson gives us a series of funky and experimental meditations that are a quick glimpse into a very near future what Dawson does on this record is explores a lot of very negative aspects and ills of modern society and tries to turn the clock forward on them ever so slightly and and just kind of exacerbating how bad things can get in the very near future in a very great way with a fantastic songwriting wild guitar work I love it I love it I love it at 21 we have Brock Hamptons trio of saturation record saturation 1 saturation to saturation 3 the boy bands fusions of pop rap R&B and everything in between caused quite a stir this decade and for good reason number 20 on our list Tyler the Creator Igor the polarizing singer rapper producer reinvents himself into a new character a new concept a new sound muted pop soul and with 19 we have legendary singer-songwriter PJ Harvey let England shake with a very thoughtful meditation on country on politics on the way she identifies and I guess envisions herself as an English person in citizen and how through that lens she observed some of the darker portions of England's past present and future number eighteen sees one of the most heart-wrenching and sobering records of the decade that is mount Airy's a crow looked at me all I can really say about this one is that Phil I hope you're okay number seventeen Sun Kil moon Benji fantastic singer-songwriter record with Mark kozilek delivering to us a perfect balance of story and song as he waxes poetically on everyday life aging and death number sixteen is joanna newsom with have one on me a record whose beauty is just still despite this thing being a decade in the past unfolding to me to this day it is just the densest most gorgeous and most voluptuous onion musical onion i think you can give yourself the tree of listening to number fifteen is my most favorite release in the world of latin music this decade that is owned a trope iike their self-titled LP track after track after track over 40 musicians on this record tons of different styles of latin music styles on styles and then fused with other stuff like pop and reggae and rock but it all works it all works so well it's so huge is so exciting it's so ambitious it's so massive it's so inventive it's so fun it's so gargantuan and it's so goddamn underrated just not enough people listening to this appreciating this and loving it cheese at number 14 it is a gargantuan triple LP of what in my opinion is the best jazz music of the decade and that would be Kumasi washington with the epic a record that truly and honestly lives up to its title at number 13 we have the gorillas with Plastic Beach in my opinion the most exciting concept guest list and production to land on any gorillas record and this list is incredibly fortunate to have had it drop this decade at number 12 we have David Bowie black star rest in peace unfortunately this past we lost a lot of great musical minds and artists David Bowie for me was the one that maybe hit the hardest was the most shocking especially since his passing coincided with the release of his final album here on which narrative Lee he deeply explores concepts of his image of his twilight years of his death and what is likely to be our perception of it it's like listening to a dark grim but also hopeful broadcast from Bowie himself from beyond the grave and at number 11 we have father John misty Josh Tillman pure comedy a record that is a somewhat incomplete but still incredibly admirable passionate and soulful ode to our broken world and everyone in it so here we are top 10 top 10 records of the decade in my humble opinion in my humble opinion let's start 10 Danny Brown atrocity exhibition Detroit rapper Danny Brown pushes the boundaries of darkness suffering and anguish easily the most insane palette of instrumentals nearly any rapper has rapped on this decade combine that with the songwriting the hooks the guests the explosive and manic and absolutely insane vocal delivery that Danny is known for this is absolutely a one-of-a-kind record that we are we're not going to be stunned at this level for quite a long time at number 9 we have a beautiful ambient experimental and drone apocalypse with Tim Hecker virgins the atmosphere and creative sound play that Tim employs on this record are so indescribable it's so bittersweet it's so moving it's so textured I like how direct a lot of the music on this record is for an ambient foreign experimental release the way all these tracks flow into and reinforce each other mmm easily one of the best drone records out there over the past 10 years easily at number eight we have Fleet Foxes with helplessness blues Robyn Peck nolde and the gang give us one pristine and gorgeous layered luscious folk tune after another while simultaneously exploring these deep yearning gigantic feelings of wanting to contribute do good in the world make something of yourself in the world be a part of something greater in that sense it's almost like this record is a religious experience it's like answering a higher calling at number 7 we have a team up for the ages Kanye West Kid Cudi turn hip hop and everything else on its head with kids see ghosts the passion and the explosivity of this record is just so bold so huge and so difficult to measure despite the fact that it comes in such a small and a short package I cannot say enough good things about this little thing of a miniature album Kanye West and Kid Cudi truly bring out the best in each other on this thing hopefully this is not the last time that we hear from both of them in this capacity at number 6 we have what I feel is one of the most exciting and forward-thinking pop records of the decade the shape of pop to come if you will allow me to say Charli XCX with Charlie from the features to the singing to the songwriting and performances to the production everything on this record is top-notch Charlie boldly pushing forward in a genre that typically just rewards conformity I have a feeling it's going to take a very very very very long time for anyone to really thank her for what she did on this LP at number 5 dance Punk has never sounded better than on LCD Soundsystem's this is happening James Murphy and company really outdid themselves on this one from weird absurd four bose bangers like pow pow - funny snarky self-aware commentaries on the band and music itself like you wanted to hit - straightforward silly hard hitters such as drunk girls this record is just one fantastic cut after the next and the way that James and the rest of the band incorporate their influences and other songs and ideas from other records very obviously up pulling ideas out of their biggest inspirations and the width they reinvent them on this record is a really inspiring plus the recording the engineering the production every sound every instrument sounds so goddamn good so goddamn Chris this this is one of the reasons that LCD Soundsystem remains to be one of the best bands of all time even if I wasn't crazy about their their latest record yeah what are you gonna do next on this list at number four is one of the best comebacks of the 2010s a band that I did not foresee returning after they had put out what was essentially their last record in 2010 its daughters with you won't get what you want eight years later the band returns with one of the most harrowing one of the darkest and disturbing explorations of noise rock dealing in all of these themes of mental and emotional disturbance exploring all these feelings of rage and self-destruction and paranoia there are very few records that drop this decade whose exploration of dark emotions panned out in a way that was so potent so you could cut it with a knife that the hairs on the back of your neck would stand up at number three we have Death Grips with the Money Store Death Grips essentially breathe new life into the style the sound of industrial hip-hop by forging their own paths in the sound the underground over the past ten years has very much been focused on expanding the darker and more experimental sides of hip-hop music and I don't know if a group has done that as well as Death Grips did especially on this LP which gives us the one-of-a-kind vocals and lyricism of a ride insane cutting-edge and inventive production the balm Bassett II the unreasonable aggression as well as the explorations of paranoia and our dystopian digital age are all reasons this record land so high on this list not to mention that few albums landed at the level of popularity that this record did while simultaneously opening up as many new sounds and possibilities as it did at number 2 we have swans to be kind the legendary post and experimental rock band came through with a record that in my opinion is the sound of rock music's apocalypse sound of rock music crumbling down violently on to itself and exploding into a bright supernova while I don't think this record is the end of rock music or the death of rock music it's certainly going to be the last time we hear in the genre as we know it a band take the style and hammer it down hammer it out to the point where you can stretch it from one end of the galaxy to the other which leads me to my number one spot on this list Kendrick Lamar to pimp a butterfly I not only am enamored to this day with the instrumentals on this LP it's amazing and expansive musical palette of hip hop jazz soul funk the dense layers the big appropriate list of guests and what a narrative and concept which is executed so freaking well just the way each piece of the story from each track weaves together I know many people and critics over the years have boiled the idea and theme of this album down to maybe one or two things but all in all I see this record as just like this huge idea of self-realization and actualization trying to be the most down-to-earth authentic and moral person you can be while existing in a place in a space where you are surrounded with things and temptations that are trying to push you to be the opposite for Kendrick Lamar that is the music industry and everything that is connected to the music industry and fame at large but you can take a lot of these same ideas and apply them to your own life experience as well because just as Kendrick is on this record all of us are given choices at various points of our life where we are either making the best decision the healthiest decision the smartest decision the most moral decision or we are making the bad choice the negative choice the choice that's either hurting us or hurting others and while the idea of life being a series of choices and realizations and just trying to put yourself on a good path the right path the right path for you that's nothing revolutionary in the grander scheme of things but I think Kendra with this record with his songs with his talent and abilities breathes new life into these ideas in a way that I think no other artists in music or outside of music over the past 10 years has and I think I'm going to leave it at that with to pimp a butterfly at my number 1 here thank you so so so so so much for watching not only this video but the past 10 years of content yes and I will catch you guys in the next review because I'm gonna be reviewing forever transition this is my list thank you over here next to my head is another video that you can check out and also shout out to Jeremy and Austin who came up with their own decade lists which we will link in the description box too and and yeah I think I think that's it that is that is it yeah Anthony Fantana music decade list best albums again forever 
gnkw3tjc4ck,ah hi every one almost the knee done tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of list week going over my favorite and least favorite music of the 2010s I've done my worst singles my worst albums like a good boy and now I'm doing my top 100 songs and singles of the decade partially doing a list like this makes me sad because there's so many other tracks that I loved now how are good that would be lovely on a list like this but hey I had to cut it to 100 for my own sanity which is hanging by a thread and the point of a list like this is to cut it down to the cream of the crop anyway having said that given there are 100 songs on this list I cannot speak at length on every single song on this list this video would be like an hour long so like my other list videos I am going to speak the most about the songs that land closest to the top and for the sake of convenience as well as directness I'm gonna have the bottom fifty of my top 100 scroll by right now the bottom 50 in my top 100 list go and buy lots of cool stuff in this part of the movie is going from 100 to knock 51 that's the best half of the list yeah so with that being done let's get into the upper half at number 50 is king gizzard and the lizard wizard with their thrash anthem for a dying planet planet B at number 49 we have the incredible V iconic the talented Janelle Monae with the funky jazzy peppy and catchy tightrope featuring big boy 48 it is a punk anthem of cross-cultural understanding and friendship idols dan Enid elko 47 satanic metal gets its mojo back with ghost cerise number 46 it is Natalia for COD a with done Sade gardenias lovely beautiful ballad with gorgeous vocal harmonies an irresistible Latin Flair and at 45 we have the tragic and depressing soul-crushing heart-wrenching hood from perfume genius number 44 a dreamy ballad of love and affection from the duo beach house take care number 43 1539 North Calvert from JPEG mafia easily one of the boldest and most impactful rapper producers to break this decade at number 42 it is the hushed and a chilling acoustic number from Sufjan Stevens should have known better and the even more chilling and actually harrowing in terms of storytelling King Park from La Dispute sits at number 41 experimental pop absurdists 100 gex sit at number 40 with money machine and Frank Ocean goes progressive with R&B and art pop with his lengthy multi-phased and epic pyramids from channel orange with number 38 we get crushing and bold bold bold post-punk on shut up from savages and on number 37 we get a banger an anthem of big braggadocious energy and female unity formation from Beyonce the bubbling and bustling battles with ice cream lands at number 36 number 35 on our list is a wonderful expression of digital love Hannah diamond hi I really admire the way this track portrays love infatuation crushes through I guess just a digital space and medium it's very modern and at number 34 we have one of the bravest and most thorough takedowns of racist police brutality from clipping with knees on the ground number 33 one of the most insane and off-the-wall creative and bold bangers of the decade it's it's got to be tonight with a higher ground and at 32 we keep a gold chain on our neck with Brock Hampton on gold oh god yes I love it pop rap bliss bring be home bring me to heaven it's godlike number 31 we have Karen J Kalinin one of the most expressive eccentric and thought-provoking as well as provocative songwriters to hit this decade the title track bravado off of his record of the same title is a wonderful self reflection on a lot of things including one's understanding of one's self masculinity it is a wonderful synth backed anthem that is incredibly powerful gray vocals great production number 30 one of the most irresistible groovy songs of the decade with also I guess a semi woke message parquet courts wide awake though really it's it's the bassline and the drums alone that truly make the track and make it worth placing so high on this list at number 29 we have the epic and ambitious collective on the TRO pika with punk arrow Sony Darrow one of many many many tracks that makes onda tropica one of the most inventive and exciting mixes of musicians in Latin music as this track is an incredibly fun and strange psychedelic mix of punk music and a whole host of different Latin flavors next at 28 we have Danny Brown with the harrowing and eye widening disturbing ain't it funny which is actually not about anything funny at all it's quite sad and I think Danny with his rapping how manic it is how hurried and expressive it is combined with the bombastic horn backbeat which sounds like something out of a horror movie soundtrack he really brings home the fear as well as the feeling of impending doom when you are just making the loudest cry for help that you can possibly imagine on number 27 from our list Kayne West himself is on an epic power trip on the song power a song that really needs no explanation and with 26 we have one of the most compelling subtle and hypnotic micro house jams of the decade for Tet with love cry number 25 on our list here is graced by YG's FD because f dt and with 24 we have linguae egg nota with do you doubt me traitor a song that the more I listened to it the more deeply disturbed by its vocals its sound it's everything I am also disturbing in many respects is the daughter song Satan in the wait an amazing dark expansive track from their latest comeback record which you you RT must know at this point I think is amazing also amazing at number 22 is the lyrically and instrumentally inventive numbers on the boards from Pusha T only a rapper of T's caliber could even begin to approach a song and an instrumental like this and pass with flying colors on number 21 here one of my favorite bands of the decade Algiers with their unique fusion of rock and soul and punk music comes together to speak truth to power on the underside of power yonder SATA power and shout-out to the singing songwriting legend PJ Harvey at number 20 with the words that maketh murder an incredibly chilling song from her wonderful and amazing let England shake record Charli XCX and Christine and the queens at number 19 come together for a pop anthem for the ages on gone and at number 18 Tyler the Creator expands his creative repertoire with earthquake with number 17 on our list we go post pop post electronic post-industrial post everything with Sophie on the incredibly dark heavy crushing and kinky Ponyboy and at number 16 it is the throbbing throttling visceral and sort of dystopian mess on a mission from liars challenges to our gender norms as well as work culture are set at number 15 on durian Electra's career boy nah nah it's our number 14 single sounds Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti with round and round a fantastically strange and anachronistic approach to vintage pop music and disco at number 13 we have the lovely wondrous and enchanting good intentions paving company from none other than joanna newsom and number 12 marks I guess what I think is my favorite synth pop anthem of the decade LCD Soundsystem I can change on number 11 one of the smartest and in my opinion most entertaining songwriters of this decade comes through and with an amazing song gives sex workers their due on far from born-again and now we are here in the 10 spots the top 10 spots I'm so psyched here we go let's do it starting off on number 10 with rest and peace to David Bowie with the title track to his final album Blackstar not only does this track stand as one of the darkest and most surreal singles of the decade but also goes to show just how much of a rarity David Bowie was for him to be approaching these ideas and concepts at this point so late in his career is pretty amazing not to mention how chilling it was on Black Star generally for him to be facing down death so directly in the way that he did I'm number 9 I really had to sit and think about whether or not this was the track I wanted to pick because obviously I limited my tracks to one per artist in this list and I had to sit and think whether or not this track was really my favorite from this group or whether or not I wanted to have it on this list because I thought it was more representative of the time the era the decade the sound of what this past 10 years has meant to me which is why in this place I ended up putting some kind of nature from gorillas featuring none other than Lou Reed which is a super catchy creative amazingly produced and colorful dystopian take on our very grim environmental future with again some amazing vocal work from Lou Reed number 8 on our list is a song whose emotional pain really and truly needs no in depth explanation not only because of the story behind the album it's from but also it's it's really just err on the face of it once you listen of course I am talking about mount Airy's real death at number seven not only for its creative instrumental its energy but also its messaging I have placed the knife with their strangely tribal fusion of house and art pop on tooth four and I number six on our list I guess you could say is my rock song of the decade swans oxygen one of the most crushing apocalyptic and I guess I I don't know how else to explain the rage of this track outside of it feeling like a fight-or-flight reflex going off and you're just aa everything is just disintegrating like a cool anime at number five we have the hard-hitting we have the socially aware we have the colorful expressive multi-phased and very apt for the time period that we are in this is America from childish gambino a song that somehow says a whole whole whole whole whole lot without really trying to say a whole whole whole whole whole lot and with our number four spot I think father John misty gets to the heart of many of our current day societal ills as well as just issues of the human condition on the title track to his pure comedy record pure comedy a track that I love but simultaneously I have a difficult relationship with it because it's description of so many of our issues seems just so accurate it almost makes me feel like damn it's it's it's like it's like there's nothing we can really do we're just fucked however I don't truly want to feel that way and I fight that feeling every day and honestly I don't think that's the the take that mr. Tillman would want one to have from the song anyway but still powerful tune amazing tune great lyrics great everything I also feel much the same way about our number three track here Kendrick Lamar the blacker the berry a bold hard-hitting fantastic in-your-face crown jewel of a track from Kendrick Lamar's amazing to pimp a butterfly a track that really gets down to many of the key themes more broadly on to pimp a butterfly self-realization and actualization race racial hatred as well as self-hatred to the number two spot on this list is going to go to the title track from the Fleet Foxes album helplessness blues helplessness blues not only is this one of the sweetest and most memorable ballads in the Fleet Foxes discography just based on sound and melody alone but also the song is actually an amazing expression of I think a lot of the key issues of being lost not having purpose this feeling of yearning to be a part of something greater just as previous generations were allowed to that the millennial generation has just had robbed from them essentially and and younger generations coming post the millennial generation to as I think economically socially there has been quite a shift that this song in a weird way reflects on without having fully experienced the brunt of it yet in a way this track is actually quite predictive as these very real and unaddressed feelings of generational doubt fear also this need to fulfill a purpose I think are stated on this track and ended up going into or evolving into much uglier things down the road this decade in a way I guess you could say this track is a marker for a point of transition into something a very negative and grim which leads me to my number one spot which is where I place death grips with the song hacker a track that the more I think about it is maybe the most representative inventive exciting when it comes to I guess being a reflection of the digital dystopia that we currently exist in the totally off-the-wall lyrics on this track I think are inaccurate display of the pandemonium the disarray that we experience mentally and emotionally again in this digital social media internet intensive age yeah yeah it's my song of the decade and I think I will leave it at that thank you so much for watching not only this video but for all of you who have been watching me over the past ten years it's been quite an amazing ride and I'm looking forward to doing this for ten years more and I guess I'll see you in a decade list video when we get to that point as well transition that's the list you can see all the tracks in this list down in the description box so you can check them out for yourself and you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best anthony Fantino best songs of the decade forever 
S-gAv3pO8iM,hi everyone decade the knee over tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of list week where I go over essentially what made for the best and the worst music now not of the year we have done that like 10 times up until this point no I am talking about the best and worst music of the decade I've already done a video talking about my worst songs of the decade and now I'm going to do the same for albums of the decade with the 15 worst of them yeah I want to kick off this list with a bit of an honorable mention if one could have an honourable mention on such a list narrowly escaping the list you could say dodging a speeding bullet on this list is actually a none other than kid the Custer Cudi with speeding bullet to heaven while I do not care for this record yeah I still do not enjoy it and the beavis and butt-head sketches suck my soul and make me internally cringe you know I will say with this record b-plus for effort and you know in a - for the big musical artistic risk that was taken on this record while in many ways I think this record was the sort of malformed a bit of a miscalculation I think it comes from a more heartfelt and studied place than some of the other awful rock rap crossovers that have happened this decade for sure the even worse ones will be turning up on this list so let's see where they fall at number fifteen on this list I place little dickie with professional rapper this is one of the most long-winded inane annoyingly unfunny experiences I have had with music this decade what of the most difficult things to swallow with this album is that it's not really sure of what it wants to be entirely it wants to pass itself off as being clever and humorous though much of the jokes don't really land and simultaneously it's so desperate to be perceived as like deeply talented and profound and and it just it just begs to be taken seriously and yet there isn't really much about it that is worth taking seriously I mean sure you could say that little Dicky invests a lot of time and effort into some of the concepts on these tracks but the concepts that he wastes all of his time investing in are often cheap and obnoxious and I don't know kind of dumbed down production is weak vocally I think little Dicky is underwhelming as well I guess if you enjoy his jokester bars his music is kind of tolerable but because that element of his music doesn't speak to me at all I really and truly get nothing out of what he does number fourteen on this list we have imagine dragons with origins imagine dragons has grown to become one of the most hated and disrespected bands of the decade and I guess it's not hard to see why with their very toothless boring melodramatic overblown overproduced take on pop rock music while I'm not against the idea of fusing genres together and experimenting with different aesthetics and musical concepts within the popular music sphere imagine dragons does it in a way where they're bringing together elements of electronic music rock music a host of other things too and and it all in their case just cancels each other out and becomes this bland bombastic soup of nothingness it's so loud and yet it lacks any edge whatsoever it's so over-the-top emotionally and yet it feels so I guess numb and calculated and in my opinion origins is the worst musical offender in the entire imagine dragons discography not only because it suffers from a lot of the same problems is every imagine dragons record does but on top that the production on this record is awful the mixing and mastering trash songs on this thing compressed to the point where they are soulless bricks of pop rock noise and it's just not good also not very good on the list is our number 13 pick logic with supermarket you know some albums really make you sit there and reflect God what was he thinking just like this one god what was he thinking supermarket is essentially the soundtrack to the book of the same title that logic dropped pretty recently and logic previously just being understood to be a wrapper he broke out of that mold as an author but also broke into I guess some rock and pop music on this one as he fashions himself I guess I guess a rock singer a pop singer on this record riding on some instrumentals that basically sound like Red Hot Chili Peppers and Mac DeMarco yeah over which he writes some of his most embarrassing lyrics to date I feel very sorry for anyone who didn't walk away from this record with a big fat check in their pocket cuz if you've ever thought logic doesn't do what he's typically known for well just wait until you get an earful of this at number 12 on our list we have nav with bad habits what can I truly say about nav and his music at this point other than that it is really just again I've said it before I'll say it one more time devoid devoid of anything devoid of anything interesting engaging memorable funny clever witty it is as if he's trying to make every aspect of his music as underwhelming and is uninspired as possible especially on this new record over here and if that is his intent great fucking job dude at number 11 we have 93 punks and vic mensa with 93 punks vic Mensa's really awful attempt at crossing over into punk music with cringy edgy lyrics some awful songs and songwriting awful fusions of hip hop production as well as loud distorted guitars some of the preachy political messaging on this thing doesn't really go over all that well either even though I fuck with and agree with a lot of mensis politics oh very little about anything happening on this record is redeeming and I just don't think there's anything else that I can really say at number 10 is a record that in a way I quietly admire and that is broken side with will never die one reason I admire this LP is that up until this point the title has been true as broken side still are a functional musical unit another reason I admire this awful very difficult to listen to album is that it's also a bit of a cultural marker for a point in time when I guess you could say Krunk core because that was in fact a thing some of y'all younger types who don't remember the worst of the worst garbage of the 2000s the myspace era may not remember things like crunk core which is fine you kinda had to be there but I'll say that for the most part I feel like this record over here is is is really the genres swan song haha in that it is honestly one of the worst combinations of that screamed aggressive in-your-face glammy brand of metalcore that ruled the aughts fused with elements of hip hop of dance pop music and electro and yes even though all that stuff sounds horrible coming together in theory in actuality it's about three times worse than you could have ever imagined next number nine on this list is xxx 10th Ozzy owned with bad vibes forever though I will say my biggest issues with this LP don't simply lie with the music which is painfully mediocre not really all that flattering to X's memory really the worst thing about this album is how thrown together it is how X is barely present on a great deal of the tracks here and how this record is just one big attempt to exploit X's memory and pretty much that's it there has been a bit of a trend with posthumous albums from a lot of artists this decade who have died young being put out and being presented in a very exploitative manner and I would say that bad vibes forever really kind of takes the cake on that front it's the worst of the worst of the worst when it comes to examples of of that which is why it ranks so high on this list it's a pretty bad also embarrassing is our record on the number 8 spot and that is Lil Wayne with rebirth which should not have been a birth at all really should have been an abortion I don't know how anyone allowed little Wayne's who do a rock crossover record where it's nothing but shitty beats awkward distorted very loud guitars just squawking and wailing and groaning underneath I guess little Wayne Auto tuning his voice throughout many of the tracks here yeah even the most hardcore little Wayne fans have a hard time rationalizing this one when or if I have gotten any enjoyment out of it it's only really been ironically or just as you know just just kind of like just a joke goofing on it but this thing is very grating it is very ham-fisted it is clumsy it is ugly it is horrid it is basically every bad thing that can happen to an artist and an album when they get really lazy on creative they have too much of a budget and they feel like they can do no wrong I think a lot of these same attitudes carry over onto the record from our number 7 spot Miley Cyrus and her dead pets from from Miley Cyrus what a harebrained attempt sounding experimental adventurous and out there and I have no idea why the Flaming Lips were down for this but ok hopefully they got some clout out of it I guess but again with this Miley record it's just a lot of awful ideas terrible songs bad singing bad sound palates despite Miley Cyrus having the profile and the presumed budget that she has if she wants to put it into a record if she wants to put it into a project this thing should not have come out sounding as trash as it does I mean I guess I admire her for doing something off the beaten path and doing something outside of the industry I guess with putting this out for fans to listen to for free but it doesn't mean that it came out good in fact there are a lot of ideas and songs on here that are quite preposterous also so many ridiculous lyrics that you can't help but laugh at what a pussy oh I'll never forget that one I will never forget it I will also never be forgetting I think because I am emotionally scarred from it our record in the number six spot that is Eminem with revival a record that is so bad that many Eminem fans felt that he came back and killed it on kamikaze also keep in mind that Eminem only rushed kamikaze out because revival was so bad god there's so many terrible things about this record Eminem's rap style has gotten suckier and suckier and suckier over the course of this decade not only that but some of his cringy a-- stand worst bars ever turn up on this LP some of the worst production he's been on too it's like he doesn't even give a shit about how his beats sound any more features generally on this thing terrible X ambassadors Jesus Christ and some of his worst song topics too and it's just so god damn long a record that is also malformed also too long and also I guess you could say an artist at their lowest that would be our number five spot chance the rapper the big day this record should have been great not only is the disappointment of this album crushing but it's also sad to hear chance just not put that much effort into his music the songs on this thing are clearly thrown together clearly not as much preconception went into what's here versus what was on acid rap versus what was on coloring book chance picks some really questionable instrumentals too and with whatever budget he had he goes into some really weird stylistic shifts and directions away from the sounds and away from the styles of music that with chance we know work we know he sounds amazing over these cool gospel and jazz infused hip hop instrumentals that are jumpy and jaunty and really energetic but instead he cashes out and trades in all of that credibility that unique sound and style for goofy trap instrumentals bad takes on hip house just about everything this album absolutely did not need somehow ends up on this album and not just one time but like three times oh not to mention that his singing on this record is bad like chance the rapper has never been an amazing singer but his vocals have been fine on previous LPS he has held his own vocally but on the big day like all that just goes out the goddamn window yeah this thing is a mess one of the worst messes of the decade and that's that's really all you can say number four on this list is taken up with the mother of all bad ideas the fourth installment of six feet under graveyard classics number of the priests death metal band six feet under which if you know anything about death metal are like in the D tier of the genre they're just like a small tiny cut above I don't know like the worst Gore or porno grind record that you've heard uploaded by some dude from your hometown on YouTube well every once in a while six feet under likes to do a covers album oriented around a certain theme or artist and this time around it's a bunch of crappy annoying cut-rate death metal versions of Iron Maiden songs Judas Priest songs too it's not good at all like that we did not need to hear this nobody needed to hear this despite six feet under being a death metal band with serious death metal roots treats its own genre as if yeah as soon as you have like some vocals on a song as well as like some down tune guitars and some double bass and everything yeah that's that's pretty much like death metal once you've achieved those things once you've checked those boxes BAM you got death metal at number three on our list is a record that is utterly detestable hideous mean-spirited unlikable bitchy annoying it's Doug walkers the wall nostalgia critics the wall Doug Walker aka the nostalgia critic basically employs a bunch of instrumentals fashioned to be renditions of classic songs from Pink Floyd's the wall and then over these instrumentals wails and whines and complains and does his own critical musical opera about how much he doesn't like the wall as an album as a film as an artistic franchise pretty much all of his criticisms and conclusions are dumb and cheap and not all that in-depth the only thing harder to swallow than his Papa's attitude are his shitty vocals I would come on here and say it's the worst and in some respects maybe it is the worst but it's only number three on this list and things do get worser number two here is lil zan totals anarchy god this thing sucks it's trash it is suck suck mix uh curtain the mayor of suck town a lot of mean and unfair criticisms often get thrown at this new generation of rappers that like to croon on beats maybe Rock a little auto-tune like these atmospheric woozy trap instrumentals and while I mean I understand that these albums these artists these songs don't scratch the same mental and emotional itches as a Tupac or a biggie and what-have-you some of the criticisms toward this new generation of artists like I don't know lack of substance stuff like that aren't totally invalid because there are certainly examples of that and I would cite little zann's totals Anarchy as the biggest example of that because yes little zan's music does seriously lack substance does seriously lack structure melody of everything that you would expect from just any semblance of a song and while it is deficient in pretty much everything and it is a bit of a void a lot like NAB's bad habits is one might ask Anthony what makes littles Anne's totals Anarchy that much worse well I could say an ABS defense at least he tries to write some semblance of a melody or a verse oftentimes little Xan will just mind-numbing Li repeat the same lyrics over and over and over and over because I don't think he's capable of writing much more than a few lyrics at a time so the instrumentals on this thing suck the vocals are creaky and awkward and nasally and hideous and weird listening to them for long periods of time kind of makes me a little uneasy so not only is there a total lack of anything that would be appealing on a record normally on this LP but it's actually repulsive to listen to on top of it and that is what I would say about total zan Archy which leads us to our number one spot which keep in mind in my opinion this is the worst album of the decade but simultaneously this album is placed in this spot with a lot of admiration in my heart because I feel like what this album does it's it's not just the worst album of the decade but simultaneously it is it is the worst album it is bad music as an art form okay it challenges the boundaries of what bad music can be the limitations of bad music it expands your conception of bad music in my opinion this record is not just bad but it's like musics answer to Tommy Wiseau's the room of course what I'm talking about here is Corey Feldman's angelic to the core a record that is so bad it's actually impressive I'm actually still impressed with this record I am amazed with how gloriously bad this record is I guess you could even say it's it's ambitiously bad even bad for lack of effort it's not bad for just simply having a kind of weird or off idea that didn't really work it's not even bad on the front of just simply being sort of cringe II do not misplace or misunderstand my feelings and emotions as I name this record the number one worst record of the decade because honestly I feel like angelic to the core is still a musical crown jewel of the 2010s that achieves things that no other album this decade did and I think achieves things that no record for a very long time ever will and yes this has been my worst albums of the decade thank you for watching let me know down in the comments what you think the worst albums of the decade were and I will catch you guys in the next one you're the best you're the best transition have you given any of these albums a listen did you love them did you hate him what would you rate him you're

IOFf-6Jg-GM,but under the bib hi everyone beat the knee deep tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of list week but now it's a special gigantic huge edition of list week where we are going over the best and the worst music that not the year had to offer but the decade had to offer and it is with that I humbly bring to you my twenty worst singles of the 2010s starting things off at number 20 we have Allison Gould with Chinese food it's a track that um yes it's on this list that means to me it's pretty trash however I don't know how much of that trash miss you could really attribute directly to Allison because you can't really talk about Allison gold without also talking about Patrice Wilson songwriter producer music video wizard known for being one of the main brains behind Rebecca Black's Friday so the guy has a serious talent for taking the aspirations of young musicians and totally ruining any chances of them having a serious career from then on out oddly enough Allison is an artist that Patrice found himself working with and putting out music videos with after Rebecca Black so you you've seen this man's calling card is that he makes terrible music that gets the entire country to turn themselves against whoever he's making the music for or in the name of hand you maybe want to subject your kid to kind of the same ridicule sounds like a reason to call DCF but okay either way Chinese food is far worse than anything in my opinion Patrice would ever do with Rebecca it's a very dumb vaguely racist song about Americanized Chinese cuisine enjoying it the hook is a little catchy I like Chinese food yeah but outside of that from the vocals to the instrumental the lyrics and I would even extend this to the music video everything about this is misguided awkward cringy and excruciating at number 19 a track that has no catchy qualities to it whatsoever and is even more excruciating is a jr's I'm ready if you guys have been regular viewers of this channel you know I've done my best this past decade to totally avoid anything and everything that AJR was doing I couldn't help but cave toward the end of this decade but I will say at least what AJR is doing as of late is ever so marginally better than what they kicked off the decade with I'm ready is an example of that which is a terrible unholy marriage of pop dubstep and a sample of spongebob SpongeBob SquarePants literally SpongeBob SquarePants saying I'm ready hundreds and hundreds of times what few music trends har were actually able to successfully hop on top of in this track the dubstep aesthetics that I mentioned earlier for example they have aged so horribly that whatever appeal they originally had is just gone at this point even though this thing came out just earlier this decade it feels like I'm listening to something that is just light-years away in the past I I'm so happy that we're just not at this point culturally right now I mean I I know we haven't exactly progressed to a spot that's a million times better but I'm glad we're past this I'm glad this portion is is over and done with right now at number 18 is an even more annoying and gimmicky song that is the chainsmokers with selfie or excuse me hashtag selfie because everything this decade needed a goddamn hashtag yes from the instrumental on this track to the very cheap and stupid dialogue throughout it which and how could you be down with this track this track is just a stereotype of I guess some girl that likes to go to dance clubs and take selfies it's oi for attention and a desperate attempt to try to appeal to the types of people that the dialog of this track is supposed to be reflective of and I mean that's exactly the audience for it however it's like the audience for it can't come to grips with the fact that this song is actually really just an insult but maybe what's things the most on this track truly and honestly is that if this song didn't hit if this song didn't go as far as it did maybe just maybe this decade we we could have been spared the chainsmokers hmm at number 17 on this list we have the Black Eyed Peas with where's the love or hash tag where's the love are we seeing a trend here putting this one on the list it stings it does hurt because not only when you get into the Nitty Gritty of it are the intentions behind this track mostly good but also the Black Eyed Peas used to make some pretty good music back in the day used to make some pretty compelling music but tracks like where's the love are just a show of how far the group has fallen performance wise it's kind of rough and very difficult to listen to but what's worse is that the lyrics on this thing which again are well-intentioned and try to combat things like for example racism which sure racism not good but I don't know the the conclusions and rationalizations and annoying sloganeering that happens throughout this track it's like they're doing these very important issues and extreme disservice and there's nothing worse than politics and music when the messaging is severely severely severely off and speaking of politics and music at number 16 we have 303 with my dick yes 303 one of the greatest musical acts of not just this decade but of all time with an annoying novelty song with a bunch of raps about my dick that's so terrible and unfunny that makes the entire Lonely Island catalogue look like a serious work of art it's pretty much like bad YouTube parody music video gutter humor but somehow if it got like a big budget in a professional studio behind it yeah and speaking of YouTube at number 15 we have our friend fret friend of the show friend of the channel one of the greatest creative minds on the Internet of all time Jake Paul with it's every day bro it's every day bro with that Disney channel flow Jake Paul with his big breakout single showing that hey youtubers can make bad music that lands itself on the charts too it's not just the job of the music industry anymore what can truly be said about this track outside of that it's it's just a really dumb generic annoying rap song with a trap B whose only reason for existing is to stroke the ego of a total no-talent and all of the narcissists hanging around him of course the rapping on this thing totally sucks although you wouldn't necessarily notice given how far the quality bar on that has dropped in the mainstream these days ha I guess you also have the dude on the track that says England is his City even though it's a country look there are a lot of horrible things about this song that I truly just do not want to relive so don't make me don't make me one more single at number 14 I don't want to relive is vic mensa and 93 punks with 3 years sober ah what a horribly embarrassing transition into rock music for a rapper to make and not that I think the genres are all that different or that rap artists can appreciate or make rock music or vice-versa which is the big problem with this track and vic mensa on the song in general that i think he was working under the assumption that doing a song like this would be so vastly different from anything that he's done before that he could essentially use this as an opportunity to reinvent himself and put on some Punk close and yell into the microphone and say some stuff about masturbation and he would essentially rise out of that like a phoenix from the ashes but instead what is reflected here is the same mediocrity that has played everything Vince has done as of late but even worse maybe Vince wasn't in the right headspace on this one or because it's a punk album he thought he could throw a lot of caution to the wind either way if punk music wasn't that before it certainly is now all of this terrible music is really just sucking my soul away at number 13 we have Kim Kardashian with turn it up huh which is a really awful dance pop song there's there's really no other way to cut it personally I love this since this song Kim Kardashian has become this huge social media mogul because that that means that she is she's staying out of the booth the singing is so tone-deaf and it's so nasally hey take that Farrah Abraham my teenage dream ended album and strip out of it any weirdly experimental appeal that people have found in that record in retrospect and you essentially get this track it's just awful at number 12 we have another one of the most annoying songs of the decade which comes from mm the song venom which not only landed on one of his records but was also included in the soundtrack for the movie venom you know Eminem has been severely severely disappointing this decade to say the least and it's because of tracks like this where you get the worst of the worst in terms of this new rap style that he has embraced where he's just sounding angry constipated all of his words new start and stop really Chris Lee but really the crown jewel of awful in this track is the hook where you're getting these just like multitrack vocals from Eminem venom it's it is so mind blowing lis annoying I don't I don't really think it's describable at number 11 we have the rail in song God made girls which is a disgustingly regressive country song about why God made girls you know the the ethos of this track and the vibe of this track the message of this track is like totally the opposite of what socially we needed this decade totally the opposite of what you get on other country releases like the high women record that dropped not too long ago but yeah I guess if you're silly enough to believe in a higher power that when creating the planet has a super defined set of roles for what one of the sexes that they created then I guess this is your jam but if you're the kind of person who sees the depictions of gender in this song as I guess sort of tired and dated and corrosive to the happiness of people in society across the board then I don't know this song won't be playing at your next party I'll tell you that at number 10 we have who is truly a king a king when it comes to bad music this decade that is Corey Feldman with the song go for it Corey Feldman's angelic to the core was truly a moment for music this decade and go for it is one of the lead tracks off of that record and it's it's a really strange combination of pop of dubstep of rock and also Snoop Dogg snoop Dogg is on this goddamn thing Snoop Dogg will show up for a check anywhere man the obnoxious bombastic extravagant instrumental and singing on this track are just so mind-blowing ly over-the-top yeah I just appreciate and in a way even though the song is awful really admire Corey for going down in flames as gloriously as he does on this track I don't know if there was a musician or a star a celebrity that imploded artistically as amazingly as Corey does on this track and so many others from angelic to the core and that's uh honestly what makes this so powerful this this is this is if bad music we're bordering on being beautiful and that's that's really what I feel at number 9 we have Neal McCoy with taken my ass who is this man what what what is his face not to make fun of anyone's appearance or anything but this looks like a Photoshop from an episode of Tim and Eric awesome show great job like if this were some bad joke country song or album or something but when you actually listen to the track no it's it's it's it's quite real and our friend Neal McCoy is not too happy with those sports stars kneeling during the anthem because freedom isn't free and all that kind of bullshit instrumental terrible generic country instrumental vocals generic bland stupid dime-a-dozen country singing but on top of it there are really the cherry on top of this shit sunday is the terrible lyrics and reasoning the messaging of the track whole point of the track being angry at black athletes for protesting the systematic murders of people of color at the hands of police officers that's the point of the song at number 8 on our list we have a battle of the minds between two of the biggest forces in the world much less music mumble rapper versus lyricist from VIN Jay this track essentially goes over a very tedious back-and-forth between an imagined stereotype of someone who's a mumble rapper a SoundCloud rapper someone wants to rap about the money and the cars and the clothes a little bit of auto-tune and a triplet flow you know basically a chill hedonistic person who's just kind of going about their own business and may get some hits and making a lot of money in the music industry and then a very angry black tank top mmm want to be white guy who imagines himself as being like the savior of hip-hop music because he can rap really fast uh uh both sides are not all that good though my sentiments kind of lie a little bit more with the mumble rapper dude if you haven't heard this song imagine these two exact stereotypes the lyricist and the mumble rapper arguing it out in a series of YouTube comments under like a little pump video or something and just set that to a beat and you've roughly got an idea of what this track is at number 7 on our list we have the leti Gras song I am with her very sad placement on this list because leti Gras were actually a really cool music group back in the day and they essentially came out of retirement to Cape for Hillary Clinton one of the grossest and most elitist politicians of all time during her campaign for president against Donald Trump and look it's not that I like Trump or that I don't understand that he's bad for the country and the Hillary would have been marginally better but that is not the tone of the track the tone of the track is to make Hillary and the option of voting for Hillary look cooler and more radical than it actually is it's peak resistance its peak neoliberal cluelessness not only is it the lyrics on this track but also the nasally lazy lis vocals that sound like a high-pitched Charlie Brown teacher I absolutely cannot stand it instrumental is really rough around the edges too but ultimately if you wanted to do a track like this I feel like you could easily just I don't know be honest about it and just do a bit of a lesser of two evils angle like hey vote for this person because they're not going to try to initiate a war with Iran and they don't think climate change is the Chinese hoax that's honestly enough at number six though a track that mentally makes even less sense b.o.b flatlined yes b.o.b we're old famous rapper thinks the earth is flat so flat he made a goddamn song about it and of course what we also got out of this is a beef with Neil deGrasse Tyson which I guess you could say is a bit of a silver lining to this cloud but it's still a terrible song not only because the instrumental and the flows feel pretty thrown together performance is not all that great though b.o.b has never been one of the most you know talented most flashy rappers on the planet so I wasn't exactly expecting bars on this thing but you know as someone with access to the internet and access to good scientific data like everybody is who has a phone in their hand these days III at least expect you to know that the earth is round know that it's a globe shape dude instead of making this song you could have easily just chartered a plane or a ship to the edge of the earth to prove that like the edge is there but no you just you just did this terrible song at number 5 we have another song about the earth little Dicky earth although it's not really a song about the earth it's just like a really shitty Pro Earth celebrity-packed pop rap song with terrible lyrics awful vocals lots of auto-tune annoying instrumental terrible sentiment or at least it majorly fails to achieve its pro-earth sentiment it just ends up sounding like a really dickish opportunistic platformer for celebrities to act like they're doing something to save the world when they're not really have you ever seen the movie idiocracy if there was a movement within the idiocracy society to make a song that would save the planet i feel like this is the song we would get this is the track at number four we have Tom McDonald with white boy rapper internet troll Tom McDonald basically exposes us to his uh his insecurities and his victim complex on white boy where he's rapping about I guess how hard it is to be white basically the only reason this song exists is Tom I guess got exposed to the Donald Trump subreddit some sjw articles and think pieces and also some angry comments toward him for being a white rapper or a white guy with braids balled up all of that anger and misinformation and lack of perspective on the world at large and through it into this huge ugly anthem of entitlement where he's just throwing spits out there why can't everyone just worship me for who I am basically it's a very bad tasteless transparent and awful attempt at I guess being provocative as Tom didn't rile up nearly as much anger as I think he wanted to with this song and all he ended up getting was this fanbase of chad's who are just like oh man finally someone's willing to stand up for white people they've had it really tough as of late and it was time for someone to say something and now as a result of that Tom now has to play that same angle over and over and over to some degree which even his if I was black song does what a sad position to be in number 3 on our list is our Kelly with I admit where the man literally admits nothing and pretty much Liza's a saw for the entirety of the track about a bunch of shit that he actually did and is is now in jail on all the abuse all the control all the manipulation the underage shit - yeah it's a gross disgusting are Kelly completely fails to come to terms with any of it on this long-ass song you would figure over the course of this entire track he he would admit something it's basically like I don't know trapped in the closet but instead as a listener you just give our Kelly permission to Gaslight you in just manipulate your reality for a really long time number two on our list is all about the power of platforms like YouTube giving independent content creators a voice and sometimes in a weird way a short-lived awful terrible garbage music career your favorite Martian transphobic techno bitch got a penis yes your favorite Martian which was at one point a musical project spearheaded by none other than ray william johnson they came out with a lot of really trash songs in in the short amount of time that the project was active one being Dookie fresh ray was also a main brain behind that doing your mom's song as well but transphobic techno out of all of the your favorite Martian tracks is maybe the one that has aged the worst although it wasn't even really looking all that good to begin with as it's literally like not even a techno beat but just like a really shitty EDM beat and it's just like a repeatedly shouting bitch grow a penis and I mean maybe there's a lick of irony or it's kind of tongue-in-cheek but if that is the case it doesn't really resonate doesn't really come off it's just mind-blowing least stupid and awful in every way imaginable and yuck there aren't words to communicate my level of disgust which is why I guess I will move on to my number one spot which is also disgusting and also beyond words in some respects and that is Hobson with the track happy ending which if you remember back to the time when I gave this my worst song of the year how I described it was that it's a rap song about rapper Hopson going to an Asian massage parlor and getting a happy ending and he goes into disgusting stomach-churning detail over the entire thing to the point where it's it's not sexy it's not attractive it's not alluring in fact the tone of the song is that of like a really bad comedy sketch and the entire point and purpose of the comedy sketch is to feed into this terrible awful just absolutely cannot compute a racial stereotype actually that's not taking it far enough the song is just straight-up racist racist tasteless annoying not funny didn't laugh you're going to lose subscriber not appealing in any way whatsoever instrumental sucks too as it's just a really annoying and hokey fusion of of like a hip-hop II and the this this vague generic idea of what suffice is for Asian music yeah it's it's it's quite gross double yikes double yikes and I think I'm going to leave it at that those are my 20 worst songs of the decade and and god that was hard that was hard going oh they're all fucking terrible transition have you given any of these songs a listen god I hope not just stay away just stay away over here

rNaT3KazKoE,ah hi everyone retha nirav utano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a Redux review of the Kanye West album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy the critically acclaimed 2010 album from one of hip-hop's most polarizing figures ever Kanye West I am now reviewing it for a second time for a few reasons one my original review is easily my most infamous review to covering it again has been a consistent request among my viewers especially since I did a Redux review of the life of Pablo because the mix and the tracklist of the record had changed since my original review of it which I thought vastly improved the album there have been no such changes to this record though 3 this YouTube channel recently hit 2 million subscribers and in a weird way I thought this would be a fun way to celebrate that and finally it's now been about 10 years since this LP originally came out over that span of time I've come to hold quite a bit of respect for the place this album holds in Kanye's discography a creative bounce back from one of the most tumultuous periods in his life a major second wind to his career and a gateway to the more manic and unpredictable side of his discography it's for all these reasons that my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is worth revisiting now and maybe even 10 years further down the road too I guess we'll see so Kanye West hails from the city of Chicago but this record is not about his humble beginnings as a soul chopping hometown hero or a jay-z protege instead My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is an extravagant depiction of the high profile high drama celebrity lifestyle kanye envisioned himself transitioning into after the loss of his mother after the Taylor Swift interruption at the VMAs after advancing to become one of hip-hop's most in-demand artists and the concept of this album is spelled out in the in the album's opening lyrics it's not a bland reality it's a dark twisted fantasy one Kanye has been dreaming of since his days in Chicago one that is as imaginary as Nicki Minaj's fake storybook British accent on the intro but of course there are elements of the album that dwell on the wealth and excess of Kanye's current day and the way his ego in persona as well as love life ties into that but still My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is more like a glimpse into a future that kind of came into fruition for Kanye with him since marrying into the Kardashian clan allowing his celebrity profile to grow larger in scope than his profile as a musician from what a bit we're exposed to in the media Kanye's current day is definitely dark and arguably beautiful as well but the fantasy he imagined here on this record pales in comparison to the life we have seen as the audience play out in the headlines of the past several years of the lyrics of yeh or the life of Pablo I was sort of bored by its portrayal in my original review and it seems like even less of a big deal now that yays life has wound up in a place even his wildest imagination here only began to scratch the surface of but I guess this record isn't just about the narrative or the concept of Fame behind it it's also about the features the rapping the instrumentals it's the total package or at least that's the reputation this album has grown to have and of course I was interested to see how those elements aged to my ears over the past decade or so still to this day I would say that dark fantasy ranks as one of the best openers to any hip-hop record this decade with its grand and glamorous and stunning piano chords with its flawlessly arranged chorus of vocals from Justin Vernon and tiana Taylor it's an odd but angelic sound can I get much hiya is just like a beautiful moment on the record that I think also expresses the theme and the idea of the concept here in that we've reached another heschel on a new height of popularity of fame of bliss of you of extravagance the beat on this track once it drops is absolutely mad the jangly chimes the steady kicks and snares the dusty wheezing to no interval melody that sounds like I don't know one hold mellotron or something the way the instrumental thickens up on the second verse though the bridge which is quite ominous too is great it's one decadent epic passage after another and some of my favorite Kanye bars end up on this track too from the classic aside of you ain't got a fucking easy is her motto too more revealing lines that I think get to the heart of Kanye's personality like me found bravery in my bravado there's also excellent strings here like the plan was to drink until the pain over but what's worse the pain or the hangover fresh air rolling down the window too many Errol's on your team that's why you're Winslow I love that the first time I heard it I still love it now however like any great yay track there is going to be a stinker or two and I think he does meet that quota Sleepy Hollow which is known for being the the home of the Headless Horseman no head maybe one could interpret this as Kanye saying something about having lost his mind but Kanye oral sex bars tend to not work in that many layers anyway whatever few lyrical duds there are on this track though it's easily made up for by how amazing the instrumental is by the cold and confident flow that Kanye delivers all of this with he sounds like he's in a place where he doesn't have to do too much to prove himself the following gorgeous though is a track that to this day I'm still kind of torn on without a doubt it is a special point on the record thanks mostly to its hefty helping a vocal distortion and Kid Cudi's ghostly haunting chorus on the cut and part of me likes how stark and minimal and bare the entire track is but the faint instrumental over the song's six minute runtime just does not do enough for me the drums the guitar the very quiet chords in the background it's all just a little too faint it doesn't make for that strong of a sonic foundation however Kanye does drop three monstrous verses load with quotables and food-for-thought where he's boldly touching down on things like paranoia and racial discrimination the first section of the first verse on this thing is easily one of the most impressive displays of lyricism across Kanye's entire discography Penitentiary chances the devil dances obviously a commentary on the likelihood and statistics that people of color face in terms of landing in prison and eventually answer to the call of autumn things being in decline linking in to that by saying all of them fallen autumn fall for the love of ballin that fast money making quick in illegal lifestyle driving people into a position where they have 30 rocks in their pocket and the cop arresting them looks like Alec Baldwin basically displaying that racial divide there between those being arrested in and those initiating the drug war so not only is all of this deeply poetic and clever but it feels so weird listening back to this because current day Kanye seems so far removed from making any of these kinds of Greater connections between oppression inequity racial disparities and the justice system it was even kind of funny going back listening to his initial lyrics on so appalled where he says I'm so appalled Spalding ball balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all not only making fun of Donald Trump's stupid hairstyle but acknowledging that the male man's a fucking scammer people will often say hey what happened to the Kanye that said George Bush doesn't care about black people when honestly this is the Kanye I want to know where he is where is this Kanye right now because this is easily one of the most damning commentaries on the black community and the American government's treatment of it on almost any modern rap record lyrically the rest of gorgeous just gets better from here in my opinion although it kind of starts to wear out its welcome once we get to the Raekwon feature even though there is a bit of an instrumental change-up at this point in the track lyrically I don't think Raekwon does enough even though he is I mean a goddamn legend to reinforce all the lyrical themes that Kanye has been working with up until this point in the song at the time when I first reviewed it power was maybe my favorite track from the record one of the best songs of 2010 and I still pretty much feel that way now in fact I think there were a lot of ideas here that have only gotten better with age the iconic vocal chance at the start the amazing King Crimson sample the chunky chunky chunky boom bap drums the whole thing sounds larger than life and yeas lyrics ingeniously depict him on a power trip of sorts he sounds like a power-hungry madman on this track I also love some of the predictive bars on this track to where he is rapping about grown-up thoughts entreating on his childlike honesty and wanting to have a custody battle to fight for that are the SNL bars on this track kind of petty sure and do I wish the words : Powell's Austin Powers never came out of his mouth yes no matter how generously you try to interpret that still I'll take it with a side of cello thank you so one of my favorites on the album here contrasts in the tracklist with one of my least favorites and that is all of the lights more than ever I think the track sounds like a tone-deaf comedy of errors for one the mastering on this song is awful it sounds compressed to death why are the drums this blown out I like the little horn line on this track that's great and I love Rihanna's a slick hook on the song too but it's not enough to make up for Kanye's preposterous performance and lyrics on this track from Slaven Lee singing to the terrible word-association in the pre-chorus cop lights flash lights street lights Bud Light and I can't help but feel as if the lyrics and the verses here trivialize the domestic abuse scandals that we often see come from celebrity circles and are highly publicized in the media the lyrics are less about the abuse and more about bad things happening to the protagonist the protagonist being inconvenienced or made to go through some sort of struggle as a result of their very bad decisions which to me sounds ok bad things should happen to domestic abusers however that is not the tone of the track being generous we could say the true meaning of this song is that having your life in the limelight often exposes your lowest points your most embarrassing points your worst decisions to the widest amount of people but there's maybe four five six seven dozen different ways that one could portray that idea without minimizing the suffering and the experiences of abuse victims so even though I appreciate maybe there's a lot going on in this song conceptually and instrumentally to my ears it's a horrid mess and a little bit misguided - we then get the star-studded monster a track that is known for its long run of features from rick ross to jay-z to nicki minaj to bony bear and there are a lot of things I like about it I like it's freakish attitude I like it's dark energy I like its sinister vocal intro the war drums and the beat also some of the wilder asides from Kanye in his verse yeah but the pussy in esophagus AHA but the put the pussy in the in the sarcophagus okay just do it the hook is super slick and the point of this track isn't too far off from what Kanye was also trying to communicate on power how his life his ego his persona his fame has transformed him into something bigger but also kind of maniacal something beyond just his simple human form but listening to it more times more years down the road what's not sitting too well with me are the features I do like how Rick Ross's husky voice sounds on the beat here it's a good intro but vocally I think Jay kind of undershoots it his lyricism is on point though I love the bar where he says he sees dudes he's made millionaires milling about spilling their feelings in the air that was a really smart point but Nicki by comparison I think vastly overshoots it with all the inflection switch ups and the baby voice and their hearts it's God it's too much and sadly she doesn't have the lyricism to make up for just overdoing it in that tanka the color of Willy Wonka no so appalled was a track originally when I reviewed this record was a frontrunner for me one of the best but I don't so much feel that way these days the odd and lengthy Swizz Beatz refrain on this track is still an earworm for me life can be sometimes ridiculous I still love the tracks fuzzy apocalyptic instrumentation it is sinister as hell but Konya is putting JZ features on here like they're going out of style and the track really could have ended right before the SCI - it really could have finished there not only because it's the weakest verse on the song ha I'm so outrageous I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet if God had an iPod I'd be on his playlist my phrases amazes the faces in places everything past 4:40 on this track just feels like an unnecessary extension even the Risso appearance I'm sad to say as much as I love RZA as much as I love wu-tang it just doesn't add that much to the track I mean if you really wanted it to be here then I don't know swap out one of the Swizz portions and then just tighten the track up and it's so much better and push a tee even though I like his feature on this track it sort of illustrates a general lack of thematic cohesion between every single verse on the song sadly I will say that devil in a new dress still sounds great after all these years though not just because of the clever lyricism of these smart rhyme patterns but also the track feels like a very cool update on classic Kanye with its chopped up soul samples with its sparse drums with its gleaming strings on this track Kanye feels less like he's rapping and more like he's preaching or passionately ranting at some points and just going on and on and on about temptation and lust and desire I love the buzzing Mike Dean guitar solo on this track - I don't think over the years he's gotten quite enough credit for being the musical technician he is for some of the greatest moments on this record the rick ross feature at the very end while not mind-blowing is an appropriate placement considering the lyrical themes here in the large glamorous instrumentation we then get run away which many people consider to be Kanye's best song the centerpiece of this album and I certainly get why the instrumental for one is great that depressing minimal piano line the vaguely industrial and frigid drums and atmosphere which all contrasts very well with the light and airy and elegant strings and since placed throughout the track the push Atty feature is a nice touch too but there is so much about this track that I still do not care for for sure I like the idea behind the song tragically finding yourself in a place where you can't love you're a broken person and you're telling this person who you care for to run away run away from you because you are busted you can't you can't keep a relationship together it is very much a toast to the douchebags it is heart-wrenching in that respect there are also some moments on this track where Kanye vocally is pretty decent like on the hook or that little passage just before the push of t feature but generally the lyrics and the singing on this track come on chief epic Jers in my email I sent this bitch a picture I'm a dick it's embarrassing that he did it it's embarrassing that he wrote it it's embarrassing the way he sang it I'm embarrassed that I'm talking about it the verses on this thing are not cute they're not endearing they're not relatable I would say they're kind of cringe also the thin horrid distorted vocal solo that is manipulated auto-tune VOC coded I'm not sure at the very end of this thing really wears out its welcome very fast it does not need to be that long it is not interesting for even half the time that it goes if it was a guitar that was generating this sound I would just say it sounds awful but because it's a voice I'm supposed to Wow Wow freaked out hell of a life was one of my least favorite Kanye tracks ever when this thing came out and that is still true to this day not only is the Black Sabbath Ironman interpolation on this track terrible but it sounds absolutely silly over these goofy Casio demo drums and farty ass bass lines between this and the super speedy arpeggios that pop up in the beat here and there the instrumentals a mess what's worse is Kanye's probably very real sex addiction legitimizes anything he thinks or could say about sex on the song so he doesn't really edit himself when he thinks about writing about nuns coming which I guess is cool if you're like an edgy death metal band or something but and look I'm not a prude when it comes to sex in music but for a track about sex and one's need for it it's it's not a sexy song nor is it all that extreme either like cross the line the craziest shit you say in this track is anal and gangbangs and that's it that's pretty vanilla your wild sex fantasy is just basically every college-age straight dudes porn search history so Kanye's twisted fantasy then tumbles even further down the rabbit hole of sex and love on the track blame game where John Legend's boyish voice as angelic as it is does sound a little silly saying stuff like oh how you bitch for sure you coming mother fuck the dog I do love the gently marching snares on this track though these string melodies as well as the super sad piano passage lifted from an FX twin track but the cherry on top are Kanye's vocals his rhymes which depict manically these different pitched and distorted and panned vocals that are arguing their way through this whole situation the scenario where a love is on the rocks it's deteriorating it's pretty tragic in the way that it plays out and the way that Kanye portrays it is very creative now stopping here this is a song I could say that I love despite the handful of little elements that I think about it are just okay but that's only something I could say if not for the Chris Rock sketch at the end of this track it is obnoxious it beats the joke to death and look there are some lines of it that I think are funny despite the woman on the other end of the line sounding like some kind of weird obedient sex robot but ultimately the issue with the skit is that the tone of it totally up ends the sad and dreary vibe of the song to come before it plus it's a very odd transition into the records very ornate auto-tuned finale lost in the world I've always disliked the way the vocals are arranged on this track I would say the vocal layering on this track is almost like the complete opposite to how grand and amazing the vocal is on dark fantasy with Justin Vernon and Teyana Taylor then there's the super cheap and silly ridiculous verse that Kanye lays into this track that just has all these just very nonsensical opposites going on you know my lie you know my truth Yamaha you're my cold for is big and is loud and as harmonious as it's trying to be it just feels like a whole lot about nothing and the very end of the record gets even more confusing as Kanye delivers this edited version of Gil scott-heron 'z comment number one piece so we have one of the most radical voices in music ever talking some of his most radical shit ever but it doesn't really link into much of anything the album has been about up until this point I mean maybe some of the verses on gorgeous but like that's it some have tried to say that this piece and Kanye's inclusion of it is like a commentary on where his life is going from here and the outlook is grim but for me that very much feels like a stretch so honestly throwing this poetry piece into the end of the record in my opinion sounds like trying to for something super meaningful into the finish of this album to give the audience the sense that they've heard something that's way more substantive than it actually is so nearly 10 years after my review and the release of this album and I still think that it starts strong it finishes super weak the concept at best is spotty and that is partially made up for with solid features extravagant amazing high-quality instrumentals but overall in my opinion to put this album in a word overrated I am feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you

e-Q9e1DjO5U,yeah hi everyone crossing the i-10 oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the clips album hell hath no fury did I mention this is a classic review it's a classic review Virginia hip hop duo Clipse originally a brotherly two-piece that dates back to the early 90s founded by rappers malice now known as no malice as well as Pusha T and part of my reasoning behind doing this review isn't just that it's a great album of course it is but also despite everyone involved in clips and their success having such a large profile in the music industry today much larger than they did when the duo initially started I still feel like clips goes under the radar for a lot of young rap fans for some reason I get that the bling era isn't the most celebrated in the 40 years of hip-hop's history but clips are one of the most groundbreaking and enigmatic duo's to ever grace the genre and I'm hoping that with records like this turning 20 years old soon that we can have a bit of a reassessment and realize that look there are legitimate reasons as to why clips are not as popular as I think they should be for one their catalog would be a lot more impressive if not for every force in the universe trying to prevent clips from happening as monstrously talented as Pusha was as malice was as williams was as an up-and-coming producer one half of The Neptunes around the time that he met clips he went to bat for them they got a deal on Elektra Records and the only thing that ended up happening is that the album was shelved and they were dropped from the label it wouldn't be until the early 2000s that the duo would be supported by Williams through his star track imprint then they quickly grinded out a proper debut album with Lord willin in 2002 even though the album is a little rough around the edges on the best tracks everything that would make Clips a special group was here in spades the slick flows the cold blooded attitude the coke talk and terminology the artful and funny word planned Andras as well as Williams one-of-a-kind production all of these zany scent heavy instrumentals with booming beats sounding like I don't know something off of a club dancefloor set on a futuristic spaceship on the other side of the galaxy or maybe also sounding something like a hip-hop pep rally there was no need for Pusha T or malice to rap ultra aggressively or fast or technically because the wordplay the rhyme patterns the raw ass hooks on this record were so good I also want to note their voices on this record as well as hell hath no fury were eerily similar however that was not to their detriment their chemistry basically amounted to coming on tracks and reinforcing one another's unique rap style that they essentially forged being tightly knit collaborators it was something that was easy to digest given that malice was the only rapper that sounded or wrapped like push a tee and vice versa now on Lord willin Clips hit it pretty big pretty fast even though the duo didn't cross over into the mainstream as hard as like an outcast or a fifty-cent did around the same time grinding was still a huge huge huge single for them topped off at 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 the album charted decently and liked industrious dope Boyz malice and push a tease started to scale up dropping features with the likes of efore T and Nelly even m.i.a and also putting out volumes 1 & 2 of their legendary we got it for cheap mixtape series which a word of advice download vol 2 wherever you can on the internet because it's one of the best tapes of the aughts later in the decade push and malice would also collectivize under the re-up gang banner with Philly rapper Sandman and AB live--i and they would go on to drop a couple of tapes and an album too but of course that would be after the duo would refine their sound on hell hath no fury in 2006 but before I get into my thoughts on this record let me say that this story the story of clips does not necessarily have a super happy ending as malice and Pusha T would end up being victims of their own success as well as their proximity to the lifestyle that they rapped about so flagrantly which was marked by the rest of the duo's manager Anthony Gonzalez at the end of the decade he was sentenced to 32 years in prison for drug trafficking and was said to have been leading a 10 million-dollar ring and in an interview with Vlad TV around the time that he dropped my name is my name Pusha T says that it ran even deeper than that with nine of his friends being round up for conspiracy charges no malice also confirmed many of these same details too in a separate interview with HipHopDX these arrests and the investigations that came along with them weren't the only pressures on clips 'as stability as a duo but it's been said they were essentially the brick that broke the coke mules back the duo's final LP came out in 2009 until the casket drops only months after all these arrests happened and the whole situation went public and even though till the casket drops did chart pretty well and it features some kind of cool crossovers with Cam Ranh and Kanye West you can also hear Pusha T drifting into on a few tracks that more pronounced expressive yeah just digging into the back of his throat type of delivery that he's more known for in a solo capacity today but still that doesn't change that most of this LP is not all that good while the first leg is definitely in the same vein of much of what the duo was doing on Lord willin and hell hath no fury never will it stop with AB live--i just kind of feels like a real left over all eyes on me is like an unrepentant piece of club trash and during the moments where Pharrell is doing production like on life change as well as champion the kookier and more minimal qualities of his production just aren't as pronounced over the long span of time since Pharrell linked up with clips in the early 90s of course his production style is going to change but I can't say it was changing all that much for the better on this album as much as some of the beats here like I'm good we're super super predictive of what Tyler the Creator would be doing during the wolf and flower boy eras of his career you know I often wonder what hip-hop would look like if we had 10 more uninterrupted years of Clips but sadly we don't live in that world all we can really do look back on the duo singular masterpiece hell hath no fury and think of what could have been now hell hath no fury came out a handful of years after Lord willin and is essentially the result of taking the best of the best ideas that came off that came off we got it for cheap volumes 1 & 2 honing those ideas and just delivering one banger after another for an entire record and there's no BS or filler anywhere on this record even the tone setting intro goes hard we got it for cheap it's the re up anthem featuring none other than mr. Lee with his thick ass Dominican accent seasoning some spicy hand drums bumping kicks and some tangy little synth chords it's got a great energy a great groove in between these funny rambling diatribes from mr. Lee malice and Pusha essentially are evangelizing with their cocaine poetry and even though much of what the duo says is intended to be slick intended to be braggadocious there's still a lot of tragedy and a lot of struggle behind everything they say too even some religious scripture in retrospect it's not all that surprising that turning away from clips malice would take a godly er path because on numerous tracks here he works in either again Christian scripture or mythology occasionally Pusha does - like on the King Solomon reference from mama I'm so sorry which again even though the sound and the attitude of this track - outwardly is very slick and very confident what's more interesting on this track are the deeper messages at work of greed hedonism and the way this lifestyle has turned malice and push a tee into something obnoxious something toxic to their loved ones their baby mama their mother their grandmother if what you want though is unadulterated materialism then go no further than mr. me - the dark bassy beat The Neptunes deliver on this one is insane and still sounds incredibly unique to this day Ferrell features on the track - and adds quite well to these songs themes of excess and materialism but even though push and malice and Pharrell are all rapping things they have trips they're going on celebs they're seeing the hook adds a clever twist to this mixture because wealth is often perceived as a competition in hip-hop music of course the predicted response to much of what push and Alice are saying here is oh yeah me too I have that too I do that too so this track essentially tries to cut that off at the pass saying oh hey meet mister me to the person who's going to insecurely compare themselves to us just because of what we say as the songs and the tracklist here get more left-field they somehow get even catchy or WAMP WAMP what it do has an absolutely absurd earworm quality to the hook that i just can't deny also the damn beat on this thing that sounds like it's been cobbled together from like I don't know a high school drumline and these very bright pronounced metallic tones that sound like these hard hard hits from a steel drum obviously not a live steel drum if that's what it is it's obviously synthesized or sampled in some way either way it rings very loudly and makes for an odd but likeable combo with the drums also the bold and husky Slim Thug features on this track add a lot of grit to the song too even stranger are the plucky dissonant string runs that play throughout right around shinin that somehow work against the shifty beat that Pharrell pulled together that syncs up with these very strained vocal hits push malice drop one quotable after another one of my favorites being the black martha stewart let me show you how to do it break down pies to pieces make cocaine quiches money piles high as my nieces from here we get the song dirty money which I'm kind of blown away this was not a major lead single to this record the beat the attitude the hook on the song the theme of the track is it's just screams like popular club music the whole thing is just about going out and frivolously spending drug money also despite the hook being so quiet and kind of monotone it just sticks with me instantly which again was one of the geniusly weird appeals of clips music that they just weren't trying to do too much to impress you it's one of the weird moments in rap music that les was just more instrumentally there wasn't a whole lot to the track outs of the very heavy drums and somewhat low fie awkward clumsy synth leads that Pharrell couldn't be bothered to clean up or play more tightly despite them falling over themselves a little bit the song grooved hardest fuck I'd say the singular take away from hello new world despite another amazing instrumental is unity as malice and push clearly seek to create some kind of cohesion or agreement with young warring drug dealers saying they should collective eyes instead of killing each other which I'd argue malice does perfectly on this verse right here which is maybe one of the best verses on the entire record Keys open doors another amazingly hooky track with a unique jangly beat that basically I don't know sounds like what I would imagine it would be like if you took some huge Keys and I don't know bang them on something also considering the ghostly chorus harmonies hanging in the background of this beat - I just imagine these keys being shiny golden that you could open up the gates of heaven with them but still the theme of the track is just about drug dealing as an avenue of success as Pusha T and malice talk about all the great things that have come to them since that kind of got the ball rolling for them into the music industry the cars are big the cribs are bigger the kids are happy the perfect picture gem star razor the fruit of my labor and I walk with a glow it's like the Lords shown favor by comparison inches more the soundtrack to grinding on the lower end of the totem pole trying to get a chain save up for this slinging out in the rain the track also features a wild expressive feature from Sandman where he sounds kind of a 40-ish we get more heavy hitters with Chinese New Year as well as trail on the back end of this record but I love the more emotional change of pace with the closing song here nightmares which is a very dreary and soulful finish for the record where Pusha and malice essentially detail some of the raw dark feelings of paranoia and guilt they feel leading or at least rapping about the lifestyles they do the guilt and paranoia that hangs in your head when all the noise of the money the parties the drinks that everything kind of quiets down which seemed to work as a white noise machine just blasting away at the highest volume so you don't hear the quiet anxieties that are just kind of eating away at you in the background at least until it's too late which in the case of clips may have in fact been the case which is why we no longer have clips so in conclusion I guess there are a lot of great takeaways from this record on multiple levels not only lyrical talent incredibly unique and fun instrumentals messages of unity messages of going out there and doing it for yourself tomorrow's not promised but also a warning to not let a fast lifestyle catch you up in a way where you're not paying attention to what could be going on around you what could be hurting those you love those who are close to you because everything that you've built up for years and years and years could be quickly knocked down and disappear great album classic album amazing album fantastic in so many ways take from it what you will listen to it enjoy it appreciate it and I will see you guys in the next video transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the Bellas well over here next to my head is another video that you should check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel you have to be Fantana clips forever 
TIVqhJuE1sY,hi everyone 7th inning out of 10 tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the classic cuz it's a classic review of My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade this is the seminal 2006 album from Newark New Jersey band My Chemical Romance the mid-2000s they were an interesting time for music to say the least I lived it I was there and maybe this is a side of me getting old but I I can't help but feel like things were just simpler back then things just made more sense on the internet when all you had to worry about was your myspace top eight but simultaneously it is not a time that I would want to go back to George Bush president internet porn takes forever to download and you can't listen to Death Grips yet no thank you and while genres like pop punk and emo were certainly at their peak of popularity I personally at the time didn't feel like they were at their peak of creativity don't get me wrong at the time MCR was an amazing breath of fresh air when the exhilarating three cheers for Sweet Revenge came out it was like a bomb going off okay but for every MC our we had there were like 10 more bands trying to be the next simple plan or Taking Back Sunday and back then it's not like there weren't tons of new or contemporary bands that I liked white stripes strokes bright eyes against me blood brothers death from above 1979 Modest Mouse most of the rock I listen to that was an old-school Punk was oriented around Indy post hardcore metalcore and even though I grew up loving the power pop and pop punk of the 90s the more commercially successful records in these genres in the 2000s were just a turn-off for me they sounded melodramatic overblown formulaic not nearly as fun catchy or chock full of personality as enema of the state or Dookie so by the time three cheers came out in four this was a trend I was already absolutely sick of which is why I was surprised when I came across three chairs working at my college radio station and thought it was kind of good despite typically disliked anything at the time that had an album cover that looked anything like this but seriously here's a record that could go blow-for-blow with any other pop punk or emo album out at the time in terms of volume vocal dramatics and yet the singing is actually great the songs are addictive in the vibe is genuinely dark and kind of edgy I'm down or at least I was in a somewhat quiet way because you know as a self-conscious twenty-something who thought he was into more artsy meaningful music and still had things like guilty pleasures I didn't spend nearly enough time openly praising this record as I should have and over the years three cheers has in my opinion aged amazingly even though the black parade is perceived to be the bigger and more ambitious record in many respects three cheers is just as good but for a band of MC ours obvious talent staying simply within the confines of pop punk or emo was going to be an impossibility their ambitions on their next record would drive them to a higher calling writing and Co producing an album that would be a contribution to the hallowed halls of rock opera well-respected but rarely attempted rock operas can be pretty tricky and risky and there are some ways in which the black parade famously doesn't live up to the grand expectations of the genre there are cuts where the instrumentation just isn't lavish or epic enough the narrative and general message of the LP is not really all that linear or clear some of the time though there are certainly consistent themes of death illness cancer bravely facing down or accepting the end of your life so even though there are great tracks here that reinforce those ideas there are others that detour into something only tangentially related whether that be living recklessly or having an irrational fear of teenagers so while the BlackBerry may not be as focused narrative Lee as a the wall or Bat Out of Hell or Tommy the Black Parade is still pretty grand in presentation theatrical as well especially given the Cabaret influence dictating the sound of cuts like mama or the bonus track blood so the black parades embrace of opera might mostly just be for esthetic purposes but no harm no foul because it just adds to the entertainment value of the album as does the band's embrace of glam rock or hard rock on some tracks here too if anything should be celebrated on this album it's how the band creatively crosses over between the melodrama of emo and the melodrama of so many strains of rock to come before it that and how punchy and infectious much of this record is the whole thing kicks off with the campy but gratifying the end the Bowie influence on this track is heavy as hell the pronounced acoustic guitar strumming along with the singing that sounds like something out of a theatre production then an explosion of soaring guitar harmonies touches of piano to a gargantuan passage where we get all of these huge deeply layered vocal harmonies which are really one of the biggest selling points of the record we get a flawless transition into the track dead which is aided by a flatline of an EKG punchy crunchy jaunty guitar chords it's a really fun and lively track the band is just really yucking it up on this song with these squawking guitar soloing some of these shredding - it's a stark contrast from the incredibly grim lyrics where our very ill patient character is being told they have two weeks left to live which again bold juxtaposition going on here between the lyrics and the music but emo and punk have a long history of turning negatives into energetic and rowdy music following the same storyline the vibe turns absolutely sinister on the track how I disappear where the lyrics not only equate death with the erasure of someone's memory their personhood but also we have the idea being toyed with of talking to someone that you love in a seance from beyond the grave trying to make a romantic connection while there I guess a ghost a specter it's a great song but once again it's the pumping pop punk guitars and the soaring vocal harmonies that really sell it the dark goth Punk edge of this record only intensifies on the sharpest lives but it's welcome to The Black Parade that's really the crown jewel of the first leg of the record the iconic descending lonely piano line that kicks the song off with Gerard Way singing theatrically about the recollection of a childhood memory seeing a marching band the Black Parade which is obviously metaphorical for some kind of transition into death when I was a young boy my father the hook on this track seems to be antithetical to some of the messaging on how I disappear though because this track is very much about someone's memory lasting and living on after death keep in mind at the point we're hearing this the guitars the instrumentation have gone completely pop-punk and the way we transition out of this into more queen inspired guitar soloing marching drums vocal harmonies it's it's pure fireworks we then get to heart-wrenching slow-jam I don't love you a tragic tension release considering all of the lavish and throttling pop punk tunes that brought us to this point the variety and the tracklist here continues on to house of wolves that feature some grimy distorted walking bass as well as some tom heavy drums that both sound like something out of like a jazz song these passages transition tightly into these synced up guitar chords and drums but that pretty much sound like something out of the KISS playbook at this point everything MCR is doing is just an impressive juggling act with all the ideas they're working into this very menacing and grim brand of pop punk then with the track cancer we get a quality piano ballad with some rich vocal harmonies and strings that feel like some Beatles baroque pop worship on the back end the biggest impact on this track though go to the lyrics which are unapologetic as well as brutal talking about how our protagonist is never going to marry how they are counting down their days they're soggy from the chemo we then transitions suddenly into something a bit zanier on the track mama with its Oompa drum beats and Eastern Bloc melodies what the band is doing on this track doesn't sound too much unlike the gypsy punk sounds that groups such as Gogol Bordello would popularize just a year earlier not to mention there's no one group singularly that brought these cabaret and folksy sounds into the genre anyway I mean look at early Dresden Dolls or flogging.molly I will say though with this track MCR easily has one of the more entertaining takes on this fusion especially considering they went all out with a general liza minnelli feature that still sounds to this day absolutely insane the band kind of eases up on the speed with the track sleep to create a thunderous interpretation of alternative rock the overabundance of bass and reverb and and searing screams on this track leaves our protagonist feeling like they're slipping down into an impenetrable dark abyss and considering some of the tracks final refrains of just sleep just sleep just sleep that's pretty much the case the song teenagers is a somewhat funny detour in the tracklist that I alluded to earlier in the review it doesn't seem to reinforce much of anything else narrative lis on the album but still I would say the song was absolutely necessary for the time considering the band's very young fanbase the track lyrically addresses an overabundance of fear and worry societally about teenagers at large kind of mocking the attitude with these over exaggerated rock-and-roll riffs and shouty sing-along choruses it sort of puts the idea of trying to control the next generations feelings and thoughts to get them to comply with everything previous generations want into perspective as prior to this we worried about hippies and hippie culture ruining teenagers as well as heavy-metal and gangster rap and emo and now social media and all this other shit at this point we're nearing the end of the album we get another very narrative heavy power ballad with disenchanted it's easily one of the most crushing moments on the album with our protagonist pretty much coming to the conclusion that their death is meaningless and the life they led up until this point doesn't really mean much either I would say there's a lot of snark on the chorus talking about how it's it's just a sad song that we're listening to with nothing to say it's hard to tell if the track is a commentary on the character and their feelings about death or the act of writing a sad song about something in general but what is clear in the verses is that our main character again is not all that impressed with their existence up until this point I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree so I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV bring out the old guillotine will show them what we all mean I guess when writing and sequencing the album the band didn't necessarily want to end things off on such a dreary and maybe nihilistic note with the quickness the narrative of this record changes up with the last full song famous last words which is a righteous rock song about pushing forward overcoming persevering I mean it feels great it's a great attitude it's well written it's well produced but I have to say the lyrics aren't nearly as specific as they are on the dreary er cuts here maybe that has to do with I don't know the attitude of not wanting to dwell on the negative but I think the sudden emotional shift that we see at this point on the album can be pretty representative of when you're dealing with things like depression or anxiety all some people can truly do is do their best to survive their emotional highs and lows their demons and even though much of this album is portrayed as being about a patient with a terminal illness it's also really just about that so overall Black Parade great album classic album the performance songwriting production style narrative even if it is choppy are all really great despite what flaws it has this thing still manages to sit around the peak of modern pop punk I highly recommend it I encourage anyone who loves it to go back and love it again anyone who hasn't heard this record before I give it a try with everything I have said in mind that is it transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you radiate you're the best

UAOZoA_9pQE,hey everyone my damn shoulder here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review a classic review of the converge album Jane Doe this is the seminal 2001 record from Massachusetts metal and mathcore band converge since releasing about 20 years ago at this point converges Jane Doe is grown to be one of the most celebrated albums in the metalcore genre but also over that same span of time converges influence has shown to reach far beyond the popularity of their music between guitarist and producer Kurt Balu working with countless young bands and frontman Jacob ban and co-founding death wish records in 2000 converges impact on underground and extreme music might be as big behind the scenes as it is on the front lines either way this record and the band that made it have not only maintained an incredible amount of relevance over the years but have gained a very rare near universal appeal where what they do appeals to not just metalheads and hardcore veterans but young punks break down fiends even critics and it's not hard to see why Jane Doe and records like it at the time represented a brave new world for metalcore of dynamic and technical experimentation of genre fusions without losing a lick of the aggression and intensity that genres known for in converges case I would actually argue here they turned the intensity up it wasn't always like this though because prior to Jane Doe while converges records were good they weren't quite as high impact or tight the timelessly crushing sound of this album would take a while to develop as converge would not only slowly grow into their performance style but their visual aesthetic - not to mention it would take some time for curv alhu to become the band's prime producer but since Jane Doe converge has been on an incredible creative streak pushing boundaries dropping classics and racking up the kind of staying power that most bands in their genre can only dream of because as fads and trends in heavy and extreme music have come and gone convergence state on their own path and it shows in that a converge record from the mid-2000s can sound just as fresh as something that the band is doing today chalk it up to creativity industriousness right place right time an act of God but converges ability to influence and dominate in their field is unparalleled so too Jane Doe what is this record and why is it so good personally I think it boils down to several things the blistering sound the high-octane performances vocals that burn like a branding iron in your ear canal this thing is basically the soundtrack to hearing damage but the appeal of Jane Doe isn't just in its extremity but also its little stylistic nuances if you would even dare to apply a word like nuance to a record such as Jane Doe because even though this is a metalcore album it's not just some Neanderthal breakdown fest and converge come through with ways to make it anything but like with the shrill and bustling interpretation of post-hardcore on distance and meaning that's enhanced with some weird electronic phaser effects that pop up here and there or the oddly shaped disorienting and mathematical riffs and drum patterns on the intro to the song thaw the band even dabbles and some sinister alt rock passages backed with crunchy bass and devilish guitar leads on hell to pay also that super-sweet set of four chords at the midpoint of homewrecker how is this not just an extreme take on something you would normally hear out of like a heavy metal fist pumper especially as the band brings these chords back at the end and starts popping in these little drum fills so not only does converge offer a lot more stylistic diversity on one record than most metalcore bands do but simultaneously they're mind-blowing ly loud sound allows everything on this record to sound more stylistically cohesive than it actually is Jane Doe has recent Asian in spades as well as a genuinely great flow and a thrilling sound if you're not shy about loud music right from the start with the track concubine this album will keep just about any listener on the edge of their seat whether out of excitement or anxiety either way this tracks crisp drums and distorted screams and dizzying guitar leads and powerfully bassy riffs will make you feel something personally I feel like the screaming on this track is so loud it's like fire breath burning my skin off after this we have an amazingly smooth transition into the track fault and fracture which has this funny skipping little groove that it's a speed that is so intense I'm just losing control it's visceral as fuck the most awesome part of the track though is probably this evil ascending melody that plays throughout much of the tracks finish that progressively speeds up into a frenzy to finale and again as I mentioned the diversity on this album earlier the band understands that you're going to have a better listening experience if they don't hit you with the same sound an idea over and over and over so past this point they start to change things up a little bit with distance and meaning not only do you get that post-hardcore shift but you get a vocal change too with a roar sound where the singing comes off sometimes snobby sometimes absolutely manic the comparatively mellow hell to pay as a nice change of pace to it easily makes up for its lack of noise with an overabundance of brood it's brooding but not only is their magic and converges ability to sneakily sweeten their incredibly abrasive sound but they also find different ways to vary up the noise - like on the track bitter and then some where bannon's voice sounds like it's being recorded on the other end of a very tiny drainpipe I'm telling you the ear shredding sounds throughout this LP are enough to make other genres and bands that historically have been perceived as extreme and over-the-top just just looked like I don't know child's play or something because while I notice and appreciate everything converge does on Jane Doe to make this more than just an expression of pure hardcore noise it's just such an onslaught maybe the biggest onslaught of the band's discography considering that past this point converges really work to incorporate a lot more harmony and dynamics into their sound thankfully though the band changes things up tastefully for the final moments of this record whether it be on the thick slow and droney Phoenix and flight which at some points reminds me of son or much of the sludge metal that would be coming in the decade post this record the band manages to push this album to mischievous new heights on thaw with maybe the most frenetic drums and guitars on the entire LP the whole thing makes me feel like I'm caught in some kind of maze slash torture chamber where I'm being quickly torn apart in little pieces by I don't know blender blades or something also the mutant guitar if on this track is so jerky and violent and finally you have to give it to converge for having the guts to end this record with an 11 minute song and have it actually be good a slow abrasive kind of melodic at points and multi-phased monster of a track that I think ties the entire record up pretty nicely and that's my personal rundown of Jane Doe if I had to sum this album up in any way I would say this thing is like forging the loudest hardest heaviest most deadly steel or some kind of metal imaginable it's so hard but then you take that metal and with your bare hands you just bend it and whip it into a million different shapes like it's nothing that's Jane Doe at least to me anyway I love this record great record amazing record very happy and pleased that I get the opportunity to talk about it and hope you guys love this album as well or at least will be willing to give it a try if you have not listened to it already that's the review transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys in the next video Anthony Fantana converge forever

q8wm4QFCqhE,yeah yeah yeah hi everyone it any Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the end of list week 2019 we're here we made it to the end best albums of the year top 50 albums of the year going to be listing them from 52 numero uno as I usually do also as I usually do I'm going to skate through the first portion of this list and then give more explanation and thoughts as we get closer to the top 20 19 has been a very fruitful musical year in my opinion and I think these records reflect that they are all great in my opinion all worth your time I've done reviews on all of them so if there's anything I describe or say that piques your interest and you have not heard it before I encourage you to look it up go out give it a shot so let's start with number 50 a very smart enjoyable and cool concept record from Rhapsody with the album Eve great production and bars all over this record with each song being named after or inspired by a black female figure in art politics at number 49 we have experimental pop absurdists 100 X with their great fast somewhat abrasive and manic project 1000 X at number 48 we have one slick brash in-your-face and booty-shaking banger after another Megan the stallion fever at number 47 we have Australian art Punk's tropical fucks storm on their second record brain drops with number 46 Malibu Ken a new collaborative project from producer tobacco and also Aesop Rock they meld pretty well on this very scuzzy release 45 8-bit rock and electronic epic USA from the band automata Gucci and with 44 a talented quartet of country songwriters convene on the new high women LP on number 43 we get to see the slightly experimental side of electronic music producer flume on his hi this is flu mixtape and with 42 we have pop punk but with problems on the new pup record morbid stuff which is throttling thrilling and catchy 41 we have one of the most mysterious and cryptic rappers on the East Coast sounding refreshing over a lot of Kenny Seagal production with hiding-places son pyro class at number forty which is a very interesting set of drone metal improvisation 'he's from the famed drone metal duo number 39 you bow as the origin of my depression is one of the most shock to the system emotionally harrowing records of the year hands down at number 38 the noise rock duo lightning both sonic citadel the duo are back and sounding crushing heavy abrasive a little sweeter too but still very creative and very much still one of the best noise rock bands out there 37 Denzel Curry comes through with one banger after another on the very trim zoo definitely one of the more entertaining rap projects of the year at number 36 we have the narrative driven and heavily conceptual smart slick and jazzy project from blue and Ono a long red-hot Los Angeles summer night great great great very West Coast hip hop project at number 35 we have the bold experimental out there left-field JPEG mafia doing more singing than ever on his latest LP all my heroes are corn balls liking the musical transition he's doing over here and this just excites me to see how he'll evolve even further into the future at number 34 we have Danny Brown rapping from a place of comfortable experience and sounding incredibly skilled in the process on you know what I'm saying at number 33 Lana Del Rey comes through with what I think is her best project to date with Norman fucking Rockwell incredibly lush heavy amazing string back production all over this thing the tunes and ballads are enchanting and intoxicating vocally Lana while is she still very much Lana the performances and the range she displays here are certainly better than anything she's dropped up until this point at 32 Brockhampton get kinda sad on ginger it's a sad one guys with number 31 we have purple mountains self-titled LP singer-songwriter David Berman who fronted the recently formed band rest in peace to him as he asked not to long after the release of this album a record whose tracks that have a more suicidal tone hit harder than ever given his absence today number 30 we have one of everyone's least favorite projects and artists of the year and that is hobo Johnson with the fall of hobo Johnson a record that explores a lot of personal shortcomings and emotional trauma through a mix of folk music rock music pop music and hip hop personally I find it enjoyable I think hobo Johnson also doesn't get enough credit for approaching topics that are more relatable and more real-life for a lot of people then some may want to admit simply because it's a guy like hobo Johnson saying it at number 29 we have Brazil's own Anna Franco eléctrico with little electric chicken heart a very hard album to define considering all the genres going into it but it's a very fun and flirty mix of Samba jazz some indie some pop at number 28 one of the most enjoyable art pop records of the Year Caroline polo check Spang at number 27 one of the most enjoyable pop pop records of the year ariana grande's thank you next twenty six Beyonce drops on to us a live album of epic proportions spanning pretty much her entire musical catalog that's homecoming at number 25 Freddie Gibbs and Madlib team up once again on the record bandana while I think Mad Libs beats were a little dry on this one Freddie lyrically and flow wise really shined through a bit more than he did on pinata in my opinion there are some fans that prefer this one some that prefer another I just prefer to hear another record sooner rather than later because both in my opinion are great at number 24 one of the most thoughtful oddballs in the rap game right now quali Chris with his album guns easily one of his most dreary sad and politically charged projects to date 23 Matt most plastic anniversary the experimental electronic duo who are very sample-based by nature come through with a record of nothing but samples of plastic and it's pretty genius with number 22 clipping drops a horror inspired record with there existed an addiction to blood hip hop horror greatly inspired by movies and gore and guts and vivid descriptions of grim scenarios how could your butthole not pucker up a little bit that was gross 21 the comet is coming trust in the life force of the deep mystery a great jazz fusion LP that brings so many different genres and sounds and styles into the fold with number 20 Liz oh cuz I love you love this LP great features performances production songwriting and on top of it Liz oh effortlessly and flawlessly pulls together elements of hip-hop pop soul and there's not really a weak link in the chain sure there's not like an amazing flow to the tracklist and it's it's really a project of attempted hits but I don't know if Liz Oh comes through with a record that is a bit more thematic and thoughtful about how it all comes together on the whole it's gonna hit hard with number 19 one of the most eccentric voices in Australian music today Karen Jay Kalinin with return to Center a great covers album that I think says a lot about Kieran as an artist not to mention the concept of this record is hilarious having purchased every piece of instrumentation on it at Guitar Center and then returning it before the return policy ran out everything you heard on this record was quite literally returned to Center and with Kieran having recently tumbled through the court system over in Australia I think this record is an emotional return to Center two on number 18 we have an amazingly produced diverse exciting jazz album with azam Ed's Polyhymnia should also mention the records female empowerment angle which informs the record and its music and its progression in a really great way with number 17 jazz and hip hop and ambient music drone plunder phonics to foo-foo finds itself on the noose louse and Malone LP a quiet farewell 2016 to 2018 at number 16 we have an artist who basically disproves his album title by coming out with this record yeah there was something great about Britain it's slow tie a little sad and down in the dumps though so I wouldn't jump into this one unless you were ready for a record a hip hop record a quality UK hip hop record that dives into themes of men health while also exploring and addressing some of the socio-political issues that are hurting his country of origin today many of which have worsened with the election of Boris Johnson but maybe we're going to get nothing great about Britain part two now at number 15 we have another great thing about Britain one of the best rock bands new fresh rock bands from the country right now that is black MIDI with their record Schlag and I'm a very bold and odd experimental brand of mass rock that I have not heard any other group pushing as of right now all I can do is fold my hands and pray that black MIDI continues to maintain one of the freshest sounds in the underground right now at number fourteen we have one of the freshest sounds in pop right now and that is the new Billy Eilish LP when we all fall asleep where do we go god this is so good yes it's subtle yes it's quiet yes it's not in-your-face and obviously before this Billy was very much inspired by some of her moodier and more low-key contemporaries such as Lord but what her and her brother have developed on this record this very unique blend of art pop and hip-hop and maybe even ASMR even if there's a part of me thinking I'm Way too old for this shit it's still just a fresh sound for the genre at number 13 Australian rock band king gizzard and the lizard wizard make their thrash metal debut on infest the rats nest which is also a concept a narrative album - about the destruction of the planet and the rich leaving the planet - I guess go live happily and with lots of resources on another planet it doesn't totally end well for them though give it a try give it a shot it's a fun one at number twelve one of the most luscious gorgeous and compelling chamber pop records of the year that the most compelling chamber pop record of the year that is the new wise blood project Titanic rising with number 11 fast furious Japanese cheer Punk's ohta bouquet beaver come through with their kind of new album kind of compilation H Acoma hits if you want to hear one of the most exciting things in Japanese punk right now give it a poke a beaver a listen getting into the upper echelon of the list now with the top 10 here we go at number 10 we have the great the flamboyant Dorian Elektra with the album flamboyant that's that's I gave the title away early what a sharp smart pop record with futuristic production bends the mind bends the gender with super smart charismatic catchy songs about love sex gender politics work violence Dorian Elektra creatively covers the spectrum right now and does it with a flair so few pop artists have at the moment at number nine we have Alex Cameron with Miami memory a record that honestly I was afraid I would not enjoy but the more I listen to it the more I love it with a great voice charisma swagger songs about love politics PC culture toxic masculinity even being a stepdad Alex Cameron shows himself to be one of the best singing songwriting commentators out there today at number eight we had a thrilling exciting experimental and free jazz concept record from Montana Roberts coincoin chapter for Memphis a chilling and unsettling project about emotional trauma and memories with number 7 Hunter hunt Hendricks brings his experimental metal project liturgy to a grand culmination on Haq cue with a beautifully layered and explosive display of what one can only call transcendental black metal with number six it is UK rapper little Sims with gray area one of the sharpest smartest most direct and in your face rap records of the year great production great flows bold personality I'd say it's one of the best rap records to come out of the UK and a long time on number five we have the deeply unsettling and tortured so tortured I think it takes those tortured feelings out on those listening to it shoo-shoo girl with basket of fruit shoo shoo truly and honestly has a long and storied reputation as being one of the most twisted musical projects period and girl with basket of fruit just exceeds anything the band has done up until this point on every front the abrasiveness of this have shocking the lyrics and the vocals are furthermore genre wise it's hard to even categorize what this is because the sense the post-punk and art pop inspirations that typically fuel many a shoo-shoo project are nowhere to be heard it is absolutely mind expanding mind-blowing frightening in a way maybe the most frightening experience I've had with a popular record since I guess Scott Walker's bish Bosch and equally freakish and impossible to categorize musical experience at number four an equally disturbing musical experience with linguae egg nota Caligula the heavy industrial almost classical instrumentation on this record is something to behold as is the singing as are the blood-curdling screams it's easily one of the boldest and most unflinching addresses right in the face of abuse in modern music for that reason this record is not going to be an easy listen or even a listen for many people and that's fine but this is an experience I personally am never going to forget or want to forget as what's been conjured here on Caligula is something to behold with number three UK singer-songwriter experimental bulk issed richard Dawson with his record 2020 a concept record about the not so far away future a takedown of the modern era facing down issues of politics isolation being overworked as a cog in a capitalist system also the environment nearly everything that ills and is slowly grading away at the fabric of modern society is addressed in some way on this project and it's done so with wild eccentric vocals angular intricate and impressive guitar playing rough wild textured but versatile production and the whole record links back to Richard Dawson's peasant record his previous album in a really interesting way which I think thematically addresses a lot of similar issues and in concepts but does so in a weirdly medieval context at number two we have what in my opinion is Tyler the creator's best album and one of the best breakup albums of the decade egor not only as the production on this thing colorful and creative and mucky but stylistically this record sees Tyler transitioning into more notes of soul music pop music while still throwing in a few bangers here and there it is his sweetest smartest most narrative driven and enjoyable records to date the way he reinvented himself for this project is a blast and I can't wait to see what the next stage of evolution brings Tyler's like a Pokemon at this point a really cool Pokemon which of course brings me to my number one record and what is that what is that record that is the new Charli XCX record charlie man pop record of the year man amazing pop record the the future of pop music in my opinion a future that I think many people are just not ready for and not to say that in pop music this is the most experimental thing that has ever happened no that's not what I'm saying that's not what I'm arguing but as far as making pop music that would thoroughly appeal to the average pop listener goes while simultaneously experimenting on it to the point where it sounds like nothing else in the mainstream pop field on that front currently I think Charlie is killing it and doing so in a way where she is smartly bringing on so many features and producers in the same way that like a hip hop artist would and using that to creatively kill it in so many spaces lanes avenues from mountainous anthems like gone to zany and aggressive abrasive banger such as click and then two more ballads and mellow cuts and then just straight dance pop euphoria such as 1999 if you enjoy pop music in my opinion Charlie has a little something for everybody here it's so well crafted every song is immaculately produced Charlie vocally I think is on point all over the place the flow of this thing is great and it's so much material it's such a large pop record too so yeah Charlie Charlie XCX personally it's my album of the year and I think I am going to leave it at that everyone thank you very much for watching this has been my albums of the year 2019 that's my list that's what all the projects I mentioned are listed down below

sWSdboVgeek,haha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of list week where I'm going over all of my favorites and least favorites of the year of our Lord 2019 and now it's time for my top 50 teasers and singles of the year quite a hefty batch of songs we have over here because I'm going through so many I'm not going to go into detail or an explanation on every single track I'm going to blow through really the first half of the list and then continue on with maybe more explanations as we get closer to the top like usual it's what I do on these lists let's go at number 50 kicking it off we have Kai Whiston we have igloo ghosts we have baby coming together under the name glue with the track locky at number 49 hip hop producer legend DJ Premier primo putting together the track headlines featuring the Grizelda guys conway westside benny at number 48 it's black MIDI with Talking Heads at 47 it is Rammstein with Deutschland 46 Black Country new roads sunglasses and a 45 we have clipping with blood of the fang at number 44 it is angel olsen with the beautiful and synth-heavy track all mirrors titled tractor her new record an 243 it is squid with houseplants post-punk a good post-punk track at number 42 it is the thought jana remix from Blueface featuring yg and cardi B and 41 we have the incredibly sad and dramatic and skeletal cellophane from fka twigs at number 40 and 39 it is Rosalia with and then poppy with Blood Money at number 38 it is the a cult band ghost with their double-sided single seven inches of satanic panic at number 37 Rina saw Emma with her pop metal fusion STFU at number 36 MGMT's sort of goth doubt in the afternoon at 35 jpeg mafia Jesus forgive me I am a thot at number 34 we have American footballs very slick and gorgeous uncomfortably numb with Hayley Williams of Paramore Fame at number 33 we have the more lush and gorgeous the greatest from Lana Del Rey at 32 it is the fun tongue-in-cheek and witty Tia Tamara from doe jacket featuring reco nasty and a 31 we have the powerful 80s throwback anthem so hot you're hurting my feelings from Caroline polo check at number 30 it is Michael Kiwanuka with piano joint at 29 it is purple mountains rest in peace David Berman with darkness and cold Anderson pact with Smokey Robinson make it better at 28 at 27 we have the hard industrial jittery and insane jailbreak the Tesla from injury reserve 26 amazing banger from Denzel curry Ricky 25 Freddie Gibbs in mad lib link up once again for crime pays at number 24 it is hobo Johnson with Subaru Crosstrek XV a personal and hilarious banger about succeeding in the music industry but monetarily not quite being there yet to where you've got money money at 23 it's one of the biggest songs of the summer featuring one of the biggest catchphrases of the summer and that is mega the Stallions hot girl summer with Nicki Minaj and ty dolla sign easily one of the best party tracks the year don't know how you can't love it at number 22 it is the grand lush beautiful and heavily Rolling Stones inspired harmony Hall from Vampire Weekend at number 21 we have arguably the biggest song and single of the year now currently being the longest charting at number one song ever a little nas X's Old Town Road I'm simply repping the original version here if you have a preferred remix by all means put whatever the song version whatever in this spot I guess at number 20 it is the clunky experimental funny and witty Obamacare from Quayle a Chris and at number 19 it is the bright punchy synthetic anthem lorem ipsum from Anamanaguchi one of the most melodic and thrilling electronic music tracks of the year at number 18 we have Karen J Kalinin one of the best singers and songwriters in Australia right now in my opinion coming through with a wonderful and powerful cover of the whole of the moon which comes from his new covers album return to center and I just find his rendition this track to be very powerful immense production and performance are fantastic at number 17 we have the harrowing and head's splitting pumpkin attack on mommy and daddy from Shu Shu this is one of many incredibly aggressive and chaotic moments from this record and a musical experience from this year I will not forget at number 16 we have the somewhat smooth and jaunty and passionate and lushly arranged every day from wise blood a wonderfully gorgeous track from her new LP Titanic rising her approach to chamber pop on this project is just fantastic at fifteen in my opinion this is one of the most exciting crossovers of the year and that is slow tie in Denzel Curry with psycho going into this track I knew both these guys favored some aggressive production sometimes I knew they both have a very distinct sometimes manic and aggressive voices and flows ah but damn they complement each other so well on this song and the B just it goes the song just truly lives up to the name not a bad thing to say about it love it at number 14 it is one of the most fun pop songs of the year this track to me was absolutely irresistible in 2019 coming from one of my favorite albums of the year - and that is Liz O with juice the beat the fun refrains Liz's voice there's not a thing about this track that I don't find to be a smile inducing or just generally enjoyable Liz oh really broke out this year it's thanks greatly in part to tracks like this and I'm happy about that because I think pop music currently is more interesting with her at number 13 we have an experimental somewhat low phi angular fusion of folk and Indian rock and even progressive music in a sense and that is richard Dawson with two halves from his amazing album 20/20 while I think this track is fantastic and hits hard I will say that it may be a little confusing or maybe not as gratifying in just simply an isolated context because 2020 is in itself a concept album about the modern era and two halves might not make as much alone as it does in the Greater record still though the very unorthodox and unlikely guitar playing and production and singing on this track combined with the very catchy yet intricate brand of songwriting makes it a pretty significant musical moment in 2019 for me at number 12 it is one of the most fantastically building thrilling bright exciting crushing metal tracks of the year and that is god of love from the new liturgy project Haq cue the overwhelming production and the way hunter hunt hendrix geniusly composes and layers so many guitars on this track and many others from the same album is just really a nearly genius in my opinion and i'm absolutely loving what he is continuing to do with the liturgy project it's thanks to tracks like god of love that liturgy stays on the cutting edge of metal music in my opinion even if they continue not to get as much respect for that as I think they should at number 11 we have another one of the biggest songs of the year and that is Billy Eilish with the track bad guy yes as much as this song was everywhere and you really couldn't seem to get away from it in some ways I it felt to me like it was even harder to get away from than Old Town Road but Billy and her brother on her debut album really did craft I think a very unique brand of whispery brooding and odd pop music and bad guy is just one of many examples of that from the new LP it's maybe I guess one of the catchiest examples of it does a whole lot with a little not only in terms of Billy's singing but also the bare-bones production in which every sound has a kind of dark yet quirky quality to it and topping all of that our Billy used somewhat unsettling yet very ear wormy lyrics and generally I just like the song as a bit of a developmental moment as an mo of sorts really kind of defining who Billy is trying to be image wise who Billy is trying to communicate to the greater public who she is as an artist at number 10 we have a track that in a way is an accidental moment of genius it is one of the most fun and hilarious and simultaneously telling songs of the and I think speaks to the ethos of one Kenny beats as he constantly makes it known his little catchphrase his philosophy in life I suppose or at least an art is a don't overthink shit and he and Zac Fox certainly didn't overthink any shit on the track Jesus is the one I got depression some may categorize this as a novelty song but it's far from that it's a serious and wonderful expression of art and even if they are just goofing off in a sense you can't really deny that there is a significance to this track in its laughs through the pain attitude when it comes to mental health at number 9 on my list I have TK my Australian rapper and songwriter with the insomniac rap banger awake featuring jpg mafia I love that this track hits hard it's dark the jpg feature is fantastic TK's delivery is great she's got a good solid refrain on the song too and I love how the theme of the track just speaks to the overload and the burnout I think of the modern information era that we exist in and how our constant engagement with the world digitally makes it difficult or rather easy to sort of avoid the whole process or the need to sleep rest unplug it's a pretty smart and apt song for the moment in that way at number 8 it is one of the most insane and jittery singles of the year a song from a duo that I think have come through with a very novel sound that I'm excited to see grow and progress in the coming years and that is 100x with the track money machine while I think the record this track comes from is short it's flawed and GEX at this point certainly have room to grow the way forward for the duo is painted pretty clearly on this song their futuristic glitchy multi-genre fusion of pop chaos that they come up with on this track and on many other songs from this record is easily one of the most exciting things one of the most I'm just looking forward to it things that I've heard this decade at number 7 we have the crushing and depressing and mind-bendingly dark do you doubt me traitor from linguae egg nota one of many fantastically tortured and Ament songs from her new record Caligula which you should definitely be listening to if you have not at number six it is a celebration of progression and success and growth with Danny Brown on best life great flow amazing storytelling from Danny to basically everything he has been so great at up until this point distilled and personified into a wonderful retrospective type moment for him where he now gets to look back on everything that has brought him up until this point and as someone who's been listening to him for a long time now it's pretty amazing to go on that trip with him in a sense on this track at number five it is the environmentalist thrash metal anthem King gizzard and the lizard wizard Planet be a raging dark rough and explosive cut pretty much about the destruction of the planet and how there is no planet B and the extra heap of genius to this song and all the songs surrounding it on their new record is exposed by how this track narrative Lee plays into the concept of the entire record it comes from so if you do like this track if you do enjoy this track and it is pretty amazing how well kinga's are transitioned into the whole thrash style on this cut make sure to listen to the whole LP because there is more where that came from in terms of songwriting quality and riffs but also the ongoing story is really intriguing to at number four it is one of the biggest boldest most explosive wonderful anthemic catchy pop anthems I already said anthem anthemic but still say it again pop anthems of the year and that is Charli XCX with Christine and the queens gone incredible production singing chemistry and writing on this song it's easily one of the best if not the best collaboration of the year it's amazing that Charlie and her collaborators on her new LP and especially this song were able to pull off what they pulled off here because there were so many risks involved with bringing so many people into the fold yet it all just kind of went over with flying colors at number three on our list we have Tyler the Creator with quick easily one of the most fun songs of the year I know there are some Tyler fans who didn't care for the Warped mutant somewhat Lofa and cartoony demeanor that he delivered to us on this new LP of his but I think earthquake is one of his best singles and Igor is his best album period and that's because of the irresistible hooks the creative aesthetic and the bold character of tracks like these since this track dropped it's weird vocals and it's oddly catchy melodies have just been putting a smile on my face I have nothing overly critical to say about this track I just love it moving on from there at number two on my list it is dorian electro with career bowie a warped futuristic soaring pop banger that is essentially a smart satirize ation of addiction to white-collar work climbing the corporate ladder working for the man it's this and many other cuts on dorian Electro's flamboyant that so genius li approached subjects of gender conformity masculinity it's rare that on a debut album an artist comes in the way Dorian has here just so fully formed their aesthetic their sonic style their songwriting ability what they decide to discuss and thoroughly dive into in their songs all of those things are executed so well on flamboyant and career boy is just a choice example of that and my number one song of the year is the teaser cut from Alex Cameron's Miami memory and that is far from born again the more I listen to this track the more difficult that is to find something that I don't like about it it's fun laid-back dududududu vocal harmonies it's somewhat sleazy and swaggered groove and rhythm section Alex Cameron's kind of smokey lead vocals dramatic hook sharp chord progression smooth like butter execution and a God level approach to the topics of respect and sex work frankly ideas that I didn't even think I need songs about but that's kind of the thing about Alex Cameron he kind of gives you songs about things that you didn't know you needed songs about Alex Cameron in a very smart specific and informative without being preachy or just killing the appeal of the song for the message kind of way details the power and the position of women who work in the sex industry painting them as people who are paying their bills trying to make an honest living meanwhile taking down a peg the people who usually derived them while simultaneously consuming what they do and undeniable reality that society seems intent to deny silently all the time and don't just look at this track of some kind of silly weird detour into a track about people who are sex workers Alex's new record in a lot of ways is all about approaching taboos and and demystifying topics that people are usually afraid to approach or sing about and in my opinion far from born again is just the best example of that from Miami memory and obviously my favorite song and single of the year so with tying that up this has been my list of my 50 favorite singles of 2019 thank you for watching make sure to drop your list for your favorite songs and singles down below and I'll see you in the next one transition

forever 
9K7JoChJEww,uh hi everyone ear theny clog tanto here the internet stuffiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of our list week series in 2019 where i'm going over the best and the worst of the year in this video the ten top ten tippity tippity tippity-tap ten in my opinion worst albums of but yeah yeah looking at this list we got ten doozies here for you which honestly i'm pretty excited to get through so let's do it the ten worst records of the year kicking it off at number 10 we have someone who has been referred to as the ginger fury and that is Ed Sheeran with his collaborations number six record he dropped earlier in the year uh yeah this thing sucks it's boring it I'm disappointed with it even though going into it my hopes were not really all that high but this thing is pretty much Ed Sheeran's typically mediocre brand of songwriting brought together with a bunch of money-grabbing collaborations with artists from across the pop music spectrum and it's like IDI uses a lot of these crossovers as an excuse to dabble in genres and sounds that he typically doesn't but then do a really crappy job at that too plus honestly I really could have died happily without ever having heard anyone rap about Ed Sheeran having jungle fever and and yet now that is a thing that I have to exist in the same timeline as and I'm not happy about it from Travis Scott to Justin Bieber there is very little in the way of any real exciting or interesting chemistry across the lp the whole thing just sounds like streaming playlist fodder at the end of the day at number nine a record that I dislike for a lot of the same reasons as the Ed Sheeran LP but it is even lazier and more horrendous and more unlikable and that is the new dj khaled album father of assad as if dj khaled couldn't prove himself to be any less of an artist he somehow outdoes himself even on that front with this record where you have some of his most ham-fisted collections of artists and beats that I've heard on a DJ khaled record ever at least on a project like major key there was some kind of care put into what artists were being combined and the quality of the production they were on top of and in addition to that the structure of the songs all I can say at the end of the day is that the nipsey track is maybe the best and only great song on this entire thing and I hope everyone involved got a fat check because having your name attached to this I imagine should come with a price at number 8 on our list we have one of the most obnoxious and annoying pop records of the year and that is the new AJR LP neo Theater this is a pop trio that I find to be so grating I even avoided their last couple of records but to boil it down AJR is essentially every melodramatic cheery bright overly compressed millennial pop stereotype there is just all packed into one group one album on top of that their sound on this particular record is disgustingly unoriginal as it feels like a lot of what's going on here is just kind of pulled from the last few twenty one pilots records but removing any semblance of edge from those projects and twenty one pilots aren't exactly like an edgy band the whole thing just feels really patronizing like oh you had a bad day will be your pillow to cry on but we are going to address things like personal and emotional issues in the most innocuous and bland way possible so not only is any hint of raw emotion on neo theater wrapped in bubble wrap but from the singing to the songwriting to the instrumentation the whole project truly and honestly is creatively bankrupt next at number seven I had a bit of a head scratch over what I was going to do with this spot with this artist but I figure this will contain two albums as this artist really gave us a double whammy in 2019 and that is logic with not only supermarket but confessions of a dangerous mind yes we got to records from logic this year though if I had to pick one of these two to be in this spot it would be supermarket while confessions of a dangerous mind is an incredibly disappointing record easily logics worst commercial solo album so far it's truly supermarket the soundtrack to the book of the same title logic came out with this year where he fails with flying colors because supermarket is not your average logic album whatever that even is at this point no in fact supermarket sees logic toying with rock music yeah logic is trying to do a true-blue rock rap fusion in a way over here though the rapping on this thing is pretty minimal for the most part logic is singing on this record and God the songs are awful the songs suck and every single influenced logic has on this thing is transparent painfully transparent I mean there are tracks on this thing that just sound like Red Hot Chili Peppers ripoffs if you've ever thought that logics hip-hop music was derivative of many of his contemporaries just try this but yes between the blatant ripoffs all over this LP and the cringe-inducing choruses of tracks like Lemon Drop yeah I can't stand this and I don't think a 20-19 worst of list is complete without this record at number 6 we have gun as drip or drown too which i think is a pretty interesting placement here because I finally feel as if I have insight now into how old heads feel when they say they don't like things like mumble rap this must be what every project in this style sounds like to them because the production which granted is the best thing about the record is one-dimensional as hell sure it's a little immersive and kind of watery definitely living up to the title of the project but it still gets really stale really fast and if the instrumentals on a record like drip or drown - are not totally on pony you're kind of doomed to fail from the start then there's the case of gonna on top of all of these instrumentals I mean I've made a no secret up until this point that as a rapper as a vocalist I don't find him interesting at all he really has no characteristics about his voice that are distinct compelling emotional exciting a lot of the time he just sounds very flat very lifeless almost comatose a lot of the auto-tune he puts on top of his voice sucks out what organic and human qualities one might be able to get out of his singing or rapping or however you want to categorize it stylistically it's all way too derivative of artists like young thug this thing is completely devoid of any hint of compelling songwriting and the flows across this thing are boring as hell too I just don't get how or why this project is appealing to anyone because the songs aren't catchy they're all very samey across the entire record vocally and lyrically it's nothing to write home about maybe I can kind of get it if I squint and imagine it in the context of the trippy trap stuff coming off of records like playboy cardis die lit but even in that Lane drip or drown to completely fails to measure up boring pointless patience testing it's not good at number five we have a record that is not so much boring but really excruciating at numerous points and that is the new blink-182 album nine one of the biggest pop punk bands of all time not aging very well in this decade as they attempt to update their sound make it appeal to a new generation with the most horrendous overblown bright ugly and I guess gaudy production that I think I've ever heard on a record of this style not to mention it's kind of hard to listen to Mark Hoppus and company rock with some lyrics that just give off some very big Peter Pan syndrome vibes and despite that blink has been around for like ever at this point it's it's like the group's songwriting hasn't advanced or matured in any way whatsoever I mean there are tracks off their old LPS that to me feel more emotionally dynamic than some of the songs on here in a way it's almost like they're regressing or something but honestly at the end of the day the worst worst worst thing about this project is that tons of the song obnoxious and the recording the mixes the instrumental layers the way the vocals are treated and just manipulated and gussied up to the point where they just don't even feel human all of that just makes this a very hard lesson a very hard lesson even harder though and even Bunker is our a number four spot and that goes to 93 punks and vic mensa with their 93 punks record this punk hip hop crossover is short but in that short amount of time that it lasts it packs in a lot of cringe a lot of preachy politics a lot of self-centered attitudes some of the sorriest excuses for songs in 2019 I'm just not sure what punk music did as a genre and as a culture to deserve a record as bad as this I mean look vic mensa he seems like a nice guy with a good head on his shoulders and a lot of his music and his messaging and politics seems smart and well-intentioned and i understand that he may be struggling to find a different lane or just exist out of the expectations that are put on to him as a rapper from Chicago whose career has overlapped with the likes of chance and Kanye and so on and so forth but I feel like this is just not really the way to do it what Vince has put out here is the equivalent of an artistic temper tantrum and it's it's just not appealing at all I don't know I have a feeling that Vince may look back in 10 years and be kind of embarrassed by some of the stuff he's put out here but what should be even more embarrassing is our number three spot and that is the Neve album bad habits what I'll say NAB does perfectly is that he distills a really weird trend and problem that I think occurs with many genres and styles and trends when they reach a peak of popularity and that is you have artists who enter the fold gain clout get a record contract and do so while putting in what sounds like the most minimal effort possible because they're merely just going along with a formula they're going through the motions and when it comes to going through the motions I don't know if there is an artist or a record more perfectly described by that phrase than NAB's bad habits because the execution in creation of everything on this project is so robotic and methodical it's like NAB is just painting by numbers he's connecting the dots and he's doing so with a flat emotionless face one thing that I personally enjoy about music is its ability to stir up emotions within the listener whether that be aggression or happiness or sadness confusion overwhelming feelings whatever those feelings may be creating an opportunity to connect and relate to an emotion or an experience through music can be a pretty powerful thing but with NAB's music emotionally his music doesn't really stir up much of anything it's like the absence of emotion its purpose I guess in a way is to uh not drive the listener to feel or think anything at all vocally it seems like NAB does everything he can to a Moute as little as possible in fact he sounds like I don't know almost like a text-to-speech software program at some points which is why NAB's bad habits land so high on this list because this isn't so much an album as much as it is a void a void of anything that you would typically find interesting entertaining or compelling in music at number two I put what in my opinion is one of the most if not the most spectacular musical failures of the decade and that is chance the rapper's big day yeah this record is not very good and it's sad that it's not very good because I was excited to listen to a great and amazing a fantastic chance project because there are tracks from acid rap cocoa butter kisses that frankly are some of my favorite tracks of the decade I liked coloring book - and I thought chance was just going up and up and up getting better and better and better and the big day his first commercial full-length album this is where he was going to put a stamp on the end of the decade and just solidify his talent his unique abilities and his one-of-a-kind sound but instead of that we got this totally trash album which mind you does have genuine emotions packed into it a lot of jokes cropped up about chance being happy on this record and loving his wife and you know what at the end of the day all that's good all that's fine I am happy that chance is happy I am glad that chance is hopefully living and emotionally stable life and settling down with a wife and kids and finding himself in his happy place right now but chance being happy or singing or rapping about love or his wife is not why this record sucks this record sucks one because it sounds like chance put the least amount of effort that he could into a great deal of these songs I can't imagine that given the lyrical quality the corny ass similes written into a lot of these tracks that he spent nearly as much time on this as he did any number of songs from coloring book or acid rap instrumental e there are a lot of mediocre beats on this thing too I don't know what kept chance from finding instrumentals or getting a hold of tracks that were as compelling jazzy gospel inspired exciting gorgeous as the sounds that he's typically known for riding on just previous tapes but a lot of that just does not show up here not only that but instrumentally there are a lot of weird genre shifts across this project too that frankly were kind of unnecessary or if chance was going to do something like drop a few hip house tracks on a record I don't know retool them to the point where they don't sound so boring and derivative and just like a pale comparison to this older music trend that you want to borrow from obviously because it matters to you it's influential to you but you're not really doing the style justice then there's chance of singing which across the entire record is is bad embarrassingly bad this is not typically how bad chances singing vocals sound and finally how is this thing well over an hour in length it's like chance had no interest whatsoever like you must have on previous tapes to edit himself like there was definitely some stuff here that should have been retooled or just left on the cutting room floor all of these things compiled make the big day such a spectacular failure it's not a big day it's just a big mess so again regardless of the emotions or authenticity going into these songs this is not the level of execution or effort that I expect from a chance project or the focus sorry but the number one worst record of the year and I did fold this over in my mind quite a bit wondering if this was the choice I was to make but the more I thought about it a more ugly detestable horrid and unlikable album had not come out this year so that's why my number one spot goes to the nostalgia critics the wall which is basically a song by song satire parody takedown of Pink Floyd's the wall because Doug Walker aka the nostalgia critic notoriously does not like the wall as a film I guess as an album as well as as a franchise within the Pink Floyd canon so he decided to take his unhappiness with the wall out over instrumentals from the wall but basically retooled instrumentals and just do bad shitty karaoke where he's just doing different lyrics about how much he dislikes the wall this is bad it's really funny because when I drop reviews people will sometimes negatively respond to them saying well why does your opinion matter more than those who as if coming on camera here and giving my opinion and putting it out on the Internet is like some kind of huge statement of egoism like yeah I think my opinions really important just because I'm saying it openly in a public space when honestly it's the internet anybody can say anything on the internet at any time for the most part but I feel like this record really gives me insight into those emotions though because I feel like Doug Walker's the wall here really truly is a statement of II because not only is Doug putting his opinion out there Doug also had to turn his negative opinion of the wall into a weird freaky annoying totally unnecessary passion project where he literally has to bring in other people to make all this possible not only as an album but there's a visual component attached to it too yeah to me that says I think very highly in my opinion and it is so important I need to set it to copyrighted music because it's it's just it just really is that that valid and look at the end of the day Doug Walker most likely is aware of how negative the backlash is going to be toward a project like this toward an opinion like this but I'm not coming down here and saying that the the wall is beyond critique I know that not every Pink Floyd record slaps and given the diversity of the Bands catalog you're growing at varying opinions over which records are good which records are not so good but if you're going to give a negative opinion of a beloved record which I've done a few times before I feel like this is maybe the worst possible way you could go about doing that I can't imagine a worse way Doug here just comes through with a record that is just so unbearably pompous I'm just not sure what to say I'm I'm almost speechless speechless beyond this point anyway and that is going to be it for my list those are my top 10 worst albums of 2019 and let me know what yours are down in the comments thank you very much for fucking with me riding with me through this list week let's keep it going transition have you given any of these albums a listen if you have I'm sorry if you have not you know sure if you're bored and you want to try them go for it but any time you waste and any unhappiness you experience that's not on me I warned you I warned you over here next to

ankJslr42AA,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and continuing last week 20:19 where i am going to be going over what in my opinion are the 10 worst songs of the year oh no any don't tell me you're gonna hate her my girl eglise alia the girl say Lee whack or whack getting down the street she crashed the street that say hi to me know as hard as it is to admit that song kind of slaps Bank the word regardless 20 19 musically overall has been a pretty good year a lot of great songs EPS and albums dropping across the years 12 months but there's there's been some especially bad music - not gonna lie there was a lot of competition to get on this list I even flirted with the idea of expanding it to 15 or 20 songs but I didn't want to put myself or even you through that much torture III think maybe your life would be best if we just kept it to 10 and you know just just made things simple so my list top 10 worst songs of the year let's go kicking it off at number 10 on our list is Jeremy Renner actor Jeremy Renner but also singer and songwriter apparently the stuff he's been dropping throughout the year especially this track heaven don't have a name is some of the worst most bland basic macho personality devoid pop rock that I've heard in a long time it's like Jeremy is putting all of his heart and soul into just writing advertisement music and I don't get it I really do not get the appeal of this it just sounds like a boomer in a leather jacket riding one of those like try wheel motorcycles and not one of the weird or cool or cutting-edge looking ones one of the big fat ones that like has all the carrying cases on and shit one of those this is just so soulless it's it's quite sad at number 9 we have the tracks with Charli XCX as a feature Diplo and Herve pages and I really wrestled with myself on whether or not I should include this track in this list because one it's it's not very popular the spread of this track has not been very viral and also it seems like everyone involved is having as much fun with it as possible with whatever this track is but I have to acknowledge the fact that doing a weird club' latin flip of the Spice Girls want to be honey honey and just taking various vocal sections from that and and playing them out over this just again horrendous revision and topping it all off with a bad music video where everyone's floating in the ocean and chillin with neon colored dolphins and shit it's easily one of the most harebrained face plant musical moments of the year despite how much I respect everyone involved this this was like something that should have never left you know the dry erase board it should have been wiped out of existence and and maybe the planet would have been better for it one more song I think the world could have done without is at number eight it's ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber with the track I don't care which comes from Ed Sheeran's recent collaborations project where he crosses over with a lot of different sounds and artists but this track with Bieber is one of the most offensively bland and pointless songs I think I've heard this year vocally they have no chemistry whatsoever and as I said my track review of the song originally the effect of hearing ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber saying the same vocal line and not even really in harmony over each other is basically the effect of pouring a glass of water into another glass of water except water is good so it has to be something that you don't even really want to drink to begin with like I don't know some some kind of like crappy terribly flavored seltzer just like one of the worst polar flavors that you could think of anyway the bland production the crap léa composed and totally inoffensive and forgettable songwriting the the just completely boring singing and performance on this thing the only thing this track has going for it commercially is that Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber are on the same song that is truly and honestly it it is painfully pointless and a sheer sign of Ed Sheeran's incredible complacence in the tail end of this decade at number seven is another artist and another song that I never wanted to see on this list but the more I thought about it the more I had to kind of do it and that is Slater Kenny's the future is here if somebody all remember I was not all that pleased with the new Slater kenny record nor were many longtime fans and tracks like the future is here is one of the key reasons why everything about this song is like my worst nightmare scenario of what could have come out of this sleater-kinney record just brought into real life with one of the worst vocal performances on any sleater-kinney song ever also one of the most tedious instrumentals and a concept and lyrics that just feel like Luddites lament about just how bad screens and smartphones are and how they're destroying society and making me feel alone when there are numerous other factors systemic factors at work that are creating such problems like emotional and personal isolation in everyday life amongst Millennials Zoomers and probably anybody else living in America currently so instrumentally it is off the mark vocally it's out the window conceptually it's AI is truly off the ball at number six is little AK and six nines lanes I guess if you want to hear some auto-tune Latin trap that is horribly produced and features not only vocals from 6-9 but the alter ego of DJ academics then listen to this but if you have self esteem and watch yourself don't yeah this is trash it's the worst kind of trash meaning that yeah it's bad yeah it's awful and DJ academics in 69 are most likely well aware of how bad it is but they know that they can do it they know that they can get away with it so they'll just like meh just pump more shit into the art stream because it will mean money at the end of the day so whatever at number five we have a track that is even more terrible in my opinion and that is gonna z' speeded up I have made it no secret that this decade gonna has proven himself in a very short time to be one of my least favorite rappers out there operating currently he is so painfully derivative and boring I just don't see the point or the appeal of gonna just kind of seems like he's being shoved down our throats at this point as far as the current landscape of auto Kerner's go it's not like he has a voice it's not like he has range it's not like he has personality it's not like he has lyrics but I mean who the hell is expecting that at this point dude just feels like a young thug offshoot and I don't really think there's much more to it than that however I do have to give the guy credit for spectacularly failing on one of these big singles from his last full length record speed it up which to me hilariously enough feeds into in the worst way possible pretty much every stereotype that people usually level against the current landscape of auto-tuned mumbly and kind of psychedelic trap rappers not only lyrically is he pretty much saying nothing of substance here but he's he's not really saying much of anything at all half the time he's barely rapping on the song it's it seems like he wants to leave in as much dead air as possible and what few lyrics he does leave in are absolutely stupid Scotty how to beat it up speed it up I am blown away that this is not a parody this is not this is real life you know it's one thing if a track in this style has a good flow or a catchy melody or a good vibe to it but gonna doesn't even bring that to the table at number four we have a bit of a special exception here as with these lists I typically just focus on singles because if I focused on just any song that came out at any point throughout the year regardless of how it was released it would be nearly impossible to whittle it down to the ten worst songs of an entire year but this track while not being a single at number four Miley Cyrus with cattitude RuPaul coming off of her newest EP I just had to mention how only because it's amazingly bad but also the EP that it came from because it's an EP I'm not really considering it for the worst albums of the year list so I thought it would be more fitting to talk about potentially the worst track on the entire record here and this is a maybe a hip house song yeah I guess it's got some groovin club' bass on there and Miley Cyrus engaging in a really awful painful cringy rap flow where she's rapping about loving her pussy having that cattitude I've said this before and I'll say it again I enjoy the sentiment of the track but absolutely everything about it is terribly executed from the lyricism to again the rapping the singing RuPaul is maybe the most enjoyable thing about the entire track but RuPaul intentionally tries to be a little flamboyant and annoying on songs such as these to create a bit of a grating attention-grabbing effect overall the whole thing sounds like that really good old zebra cat single from 2012 i'ma read if it sucked at number three on our list is the 93 punks vic mensa and travis barker collaboration three years sober you know Kid Cudi at one point you could say had one of the worst attempts at making a rock crossover in the hip hop world and then it was logic with supermarket and then vic mensa said no no i'm not gonna let it go down like that i'm not gonna be the person who is sitting this competition out this decade i'm going to make an even worse rap to rock crossover in this decade and that is this 93 Punk's record that he drew up and in this song from it is one of the lead tracks one of the lead singles one of the cringy astrak-- songs i've heard all year with vince kind of singing and yelling about i guess going from drugs to kale and the masturbation is in there in the mix for some reason the whole thing just seems like it's coming from a really ugly place of insecurity and i have a hard time listening to it because of that and the more I talk about this track the more I feel like I'm getting PTSD just thinking about the last time that I heard is so I think I'm just gonna move on to number two at number two though we have a track that I have an even harder time listening to and that is VIN J's mumble rapper versus lyricist many of you may not know who VIN Jay is and that's fine it's not like he's a rapper on Def Jam or anything like that he is a dude who has a passion for spittin those fast fiery flows and he doesn't so much like the Klout rap he doesn't so much like the auto-tune stuff he doesn't so much like the the some of the triplet flows I imagine he doesn't like the current date is like the mumble rap and he came together with a concept song a preachy annoying obnoxious concept song where he is rapping from both perspectives of the mumble rapper and the lyrical rapper and they're kind of like you know given their spiels about why it is they feel the way they feel and why it is they operate the way they operate truly and honestly I have not been able to listen to this song all the way through in one sitting I don't think I've heard the entire thing in bits and pieces but that's because every time I hear it I have to just shut it off because I can only take it maybe 30 or 40 seconds at a time before I just want to rip my head off as the dialogue between these two individuals is annoying and tedious and pointless VIN Jay seems I guess completely oblivious to the fact that what he's doing is just as much a stereotype if not more than the mumble rapper because the idea of there being this white lyrical Savior in the hip fear is gonna bring it back to the realness he's got those real lyrics has been a trope since the days of mmm I mean mumble rap is only a recent phenomenon which will die out in time and be replaced by something else and whatever that something is will most likely be wrapped at angrily by white guys who think that we need to go back to some imagined glory in the past basically make rap great again and that narrative unfortunately will continue enduring like a fucking cockroach and the number one song number one worst song of 2019 in my opinion it has to be little Dickies earth yeah this track sucks not only lyrically and aesthetically and instrumentally does this song just sound like trash it is a cheap stupid novelty song from a guy who spent his last full-length record trying to convince us for a pretty long span of time that he's to be taken seriously and he's talented and he's this and he's that and he's being underrated he's the underdog and then he comes out with this and it's one of the worst things I've ever heard in my life it's a really crappy multi celebrity appearance song where we're singing about just being various animals and then relating that to a general nondescript love of the earth now some might see placing this song at this point on this list as a little cynical or even a little mean because hey you know what the songs for charity it's for a good cause however I would argue that it even kind of fails on that front - truth be told I don't have all the information and the stats on the breakdown of every single thing that has been done for the environment in the wake of this song as as far as things related to this song but going on the website attached to this track doesn't really give you much more information especially as you watch the videos as to what we could be doing better especially the energy video featuring little Dickie which doesn't really educate anyone on the issue as to how we are currently destroying our environment little Dickies solutions and I imagine this probably also applies to the funds being accrued from this track - are just not really all that pointed or focused in any way whatsoever he's just kind of like vote for people who like the environment and that's it it's like he wanted to start some kind of earth charity or earth benefit some kind of environmental something but didn't want to be bothered to do any of the research and then just grabbed a bunch of celebrities to hop on the song and just give it a cheque of approval in the most I guess effortless way possible I guess I hope and I pray that someone who's not on a camera or a microphone somewhere related to this is you know making some good decisions behind the scenes so this actually does some kind of good for the world and I think we can leave it at that this has been the worst songs of 2019 they're there they're not good a transition that has been my worst singles video have you given any of these songs a listen if you have I'm sorry I apologize over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana worst singles of 2019 forever 
yfCgjZ2_4TE,oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah let's bleep hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another list as it is list week this quick little list over here is my list of the 15 best EPS of 2019 to zero one nine 15 best top list ba-bam yes they're here at the bottom of the list but do not write them off the Japanese math rock band Treecko with their repeat EP yes I know I missed their debut much earlier in the decade that's actually a pretty great but give this EP a shot give it a try there's some pretty songs on here it's not as explosive or as aggressive as some of their best stuff from their debut or their follow-up but still Treecko continues to prove why they are one of the most exciting bands out of Japan in the math rock genre right now at 14 we have Oliver trees very fun do you feel me EP loving seeing Oliver drop some bangers drop some hits drop some interesting fusions of pop and acoustic music and I guess a hip hop he does a little bit of everything but I want to hear in all of our tree album for the love of God I want to hear this man improve and mature musically and artistically I love the visuals I love the music videos I love the memes but I want to hear a little bit more on the music end on the music end of things so my mouths watering I'm excited a lot of the material on this thing is good let's hear it let's have it let's do it mr. tree at 13 is a band that I was unaware of up until this year and that is chat pile who dropped two EPs this year they are pretty much a a noise rock band a very savage noise rock band and and these EPS both had very distinct flavors one EP has a set of tracks that are a bit more noisy chaotic sludgy heavy the other EP that I'm not sure I prefer but still it's it's Miraval and does have some great moments on it is a lot more post-punk influence now both records are firmly planted in the noise rock genre but slightly different vocal deliveries on both records slightly different intensities on both records but still two very enjoyable eps from one single band that I mean if they keep dropping tracks like this why not next year the year after a full album or something you know so hopefully chap pile does not slip through the cracks immediately after this and they continue dropping music they continue making noise they continue raising hell and and and I don't want to to miss that I don't want to miss that hell the hell that is raised at twelve we have a disgusting I'll just blast it out amazingly nasty EP of death metal from the band undeath sentient autolysis is that how one says this either way the vocals the drums and the riffs on this thing are so fat and claustrophobic it's like I'm being sucked into a black hole and then just squished and compressed and so I pop that is truly the quality of the instrumentation on this project I like that quality I think it makes listening to this exciting compositionally I can't say it's the most original death metal record under the Sun or anything like that but it is like a head and bone crushing experience and just want to hear more from the band especially since you know the performance is on here are pretty good they are pretty nasty they are pretty raw at number eleven we have black dresses with dreams come true 2019 I do like black dresses very unique fun and somewhat eccentric fusion of industrial music goth music a bit of hip-hop in there too they came out with a pretty rough and wild full-length project last year and what this 2019 EP sees is the duo taking songs from that record and I guess cleaning them up a little bit making them punchier making them a little less sloppy just reinventing them a little bit and maybe showing us what black dress is sonically we'll have coming down the pipe having said that I'm looking forward to hearing what black dresses can do with their music in the next year or so at number 10 it is the comet is coming with the afterlife if you guys have been paying attention to my favorite albums of the year my loved list so far you know this is a great uk-based jazz fusion group who also came out with an album earlier this year the afterlife essentially seems like a long somewhat seamless afterthought to that project and while it's not as bold or as toned I do like how all of the sounds here in jams and weird psychedelic extended interludes come together at number 9 kilo Kish Redux which is a pretty surprising placement for me because I have not really been a fan of much of anything kilo Kish is done up until this point throughout the decade thought her debut record was kind of forgettable thought her breakout mixtape was too cloudy and hazy and bland I'm not really all that crazy about when I hear a kilo Kish feature but this new EP features a total genre pivot for her where she's going into more of an electro-pop direction not so much a sleepy alternative R&B or cloud wrap type of thing this is a lot louder bolder more unapologetic I'm not gonna say she's one of the strongest singers on the planet but the vocals are a lot less faint now and the instrumental choices are off-the-wall the instrumentals on this thing are nuts it's electro pop but kind of aggressive and there are some subtle trap production notes picked up here and there it's pretty direct the tunes are solidly structured as well it's a really good EP I hope kilo Kish can continue with this sound into the immediate future and just push it further and see where it goes at number 8 we have poppy with choke who toys with a few different sounds here but in a way goes back to that heavy-metal influence style that she is going to be going full-throttle with on her next full-length album in 2020 I am mostly hunkered down here waiting for that even though this may just be teasing towards something and it may not be as long or as satisfying as her last length record give it a listen give it a shot it's still a good batch of tracks at number 7 we have tonight with 2 the duo is finally back years and years and years later with a slightly revamped take on the banger giving it a more deconstructed and experimental approach Lim Kim with generation at number 6 is one of the most exciting artists out of Korea right now there are some amazing fusions of hip-hop and industrial music and Korean folk music on this thing that are bold that are loud that are in your face almost punk rock in a way I hope this EP is also the shape of things to come at number five I want to give a shout out to street sex who came out with follow-ups to their gentrification 1 & 2 EPS with their gentrification 3 & 4 EPS the duo is back to delivering their uniquely manic abrasive and harrowing blend of electro industrial music synth-pop music post-punk noise rock the four tracks presented on these EPS are a shock to the system at number four I want to give a shout out to squid with their Town Center EP who with this very short collection of songs have proven themselves to be one of the most exciting dynamic mature and talented new post-punk bands out there dropping songs that not only celebrate the eccentric and groovy and fun qualities that the genre is known for but also having the guts to not just play into some nostalgic expectation based on the style of music they're playing within as there are some real instrumental ambitions and initiative on this EP - this is far from basic blueprint post-punk it's not just some Joy Division ripoff it's got me going I'm excited at number three I want to give a shout out to Daniel Smith aka caribou aka Daphne with this awesome funky groovy sizzling EP electronic beats house grooves disco edits all these sounds coming together for a pretty danceable and fun and linear set of songs at number two I want to give a shout out to the experimental delek post punk outfit gorilla toss for there what would the odd do EP it's a little more chaotic and lo-fi than a lot of the material off of their last album but still sees them pushing things into an even more experimental and psych direction than a lot of the material on their last LP so I'm pretty psyched to hear what they're going to drum up in the future on that front now that they have taken a turn for the trippy with their latest material and finally my favorite EP of the year the more I think about it due to its wonderful songs amazing environmental and socially charged themes and concepts the way that the band has pivoted genre wise once again and comes through with some great material it is kero kero benito with the civilization 1 EP I am pretty psyched to see where this EP is going to lead to another EP a series an album down the road that also expands on these very same ideas and sounds and themes either way whether this is a taste of what's to come or an isolated incident in the kero kero bonito discography these tracks are great this is not the dance music or the j-pop of the band's debut album or even the noise pop and twee music of the follow-up time in place this is more of an indie pop more of a synth pop experience and the band is still sounding incredibly creative and interesting in this field too even though the songs instrumentally may sound a little light on the ears the lyrical themes are pretty heavy and dark apocalyptic in a way certainly not ideas and attitudes that are usually expressed within the genres but Caracara veneto find a way to work them and well so yeah kero kero bonito civilization one EP of the year and again just because the other EPS did not make it to number one do not miss out on them - if you were unfamiliar with them and I will see you guys in the next video make sure down in the comments you let me know what your favorite EPS of the year were - transition have you given these EPS a listen did you love them did you hate him what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the Bellas well over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the link to

Ml0GPxwZtw8,
jKw0RVvH94A,"hi everyone Boris Johnson why here the Internet's busiest music and it's time for a review of the the new Harry Styles album fine line this is a new full-length album from singer/songwriter One Direction member mr. Harry Styles following up his 2017 debut and I will say despite not being crazy about that record so far as One Direction members going solo are concerned harry has shown the most potential as Zayn and Liam as well as Niall have all put out their own solo works I haven't got the same sense that they have artistic abilities and tastes that extend as far as Harry's don't you forget about my boy Lewis though he's gonna put out the best album next year ten out of ten 20 out of 20 Louis Louis Louis Louis well while Harry has put out the best solo work so far I still think there is a lot of room to grow artistically as well as just just defining Harry's musical style and voice but honestly with fine line I feel like we are not really any closer to that as yet again Harry serves up another batch of inconsistent tracks even nondescript songs that hop around from blue-eyed soul to sad boy Foulke some 70s rock some contemporary pop - there is a bit of a vintage Flair that runs throughout much of the record but I wouldn't say Harry even leans on that heavily enough for it to be a central idea or concept of the album essentially we've gone from one direction to pretty much no direction the indecisiveness of this record begins right away with the opening track which features some subtly swaggered vocals some driving drums and bass it sounds like something off of a Strokes record but then it slightly enhanced with these bright shots of vocal harmonies these DDD's it sounds like something out of a grizzly bear song or a slick piece of pop or soft rock out of the 70s maybe even little Eagles ish the song at the core of doll is absolutely boring although it's hard to tell because Harry does so little to sell the damn thing vocally the mix totally sucks too the drums sound like they're behind a wall the group vocals overpower everything else harry has such little vocal presence on the track the acoustic guitar that's in there very quietly is so faint it might as well just not even be there I was pretty bored by watermelon sugar as a single and I can't say I'm much more into it now that I'm hearing it on the album it feels like another groovy pop throwback but yet again Harry doesn't really sell the track vocally and this is the type of instrumental a top-notch soul singer or even Freddie Mercury would have murdered back in the day but Harry's performance here is just middle-of-the-road not interesting at all I can't say the lyrics are all that profound either as Harry is mostly singing about comparing love or intimacy to the euphoria of the sweetness of fruit whoa comparing like love and sex to two fruit that's never happened before the song adore you next is a step toward the nondescript I can't say I get the appeal of the song as a single does it not just sound like a Marine v song I mean sure maybe maroon 5 would not be the first band to employ the synth bass that this track has but the drums the groove the singing the overly slick production it all just sounds something like Adam Levine and the gang would do but with a few more 80s nods it's very so what I like the song lights up as a single with its very moody take on blue-eyed soul with its bright shots of group vocals but the more I listen to it the more I feel like the structure of this track is kind of malformed the verses don't pop as much as they could the choruses don't pop as much as they could all because the progression of the track just feels a bit muddy also if you strip the song back of all these showy vintage bits of instrumentation I can't help but feel like the song itself would be incredibly boring but not nearly as boring as the song cherry which actually is pretty stripped back and acoustic and it may just be candidate for worst song on the record for one it is way too early in the tracklist to start putting out songs like this this quiet finger picked acoustic ballad with vocals that are so subdued they sound nearly comatose not to mention that for whatever reason the vocals on this track sound way more anonymous than any other vocal on the rest of the record I could not pick this out as Harry Styles do save my life on top of it the whole thing sounds like Peter Gabriel's Solsbury Hill but on xanax and completely stripped of any likeable qualities thankfully there are some highlights that come around the halfway point though like the song falling it's a somber piano tune where the vocals are actually legitimately impressive especially when Harry hits that one very loud and very high note in the second half of the track the singing is great and shines despite how basic and plain the piano instrumental is certainly a powerful and emotional moment on the record even if the lyrics aren't the deepest in the world to be so lonely though isn't nearly as gratifying mostly because I feel like the song doesn't really live up to the title or the sentiment of the track with it's flirty acoustics an island inspired groove the whole thing sounds like sociably dancing the night away with a bunch of drunk boomers on a beach resort if this thing is lonely its Jimmy Buffett or Vampire Weekend lonely it's not Conor Oberst or Elliott Smith lonely the song she though is a transition into a fusion of very dramatic 70s rock and soul with these extended kind of demented buzzing screaming guitar solo passages at the finish that sound like something Jack White would just freak out over but the whole thing sounds like a kind of gentrified version of a sad sad soul anthem out of the 60s or the 70s think something like James Brown it's a man's man's man's world still the track gets hard a lot harder than most of the songs here even if most of the appeal I think comes down to the instrumental also the bright vocal shots of Shay the unexpected stylistic twists and turns continue on to the track sunflower vol 6 which sounds like what you would get if you forced of Montreal and Vampire Weekend to write a bit of a reggae inspired hit that was meant to rule the radio waves in the 2000s because of the unlikely mix of sounds and hooky melody is it's certainly one of the better tracks here the record does not pick up from here though unfortunately the vintage folk pop ripoff Canyon moon just sounds like a bad bit of Paul Simon runoff also the grading and silly group vocals on treat people with kindness which come off as very unselfish yeah they're tough to stomach the closing track on this thing the title track sounds like a bad read on some falsetto vocals and acoustic chords from a boney vert record and then a big Sufjan Stevens sized instrumental finish most likely there are two dudes right now in a college dorm somewhere having this conversation it would be so epic if boney vert and Suzanne collabs well this is certainly what it would sound like if it were bad with Harry's very weak falsettos way too much reverb a boring set of chords this song goes absolutely nowhere fast and then the big instrumental finish basically feels like not just putting lipstick on a pig but also a pair of Chanel pumps and $1,000 dress overall I'm not very crazy about this record it does have some highlights but for every highlight there is also a pretty crummy track too majority of the other songs are just merely tolerable I'm pretty indifferent to the whole thing although I can't say I will go into another Harry Styles album after this with nearly as much hope I'm feeling a light to decent five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

GLyTw0trKM0,uh hi everyone here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new glass Beach record the first glass beach album this thing is out now via run for cover records and admittedly I am kind of late to the party whoa party I put the record off again and again and again as I was covering other stuff throughout the year and maybe I shouldn't have but I was being constantly reminded by fans that this album was something special and even though I didn't review the record up until now I had listened to it here and there throughout the year and I was pretty impressed initially with the diverse array of influences going into the tracklist this LP not only serves up a pretty rowdy mix of power pop and emo but the songs here also incorporate elements of jazz indie tronic music neo psyche the chord progression and peppy pacing of the track bedroom community sounds like something out of a cutesy anime theme song with a constantly shape-shifting tracklist the first glass beach album is a lot to take in at 15 tracks in one hour not only is there a lot of stylistic diversity across the record but also some of the songs on here kind of intricate complex or a bit long-winded working in multiple phases the band really has a drive to produce these rock songs that are energetic but also sound like these miniature punky orchestras and even though the execution on this thing is wild it's a little loose the end result is still pretty grand and exhilarating like the track neon glow which is a very noisy piece of power pop elevated by these tight twinkly melodies that pop in every few bars or so it's aggressive but also intricate and kind of fun also the transition after the halfway point of the song where we start getting some jangly sad horn backed instrumentation and the amazing finale the build-up that it tops things off with that's a pretty incredible moment - there's also the intro track classic Jade eyes which has a very quiet spotlit vocal and piano intro that's kind of theatrical it sounds like a sad sad show tune or like something that would kick off an epic rock operas such as MC ARS Black Parade but then the gentle synth leads and groovy bass that the song transitions into pretty quickly after the intro that sounds like something that is a little J pop inspired actually and with the dreary horn passages that come after along with the punky finale the track just gets better and better meanwhile the song Glass Beach kicks off like a fiery emo rager it sounds straight out of the 2000s vocally it's just letting it all out emotionally speaking I loved the filthiest hell drums on this track the kind of angular geometric synth lines the melody work on the track it's more and more skilled as the track progresses along these extended chord progressions it's beautiful it's anthemic it's electrifying these tracks are just a few examples of the multi-genre impressive progressive dynamic highlights on most of this record and given the level of attention to detail on individual songs here of course there is a lot of attention to how all of these songs are flowing together on the entire album - for the most part the tracklist on this thing is sequenced really really well across the album there are nice transitions from multi-phased epics to beaming anthems to ambient palate cleansers I'd also like to quickly mention the lyrics on this LP - which mind you aren't bad but I think that depends on your point of view just reading the lyrics aloud out of context one might classify them as just being boring annoying emote right I get how some people might have a cynical reaction when reading lyrics like but when we're with all our friends can we just pretend that no one can hurt us because hey I love you okay it's so hard to say that I fucking need you to but I think the record overall is pretty self-aware in how over-the-top it is emotionally and compositionally especially since on the compositional end the band goes to such lengths to in a way overdo it in that sense I think the vocals fit the album very well because everything on the record feels so dramatic and theatrical as if every song or musical phase of the record is a different scene of some sort my biggest issue with this LP aside from a few of the interludes feeling a little too off the beat path a little too unrelated to everything else going on not really landing as a result of that my big biggest issue here is that the record in my opinion does not really stick the landing as things start to turn downward in my opinion around areum there's something I should say about the record generally before I get too deep into this track and that's the vocals in my opinion are the Achilles heel of the record maybe one of my least favorite things about the record yeah they're kind of grating they are unapologetically whiny but ultimately they're not as skilled as everything else going into the project and to me that feels a bit off-putting however in the context of what the band is doing instrumentally what they are trying to message to their audience as well the mix of genres going into this thing 90% of the time or more the vocals work not on this track though because glass beach decides to feed the singing through some kind of obnoxious vocoder I really don't know but it makes the singing truly intolerable to me especially once it starts getting more aggressive I just can't stand it it's excruciating I scramble to skip this track every time the track soft is okay I guess but the interstitial tracks here really don't land when they are shouldered between songs that are more core to the record but simultaneously not all that great which brings me to Yoshi's Island which is maybe the least gratifying of the longer songs here at this point it just feels like the band is dragging the record out unnecessarily I mean stylistically it doesn't really bring all that much to the table outside of a vaguely tropical vibe coming out of the chords overall I think the tracklist would have felt a lot less flabby without this one orchids though is a pretty decent closer the Soaring sad and heavy vocals and instrumentation presented here feel a lot like Andrew Jackson jihads knife man the closing track to that record the big epic finale not quite as big here by comparison but still pretty hard-hitting and in certainly a passionate moment on the record that ties things up pretty nicely so overall there are some interludes here that are just okay the ending drags on a little bit there are a few glaringly bad ideas but for the most part the first glass beach album is a very good record and impressive debut that has me excited to see where the band is going to go next what they're going to sound like once they start getting even more ambitious and start smoothing out some of the rougher edges that they've presented here as this thing is easily one of the most versatile dynamic and varied incredibly creative records in the fields of emo and power pop that I've heard this decade I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you could check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music glass beach forever

VyzhfhARDr0,uh this new xxx tent ah see own album it's not good bad vibes forever the the new posthumous album from xxx fantasy Onan yes it's not very good and it feels weird saying that because I feel like it not being good has very little to do with the artist the album is named after because bad vibes forever is yet another example in the music industry of an artist's name and legacy being grossly exploited posthumously with an album that is theirs in name and in name only and look not that I'm against the idea of posthumous albums in general I'm very clearly not I mean just earlier this year I loved an album of prints demos but the works on that album as much as maybe if prints were still here he would have disagreed with the idea of putting those demos out the works on that record were still very much undeniably his whereas much of what I'm hearing on this new project over here feels more like weird extras odds and ends left over hooks or random vocal ideas repeated and strung out into a sound like choruses placed against production that they may have had nothing to do with originally and then coupled with features that just seem like they're meant to I don't know caused a stir get people talking get people clicking over onto this album because hey Wayne is on here hey Rick Ross is on here oh my god did you hear there's a blink 182 feature I mean sure there are some collaborations and some features here that certainly make sense the Joey badass feature makes sense given that him and X had worked in the past and the Kemba feature on the same track featuring Joey is actually amazing maybe the best feature on the entire record also having Craig Zen given how edgy some of ex's work used to be in the past is pretty fitting as well but in what way in and what reality does it make sense to have Noah Cyrus on this project and to mention it once again in what way in and what reality does rick ross on this project makes sense like i don't know they're both from florida is that it is that literally all they had in common i mean look there's some tracks on this project that kind of sound like a semi complete ex song but it's so painfully clear that if it weren't for the features that if it weren't for the producers basically filling in all the gaps filling in all the holes that we would have a fraction of the material that we do on this hour-long album their tracks on this thing we're literally the only place where ex's voices is on the hook and it's just a vocal line and it's repeated over and over and then it's the featured artists just rapping the verses on the cut it's barely an ex song it's not even an ex song it just sounds like another person's song but with ex as the feature plus their tracks and vocal takes on this thing that should it should have never seen the light of day like the dancehall tracks on this thing are bad not only that but ex's vocal performances on these tracks seem almost tongue-in-cheek in a way also sometimes the production on this thing isn't even really all that flattering either whether or not it was originally attached to the vocal that ex had laid down to begin with heart-eater i think is a prime example of that the guitar solo on this track is trash i can't tell if the drums and the additional guitars on the cut are just like add-ons or if they were originally meant to line up with the acoustic guitars and vocals that ex had laid down first it just sounds like a total mess and so does the blink-182 appearance on this thing too I'm actually kind of surprised that mark and Travis would be down to do this it's just kind of shocking how ready everyone is to actively take part in just squeezing whatever clout or juice they can possibly get out of exes memory on this project because nobody here can really be convinced like they're making genuinely good music with what X had and left over right I just don't get it how is taking some vocal snippet of a late artist and extending that out over a beat to the point where I guess you get something repetitive something is seeming like a hook some semblance of a chorus and then having some featured artists that that person didn't really have that much of a connection to while they were alive and just having that person wrapped to fill out the rest of the track how is that really a celebration of that artists memory and while yeah tracks like X pitch and some of the more emo folk driven tracks on the record that sound like they could have been on 17 they're not so much my thing but still I would take these moments any day over what feels like an assembly line of producers and features being tacked on to a bunch of odds and ends that are just left over in the X of all not too long ago I gave another very negative opinion of another posthumous X album skins and my issue with that record generally is that it felt very under written very low five very rough around the edges very raw like there wasn't really anything that was all to complete about it and while I didn't really care for that music being released in the way that it did because it just felt really um I don't know just not finished certainly not anything I think should be getting put out there and categorized as an album either way it's actually easier to appreciate that project because at least it feels like an intimate expression of a real idea that X had on bad vibes forever I feel like what we're getting is just leftover X pieces and sounds and those are just being brought to a chop shop and assembled into a new car or something and while that's not true of every single track on this project it happens often enough to the point where it's difficult to enjoy much of any of it this new xx extant aussi own record it's not good you 
xF2BvFkMieA,hi everyone wrist the knee popped you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of Griselda's WWC d this is the highly anticipated joint album from the main brains over at Griselda Records Westside gun Benny the butcher Conway three of the hottest artists right now coming out of Buffalo New York essentially putting the city on the hiphop map in the past couple of years a lot of the Griselda hype has been building up to this point this collaborative effort out now and Shady Records and even though it's here it still feels unreal not just because of Griselda's meteoric rise to industry credibility but also the independence and artistic freedom they've been able to maintain while gaining so much popularity it's rare you have artists who are connected to jay-z connected to Eminem and yet they are still putting out records and mixtapes on their own label at their own prolific pace in the grander scheme of Griselda's plan as essential as this project may be it seems more like a bit of a detour as the end goal still seems to be to build Griselda's brand up from the ground up and own it all the way and even though in the past while I have been a little underwhelmed by solo west side projects and solo beni projects I'm hoping that hopping on tracks together will be a surefire formula for keeping things from feeling one-dimensional also exciting to hear these guys work exclusively with derringer and beat butcha for the entirety of this project and rumor has it that they used absolutely no samples on this project no samples all original music so WW CD is 12 tracks and a remix of the conway song bang featuring Eminem at the very end and even though Griselda doesn't exceed my expectations on this project ww CD still shapes up to be everything I hoped an album from these guys coming together would be this thing features a pretty tight 46 minute run no tracklist fillers no weird one-minute bridges to nowhere no poor excuses for beats no structuralist verses that just drag on forever and there's a pretty exciting chemistry between these three guys that undeniable they bring out the best in each other creating something more versatile than the respective Griselda solo efforts over the past year or so but again my major issue with this project is that it does not exceed my expectations all these voices and ideas coming together it's just not greater than the sum of its parts I mean sure Benny and Conway and Westside all reinforce each other pretty well it's like the effect of taking one line of coke and then another line of coke and then a third line of coke they're certainly not a trio sounding heavier on the scale than they are right now but it's not like because they've gotten together on a record all of a sudden they're top-notch storytellers with the most vivid narratives and wordplay this thing is not an only built 4 Cuban Linx it's not even a hell hath no fury lyrically I would say each member of Grizelda is still delivering pretty surface level drug and gun talk sure their dedication to these topics feels a lot realer than when most rappers will just casually mention them and it feels borderline cinematic to when these guys land on a particularly eerie beat like the tuna progression quietly wailing away in the background of chef dreads it makes it sound like something bad is gonna happen or with the track Scotties which features these wobbly detuned chords that sound like something off of a Halloween effects tape or with city on the map featuring these lightly droning bass notes icy elongated piano chords sounds like something out of a creepy detective show soundtrack so with instrumentals like these combined with Conway bars like so if it's smoked Wayne even askin we just pull it up and somebody gonna see a casket it's grittiness you can cut with the knife there are some other strong and potent emotions on this project too that are worth pointing out like with West Side's very focused verse on Freddie hot spot where he goes at length about a murder attempt and feeling very paranoid the heart pumping intensity of having a brush with death hits pretty hard on this one but still moments that are this topical and this narrative are pretty rare on WWC d sometimes the most you can hope for on this one is a great be gruff rapping and a handful of quotables to rise up out of the piles upon piles of coke like on this fantastic set of bars from Benny or on the track chef dreads which is maybe the most lyrical slugfest on the entire project with Conway and Benny and Westside constantly switching off bars between each other there are some equally awesome trade-offs in the first portion of the track Scotty's - and while all these guys do have their moments on this project I will say there is a pretty apparent talent gap within Griselda Benny the butcher is easily the most lyrical technical and methodical rapper of the trio meanwhile Westside makes up for most of his technical and lyrical shortcomings by just having a very standout voice and delivery though it's pretty hard to ignore when he obviously runs out of ideas like toward the tail end of cruiserweight Kok where it feels less like he's rapping and more like he's just making random idle threats that the song really could have done without there are a few tracks in the tracklist here that maybe feel a bit redundant maybe not as potent especially Mosel and my only other major issue with WW CD has to be the features some of which don't even really complement the record like novel at the very end of the seven-minute long old groove his appearance coincides with this really random weird jazzy beats which his delivery is much more bright and soulful than anything else on the record it just sticks out awkwardly also the Eminem feature at the very end is annoying as hell I mean look I give Grizelda credit for putting it at the very finish because most Rahzel the fans are not trying to hear that the best appearance on this thing easily is again actually 50 cent and while I think it's great that 50 sounds more cold-blooded here than he has in years when 50 is your best guest on your project you know you're kind of starting from a low bar look overall I think WW CD is pretty good there are a number of ways which it could have been better but this thing was very much still worth the hype it's also good to not just see the lion's share of this genres attention going to guys like Pusha T and Freddie Gibbs I can also see why guys like Ray Kwan see Griselda in a way as a bit of a spiritual successor to a lot of his work back in the day because in a way it is I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this one transition have you in this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should our view next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Grizelda forever

video that I referenced in this video are linked down below so you can check them out there cool cool okay let's do it first off Oh new collaborative track from the chainsmokers it's a generic fusion of electronic dance music and pop with no soul whatsoever not distinct at all bland and boring forget about it moving out from their new super unseasoned Christmas song from Taylor Swift Christmas tree farm she comes from a Christmas tree farm that's sort of the origin and the track and everything however it does not make this incredibly boring Christmas song one of the most boring Christmas songs I've heard in my entire life any more likable we also have a new track from of Montreal where Kevin Barnes for whatever reason continues down this weird eighties New Wave obsession he seems to have with this new of Montreal material I will say this track seems a little bit more psychedelic and experimental than the last one but aesthetically it's still pretty bad and I don't see what Kevin artistically really brings to the whole new wave thing we also have a new track from holyfuck which sounds like a very bad half-assed remix of some awful forgettable like psych pop or psych rock band it also features the singer of the band pond and it's just sort of mind-blowing that this is the same group that came out with that amazing self-titled years and years and years ago and now they're just really dropping bland electronic dance music with a sort of boring indie edge to it I guess we also have Halsey who has dropped two tracks this week the track finally beautiful stranger which is a really terrible acoustic cut which basically sounds like I don't know she's having like a an acoustic Lady Gaga type of moment it's a little Taylor Swift ish I suppose as well and that she comes out with the some very odd suga's interlude obviously the the dude from BTS and while I don't mind his vocal performance on the track I feel like you're just dropping an interlude featuring him prior to the release of your album to hype the record up it's it's not even really a complete song it's just an interlude track and it feels like an interlude track so why would you drop an interlude T's toward your album even if it has a member of BTS on it and despite the fact that you helped sort of bring attention to boy with love you like you're just getting the stood out an interlude I mean I hope he's on more of the record would would would hope you get more than an interlude appearance but whatever all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of meth not terrible but certainly worth pointing out the who seemed to be getting ready to put out their first record in about 13 years or so a big boomer energy on this track yes but it's still a pretty solid rock song the title of the track is I don't want to get wise it's not bad give it a try give it a shot if you like the who's classic more raw straightforward rocky British Invasion sort of early era type material you'll probably dig on this track excuse me also the band or rather doctor do a home sick is back with a new track that sounds almost like what you would get if you if you fuse like some animal collective esque neo psychedelia with post-punk and it's not that bad again the homesick the name of the track is Kane there were some aspects of it that I found to be maybe no gelling all that well aesthetically but I still think it's pretty cool combination of sounds and I will be looking forward to more material from these guys dropping on Sub Pop we also have reco nasty coming through with a new track hard is the name of this new one and gotta say wow she is screaming her brains out on this track reco has had better hooks reco has been on better instrumentals I mean the bass on this one is pretty huge but it's a pretty generic trap beat a lot of the beats on the Kenney beats project she had recently were more unique a lot of her metal influenced and infused beats are a lot better than what she has going on here well it does sound a bit more cleaned up than usual and I think it sounds more commercially viable I don't think this is one of her better songs moving on from their pop 1280 a band who we have not heard from in a while maybe some of you have never heard of them at all because my reviews of their stuff on the main channel here have not the sort of garden the most reviews or anything from what I've been able to make out so far from their newest LP they're really going like cold wave they're really going dark wave if you love that punky super moody super ominous type of synth based music you are probably going to like what they have going on with this new LP some of the vocals I found kind of bland some of the tracks I found underwhelming this one goes a bit harder though give it a try give it a shot it's not a sounds for everybody but for those of you who are a bit more goth doubt and synth doubt then the average person boom operator is the name of the track give it a shot we also have Oliver tree who was back with it with a new kind of pop rock jam with a strong acoustic backing he's he's written songs that sound like this before and I don't think this is one of the more unique or catchy tunes that he's been responsible for penning so I don't know I'm pretty on the fence with this track I'm wondering how much versatility is really in mr. trees I guess tool belt because you're kind of painting yourself into a corner on this one in my view I feel like more instrumental diversity and better production moving forward would be the way to go but with this new single I feel like he's almost just painting himself into a corner I don't know moving out from there and Ward has come through with a very I guess pleasant new single it's sweet on the ears migration of souls is the title of it it's dreamy the instrumentation is pillowy and Ward's voices is whispery and as sleepy as ever makes me want to take a nap though it is very pleasant on the ears I wish it was a tad bit bolder not that M word has ever been an in-your-face songwriter but I feel like um it was a bit more to sink your teeth into on on his older stuff but hey you know what are you gonna do write a cappella talk has come through with a brand new track while I am liking that this new song is not as overtly and annoying kind of like I wish that kind of stayed more in that metal lane that they broke onto the scene with Patchett Bron is the name of this new track I hope that's the name that you uh hope that's the way that you would pronounce it rather I'm still feeling like a weird 70s rock vibe coming off of this track with a lot of harmony which is not necessarily a bad thing you know those anthemic melodies is part of what made the band's debut album so fantastic and so amazing but I feel like the further they go along the more they drift from being a hard-edged metal band with some super melodic and catchy qualities and they're just like kind of dulling their teeth it doesn't have as much punch doesn't have as much kick it's just um just feels like a slightly more watered down version of what I miss so severely from their first record so I don't know new new new Colucci Selita while I have always appreciated or at least appreciated since her last full-length album about Cali is that she comes through with an amazing array of influences and sounds on her last full length record cool combinations of styles that are executed incredibly well with some very sensual and sexy and catchy vocals and well I get that this new single over here is is also a reflection of all of those influences going into her stuff there's a bit of Latin pop in here there's a bit of trap music in here I feel like this combination of sounds applied in this way is pretty much part of the course for a lot of commercial music these days and just doesn't really feel like her doesn't feel unique in any way whatsoever the song itself at the core of all of it I think is pretty sleepy though I don't know maybe with better instrumentation and better production it would pop and it would be a bit more I guess compelling but with this very generic washed out light on ears thin and aesthetically bland the fusion of Latin music and trap I just don't see what makes this song so interesting or so special it just kind of falls flat in my ears moving on from there luminous spaces which is a brand new collaborative cut from John Hopkins and Kelly Lee Owens I think there are some admirable qualities of this track however one of them is just not the first few minutes of it which I think feature some ok vocals from miss Owens but the instrumentation in the background is just way too ethereal drags on forever once the beat really gets going on the track it is so gratifying and so exciting but I I just wish that miss Owens had more vocal presence in the portions after like this this intro and I don't know more the track was spent on those beats and on those grooves this first leg is just so-so patience testing and I I don't really see what makes some the weight really worth it once the beat really kicks in it just feels like I'm listening to an entirely different song you know it's not like that intro built up with a musical progression that felt like all that connected to begin with so while there are aspects of this track that I like the intro just really kind of turns me off moving out from there HM Ltd is back with the track Y which is easily the oddest song I've ever heard from them it's kind of like a weird abstract pretty instrumental piece sounds unlike anything I've heard from them so far and it's also connected to this visual Illustrated music video that it's it seems very much tied to I can't imagine too many people enjoying this piece or listening to it without the visuals attached to it so I don't know it kind of seems more like a multimedia venture in a way though HM Ltd has dropped music videos and stuff before this seems almost like they were sound tracking you know like a visual piece or something for the most part I think it's okay you know I guess it's cool they're branching out taking some risks doing some different stuff but this is not really an HM Ltd song I'll be going back to anytime soon I guess also Harry Styles adore you it's a decent pop single I mean I guess the hook kind of pops it's got a pulse but aesthetically and vocally it's a pretty average song from Harry I can't say I'm really looking forward to this new LP in the same way I was his last record not that I was all that crazy about that record once it eventually dropped anyway so I don't know I'm not I'm not really excited for this new Harry sadly we also have Flatbush zombies yes they are back mónica featuring tec-9 instrumentals fine the zombies sound okay on the track but having tec-9 in the mix the sounds about as good as one would assume having tec-9 in the mix would be with a group such as Flatbush zombies I mean I guess it's admirable they were ambitious enough to want to make the crossover happen and I guess in a way it kind of works and that both groups are a little dark edgy creepy in a way but stylistically I just don't see how their rap Styles complement each other and meld all that much I mean once tech comes in he sounds absolutely goofy in the context of a Flatbush zombies song so I just don't get what brings it all together really moving out from there duster is back famed slow core group duster has a new record on the way it's actually dropping on the 13th I believe a letting go is the name of this new track I think it's okay I mean granted I've never been the biggest dust or fan in the world I get their older records they're classic and it's been a long time this is the comeback record and listening to this track it sounds like they haven't really missed a beat you know what I mean it sounds like they have not missed a beat but can't say that that means it's automatically speaking to me or anything but hey hardcore fans of this band and this genre have reason to celebrate comeback album dropping very soon we also have the Chemical Brothers being remixed by the avalanches which is always cause for excitement I suppose I think the beat is not strong enough in the weird vocal snippets kind of overtake the thing a little bit more than I would have wanted it to but still it is literally the avalanches crossing over with The Chemical Brothers here which who doesn't want that we also have Bamburgh coming through with a very very very sleepy single sing me to the street which definitely does not kick and punch and fight in the same way the thief last single did I could see this one the slow burner working a bit more for me in the context of the entire record but it's very slow dramatic spaced-out post-punk with with a somewhat Goffe twist sort of like in this band and in post-punk terms their style to the doors a little bit it's not bad give it a try give it a shot if they're if they're new to you and av tear has a new project on the way he has dropped sort of a two-part track over here red light water show and disc one and they are jeroni and ambient as hell can't say they're doing all that much for me personally but hey if you want to hear a V go in this direction and I know there are people out there who don't want to miss out on a single piece of solo Animal Collective material give it a shot pay attention to it there you all right Algiers has come through with a new track as well the Industrial post-punk soul rock-and-roll outfit known as Algiers one of the most versatile and revolutionary radical bands operating right now void is the name of their new single it's very punky it's very direct there's some aspects of it that really remind me of Dead Kennedys which I think it's great I mean I love Dead Kennedys but but but but but I think compositionally it's a little one-dimensional for them sort of seems to get buying a lot of raw energy though I doubt that that is really kind of one of their strong points that sort of carries one of their songs I mean Algiers at the end of the day musical innovation and songwriting is really kind of the bread and butter there's stuff for me also messaging I don't see how just kind of like breaking things down to the most rudimentary elements and sort of just going full Punk how that really benefits them all that much but hey the song could certainly grow on me once I hear the entire record that's entirely possible just thought it was okay alright let's get into the tracks I thought were the best tracks this week we are flying through this episode I suppose given how many songs have had to go through first off the weekend whoo I also was going to talk about last week had I done a weekly track roundup but I didn't so I'm catching up here we have two songs to talk about here in regards to evil because new record on the way to treat to teasers to singles and I enjoy both of them heartless I did a review of on the Fantana channel I talked about it at length over there I think it is a very solid song super straightforward super catchy enables usual style I was hoping for or wanting a bit more of an aesthetic changeup but still I enjoyed the tune at the core all of it however the other track here blinding lights is that aesthetic change of because this track is kind of new wavy very 80s a bit more linear not quite as sharp or as catchy as heartless in my opinion but still a very enjoyable cut and I think a reason to look forward to the new LP not sure if the entire record is going to sound this 80s most likely not but I guess it was kind of a fun little costume change stylistically for able to play into his new LP moving on from there we have a tame impala posthumous forgiveness gave this track a full-length review on the Fantana channel as well liked it quite a bit thought the lyrics were pretty thoughtful from Kevin and I loved the kind of psychedelic kind of synth a multi-phased instrumental pretty ambitious song and still looking forward to that team Impala record in 2020 all right we have a new track also from the band shopping which initiative is the name of the song and it sounds like some really quality post-punk with some I guess critical and thoughtful lyrics some pretty personality loaded vocals and a a dynamic instrumental give it a shot give it a try very groovy very fun we also have Grimes with a track from her forthcoming LP my name is dark it's kind of a loaf I somewhat gothy rock track with some baby vocals and a lot of atmosphere some some weird disturbing rushes of screams it's pretty colorful it's pretty fun last-minute drags it on for quite a bit in my opinion but I still think it's a solid song and I guess is a one of a few reasons to look forward to Grimes new LP in 2020 caribou has come through with a new single as well very Arthur Russell Russell excuse me a very Arthur Rush Russell Russell Arthur Russell ish is what I'm trying to say here a you and I it's cool fusion of art pop and dance music light on the vocals kind of a colourful groovy linear instrumental diggin it quite a bit and also shout out over here to an artist who I'm just now becoming a familiar with Alice long you cow with some production on this new track over here from Dylan Brady of 100x Fame rich bitch juice is the name it and if you like the absurdity if you like the bangers of 100 gex but you want to hear I guess and even I guess swagger filled braggadocious singer on the track on the cut give it a try give it a shot I'm digging it I'm liking it awesome alright we have track over here also from the professionals which is a pseudonym that two mad lib and oh no function under they have a new track out here titled superhumans featuring Chino XL in Elle's eye which is a pretty weird combination of lyricists but I'll take it given how good the instrumental is and given how good generally the lyricism is across the track dig it dig it dig it try and try to try it and that is the last track in our weekly track round up everybody remember all those songs are linked down below so you can try them for yourself and once more we have our sponsor the ridge link below our patreon turntable lab - and we'll see you in the next one guys we will see you in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup 
IJnUpM5wrIQ,oh hi everyone via theny break tano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a reviewed the new Hannah diamond record reflections pop singer and songwriter Hannah diamond who has been affiliated with the PC music label for as long as many artists on the label have you could say she was one of their biggest voices as their unique approach to hyper futuristic bubblegum bass was a hot commodity earlier in the decade singles like attachment pink in blue every night we're pretty essential not only in establishing a sonic calling card for the label but also a visual aesthetic but despite Hannah's somewhat alien voice and her retro futuristic fashion giving PC music a pretty bold look right out of the gate her career feels almost like it's been treated as an afterthought in the greater PC roster I mean her debut single dropped in 2013 she played a pretty vital role on both PC music compilations and we're now just getting her debut album in 2019 long after the labels most notable artists like Sophie and Eiji cook have evolved past the sounds that originally put PC music on the map it's also kind of weird there are tracks on this project that are a year two three years old at this point whether or not you've been aware of everything that's happened with Hannah diamond up until this point reflections is still 10 tracks and 39 minutes and honestly it's a lot more underwhelming than I thought it would be not only because AG Cooke an easy funds production on this thing is pretty tame either current standards not exactly pushing the envelope in the way they've been known to over the years but there are just so many songs in the tracklist here that are fleeting forgettable and I'm just not sure how Hannah's heavily touched up and manipulated vocals play out long-term like over more than a few tracks at a time while it has given her a unique aesthetic and a particular flare on singles and in small doses the novelty of sounding like auto-tuned voice to text software with an English accent wears off after a while especially when the hooks are bland and the instrumentation is underwhelming I get it's a style I get it's a sound I get it's a vibe but there's got to be a bolder way of employing it than this because as is the vocals the instrumentation just feel one-dimensional leaving multiple tracks here sounding like a total bore the intro song reflections also the track never again the very slowly paced true is outright tedious and may be my least favorite track here and even the song invisible which narrative Lee sounds like one of the most relatable songs of the bunch it's still difficult to get much out of it emotionally because it's sound also the lyrics feel like I'm listening to something that is the result of programming an AI to produce pop songs that lonely teenagers will relate to but obviously not trying to do that from a place of genuine emotion it's more from a predictive algorithm there are a few tracks in the tracklist here they have strong dance beats maybe an experimental edge that I think is pretty cool the song fade away as well as concrete angel whose final moments get pretty glitchy and abrasive but I still wish the vocals had a stronger presence on both of these tracks at the end of the day the singing just sounds like another piece of synthetic ear candy in the mix that has no more presence or importance than anything else there are a couple of gratifying pop anthems in the tracklist here for sure there is the song shy whose main melodies are so freakin sweet they also contrast very well with the incredibly icy cords hanging in the background the whole thing makes me feel like I'm skating across a starry sky in a tight shiny sequin romper and I'm feeling sexy in the whole time I'm buggin really hard meanwhile the song love goes on also a strong pop appeal on this one and it's one of the few moments where Hannah's vocals have a pretty noticeable human touch they don't feel quite as robotic as they do everywhere else and I think this song is the better for it and fade away make-believe the ending tracks to the album while they are nice they're not anything new for Hannah they're years old at this point they don't really stick out in the tracklist because I think there's just not enough variety sonically across the runtime of the record I feel as if their appeal has kind of waned over the years and Hanish be evolved past this sound at this point in doing something bolder and more interesting at the end of the day while I don't hate this record and I think there are a lot of check boxes filled out here that essentially make this a genuine representation of the unique sounds and ideas that PC is putting out there on the pop landscape today I just wish that Hannah and easy fun and AG just pulled out more stops with this record just went all out on this album and tried to make it one of the bigger and more attention-grabbing statements off the PC roster but that just didn't happen instead they mostly played it safe with the sound they established well over five years ago and failed to expand on it in any major way over the course of 10 tracks

jeFLQSy2uFQ,Lala hi everyone Green that he snaked an oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tonight EP two two two this is a brand new EP of music from producer duo Lunas and Hudson Mohawke aka tonight in the earlier half of this decade these guys got together and dropped an EP for the ages a short collection of five tracks that helped bring the burgeoning tide of trap to its knees with zany samples and booming bass and excessive drops okay obviously this EP didn't really bring trap to its knees but there are some songs on it that did catch on pretty wildly I didn't name it my EP of the year even though I do think generally this project is a little underrated and underappreciated I have to specify when I say trap I don't mean any shade of it that would land under the hip-hop umbrella I'm talking about the style of electronic dance music that is inspired by it and that style is still going today but it's not nearly as novel as it was when tonight's debut EP came out and granted while Lunas and HUD MO were far from the first to reinterpret trap music for DJ sets and dance floors the approach they displayed on their debut EP was a lot more colorful and unorthodox than a majority of everything else out there at the time from the incessant vocal samples on higher ground to the pish pish pish percussion bouncing bass and weird bubble sound effects on buggin while there was another single in 2013 HUD Moe and Lunas went back about their business as if this crossover never happened which I guess wasn't hard to do considering this was a collaboration that literally nobody expected ever anyway but now that it's happened I'm desperate for more or at least I was I mean it's seven years after the fact now at one point I just started assuming I would never hear more tonight music but I guess I'm glad they didn't let the rest of the decade play out in complete silence now we have seven more tracks 22 more minutes of material and while I like it I'm afraid fans of the last EP will not necessarily take two this one is hard not only because the musical trend tonight was born out of has trended downward a bit but also because Lunas and Moe have changed the sound of tonight up a little bit too for sure this EP is still very banger focused but the progressions are a bit more abstract this time around sometimes drifting off into these very bare-bones passages or even near silence in the case of first body it's like the duo's embracing these more deconstructed elements that are all the rage in the underground right now which I think it's cool that they're keeping up to date and they're experimenting and staying on the cutting edge but it's not always - the EPS benefit because of this the song first body that I just mentioned hit some pretty significant lulls along its runtime and even though I loved teasers from this thing like serpent for it's whooping manipulated vocals and wild drum circle percussion I know there were fans who are not really all that crazy about how long it took for HUD Moe and Lunas to really get to the meat of the drop on the song and again that's the thing about this EP it's nowhere near as direct as its predecessor and I know there are some people reacting to that as if this EP is bad or somehow significantly worse than the first one but I think what these guys are mostly doing on this project is playing with expectations and just employing some mind games for someone looking for something sweeter and hooky err on this EP I would listen to dollars it's got some playful vocal samples some rotund bass a rumbling B head banging drops and an engaging progression that keeps you on the edge of your seat what is not to like the song club finger true to its name feels like a weird twist on an EDM festival anthem with its thumping kicks and bright laser synthesizers I'm not gonna say the nonsensical vocal samples placed throughout the track aren't obnoxious because they are a little bit but I mess pretty heavily with these synced up synths bass and drums that hit at multiple points of the song it's hyper aggressive and absolutely ridiculous I prefer wonky ER glitch happier numbers on this record though like what it is the vocal samples are a lot more lighthearted the groove feels like something out of an old Neptune's bee I could even see Pharrell doing the weird auto-tune vocal it's placed at a few points of the song the song I'm in a hole toward the end of the EP is a hey it has some cool moments it's still a little underwhelming though with its tiny vocal samples and wash of synthesizers that kind of close up shop but I do think gimme some makes for a pretty bold finish the song is covered with this vocal sample this loud distorted disorienting those contrasts weirdly with these synth intervals that are distant and buzzy and erratic tonight building up these very skeletal passages into even odder grooves where these synths start progressing into these nonsensical melodies it sounds like a tangerine dream synth Odyssey but a lot more sour there are some indescribable II weird passages after this point I love the attitude I love the groove I love that it feels like tonight are basically giving middle fingers in every direction overall I thought this EP was a decent follow-up it's not nearly as adrenaline-pumping as the debut I mean it does go hard for sure that that's undeniable but it's a bit more cerebral it's a bit more about subverting expectations a few duds in the tracklist sure but there are more highlights than there are not also appreciating how most of these tracks flow into each other even the weird giggly skit after the halfway point look at the end of the day I hope we just don't have to wait seven more years for tonight to return with another EP or album but I guess I can sleep more soundly knowing that at anytime these guys can return with a fresh take on the banger I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this one transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana tonight forever

_O0UrJG9J0A,ah hi everyone Anthony sail tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new trippy red mixtape a love letter to you for this is the newest mixtape from rapper and singer trippy red the fourth installment of his a love letter to you series obviously and as far as rapper crooners go I have historically expressed quite a bit of faith in trippy red when it comes to speeding to the head of the pack making an impact on the emote rap genre he certainly seems to be on track with that with this tape set to do a hundred K this week however I've not really been all that excited about the man's recent output especially his new exclamation point record that dropped earlier this year which was easily the most low effort and just thrown together batch of songs the man has put his name on so far I don't know what creatively drove trippy red to this point but it was kind of a shock so much so that it's got me looking skeptically at this 21 track mixtape thinking how much effort did you really put into this very lengthy batch of songs nothing tells me you've put in the forethought to make any of these tracks have a shelf life longer than a year or even six months and do rappers at this point even expect their most hardcore fans to sit through these hour-long 20 track projects I went into this tape hoping that maybe trippy red would go back to basics a little bit given that this is part of an ongoing series that he is pretty well known for and give us a series of songs doing what we know just works emotional numbers trap bangers overly emotional singing sticky melodies catchy flows the opening track on this thing larae is not a very good omen though it sounds like a breakup text set to acoustic guitars loaded with all these fake deep quotables meant to make the other person feel like they're stupid for ending the relationship assuming it's their fault that ended it's not easy to sit through honestly and what's to come after this track is basically a mixed bag of snoozers losers bangers and anthems and tons and tons and tons of features to sum head-turners ynw Mele is on here post his incarceration which is pretty crazy and at the of all for me it sounds like there's this lengthy rambley vocal snippet from xxx tenth Osseo where he's kind of rambling on about his difficulties with I guess just being loved being in a relationship caring too much if you find that mindset sort of relatable even considering the person it's coming from but beyond that the feature list here is a gauntlet of basically whoever is hot at the moment to baby young boy lo mozi juice world which unfortunately I think speaks to a certain disposability when it comes to a lot of newer music which I think we're now just accepting as normal these very short shelf-life records with these feature lists that go in and out of fashion like seasonal wardrobes I will say the first leg of this tape starts off pretty focused though in true trippy red fashion with a lot of heart broken vocals and acoustic guitars and trap beats we have a song about wanting love we have a song about hating and not wanting love on the first leg of this tape trippy sounds more comfortable in this Lane than ever but that is also part of the problem because I think this puts trippy in a place where he is now just painting by the numbers delivering fans merely what they expect not expounding on these feelings or emotions in any way whatsoever granted who needs love does go pretty hard again it is a love rejection anthem with trippy openly embracing his single status the lyrics while they are pretty surface level they do sound like they come from a genuine place not so much the case for lovesick though whose constant references to forgetting what I said just feels like volunteering yourself for gaslighting not to mention the firework samples and the dramatic singing remind me of something off of Drake's first record - the hooks on love me more in real feel are pretty sharp but the verses are completely devoid of anything memorable not to mention the trap beat acoustic guitar combo is growing pretty stale at this point this emo trapped wave I don't even think is five years old and already we're running this instrumental style into the ground thankfully there are some welcome change ups with all the features to follow past this point this ain't that is certainly a highlight with some sparkling guitar peji O's and smooth bass sound tracking what is trippi's most effortlessly catchy hook in a while those saying that for real the saying that for real honestly I don't even mind the mediocre Lowell mozi feature in the second half six kiss by comparison is a much tougher listen though Meli's feature sounds completely tacked on juice worlds miniature versus nothing to write home about and then trippy pulls on some of the weirdest movie references that I think I've heard him drop in a while from Coraline to Megamind and also mentioning Optimus Prime yeah I can do without all that especially since trippy similes here are pretty boring the song ends with little yah T and P airborne sounds like a bad leftover from little yachties last record and on the track all for me smoke purp is so slathered in auto-tune he sounds absolutely ridiculous there are a lot of mediocre less than stupendous moments on this tape honestly I feel like all that's worth mentioning is the handful of highlights that happen past this point we have sickening with Tory Lanez which features some great pianos a little woodwind melodies too easily one of the more elegant moments on the tape trippi's refrains on the track of I don't feel too well a pretty hilarious considering the title of the song and lyrically he constantly references being sick or just sicknesses so I guess in a way it's one of the more focused songs here and then Tory Lanez feature goes a lot harder than I would have expected emotionally speaking so when he pops in it's not a lull or anything like that the Grinch is a very short hyper aggressive banger with more production from Pierre it's one of the wilder songs on here I wish there were more tracks that took this tone definitely would have made for a more fun experience but the moment that we have it is pretty good we have death featuring to baby while it is not one of his better features I've heard this year an appearance from the baby is always a bit of a pick-me-up on a project like this though the very nasty three 6 mafia's sample on this track goes a long way too with the trap beat and the club' synths on the instrumental it's a good vibe we also have bust-out featuring you've d considering the gorgeously melodic since on this track and the wonderful change-up on the chorus this has to be one of the tracks that has the most forethought on this tape because rarely on this project does a hook have this much contrast as a hook pop out this much I wish there were more tracks on this thing that had this level basic structure also you've D kind of one of the better features on the project a French rapper I wasn't aware of up until this point and he's really a breath of fresh air in this tracklist his delivery is pretty tight and his voice has a very distinct quality to it what also popped out was little wop on the jungle book and while I've never really been a huge lil wop fan up until this point his incredibly raspy delivery is cartoonish hilarious he sounds like twenty-one savage with a bronchial infection seriously though his very short appearance at the front end of this song definitely is attention-grabbing lyrically trippy goes at length throughout the rest of the track too definitely one of his more aggressively delivered sets of verses so that's that's a standout to the finish of the tape ends on a somewhat strong note with the acoustic abandoned and the boom bap ish can you rap like me we're trippy shows he can flow with old heads even if his pen game isn't the best now as much as I enjoy these tracks of course they are not enough to carry this hour-long project into a positive score because a majority of the material here is not all that great it's not memorable and all-in-all this project serves as a reminder that this is the current state of the music industry where songwriting barely matters just get a vibe get kind of a hook and a beat that sort of goes and you have a song just get it out there and maybe by some sort of fluke it'll hit at the very worst it'll get some streams on your massively long record and look I don't deny that there are artists out there including trippy red that this formula is working for but the problem is this formula is too easy to replicate and as a result of that you're not really leaving a mark a long lasting mark on your audience and it's going to be easy one day for another person to do exactly what you're doing and just step in your place records like this don't really foster long-term loyalty and you know what I hope I'm wrong about that I hope I'm wrong feeling a decent too strong for on this one transition have you given this tape a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the life you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell is well over next to my head is another video that you

fC94rzgHF3M,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of our y-you know review series where I go over a series of Records that I did not get a chance to review in this month and now I'm going over them in brief gauntlet style in this video just to get my thoughts out there on some projects that I thought were worth mentioning that I thought were worth addressing just couldn't really you know do a full length review on them you know what it is at this point because we do this every month so let's get right into it above am the new Wilco record is not a bad addition to the band's catalogue basically the group comes through with another batch of tracks that are a very melancholic hushed indie folk music that they help make this sound the style what it is today so how could you not admire the band for sticking to their guns in my opinion this one's sadder and dreary er than any other album Wilco has dropped this decade especially in comparison with schmell Co which was a little rough around the edges freewheeling wild sometimes silly for Wilco which I thought it was kind of cool they were letting loose on this record this album is very much going back in the other direction it is very grey it is very dejected some solid tunes on this one here and there but for the most part that sadness that seems to be permeating every corner of this record or at least what feels like sadness it doesn't come off as all that potent I think it's a bit one-dimensional while in one breath I admire this record it's consistency I wish it was just a bit more versatile new record from guitarist and songwriter extraordinaire Santana I was pretty excited to get deeper into it once I heard some clips and a few tracks from it given that it seems like it's it's a return to form honestly to some of the more jazz fusion sounds that Santana was known for back in the day but now he's bringing in some elements of afro funk afro jazz which is great but I can't help but feel as I listen more to this one it just lacks the finesse of Santana's best works from the 70s while I admire the musical fusion that he's going for here and it's definitely the best thing this album has going for it in terms of the rhythms in terms of the guitar solos I just think it could all be a bit tighter when talking about a genre like jazz fusion I happen to feel like tightness as well as incredible chemistry between all the musicians involved is pretty significant and I'm just not hearing it to the extent that I would like to on this record some points of it just feel a little clunky a lot of the group vocals almost feel tacked on not seamlessly woven into the rest of the instrumentation I admire what Santana was trying to do on this record it's certainly a welcome change of pace from his more commercial works over the past decade or so but can't say this this one really did it for me new mayhem record I think is fine I don't really have any major criticisms about it other than it's you know pretty by the numbers a few tracks here and there are especially vicious and standout as a result of that but for the most part it's a pretty meat-and-potatoes black metal release at this point not sure if there's really anything else to add if you are a traditionalist if you just want to hear black metal in its most straightforward form without I guess too low fiber recording give it a shot new omni record networker a relatively new band whose record over here is dropping via sub pop that's how I found out about them that and some of the teaser material from this thing that read as some very herky-jerky angular frenetic somewhat spastic old-school post-punk kind of love that sound and the more I heard omni tried to pursue it the more it felt like they were sort of capturing that old-school aesthetic but the songwriting and the playing where i'm not really anything to write home about while I understand that trying to rekindle this sound requires quite a bit of talent I feel like the band didn't really put much of their own twist on it or go above and beyond to enhance it or anything a handful of good songs on it and if you're just nostalgic for this era of post-punk music give it a try but outside of that I couldn't really find anything else to just throw praise on to with this one the new Jeffrey Lewis and the voltage record which has some pretty decent lowest songs on especially LPS which is an amazing record collectors anthem if you are a vinyl head you will absolutely love some of the stuff that Jeff is saying on this track he is as funny and as clever as ever on at least the first leg of the album then there is an interlude cut where I think kind of I guess marks a change in sound quality because in my opinion a lot of the tunes and the second half are nowhere near as funny or as memorable or as lyrically bold so I don't know to me it's really kind of a tale of two halves one half that I really enjoy the other half that very much pales in comparison and that just is what it is I guess but if you love your punk music with a bit of folk or you love your folk music with a bit of punk and you love very verbose wordy heady songs give Jeffrey Lewis a shot especially if you have no idea who this guy is because he's very much underrated techno technician techno wizard Andy Stott he is back with a new collection of tracks which is being billed as a double EP and the material here is I guess his slowest space east batch of songs yet it's like he's trying to make his little noise and bring his little speed into the equation as possible the experience is definitely unique from any other Andy Star record I would say it's unique in comparison to really most technically a novel idea a cool approach a different angle unexpected but I I'm really not getting that much out of it for me it just sounds underwhelming I wish there was more of a groove or I wish there were more sounds just filling up these empty spaces to make it more of a I guess enveloping more ambient experience the new girlfriend of the year record with its short synthetic abstractions about like TV shows the track about spongebob is hilarious in a way listen this might just be one of the worst albums of the year but there is something about it that makes me wonder if this is like the future of music as we know it Plus how could you not want to try something with this album cover this album covers something Frank Ocean collaborator vegan is that how you pronounce this this artist named vegan I'm assuming so well vegan is a pretty talented and versatile producer can't say after listening to this record though that I'm hearing much in terms of like compositional or songwriting talent I mean that can certainly be honed or more song structures can be brought in to make this collection of songs more impactful but for the most part what I'm hearing here just feels like a loose collection of rough ideas motifs and sketches many of which are really cool but outside of that I'm having a hard time really enjoying or finding more praise for this record because everything while there are some cool ideas thrown out here and there it's all just so fleeting the new wiki record given some of the teaser tracks is one I was very excited to listen to however ended up being disappointed by how uneventful a lot of the deeper cuts on this thing are sad to say it's really the singles that ended up being the most interesting on the album there are some cool beats here in there and he picked some good guests throughout the tracklist too but there are so many moments where I feel like the song writing is just underwhelming we're forgettable wikis flows or verses are just okay kind of standard for him nothing all too new or groundbreaking or I guess exciting I mean if you're the type of person who has to hear everything going on in the New York underground I would say give it a listen but it's it's not gonna stick out to you any more than I think the best stuff the city has to offer every year I get a question or two about the Claypool Lennon delirium and I'm yet to really formally review a project from this duo and I am kind of shocked because I feel like I would be just chomping at the bit to do such a thing because of this meeting of the minds here I mean Sean Lennon and one of my favorite musicians of all time Les Claypool collaborating on an entire record of songs but I'm just yet to hear a project from them that to me feels reflective of their unique talents I feel almost like when they get together on a record they cancel each other out in a way not only that but I feel like vocally Sean Lennon and les claypool obviously they disagree and fans of this project disagree and that's fine but I I just think they're oil and water man I just do not get what exactly these guys do with each other that they either couldn't do separately or they think is so incredible that they they couldn't possibly make it in any other context with anyone else that it must be made I just really must be going over my head or something because I'm yet to hear anything out of this very psych revivalist you know collection of tracks the new one I'm talking about that it really just kind of speaks to me I mean it's a little zany but the songs are subpar in my opinion sometimes it comes off a little grating obnoxious and with Lennon and Claypool constantly switching off there's just so little consistency to the whole thing so I don't know it's cool that they're doing it and they're together and I commend them for sticking with what they're doing here but I just get so little out of it the new floating points album given some of what I heard prior to the release I was pretty psyched to hear it but then ended up being a little underwhelmed by the overall experience as it pretty much just feels like very inoffensive so so IDM kind of groovy kind of linear a few interesting synthetic textures here and there but you know nothing really blown me away hmm Josh hommies the desert sessions is back after quite a while with a short little record with who knows I mean he's working with like just about anybody who will walk into the studio and has a bit of a profile on this record which i think is kind of unique about this project it's a fun cool interesting thing about this project it's amazing that he's able to pull all these sessions together and make what happens happen on you know these desert session records but creatively it's all over the place songwriting wise it's very inconsistent especially like that tweeting song on the back end is like ten shades of terrible and and frankly the more I listen to this the more I'm just wondering where is this wild eccentric fun colorful attitude when it comes to Queens record villains because that album was like one-dimensional as fuck and so sonically gray that it lacked character a character that I think turns up on this record just hope hope I hear it on the next Queens I guess nuke I wished an album producer who I have reviewed on this channel in the past on his chi Whiston bitch record also that new collaborative project with baby and his boy igloo ghost hearing what he's doing on this record I can see why there's a lot of excitement for it I can see why there's a massive amount of hype for it I could see why people are finding it interesting and there are a good handful of songs especially in the first leg that I personally think are great where Kai is drifting away from some of the trap that he's known for infusing some of those elements with more wondrous organic instrumentation it hits hard yet it's also pretty but then there's a point where he diverges from this fusion of styles entirely and just starts trying to reverse-engineer as a solo electronic music producer with some guests here and their experimental rock music post rock music a little bit of I guess art or indie rock as well and I just feel like the results pale in comparison to anything that is so obviously a point of reference and influence for him on this record like I would rather much rather listen to a Godspeed song or and any number of experimental or post rock artists who he's just trying to copy on this essentially it's certainly admirable that he took this risk whit in this direction this certainly seems to be paying off amongst his fans who are very enamored with the project and didn't expect someone of Kai's caliber to drop an album like this I didn't expect him to drop an album like this frankly I think there are few electronic music producers out there who would feel bold enough to do so and I also think it's very cool that this record is reflective of Kai's obviously diverse tastes but does he recreate and embody these sounds in a way where I just enjoy them within the context of this record not really All Things Considered the new blood incantation project is a pretty good death metal record it has a great recording very heavy very brutal very crushing but everything rings through so clear the vocals the guitars the bass the drums really everything sonically and compositionally the band is a bit more progressive than your average death metal group some of the riffs and playing or a bit technical some of the song structures are winding and in really add to the flavor of these tracks and yet they never veer too far away from that classic and morbid sound now is every riff on this record great in my opinion not really and I think the 18 minute closing track is a bit convoluted and could have easily been broken down into a few different parts but still the material on here that is good is very good and I think is worth checking out for any metal fan really even someone who may be just curious about death metal and just looking to get a good example of how the genre sounds and in what its genetic makeup is I have been returning and returning and returning to this new Hot Chip record for months now really because it's it's been out for so long and honestly every time I listen to it it just feels more and more underwhelming less of it really sticks with me I'm just not really sure I mean Hot Chip has has never truly been one of my favorite indie tronic or synth pop bands but I've always thought they had plenty of catchy material throughout their discography and I'm just not finding that to be the case on this new record over here I just thought it was very bland and their most forgettable record yet ition and that is the why you know review for this month all of the projects that I talked about are listed down below over here next to my head is another video that you could

VkMov0H8QRA,hi everyone keeping it together here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Coldplay album everyday life this is a new full-length record from the world famous platinum selling rock band Coldplay they are back with their eighth full-length album it is a two-parter in 16 tracks that somehow comes in under an hour I'm gonna be honest with you this decade for Coldplay creatively I think has been pretty dismal Mylo ghost stories dreams not the band's best stuff and sure there's been a lot of commercial success and versatility and it looks like the band is doing well but the last album Coldplay drop that actually meant anything to me came out in 2008 so I went into this new record really hoping for the band to end things on a high note with this decade which was kind of easy it was easy going into this project with high hopes given the ambitious double album thing given teaser tracks like arabesque a groovy horn backed Jam expressing this sort of humanitarian oneness you could be me I could be you essentially asking the listener to put themselves in the shoes of people who they may fear or hate or think less of and not just this track but this entire record feels like a reaction to the incredibly intense and divisive times that we live in but also it lacks the equipment or maybe even the will to discuss the root causes of war and inequity and poverty and extremism so essentially Coldplay supplants a focus on real world problems and solutions for allusions to friendship a higher power nostalgia and a whole bunch of musical detours that just make this entire record feel like a crapshoot like on cry cry cry a piano back piece of vocal pop with a vintage flare sounds like it's something straight out of the 50s or 60s but now just coming out of an expensive studio today with some chipmunk background vocals that are really awkward doesn't really say much lyrically and the ending totally fizzles out for the most part it just feels like a random detour a total non song hit of Soma to distract from this records lack of core material and the odds and ends in the tracklist here continue especially on the second half a sudden elegant piano piece topped with a Persian poem that arrives after a very weird instrumental transition or the song broken a one-off gospel number complete with chorus of singers and finger snaps some humble piano - while it's on it's okay nothing horrible about it but ultimately it's another detour with a fizzled ending and a lack of reinforcement of everything that's going on around it the song guns that kicks off the second half is a fast and folky number maybe the most gripping and lyrically radical song of the bunch with some references to revolution and how our country politically prioritizes guns the singing and guitar playing on the track are great but the songs brevity leaves it feeling like a footnote amongst all of these bland non statements which the song also is sort of as well even though it's packed with more social commentary than many other tracks here these comments really fail to come together into any sort of focused statement I guess there are also songs here that just feel very off the mark like echo with its really pristine acoustics and its idealization of Africa as if it's just one big country singing about big rivers and African mothers taking this very assuring tone like everything's gonna be alright I'm not really sure about this one I feel like this is what you would get if you made Asura from Vampire Weekend right the most tone-deaf song he could even more tone-deaf is the single orphans which I didn't think too much of at first outside of it just sounding like a very dreamy arena rock ballad Ally u2 with its course about missing your youth and wanting to get drunk with your friends it doesn't seem like too much on the surface but it gets really awkward looking into the lyrics so the verses and the deeper meaning of the song as I guess they're inspired by refugees of the 2018 Damascus bombing in which case why is the danger these people are in their struggle to exist being juxtaposed against this chorus of no I fail to see the parallel here like what is the connection the matically if you just stare at the lyrics there doesn't really seem to be one what does this first world desire to gain your youth just ponder your youth and drink with your friends have to do with like not dying due to the misfortune of being born into a warzone I think it's really frankly stupid to portray their desires as just being like hey I want to know when I can drink with my friends in those moments I think their material needs and desires should be portrayed with a bit more accuracy not just some bomb-ass sing-along party course the band tosses in to make the song appealing for a pop audience and look there are definitely a handful of well-written well-structured and satisfying songs in the tracklist here arabesque champion of the world also trouble in town whose first leg sounds like a very low-key beautiful ballad that could have been on ghost stories but then it transitions into this gorgeous crescendo kicked off with a vocal snippet that sounds pretty Pink Floyd esque but this handful of tracks does not outweigh the immense amount of what sounds like filler on this record I'm sorry but there's no way that Coldplay could dig this record out of the mediocre rut it's in with more electronic classical gospel or whatever kind of detours everyday life is just a very well produced but unfocused album with a pretty incomplete message it's kind of woke on the surface but just as distracting and inconsequential as anything else the mainstream might want in front of your face feeling a light to decent 5 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Coldplay forever 
wsu8XzmeOYg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new have a nice life album sea of worry this is the third full-length LP from dan barrett and tim mokuba's have a nice life a connecticut music project that somehow gained this incredible cult status after the release and slowly snowballing a claim of the 2008 album death consciousness with its 90 minute runtime fusing elements of post-punk with industrial music with drone with goth rock with low fine music shoegaze it's a pretty dark murky and soul-crushing listen with this heavy and raw sense of dread hanging over nearly every minute of the album in a way that was pretty unparalleled in the late 2000s by that virtue alone it's easy to hear why this stood out in the underground in the way that it did also why it's retained so much relevance over the years so since the release of death consciousness have a nice life output has been sporadic sure Tim and especially Dan have stayed busy with their own lives and side projects but the only other have a nice life album we have the speak of is the very good follow-up in 2014 the unnatural world and now see of worry which just dropped this month so given how rare have a nice life albums are and how good the first two records were I went into the third LP with pretty high expectations even if I wasn't all that crazy about the teaser tracks because with have a nice life there's a high probability that on first or even second listen you're gonna miss things because of the typically low fire recording experimental mixing layers of atmosphere and noise but with more and more listens through the seven tracks presented here sadly I found no such magic or even inner workings or details that really turn to this record around for me and in my opinion see of worry is by a mile the most stale and unimaginative project have a nice life has given us yet if there are two things that have really defined the appeal of the first to have a nice life record so far they are some pretty evocative sound play and also a seamless blend of dark experimental music genres that are just pulled together in such a way where it's hard to tell where one influence starts and another begins and it feels like neither of these things show up on see of worry as this record is just so painfully obvious which is made pretty clear by the opening track the title track of the record sea of worry what is this track it's a generic surf rock beat topped with some spooky whaling guitars very washed out and distant lead vocals that have kind of a snotty punkish tone and delivery to them it sounds like the breakout single from a gimmicky goth rock band that dresses like the Beach Boys while they have skeleton masks on or something I don't know the song writing is pretty formulaic the sound play is not all that exciting it's way more surface level than anything I would expect from a have a nice life record and I can't say the lengthier Dracula bells is that much better sure by comparison it's a more noisy abrasive and experimental track that works in numerous parts but very little of these parts land especially in the first section which features a horrendous drumbeat it's a kick snare snare with a rickety-ass hi-hat on every single quarter note the number of drum sets I've ever been behind in my life I can probably count on two hands and I can play this beat and I don't mean that it's a super simple cute little groovy beat that you might get out of a Meg white performance or a mode Tucker performance no it's just really stiff and boring and lifeless the dreary guitar intervals playing over the speed get pretty tedious too sure there's some pretty nice chord and melody change ups on the hook of the track but it's really not enough to save the song and then there's a portion where we suddenly break into this darker heavier more rhythmic and industrial passage with some buzzing bass some twisted lead vocals to cacophonous embellishments of piano and guitar kind of sounds like a paler version of something I might have heard on the new daughter's record and I'd like to say I enjoy the noisy crescendo that the track arrives to at the very end but the icy very synthetic I can't even describe them splashy scent passages that play over this wall of noise horrendous aesthetically they don't compliment anything going on underneath them and the way that they're mixed into the track they really overpower everything in an awkward way the song science B tones things down quite a bit by comparison and is another moment on the record that feels very out of character for have a nice life the track mostly sounds like a very anonymous New Wave demo from decades and decades ago with too much reverb on it we have some rigid and very sparse drums on this thing lightly pulsating bass then some faint tones that are so quiet it's difficult to make out exactly what they are part of the time guitars since the vocals are even more difficult to get a grasp of and I don't just mean lyrically which is typically the case for a have a nice life record but also melodically emotionally if the point of this track is for everything on it to be barely present then I would say mission accomplished now there is a passage in the second half where everything gets a little bit louder the guitars have a lot more presence than they did previously but it's it's really too little too late by this point the tracks grown stale at least for me and the progression it's arrived to is not all that gratifying we then have trespassers w-which kicks off with a guitar riff that shouldn't have been left on whatever Danko Jones or alkaline trio or hives record it was found on because I can't really say this but rocking riff really helps sea of worries case it mostly just sounds like an awkward attempt at being hooky while also failing to appreciate that the songs washed out production and ghostly aesthetic doesn't really do all that much for these forcefully vocals and fist-pumping riffs the song everything we forget is genuinely one of the few mums here that really feels like I have a nice life track that could fit on the two previous records feels like it's in their wheelhouse it's a layered and strange ambient piece that feels pretty massive there's so much going on and there's so much sound bleed happening it's difficult to make out every detail but it's like I'm hearing all of these cycling synthetics set against ghostly chorus vocals and maybe some strings either way it's equal parts gorgeous and unsettling even if at a forum in a runtime the whole thing is a bit breezy the sadly the record doesn't really pick up from here next we get a very sloppy loaf I piece of post-punk the instrumentation never really seems to coalesce into anything all that gripping it mostly just ends up being a noisy mess as the mix of the track just gets more and more distorted it's like a self-serious bass boost meme is it super abrasive yes but is it dynamic or texturally interesting not really it's like if a goth rock band with way too much reverb had about the same recording quality as like that 2009 waves record I assumed the closing track would be a pretty grand finale given its 13 minute runtime but the whole front end is taken up by this audio of what sounds like a television or radio preacher a really boring evangelist type who doesn't really have much to say honestly and don't get me wrong I'm not against the mention of Christianity on a rock record previously I've really enjoyed it especially when post rock bands have included audio of preachers who are really on some fire and brimstone shit but what our friend here is telling us on the tape about the devil and deception and so on and so forth can be heard by just about anybody if you flip on the Christian hour at your local public-access television station the only thing that could make me curious about this audio is if it was revealed that the guy talking is actually Pete Buddha judge and believe it or not there's a few points where their speech patterns are oddly similar once we finally transition into the more musical portion of this track it's okay we get some weary vocal harmonies and glistening pianos and light acoustic guitars I like the fat Dorjee display of instrumentation that comes in after this portion that's a pretty nice transition even if the lead vocals are turned down solo and buried into the mix so deeply it's almost comedic but yeah that's pretty much the end of the album and I gotta say this was rough this was not a very good record from the have a nice life even though it's been 10 years since death consciousness this is not the type of rut I would expect have a nice life to be and not on the third record I'm feeling a strong 32 a light four on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but which rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry at the Bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana have a nice life but forever 
rLCwc_nrimk,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week you know what it is this is what it is okay before I get into all these tracks which are linked down there below as usual want a shout out of course our turntable a blank where you can buy a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on the channel we get kickback from it and supports the channel supports this segment also our patreon page where you can get access to bonus monthly let's argue patreon only let's argue episodes also monthly classic album listen along live stream listening parties we're doing our next one very soon so hit up the page see what we got over there and finally I want to shout out our little charity vinyl compilation that we did or we put out at the end of October it's only really been out a month now this baby is just a month old that we put out with proceeds going toward the immigrant legal Resource Center there's only a few hundred copies of these left so if you really want to get one hit up the link down below but also keep in mind the remaining couple hundred copies that we have left we are going to put them on sale on Black Friday so get them now or wait and see what of them are left and get them then either way get one this week get one when you can and yeah that's it link down below alright let's get into the worst tracks of the week the worst tracks of the week we have a handful first the new partynextdoor track loyal featuring drake is absolutely mind-numbing ly boring alternative R&B i think it is pretty safe to say at this point that being tossed into the ovo stable has very much like prevented partynextdoor from evolving and progressing in any significant way and now what we're getting is just very very stale really really behind the curve at this point and yeah it's just really unexcited frankly moving out from there Marilyn Manson has seen fit to do a cover of the doors the end and it is about as a long winded and is drawn out as one could imagine I guess with Manson just taking a lot of spatial liberties with the track it's it's really just a devoid of anything interesting for its eight-minute run time and I don't ever want to hear it again for the rest of my life moving out from there the new bad bunny track vete I don't know I cannot stand this man's vocalizations unfortunately they just seem so off to my ears he does not to me come off as like a traditionally great singer I know the dude has a lot of heart and have all the respect in the world for him how he sort of put his public image on the line and some of the Puerto Rico protests and kind of going down there and doing his thing down there and showing support and solidarity for for those fighting for a better life and a better government in the country but having said all that I cannot die I cannot get into this song over here as much as much as I do fuck with this man's you know haircut we're on the more on the bald wave but but once more I just cannot really get into this track outside of the the beat goes kind of hard but the singing I just cannot moving out from there a new Kalani track you know us up which really really could use more of a strong melody more of a structure for the most part she just seems to be sing ranting over a very generic somewhat smooth and pillowy instrumental and really just like kind of complaining about a relationship that she doesn't really seem to be getting as much out of as she would like outside of that there's not really a whole lot about the song that feels all that compelling but what are you gonna do alright tracks I felt kind of met on wasn't blown away by them but thought they were still worth pointing out one a new track from Isis ami who is an artist who I've talked about before in this series she has a new record out the drop this year that I think is okay she also has a new EP a holiday themed EP out will Little Drummer BB and a few tracks from it are floating around the internet right now it's you is a very quaint piece of drum machine back bedroom pop that is somewhat low five is still very pretty and a little melancholic give it a try give it a shot next we have a new track from Maggie Rogers a singer and songwriter who's a new recent record I didn't really get that much out of however with this a new song of hers over here love you for a long time it kind of seems like a 90s singer-songwriter throwback radio jam that's not too bad the vocals are still not very all that distinct but still not all that distinct but but still it's it's sweet on the ears it's nice on the ears a hit of slight nostalgia for me personally oh damn alright next a new track from singer and songwriter Maggie Rodgers whose new LP I didn't care for all that much but this new single of hers love you for a long time has a bit of a throwback 90s singer-songwriter radio jam quality to it that I liked quite a bit vocals still a little generic but the tune is nice the tune is sweet we also have new track from eddy currents oppression ring Australian garage rock band very linear song over here some vocals that are pretty straightforward almost narrative in tone the lyrics feel kind of political little revolutionary that quality about the track that I like but I thought that the writing the performance of the progression of the song was a little tedious and repetitive we have destroyer out with a new track where I do like some of the lyrics I do like some of the vocals but like with the other teaser from his upcoming record have we met this new song also feels like it could use more progression it needs more interesting instrumental backdrop it just doesn't happen is the title of it and again while there are some lyrical and vocal ideas presented here that I thought were pretty cool overall the song does get a little tedious and let's get into the best tracks of the week starting with Anderson PAC and Mark Ronson coming together on this track then there were two which is a song from the new spies and disguise Disney animated film soundtrack wouldn't really be covering this or making a big deal of this if it weren't for the fact that Anderson PAC and Mark Ronson are a duo that has long been overdue and the song comes out fucking excellent I hope that this is the start of a beautiful friendship because given Mark Ronson's pedigree the stuff he was able to do back in the day with artists like Amy Winehouse and given the era of sounds and influences that Anderson pack seems to typically pull from in his own music I feel like Anderson and Mark are just a match made in heaven these two need to do okay this is this whole if this video exists for any reason it's to put this message out into the world okay these two need to do an entire record together get in the fucking studio and do an entire record because if even half of it comes out as good as this song it would have been worth it so there you go that's my idea that's my opinion let's go and next we have a brand new song from English producer electronic music producer mr. Square pusher who has been on a bit of a hiatus a bit of an album hiatus for a while now seems like we are getting a new record very soon the title of this one over here is war track and it's easily one of the glitchy ax stand most mind-bending singles I think Tom Jenkinson has dropped in a long time somebody who is a big fan of a lot of square pushers older stuff I am digging this one quite a bit we have a new track from storm Z as well rapper singer-songwriter storm Z he has a new record on the way the people are making a big big big big big deal of he has this latest cut this latest single out with burna boy as well as Ed Sheeran and yeah I actually enjoy it the edge here and feature is not too bad I think burna boy does well on the track I think the instrumental is fantastic I think storm Z also kicks these start off really well yeah I don't really have much negative about this song to say I dug it i fucks with it i like it quite a bit despite the fact that i wasn't really all that into the poppier in more commercial direction of his last full length record i will be looking forward to this new one quite a bit you know could be a could be a great one could really blow me away we'll see all right we also have rena saw amma coming through with a brand new single STFU and it is yet another example of a new current day bright shining star cutting-edge pop artist who is incorporating elements of new metal and groove metal into their sound i don't have any reason to believe that this is like everything rena is going to be doing for the next record or two records or whatever but this single on its own is really aggressive its bombastic it's in your face it's catchy features some quality vocals heavy production good riffing so uh yeah don't go quite a bit Reena STFU check it out it's a fun fun single alright Ozzy Osbourne straight to hell yes Ozzy is back with a really fuckin good new track with a sound and a production style that is very much in the vein of the dozens if not hundreds of sludge and stoner metal bands that Black Sabbath has influenced over the years because it sounds almost as if the guitars and the drums on this thing are off of like a sleep or a high on fire record which is not a bad sound this is not a bad sound it's heavy as hell it hits hard Ozzy's lyrics are about essentially drug abuse and drug addiction so it's pretty you know in his wheelhouse of knowledge and he writes from very compelling place you know given his past and yeah just generally it's a very great track I liked it a lot more than the last track that Ozzy dropped very recently that one felt a lot more sterile even if it was a pretty solid ballad this one is good writing good performance it sounds gnarliest fuck and has a really pretty bridge on it as well so I'm all in all this is a really good it's really good Ozzy track we have a new song from Kesha as well Kesha is back my own dance something essentially about her marching to the beat of her own drum her own direction her own style this is Kesha you did I am woman hear me roar that sort of thing there are a few weird lyrical ideas on here like a don't circumcise I can't even say don't circumcise my circumstance not sure if I'm super crazy about that lyric but generally I think the song is actually really catchy and I think I liked it more than her her last major teaser track so that's it's out there it's weird it's ridiculous it has very funky and an odd way qualities to it but that's that's just kind of Kesha I guess we also have hiam hallelujah brand-new track it is a beautiful acoustic ballad and that in my opinion has some qualities to it that reminds me of the the great work of Nikko Chelsea girl that era maybe also a little bit of simon and garfunkel on this track too it's quite nice and very good singing on it as well so check it out it's solid I want to give a shout out also to Francis Quinlan of hopalong Fame who seems to be on a bit of a solo venture now with this brand new track over here now that I'm back it is a dynamic multifaceted ballad that is not as loud and as in-your-face and and as I guess ever shifting as a lot of those great tracks from Hopalong that indie rock fans love so much but it's a really good creative tune so give it a try give it a shot I also want to give a shout out to this remix from MJ Cole of the flume song rushing back featuring Vera blue great grooves and great basically I apologize a remix reinterpretation re-prep presentation I don't know this film track it's got some great beats on it some colorful production give it a try give it a shot and ooh blood incantation over your death metal band blood incantation they just dropped this new full-length record hidden history of the human race it is a gnarliest fuck death metal record with a bit of a sci-fi twist and the production is heavy and thick and murderous and yet everything rings through so clearly it's not one of those dirty dirty grimy death metal records and yet it's not a super sterile like a tech death record it's a good midpoint you know what I mean there's some great playing there's some good gory details but it's it's not ruined by an overly clean or an overly dirty mix just give it a try it's a good one and a Bill Callahan brand new single out if you could touch her at all and it's just a really good sleepy sad country ballad with some great instrumentation the songwriting is a bit more beefed up than it was in comparison to a lot of the shorter vignette like tracks off the Bills latest record but still

ckBbj-E0SdA,hi everyone hose and II tell tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Maddie on record good faith this is the newest full-length project from French born songwriter producer electronic musician pop alchemist Maddie on I first heard of his stuff back in 2015 with the release of his debut album adventure the music on that project I wasn't crazy about it mostly just hit me like a very formulaic derivative EDM friendly brand of electro pop don't get me wrong there's some fun euphoric and even epic music packed into this record like the song okay or the track Imperium but be consistently boring vocal guests combined with the overall lack of interesting textures and the very synthetic to the point of sterile sound of these songs put me in a place where I doubted if I would ever be a part of the Madeon fanbase it's been four years since the release of that record though so I thought I would give his new one a fair shot just out of curiosity and a lot of suggestions from you guys of course and it's definitely a trimmer project at 35 minutes the production isn't really any less smooth than it was on the previous record but at least Maddie Ann's use of effects combined with the extra layering he throws into this record it makes for a pretty fantastical listen and the vocal features that are here on this project they fit pretty seamlessly into the album they aren't distracting they don't feel like they're driving a change in tone across the tracklist which makes for a more cohesive listen and not just all of that but the sweet sweet bliss he's able to conjure across this record makes it a cut above its predecessor on the opening track dream dream dream I'm not sure what's more attention grabbing is it the creatively chopped and luscious vocal harmonies or is it the cloudy bursts of enveloping sense that fill the mix with rainbows of color the vocals are a bit sleepy but I do like the robotic processing on them and makes it feel like I'm listening to I don't know an AI get in touch with its programmed emotions I get a similar vibe off the track be fine which even though it has a bolder groove hook your structure still lead vocals are very similar and they're also enhanced with these also gorgeous group vocal sections so at the start of this project already I am impressed more with what I am hearing than I was with any Madi on track so far not to say this project is perfect though there are points at which the vocals just don't really hit all that hard like the utterly forgettable closing track also on the track all my friends where the singing is so unblemished and nearly soulless that it's hard to connect I guess it reminds me of many lead vocal passages from Daft Punk's discovery but if you stripped out anything that was emotionally compelling I do love the dance grooves on the track though the cute little production details Madeon throws in here and there but still talking about the vocals the worst of which I think comes through on the track heavy with hoping which look to be credited to singer and songwriter Audra Mae someone who's worked once I listen to it she does not typically sound like this Madi on must have taken her voice and pitched it down in a way where it has this very awkward weird androgynous quality to it which is something I've heard done well before Dorian fucking Elektra but I can't say that's the case here on all these songs where I'm not crazy about the vocal Madeon is still bringing some instrumental heat some grooves which is also the case for the cuts where he features little vocals or no vocals at all like with the huge horn sections and fat hip hop beats toward the end of hold me just because which to my ears sound like John bel ian if John bel ian wasn't such a snoozefest too bad most of what happens up to this point of this track is a little bland we also have the track mania which is a beautiful arpeggiated synth Odyssey the introduction of the track features this primal drumming a rubbery and whimsical lead melody then we go full throttle with these heavy punchy beats when we're building up with these awesome synth arpeggios toward the finish it feels like I'm just flying up a mountain with my anime crew you know we're just make it stances then there's also the track miracle which features these bright shimmering blasts of group vocals just pitched samples that create this incredible feeling of euphoria it's like the rapture is hitting and I'm being brought up to electro-pop heaven with some slick grooves and tasteful progressions the introduction is another moment that feels a little Daffy Punk inspired with a side of Porter Robinson and a splash of Kanye West especially in the samples and drums and I would say the Kanye influence turns up one more time in a bold way on the track Nirvana after a dramatic vocal intro Madeon hits us with these thunderous drums bright just ringing synthesizers that feel like they're a product of the graduation era of course all of this is enhanced by these repeating vocal samples twittering high hats a hip-hop beat and I think Madeon makes it his own with these very glossy shimmery layers of sense that are very consistent with the bright futuristic and synthetic aesthetic most of this record shoots for so I love that Madi on on this record is able to effectively show off so many influences in a very obvious way while simultaneously creating a listen on this record that has a strong sense of identity to it that to me says hey it's fantastic that Madeon has a very strong sense of his artistic self which I still think is a work in progress because while the consistently glossy idyllic and euphoric sound that Madeon brings to the table is nice I don't find it to be all that versatile a lot of tracks on this project really pale in comparison to others especially on the vocal end and once more I think Madi on sound palettes really could use some more texture some shaking up and maybe cast a wider net of influences to pull from next time - overall though I thought this was a decent very likeable electro pop record with some very bright bright bright and feel-good sounds on it I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

I mean it could go to little nas ex it could go to Liz Oh as well ooh and Rosalia's in here oh my god I would love to see Rosalia win a god damn Grammy that would be great Maggie Rogers no thank you tank and the bangus No Yola I think she's a very good singer but I don't think it's likely she will win same with black Pumas yeah I think it's really down to Billy nas and Liz Oh on this one and once again I think I think Billy is kind of the favorite Best Pop solo performance spirit Beyonce bad guy Billy Eilish seven rings ariana grande truth hurts Liz oh you need to calm down tail Swift I personally would love to see Liz Oh walk away with this one because I mean while I think that um she doesn't have the freshest sound the most buzz of any artist in these categories vocally she's just on another level she has so much personality so much range so much volume so much character to her voice I would love to see her walk away with a Best Pop solo performance on this one with best pop duo and group performance we have ariana grande and social house boyfriend that track is pretty meth in my opinion sucker Jonas Brothers also a pretty mediocre track Old Town Road Billy Ray Cyrus that would be pretty great sunflower post Malone and sway Lee also pretty boring in my opinion seniorita okay that's I wanted to go to Old Town Road please for the love of God let this go to Old Town Road Best Pop Vocal album The Lion King record from Beyonce Billy Eilish thank you next ed Sheeran please do not let it go to Ed Sheeran lover Taylor Swift it's fine but I would rather see Billy or Ariana walk away with this one I do fuck with Beyonce pretty heavy but that Lion King record was not it best dance and electronic music recording linked bonobo that's pretty cool that's great that bonobo got to a nice Grammy not there got to keep on Chemical Brothers which is a somewhat solid record Medusa featuring good boys piece of your heart Rufus to soul underwater Skrillex and Boys Noize featuring ty dolla sign midnight hour gotta say I enjoyed the Chemical Brothers record they're the most I would love to see it go to The Chemical Brothers on that one even though I think it's a likely to go to a newer and trendy artist on this one best dance and electronic album we have LP 5 from apparat the Chemical Brothers hi this is flume mixtape who that blue mixtapes on here that's cool solace Rufus to soul taiko whether would love to see this go to the mixtape frankly would love to see it go to the mixtape then Chemical Brothers I think honestly flu could have a big chance at this one flume is a relatively popular producer in the underground and the mainstream too so I think that could definitely carry over into quite a few votes with this nomination I'm sure there are a lot of people in the industry that love themselves some chemical brothers especially given that a nostalgia factor you can't ignore that but I think flume has a serious shot at this one so pretty excited about that for Best Rock performance pretty waist bones UK gonna have to look that up frankly I have not heard that record this land Gary Clark jr. which was okay history repeats Brittany Howard which I thought had some moments on it woman Karen Owen Danger Mouse too bad rival sons God seriously this is like the most dismal rock performance category in a long time the Brittany Howard again I like some tracks on it I guess I would like to see it go to Brittany Howard I know there are a lot of people in the industry that mess with Alabama Shakes not sure if that is going to make the win here guaranteed though so I guess we'll see with best metal performance we have a Candlemas featuring Tony Iommi we have death angel on here i prevail Killswitch Engage and tool with tempest I guess I prefer the tool track but it would be hilarious to see Killswitch Engage win just for the meme we have the best rock song category fear inoculum give yourself a try harmony hall history repeats this land all respectively from Gary Clark jr. Brittany Howard Vampire Weekend the 1975 and tool I'm okay with all of these tracks I'm not super crazy about any of them I guess again Brittany Howard history repeats that track would be pretty cool fear inoculum i think would be great see tool walk away with an award even if I think that track is a little bland harmony Hall is is fun as well I'll just say harmony Hall and I'll say that honestly I think it's likely Vampire Weekend might get it so Best Rock album now ammo bring me the horizon social cues Cage the Elephant in the other cranberries I prevail trauma rival sons feral roots I guess I would like to see it go to bring me the horizon or Kade's the elephant's I think those two records are probably the most solid and creative of the bunch s alternative music album UFO F big thief it's it's cool to see big thief here it would be amazing to see them win especially considering I like their new record can't say I was all that crazy about UFO fo assume forum James Blake that's good one i-i've own Iver father of the bride Vampire Weekend the new Thom Yorke record as well I would like to see it go to the James Blake although I wouldn't be surprised if it went to Bon Iver Vampire Weekend or Thom Yorke I feel like as far as I don't know industry cred they might carry a bit more as much as James Blake does have a passionate fan base I feel like the seals already kind of broke in there with us Bon Iver Best R&B Performance love again with Daniel Cesar and brandy which in my opinion is not a very good performance at all so I would be shocked to see it go there could have been her featuring Bryson tiller exactly how I feel Lizza with gucci mane roll Simo lucky day come home anderson pack featuring andre 3000 huh i would love to see it go -

nobody is paralleling Rosalia right now give her this goddamn Grammy for the best American roots performance here frankly I would love to see it go with Yola not sure what the likelihood is that it will go to anyone else but I think Yola should get it I would say my feelings are similar on the best American roots song and best Americana album - but as far as the best reggae album category goes even though I'm pretty sure it's in the EP I would like to see it go to coffee because that rapture project has quite a few good songs on it and I feel like as far as contemporary reggae artists go she's bringing one of the most cutting-edge sounds that fits pretty seamlessly into the current music landscape while still authentically feeling very much like genuine reggae music with producer of the Year non-classical we have a pretty interesting mix of faces that have really helped craft the sound of the year with Jack Antonoff working with Kevin abstract taylor swift lana red hearse dan auerbach put in a lot of work this year also John Hill is on here - who has really killed it with John Mayer Kate's the elephant young the giant Carly Rae Phineas who of course is all over the Billy Eilish and Ricky read with fiddler Maggie Rogers Liz OH - and a lot more this is a tough choice I wouldn't be surprised to see it go to Phineas just based off of the hype of that Billy record personally I think I would like to see it go to Jack because while I do love what Phineas did on that record and I like Dan and I like the work of John and in Ricky - I think jack is really you know had a quality over quantity approach and what he's contributed to each one of these records which was a whole lot was great and I think I am going to leave it at that everyone that has been my take and predictions and hopes for the 2020 Grammy Awards make sure to let me know your thoughts down below in the comments and yeah over here next to my head is a nother video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Grammys the forever 
NMsEzAg_E7o,hi everyone Tran theny send tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new liturgy album Haq q this is the latest LP from the experimental metal project masterminded by hunter hunt hendrix composer guitarist singer songwriter arranger the title is obviously an acronym it stands for high Lagaan above quality and quantity that and the front cover here are a product of hunters incredible mind which always seems to be at work not just on new music but also on exposing these deep philosophical concepts that seem to inform the sounds he creates follow hunter hunt Hendrix's exploits online and soon you'll be catching views of charts and lists loaded with heavy terminology maybe even a paragraph or two from a manifesto or a really long-winded vlog talking about metaphysics I would call it pretentious if it didn't all seem like it was coming from a genuine place of curiosity and also vulnerability like hunter is genuinely trying to connect to something greater than himself and invite others to do the same and that something hunter is attempting to connect to often comes with a religious or a spiritual component which isn't surprising considering how much the project genuinely borrows from black metal music but liturgy isn't your average black metal band not just in terms of musical aesthetics take 2015's the ark work for example which was loaded with elements of glitch music hip hop MIDI all coming together with the bands typically loud and searing guitars and drums in a really intriguing way there's also a hunter refers to in his black metal writings as the burst be less of a steady and stiff blast style of drumming that has been the backbone of numerous classic black metal records and more of a fluid rolling percussion style that allows the band to quickly build up into these amazing overwhelming crescendos on numerous tracks you can hear it on most if not all of the tracks on liturgies Aesthetica quite a few of the songs here - and this percussion style just brings this amazing feeling of metallic transcendence that to my ears has been unpair throughout the decade so there's all that and then there's hunter hunt Hendrix's philosophical intentions behind the music that he composes which arguably is put liturgy and a lot more hot water than anything they're doing musically now in retrospect I get why black metal traditionalists would reject and be openly angry toward Hunter publicly trying to create this antithesis to the forms that make up classic black metal records like Transylvanian hunger not only that but Hunter openly encouraged American bands to break off from these roots entirely do their own thing mostly in the spirit of artistic evolution and I think listening closer to Hunter's music and reading his words makes it clear that he doesn't hate the Scandinavian black metal scene I mean how could he his life's work is so indebted to it sadly Hunter's vision for a mass embrace of a new direction for the genre didn't really pan out black metals purist mindset has prevented the genre on the whole from going much of anywhere since 2011 and the burgeoning American scene that was creating a gigantic buzz for a moment is quickly becoming a passing phase that lasted between two hunters and sunbae there seems a great deal of the crowd were just into the shoegaze the aesthetics of some of the more black gay Z bands out there I guess for is grumpy and as immovable as black metal traditionalists are you have to kind of respect the fact that they're still here plugging away as if none of this ever happened but so is hunter - as this new liturgy record is a bold culmination of everything that has made the project groundbreaking up until this point now despite Haq queue being so large in scope this album is actually one of liturgies trim astoya with just nine tracks 45 minutes the tracklist is pretty evenly divvied up into these seven or eight minute metal pieces and two or three-minute interludes in between them only major exceptions are the droning guitar outro and the tracks virginity and passacaglia which are not lengthier metal pieces but side-by-side they complement each other feeling like a larger 9 minute block so the kickoff to this record the intro track I think is as grand a statement you could ask for from the beginning of a liturgy album all of these light swirling electronic glitches instantly explode this furious wall of guitars and drums it is a fluid burst of energy the performance is already incredible the guitars are so quickly picked the drums are dizzying what follows from here are a series of versatile and somewhat mathematical guitar and drum passages that hunter tries to arrange other instrumentation around he already showed his ambitions to do this on the ark work in 2015 and now he is building on that desire here really perfecting honing but now he's doing it with these alternating layers of squealing woodwinds and woeful moans I know it's not this but it does really sound like a couple of people in the studio blowing as hard as they can into a couple of recorders meanwhile the singers at this point on the song sound like they're either too cold or depressed to be singing now I will admit all this sounds very odd but the placement of these sounds in the mix is actually pretty good a lot better than I thought the ear piercing bells were placed on the artwork it all sounds messy at first but eventually the woodwinds and the vocals in their own way sync up with some of the guitar leads layering up in a way that feels kind of triumphant just before a quick glitchy transition the stakes of this track are raised even higher when these singing genuinely starts to sound great angelic at this point of the song we're just bordering on listening to an Avant metal opera and there are a lot of different phases throughout this track all of them flowing together pretty seamlessly eventually concluding with a very strong ending - not sure if I could have asked this song to set the tone for this album any better it's like hunter perfectly distilled one of his dense philosophical or sonic theses into a musical composition the first X occur in Turla that comes after this isn't a bad moment on the record it's a quick regal piano piece with some glitchy edits here and there aesthetically doesn't sound like anything that came before it or comes after it but by the end of the record it's pretty clear these intermission moments are merely just palate cleansers to almost clear your mind in between these incredibly dense and relentless performances compositions mixes because this album is a very intense listen and as a liturgy fan of course I anticipated what I'm hearing on the intro track but really by the end of the record it really starts to weigh down on you so while these interludes don't make for the best album flow that I've ever heard in my entire life they do sound good and it's certainly a lot better than if the interludes were boring or if the interludes weren't even there at all the track virginity opens up with all these gorgeous harp runs literal harp runs cascading over tragic tremolo picked guitars that distant throaty retched screaming style of singing that Hunter usually brings to liturgies albums is here but now it's sounding a little freakish a little inhuman Hunter starts hitting listeners with even more synced up guitar leads and choral vocals but this time they're really going hand-in-hand climbing up this amazing melodic progression that just gets higher and higher and higher with the guitars and drums being played more fiercely the higher this melody reaches it sort of has the effect of seeing a pong ball bouncing back and forth between two paddles on a screen and eventually it starts going so fast it becomes a blur for me it's stuff like this that makes liturgy one of the most if not the most dynamic band and metal today because I can't really think of any groups that are doing such fast skilled well-executed and composed swells and crescendos like these your favorite post metal band could never this is pretty much the end of the track as I mentioned earlier from here we get a very smooth transition into the song passacaglia which immediately brings us into these head-banging heavy grand riffs that feel like an amazing let off of tension built up by virginity and the epic quality of the riffs on this track are enhanced by the woeful and dreary strings hanging in the background there's then some added layers of glockenspiel and vibraphone whose tiny ringing fluttery notes are reminiscent of some of the bells that were included on the ark work but I just find it to be a lot more gratify this time around the rest of the song is mostly a thunderous riff fest maybe not as tightly executed or is hypnotic as some of the groovier songs from Aesthetica mostly because the added instrumentation here makes it a bit of a behemoth but it's still a pretty incredible moment on the record the second interlude on the record is a chilling Bell piece whose notes seem to ring out for ever it's another nice palate cleanser and becomes a bit surreal when these ghostly vocal harmonies and pianos start drifting into the mix then we have God of love which I thought was great as a single as a teaser track to this album and it sounds even more powerful in the tracklist and kicks off with a seriously cinematic string opening much of what's to follow features the very same instrumental suspects that we've been hearing so far but now it's all culminating the vocals the vibes the glockenspiel the strings the bells the guitars and drums these things are intensifying hammering on the mix all at once it is mind-blowing ly thick and loud on at least a few points it sounds like the whole thing is just going to implode and the song is structurally impressive too despite how much is going on each section feels pretty defined from the last and the structure of the track is really impressive too great momentum carried across the song each musical passage contrasts really well from the next now considering how heavy and relentless and just mind melting this cut was the third interlude here I felt personally like I really truly needed the spacious fluttering pianos here are a very nice and welcome break and it's it's great that they last for almost four minutes because really after everything that has occurred before it god of love is just a marathon the title track is effectively the records last hurrah it's not as heavily arranged as most of the songs that precede it but that's fine what really gets the magic of the song across is the muscular and very toned riffing and drumming throughout the track hitting these great very sharp grooves ensure at various points of the song there are some vocals or piano hanging in the background but they don't take up that much of the mix they don't distract too much from what the drums and the guitars are doing the stop on a dime transitions the head-banging riffs and all of this is strangely enhanced by the multiple I would say really incessant at some points glitchy edits that are placed throughout the track all of a sudden a riff will be thrown into this cycling skip and then just burst into another drum beat or riff it's pretty impeccable how hunter is able to manipulate these skips and these glitches to actually build up and intensify any number of moments of the composition from here we have a seamless transition into the semi ambient outro on this record who's curious bells and pianos eventually give way to some very raw and tinny guitars the sound pretty typical for any number of liturgy compositions but eventually these guitars get very fat and distorted kind of shoegaze ii droney a little uneventful as a final final moment on the record but I think for an album of this general intensity a meditative finish can be pretty fitting I truly don't have many complaints about this record I wish it came out earlier in the loudest and thickest moments here there are spots that I wish where the sound engineering was better the separation between the instruments was better but the fact that it all comes together and such a grand aggressive explosive loud way is a pretty decent trade-off for sure some of the transitions into the interlude tracks could have been better while all that would be great it would just be a cherry on top of what's already an incredible album and with this record being out and with this decade coming to a close I would like to say that the general lack of appreciation for liturgy has tried to do in the metal field this decade is one of the biggest l's of this past 10 years this lack of appreciation will most likely continue on for a very long time because hunters music is certainly not going to appeal to everyone but hopefully we can reach a point where the ideas presented here aren't so unorthodox and more innovation in black can be widely accepted beyond someone trying to take the genres already smudgy sound and just apply some shoegazing aesthetics to it which is fine but there's so much untapped potential in the genre that only a few groups seem to be willing to dig out and liturgy is certainly one of them in my opinion the most successful most daring as well especially on this record I'm feeling a light to decent nine on this one transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or

9aInNmFYxRM,hi everyone smoked the knee water tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mount Erie album lost wisdom part 2 this is the latest full-length album from Phil el vrom zone Mount Erie just in case you are unaware Phil elrom in my opinion is one of the greatest minds to come out of lo-fi indie and singer-songwriter music and now he's dropping a collaborative record with fellow singer and songwriter formerly of the band Eric's trip Julie Doran and this is the second time they are crossing over on to an entire full-length album which should be pretty obvious given that this thing is titled lost wisdom part to the original lost wisdom actually came out over ten years at this point sidenote songwriter Fred Squire was also included in those original lost wisdom sessions he doesn't seem to have carried over on to the sequel record here which is a change that's worth noting also one that I'm not too excited to see mostly because that first lost wisdom record is so important to me it's such a cute rustic heartening intimate little album that's attached to some of the best song writing under the Mount Erie name and even though I welcome the idea of a sequel I wonder if the very specific brand of magic to that original record is gonna carry over can that be rekindled in such different times under such different circumstances and maybe I'm overthinking it maybe Phil and Julie the two primary voices of lost wisdom all they need to do to justify coming out with another record in this series is just to collaborate on a full-length together once again but there's not really anything about that original lost wisdom record for as much as I've loved it over the years that's communicated to me that a sequel was on the way or that one was even necessary so because Phil is consciously referencing back to that lost wisdom album I have to assume that there are characteristics and similarities between these records that go beyond their personnel this must be some kind of spiritual or thematic successor and if that is the case I'm not really hearing it despite lost wisdom to only being a handful of minutes longer than the original the songs on this one aren't nearly as catchy or straightforward even on the shortest track here pink light which is easily one of the sketchiest and most impressionist ik songs of the bunch to the point where it feels almost unnecessary and even when Phil and Julie do manage to drum up a good track in the tracklist here it feels less like a folk tune and more like a long-winded musical meditation or diary reading in that respect lost wisdom to shares more in common with mount Airy's dawn or Phil's last major album now only except not nearly as consistent while I personally think it's unfair to expect Phil to be writing from the same place that he was in in 2008 especially after everything he's been through over the past several years I also would have never expected him to brand a new album after something he had done in 2008 either because these two records just show such different qualities in terms of songwriting and ethos on the original lost wisdom the title track was a song that was essentially trying to juxtapose loneliness raw emotional pain against all of this sad uncaring nature imagery like the world and everything natural in it is just moving on while I'm by my lonely in respect to the nature imagery it is a Mount Erie album so you know there's gonna be like a rock or a tree or two and curiously enough there's already been a lost wisdom too in the Mount Erie discography a track of exactly that title on the back end of Phil El rooms wins poem a fantastic foray into black metal that he came out with not too long after lost wisdom and of course sequel tracks and stuff like that are nothing new for Phil but just thought it was worth noting especially since despite the aesthetic change on that wins poem album that track feels like more of a true lyrical and melodic successor to the original lost wisdom album and track the closest thing we get to that over here is the track real lost wisdom which I think there's potential in doing a track like this exploring some of the lyrical themes and ideas of the original losing wisdom losing something significant as a result of losing a connection with a loved one or someone important to you Phil then relays that to his connection with his young daughter the songs biggest takeaways are essentially love in ten sleep while you can love is worth it love is worth existing for fill also equates love to gazing into a flame or a fire that you just don't avert your eyes from it's a pretty powerful message but still forgettable tune not one of these stronger songs and the tracklist here sadly which is again something I miss so much about that first lost wisdom album how tuneful it was the same messages about love are echoed on to these songs that bookend this album belief and believe part to the latter is a lot better than the former just by virtue of being sweeter less long-winded it's a gentle piano ballad performed in a very slow motion with Phil and Julie's vocals intertwining nicely a genuinely beautiful moment trying to express an undying devotion to love this message of not losing faith in love less enchanting on this album are the songs that engage in not as lofty topics offering instead plain and frank descriptions of what seemed like normal goings-on with maybe a few poetic embellishments here and there like on the track when I walk out of the museum or on the track and during the waves which Phil kicks off lyrically with the image of him sitting on a train reading about Buddhism and listening disaster as a longtime fan of Phil's work you might assume that these graphic descriptions of his everyday existence would be exciting intriguing or revealing but for the most part they just feel humdrum and uneventful I mean it's typical as the idea of love or the loss of love is it's it's actually really where the best moments of this album turn up the song love without possession is certainly a highlight here with its quaint and simple guitar strumming with Phil and Julia's voices harmonizing in this very awkward but endearing way it's a pretty linear progression the instrumentation beefs up a little bit toward the end and we start getting what sounds like a Velvet Underground style jam then the song widows is a very unlikely single-parent widower anthem and I'm not trying to use that term in a funny or ironic way because it's literally the only track here with roaring distorted chords and soaring lo-fi guitar leads as Phil sings about dealing with the PTSD of losing his wife and just being haunted by memories of his past look overall I think this album is okay it's not a bad Mount Erie record but I feel like lost wisdom too as a sequel in name and in name only because sonically and lyrically this project has way more in common with Phil's most recent works than it does anything he dropped ten years ago even with Julie Doran in the mix for the entire record and of course Phil and Julie collabing again is not a bad thing they work together really well but this is far from the best material they've recorded together and that has only made more obvious with it being a sequel I'm feeling a light too decent six on this one

VuWOK6_7GZU,hi everyone my and grain tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little peep compilation everybody's everything this is a new compilation of songs from little peep which has pretty much been released in tandem with a documentary film about the late rapper and singer's life and rise through the music industry I went into this new and old mix of tracks pretty skeptically because in most cases I think the music industry releasing music posthumously from a popular artists especially when those tracks are just odds and ends that can be pretty exploitative for me it needs to be clear that those releasing the music took the utmost care in maintaining the image and legacy and the aesthetic of the artists that they that they're dropping music from the released material should be flattering not sub par or embarrassing and even though there are some tracks on this comp that I would say are subpar and mediocre I still read the whole compilation and documentary rollout as being pretty genuine as well as tasteful at least this collection of tracks is being released as a compilation which fans again know is posthumous so they can expect at least some of the material here to be rough around the edges this whole thing could very well be a mixed bag the fact that it's been paired with the documentary just enhances this feeling that the release of this material feels like it's just meant to expose some of the uncovered corners of peeps musical mind so we have an hour of material here spread out amongst 19 tracks and the quality and the sound of these songs kind of varies some tracks on this compilation are well produced and feature complete structures as well as robust hooks and verses from peep like with the track moving on it's simple and steady and effective track beat pairs very well with the Sat acoustic guitar passages this song also features one of peeps most impassioned vocal performances ever it's hard-hitting it's tragic and a very welcome change of pace from the more comatose vocal performances on peeps previous stuff it seems an equal amount of care went into tracks like Belgium and when I lie tracks that essentially make up the also posthumously released goth angel sinner EP live forever ghost boy and keep my kumuk for a trio of highlights as well the first to see people in a bit of very dreary cloud wrap with tons of reverb making these tracks feel very pillowy very dreamy taking a bit of the edge off of the incredibly depressing blend of Punk and trap and emo that peep was known for and keep my KUSI's peep on what sounds like kind of an old-school classic Memphis sound his eccentric delivery and flow the weird somewhat lo-fi synths on this track also the ghostly groans occurring in the background the atmosphere as well it's a spooky flex easily one of my favourite tracks here and a direction I would have been excited to hear peep go into if you were still around and as long as we're talking weird surprises and highlights on this compilation we have I've been waiting with Isle of Makonnen which maybe some of you are saying yeah I've heard that track the Fall Out Boy track I've heard that single no this is the non Fall Out Boy original version of the song which sounds vastly different for one the beat is a lot cuter it is not nearly as glossed up or over produced which is quite nice and the vocal qualities of the song are a lot different too with peeps and McKown ins vocals overlapping quite a bit it's almost as if they are doing a bit of a duet here now don't get me wrong the singing on this track is not the best in fact I would say at some points it's kind of bad but what's happening on this track is so unlikely a sound and a style for peep and Makonnen I guess it's fun to hear them just so out of their element especially it seems like vocally they're in a competition to see who can ham the song up the most so even as someone who historically has not really been a peep fan at all they're definitely highlights on this record that I respect and also enjoy but then again there are tracks on this compilation that are really rough around the edges not super well-executed or peep even sounds scarce on his own song mostly with the track ratchets featuring little Tracy where people only contribution to this track is really just the the refrain the hook the bulk of the song is really handled by Tracy and unless you're a Tracy fan I guess it's fine if you enjoy what peeps cohorts and the goth boy clique offer but I don't know to my ears it's very clear that the talent gap between peep and any member of the clique is about as wide as the English Channel though still I respect the decision to have people on here like Tracy because it's it's certainly more tasteful than just grabbing a bunch of random ass rappers that peep didn't work with that peep didn't have any connection to still having said that nearly every Gabe feature on this comp is a shade of terrible his voice is unbearably nasal and whiny he sounds like the former singer of a long-forgotten emo pop band out of the 2000s he really weighs some of these tracks down despite the hooks to LA to London or rock stars being so good and all the little Tracy features on the back end of the compilation I'm not that crazy about either especially on white tee which generally to my ears just seems like a waste of a postal service sample so despite my compliments and admiration for how this compilation and documentary we're so tastefully rolled out there are tracks on here that are obviously flawed not all that complete it's also dogged a little bit by the general subpar singing and lyricism that I've never been too crazy about in peeps previous stuff though I will say the fetishization of depression and addiction seems to have been toned down a little bit on at least some of this material and I like that a lot overall this thing's not a terrible compilation I liked quite a few tracks on it even some of my favorite peeps augs land on this collection of tracks which is a phrase that I never thought I would hear myself say but there are quite a few duds in the track list too I'm feeling a strong 5 on this compilation indifferent toward it on a whole I'm not super crazy about it I don't think it's bad either however I still would recommend listening to it even if you are casually a fan of little peeper things that sound like little peep if not only for the highlights that are on this thing transition have you given this compilation to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as

90KKkgAUaNM,hello hello hello everyone and he Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week they're all linked down below so you can check them out you can hear them for yourself before I get into it I have to shut out our turntable lab link down there in the description box you can get a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on the main channel we get kicked back from it you get vinyl our channel gets some support in exchange for that and also

below thank you very much for supporting the channel supporting the content and everything that we do alright and the worst tracks of the week we have a handful just a couple and then we will move on to greener pastures one the new of Montreal track peace to all freaks I don't know what has pushed Kevin Barnes into this sudden we have to do an 80's song we have to do a synth pop song direction but it it does not sound good the production is weak the aesthetic he's trying to grasp on to hear rekindle essentially recapture on his own recording is displayed pretty weakly and the song isn't even that great so um can't say based off of this I'm all that excited for this new of Montreal record but whatever moving on from there modest mouse has a new one now ice cream party and it does not sound like a party at all it is the slowest most boring single Modest Mouse has ever put out period and I thought some of the tracks from the band's last record were rough virtually none of the distinct and just basically thrilling or interesting characteristics of Modest Mouse's music that has defined their most classic records show up on this track even Isaac's voice just sounds completely off there's nothing about this song I find appealing and it's just really uneventful it's just really slow it's very hazy not a whole lot of substance just a lot of hot air in my opinion moving out from there also glass animals they have a new track out the features Denzel curry Tokyo drifting given the Denzel Curry feature I was pretty excited to give this thing a try but it is just a really weak attempt at trying to fuse like some pop rock and some trap and can't say I cared for much of any of it outside of denzel's verse denzel's verse was great I can't really say that the the song was boring or just felt like like a cheap imitation of something else on account of Denzel if there was no Denzel curry feature on this track there really would have been no reason to try it whatsoever I'm just hoping that glass animals while I've never been a huge fan I'm hoping that the entire record doesn't go down this direction because that would be that would that would be a difficult to listen to let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of met not blowing me away but still worth mentioning and pointing out still worth um some attention a mention first off the new track from Princess Nokia Balenciaga I like the sentiment and the theme of this track essentially about fashion thrifting kind of defining your own looking style which has always been princess Nokia's thing beat goes hard I like the flow lyrically it's not one of her best there are some lyrics that are kind of worthy of an eye roller here some very basic ass Rhymes here and there but for the most part I think this track is basically a thrift shop by Macklemore was was actually cool you know and was not total shit so um you know while that song is a fun and was certainly fun at the time that it dropped has not aged well I'm liking this track a bit more in terms of shelf life I guess so uh still shout out to the the attempt here you know there are a lot of good elements of this track and and maybe if you don't mind the lyrics you'll like it a lot more than me also shout-out to Loma Prieta continuum name of their new single I like the explosive and abrasive second leg of this track but I don't know why the entire first half is spent just like mimicking this slightly crunchy lo-fi very boring average indie rock sound where the vocals are buried to the point where you really don't get much out of them I like Loma Prieta as more chaotic approach to scream Oh some might even call it emo violence and that's cool I dig that about their stuff can't say I enjoy hearing them too much going down this boring indie rock road though again it they kind of pick it up in the second half and and go into more interesting a territory with that John Legend Kelly Clarkson John Legend's legendary Christmas his new Christmas album is out and he has a track on it with Kelly Clarkson that's pretty much more progressive updated less problematic version of baby it's cold outside I did a full-length review of this over on the Fantana channel it's a little corny yes but the original song is corny as hell too so I mean you know that that's that much hasn't changed are the lyrics less problematic yes you know I say just look at it as one of many many updates that have been done to Christmas or holiday songs over the decades that popular holiday song has commercially been a thing it's not like every single commercial holiday song that we hear on the radio or hear covers of year in and year out have has seen no alterations whatsoever at least the alterations on this one were I guess well-intentioned so it's okay some of the vocal performances could have been better on here - John and Kelly a few parts I think could have used another tape but overall not bad next janae I co brand new song featuring her ex Big Sean the title is none of your concern I am liking a lot of aspects of this track I think her vocals on here are more stunning than they've been in a little while instrumentally you think it's cool like the tune as well it's really just Big Sean on the back end that ends up kind of dragging the whole thing down because lyrically I don't think his verse fits the tone of the entire song I mean sure their elements their of desire and missing someone yeah okay but the incredibly perverse avenues that his lyrics go down just don't really seem all that fitting against what Aiko is doing for the majority of the track in my opinion just kind of seems like a square peg in a round hole but what are you gonna do we also have Harry Styles watermelon sugar I don't I don't really don't know what to say about this track I mean I like the instrumental it feels kind of classic as far as like a fusion of pop and maybe a little bit of rock music as well it's it's very light on the ears it's got a good groove to it I like that Harry is trying to do something that I had that I would say is is a little more mature but there's something in terms of just his delivery his performance his charisma frankly that's lacking I feel like he's really marketing himself in this rock star mode he is dressing very colorfully he's really like throwing himself into the spotlight and I think trying to be a little more eccentric and a little bit bolder in terms of his look and in terms of his singing style but um you know he's no Freddie Mercury man you know and that's that's really kind of all there is to it and not that you pulling directly from a queen thing but when you're talking about like you know the gods of gods when it comes to like front men and singers and just like dudes who hit the stage they hit the mic they have that pizzazz they have that certain something they have that incredible performance ability that incredible talent when it comes to execution and I just don't really feel like Harry has that you know unless the song is really amazing which I think the song is okay there's not a whole lot to get excited about because Harry is just not like burning the house down you know what I mean so I feel like this is kind of track that would warrant that sort of performance style but he just doesn't really bring it to the table I don't know all right moving on from there Grimes brand-new song from her upcoming record which is dropping in 2020 so heavy I fell through the earth art mix I think this track is pretty groovy which is cool but for the most part it just feels like a really dated piece of club' electronic music that's a little Moody maybe slightly dystopian but very washed out not much of a tune or a structure to it it's just really repetitive and I don't know it just seems like a bit of navel-gazing song wise song wise it just seems out to lunch you know it's got a groove it goes on for quite a while it's a very wash out it's got a lot of layers to it but not a whole lot of substance beyond what you're kind of hearing on the surface in terms of like the very pillowy and groovy bells and whistles I guess we have a brand-new track from a boogie with a hoodie reply featuring a little Aussie vert an artist whose stuff I don't typically cover on the channel but still I thought the song was worth covering because loozy verts verse on here is absolutely great vocally he I think goes harder than he has in a while and I like that he really just tries to a sell it on this track so a big respect to little Uzi vert for a really kind of pulling it off and pulling it off well on this new cut we have Billy Eilish brand new cut which I talked about over on the Fantana channel everything I wanted and it's it's okay it's kind of a fusion of art pop and house music I think the tune is OK I like the surreal nightmarish dreamy elements and the storytelling of the song but production is bland as hell production is so bland and as far as a fusion of pop music and house goes this is pretty typical not really a whole lot about it that I find to be special nothing nearly as unique or as creative as anything on Billy's latest record so I'm hoping for something better the pipe and baths wistful fata morgana brand-new single I don't know if you guys have listened to baths in a while I know it's been a while since I've covered baths on the channel though you know it's it's not like there's been a whole lot of baths music to talk about as of late but kind of shocked as to how much this song just sounds like a postal service song I I really don't know what the cause for this shift in sound and direction is on this track but it just pretty much sounds like a postal service song yeah I don't know it's okay it's not terrible but there didn't really seem too much influence wise being plugged into this track other than the Postal Service and I'm just not sure why best tracks of the week the tracks that really grabbed my attention we got a handful let's go through them one trippy red with the track over here death featuring - baby not really a whole lot to say about this track other than banger alert banger alert banger alert it's dark it's grimy it's nasty trippy solos are pretty good the baby is great on the track as well the baby continues to show his incredible talent as a feature artist he really just kind of picks any track that he's placed on up and not sure what else to say outside of that you know what makes this track entertaining it's pretty cut and dry alright moving on from there play that boy is a poison clan featuring Denzel curry and Anonymous's an artist who I've been turned on to because of his connections to Denzel curry these three come together on this track for an incredibly dark and aggressive I would say evil and sinister ass banger make sure to try it because it goes hard as hell and you can already tell from the cover over here it's a kind of evil as fuck alright a shout out to Neon Indian yeah an Indian is back dropping a brand new single Toyota man and yeah if you like that nostalgic brand of synth funk that Neon Indian typically brings to the table you'll like the bass line of this track but the track is in Spanish there are also what I would say elements of like I don't know what Tejano music I really don't know but there it's it's it's not just some straight gentrified western brand of synthy pop music I'll say that I love that he is bringing in some I guess more international flavors into into the mix I like that Alan is uh I guess you know even representing and I guess defending the groups of people who are being attacked you know I would say uh in an unwarranted fashion by the current administration's immigration policies because that is brought up in the music video as well though you know if you're just listening to the song and vibing to it it's not anything that's gonna you know sort of be in your face outside of the fact that hey it's it's pretty cool that uh you know we're hearing something that is a little outside of the the the you know American borders in terms of just you know the style the sound and everything so the song is catchy is hell loving the mix of influences production is great too good vocal performance from Alan as well and the creative and fun colorful music video which has of course you know some social commentary into it is just a cherry on top of this already nice ass musical sundae alright we have also ooh moses omni veer isle is the name of this new track and now some knee is getting bolder and bolder and bolder and more and more out there loving this this is a nice piece of art pop over here with some insane lead vocals on it and it is a lengthy track to it really is gonna make you hunker down for a while and just observe its majesty is is really all he can say about it majesty is what this track is filled with it's majestic so give it a try give it a shot very excited for moses some knees next couple of years if he's going to continue dropping material like this we also have ooh lim kim yellow brand-new EP which this is this is the EP over a year that she's recently dropped and this song over here yellow is an incredibly dark and amazing Bangor and I love that she is sort of influencing elements of her of her heritage into the music as well and kind of just kind of changing up that usual trap formula and it's it's really out there too it's really creative and it's incredibly again I'll say dark it's edgy it's a very left-field and you know if you like your your hip-hop weird and give this thing a shot because it's a goes goes pretty fricking hard and ooh we have miss Lauryn Hill here guarding the gates from the Queen and slim the soundtrack the soundtrack to Queen and slim and yeah this is a lengthy one too is a very long ballad about love with some rich background instrumentation it's a little repetitive but the performance is good and Lauryn Hill's voice sounds pretty good you know she's dropped some you know some material here and there over the course of this decade where maybe the instrumental or the vocals were pretty damn rough but that is not the case on this new track over here you know doesn't sound like the good old days or anything like that I'll say that but it's actually sounding really good don't know if her work on the soundtrack is going to spark you know a new commercial album or anything like that you know new solo release but hey you take what you can get and finally I think this is the last one we're gonna discuss here this brand new track a collaborative or you know really a crossover rather because a rest in peace Sparklehorse but a crossover between Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse ninja rest's featuring MF DOOM so incredible production on this one I'll say that much and MF DOOM his verse is good but it's it's typical and MF DOOM flows and similes and rhymes you know if you've heard him in his best moments throughout his discography you've heard verses as good if not better than what he's done here but still the fact that he's crossing over with these two and the fact the instrumental is so good on this one is caused to listen or regardless and obviously put in the best section because I love so that is going to be it I think that has been the weekly track roundup everyone hopefully hopefully hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video you are the best I will see you in the next one Anthony Fantana music forever 
XQJ2o3Si9mU,hi everyone burst and he piped an O here the Internet's piss hissed music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dojo cat record hot pink this is the newest full-length LP from the singer rapper songwriter dojo cat a project I've been looking forward to ever since she went viral showing the more eccentric side of her personality with the unplanned breakthrough mu also undeniable bangers such as tia and tamera with rego nasty stuff that's certainly more fun and colorful than the forgettable pop rap and bland alternative R&B from her last record Amala now even though TN Tamara's nowhere near the tracklist of this record which makes me sad there was at least some material teasing torta that had me excited especially bottom bitch which is pretty much a summer jam that dropped just at the start of October and saw doja dipping our toes into the wave of emo trap and killing it the slow sad guitars on this instrumental which I believe are a blink-182 sample the steady trap beat the euphoric burst of on the hook all of this comes together for a simple but winning formula also the refrains and the weird relationship this song is in reference to with dojo cat referring to this woman she's singing about as being her bottom bitch and relating this relationship they have to that of a pimp and and how dynamic still an irresistible single to my ears though but what's disappointing after hearing the rest of hot pink it mostly seems like an isolated flash in the pan and that's pretty much what the entirety of hot pink is every single song hoping it's a breakthrough single dojaquez essentially jumping from one pre-established trendy idea to the next in hopes that she'll be able to fish out another hit which isn't inherently a bad thing we all want to hit song of course but the way in which that pursuit is gone about here results in an album that has no real focus or distinct personality the more I listen to it the less I feel like I have an actual grasp of who doja cat is as an artist what is her sound what is her style what is her anything now obviously a huge amount of thought went into just that on the visual side of things on the music video side of things on the marketing side of things when it comes to the actual music that you're marketing it's it's almost like an afterthought because again nearly every track here feels like it's essentially presenting me with a more agreeable lowest-common-denominator version of a sound or a style I've heard done better somewhere else by someone else like the song streets which is a washed-out utterly boring piece of dated alternative R&B sounds like where the genre was back in 2012 or 2013 it's like something Noah 40 would have produced for Drake years ago something the weekend would have sung on years ago but nowhere near as interesting the song say so is completely anonymous I would have never guessed this was a doja cat song had I not been told it sounds like a weird fusion of like I don't know a Gwen Stefani solo track and The Cardigans Love Fool just a very disco tinged pop that has a good vibe has a decent groove but the hooks the verses they're just okay the song addiction in my opinion is equally faceless I do like the aesthetic of the track it sounds like some old-school synth funk that's neon-lit said in Miami on a very steamy night in a club it's not a total exercise in nostalgia though it has some sleek punchy updates to the bass to the beats but that's about it and while it's not a terrible track why does the song won't bite sound like basically a bubblegum version to the intro of Childish Gambino's this is America you know what I mean that passage with the vocal harmony is in the very plucky fun bright acoustic guitars yes imagine that passage but ripped off watered down extended out into an entire song and rapped over and that's pretty much what you have here also the more I listen to cyber sex the more reminds me of Pink Friday air and Nicki Minaj but with a lower budget dreamier singing and slightly less pop appeal shout out to the lyrics about sexuality in the internet era though that's pretty apt and some of doshas zany rap flows in the second half of the track I do love because they mark one of the few actually eccentric and odd moments on the record an album that generally plays it pretty safe you ain't getting pussy you fuckin an AI doja has a few focused and worthwhile topics on this record a handful of one-liners that may be worth repeating but there are also plenty of spots on this thing where she's falling very short on the lyrical front especially on like talk dirty in an age where female rappers are speaking so unapologetically about their sexuality in song I imagine it can be kind of hard to stand out that's certainly what this track struggles with I mean compared lyrically to a cupcake a Brooke candy or even a cardi B sometimes the material here is pretty vanilla also the vocal distortion on doges voice which is not anywhere else on the record just here is obnoxious as is the flow and while there are better tracks here they're still very little too freaked out about the spastic and freaky auto-tune vocals on the track shine certainly grab my ear I like the overall vibe and aesthetic of the song but the lyrics are pretty much just very generic glitzy flexing nothing really all that interesting the very flirty like that has one of the best hooks on the entire project some of doshas most seductive and alluring lyrics but the Gucci Mane feature is painfully average and just really sad he phoned it in juicy with Tyga should get a mention as well given how huge the song has been for both of them I think that the beat is awesome I like doges flows and her chorus on the track especially that line about if you see it from the front wait till you see it from the back there are a lot of good things about this song there are a lot of good things about it but what is not so good about it is just how uninteresting and boring the freaking verses are Tyga does on this track what I think dozens of other rappers could have done better and doja on the back end of the song feels like she's an afterthought on her own track it's just not one of her better vocal or lyrical performances sadly on a track related to one of the most beautiful things on this planet the booty I expect more so again there's just not a whole lot to enjoy on this record or be excited about you know there's there's a lot of material here that to me feels very agreeable very background very generic certainly not offensive or the worst thing that I've ever heard in an isolated context but as an entire album it's just really disappointing to hear an entire record that really has

1J3s6wbc-S4,ah hi everyone Bluth anis Caetano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Montana Roberts project coin coin chapter for Memphis this is the latest LP from Chicago saxophonist composer spoken word artist Montana Roberts who has spent much of this decade ambitiously crafting an album series that she is now on the fourth installment of coin coin the whole thing functions like the musical equivalent to a multi chapter book exploring themes of one's past and how we remember it so far it's been a pretty versatile series with these shocking shrieks and free jazz passages of coin coin chapter one in 2011 in 2015 Roberts took the project into a surprisingly droney and experimental direction with Chapter three and even though I haven't loved every moment of coin coins so far you really never know what you're gonna get given the themes of coin coins so far especially on this new album one could make the assumption that Roberts interpretation of memory or recollecting one's history especially traumatic history can be a pretty unpredictable or even disorienting experience and as much as I do love coin coin chapter 1 because that record did truly leave a pretty big impact on me with how bold some passages of it were the more I listened to it chapter 4 might be my new favorite installment maybe the most gratifying chapter in the series so far this record feels like I'm being aggressively pushed through this noisy overwhelming series of scattered thoughts interpreted through many things spoken word pieces spirituals free jazz seems like the point is to make it hard for the listener to make heads or tails of anything at least on the first leg of the record that disorienting feeling it kind of dissipates toward the end of the album as we get clearer views of the memories that Montana is pointing toward it's like Roberts main protagonists on the record a young girl is blocking these horrific memories out of her mind but is slowly getting a firmer grasp of them toward the end of the whole thing now the sound and the production on this record are very raw up front every instrument is clear as hell a lot of punch very dynamic pretty much consistent with the sound quality that constellation records in hotel to tango have built their name on over the years even in the most cacophonous and abrasive and overwhelming free jazz passages on this record there's still quite a bit of space between all the instrumentation it's all very readable and intelligible each horn blur and woodwind flutter and drum hit you can really dive into the details of all of these pieces despite how noisy they are the production the engineering does result in some pretty great sound pallets on this one not gonna lie the stumbling drunken screaming jazz horns on fit to be tied are incredible they sound like a violent alcoholic stepping out of a bar at 4:00 a.m. some of these psychedelic swirls of vibraphone on the track shoes of gold are certainly pretty also the eye widening and chilling vocal harmonies on the track her mighty waters run which is a very dark portrayal of a spiritual type song another moment on the record that's genuinely frightening there's also the 10-minute trail the smiling Sphinx which works in multiple passages one of the boldest and most telling phases is when we get what sounds like the scratchy buh double bass notes I'm not sure what it would be if not that and they are performed in such a way where they sound almost like a group of fat hogs just going insane on a bucket of slop which is pretty odd but it adds to the disturbing sound set on top of it of these reed and fiddle notes just screaming and going insane playing these very familiar in Old Country melodies which in a bunch of different contexts would seem friendly nice or kind of upbeat fun even but on this record instead very dark almost scary in a way I think it's a testament to how your brain can interpret really just about anything in a negative light when it's associated with a traumatic experience coincoin Memphis kicks off with a bit of an intro with jewels of the sky inscription which is a pretty dramatic drone that builds up into a massive mountain of bass horns Roberts then tensely rattles off what seems like an internal monologue from our main character here talking about running and running talking about her father more memories of her father being a child of the wind a lot of lyrical repetition in this spoken word piece which I think comes down to Robert's in the head of her character trying to recall these moments that she's referencing like she can't quite move beyond the handful of things she's saying and connect it to anything else yet so she's just kind of thinking of them over and over and over folding them over in her mind to see if turning it over once more sort of raises up a new memory a new fact a new something which at first is very odd not really knowing or understanding where the album is going but once you hear through the entire thing listening to it over once more and kind of understanding where the whole thing is headed it becomes um quite ingenious after this we get some plucky acoustic notes some jaw harp as well to really kind of bring that southern flavor I feel like I am just in the deep south in the dead of summer under the beating Sun I'm just sweating my brains out now this calm gives way to the instrumental storm on trail the smiling Sphinx that I mentioned earlier we move through somebody crushingly loud and disturbing moments on this track it's it's really hard to keep up the whole thing is just flattening my mind to the point where all the molecules spread out into the next galaxy spoken word on this track returns more recollections of our protagonists father the family of the protagonist being given a hard time I think going to a white church or wanting to worship at a white church last fragment of this progression is this image of candy colored skin being lit up by a bright hot light and its parts like this especially going back and listening to the entire record that give me a sinking feeling I feel like I'm watching something happen in front of me that I am desperate to stop but I'm powerless I'm moving in slow motion I'm not really there on that plane of reality the very negative vibes coming off of this track are enhanced by harrowing horns which all contrasts very well with the spacious and dreamy shoes of gold which references back to a story being told in a bit of spoken word earlier on the album and while I like the sound the aesthetic the instrumental makeup the track compositionally the song is mostly just very incoherent vibraphone some guitar some basses well I wish that there was a bit more chemistry in between all the musicians on this track for the most part they seem almost disconnected in a way really the whole thing just sounds like I don't know an experimental music piece coming from a 1950 sound stage owned by a major media studio the next track wildfire bear isn't bad either but I'm more excited by the middle of the track than I am by anything surrounding it after that we get fit to be tied that I mentioned earlier that just demented barroom jazz sound of the horns on this track is just a oh it's anxiety inducing it is disturbing and so pivotal to the narrative in the progression of this album core mighty waters run comes after this that I mentioned earlier incredible spiritual peace great vocal break for the record - now with all things beautiful which in my opinion is another incredible track here we get more bits of the narrative the smell of embers people wearing hoods being frightened being told to run again the story coming together becoming clearer on the following in the fold the narrative continues there's lots of droning tones on this track more jaw harp Roberts singing the melody of this little light of mine against this slightly unsettling backdrop she depicts our protagonist here as being lost having run away from this attack on her family she is going to a new home as she says in the midst of where she is she finds a plate of food I guess in the middle of the wilderness and everyday she finds a new plate but it's set further away from where I guess she's hiding out she suspects this is a trap but she continues on eating it anyway then we get some memories or updates on her parents post this event her father moving on her mother in an asylum essentially never seeing her again after this we have a very quick transition into raise yourself up which vocally features what I can only call like battle cries pounding drums it's a really aggressive build-up it reminds me of so many amazing moments from some incredible god speed records over the years honestly but with a more jazzy I guess sound palette the closing track is a pretty interesting mix of sound some pump organ bold Sachs Industrial distortion just roaring away in the background like white noise some rumbling bass - it meets a somewhat abrupt end but it's still very bold finished for a very bold album that feels less like just sitting back and listening to some music and more like literally being transported into someone's shoes as they're having some of the most negative experiences of their entire life even though there were a few tracks that I thought could have been a bit better I'm still walking away from this thing thinking wow I'm also left wondering what's next what is after this for Roberts and for a coin coin in general because certainly not every bit of the narrative and in every memory presented here is sort of tied up and explained I'm still leaving this album with a lot of questions and conceptually that's not necessarily the worst thing in the world considering how dodgy and unpredictable the records presentation of memory is overall loving the concept behind this record how well it is executed loving the performances here the production is incredible loving the writing and compositions loving how compelling the spoken word passages on this thing are this record is a feat and Robert should be very proud of what she's achieved here because this thing has very quickly become one of my favorite jazz and experimental records of the decade sure I wish it went on longer and I wish it told me more but I guess that's just more reason to look out for the fifth installment of this series and when it ever ends it'll be interesting to go back and listen to all of them over again and see if the greater context of all these records just kind of adds to the experience I'm feeling a decent too strong nine on this one transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it

4pRxNcHyxKQ,haha hi everyone slave mini tre tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of my new self-titled record from singer/songwriter Michael Kiwanuka who frankly has been killing it for quite a few years now going gold in the UK with his last record and his debut record he actually does pretty decent numbers throughout Europe it's just over here in the US that he hasn't totally exploded yet despite him being one of the few current day mainstream parallel songwriters that truly embodies the classic sounds of American soul music now Michael is not simply that he is a singer-songwriter at heart also works into his music elements of psychedelic rock folk music making his catalogue so far a pretty versatile array of classic sounds from the American Songbook up to this point while I have loved a track here and there from Michael's last record his debut record I'm really yet to fall in love with a whole project their moments on Michaels records where I feel like his vocals just come off a bit too mild moments where the songs aren't as memorable or where the instrumentation production is a bit too sterile or overwrought I love what Michaels sound and style represents even the messaging behind some of his songs like the very lovesick and funny bones or the unflinching black man in a white world so up to this point I've been admiring Michael's work from afar but also feeling like something distinct or necessary is missing his latest record here self-titled third record I'm taking notice mostly because the teaser tracks from this album were so excellent easily some of Michaels best work so far you ain't the problem piano joint the show-stopping hero which sounds like a mid-60s protest song that would have rocked the Woodstock stage back in the day and while Michael has worked with Danger Mouse before on his last flank record he seems to now be the primary voice and brain behind the production here which i think has led to a sound that is far more representative of an era that Mykel so obviously borrows his ideas from but they achieved this without making this records appeal feel as if it is rooted in this nostalgia gimmick but seriously the drums the guitars the acoustics the string sections that light sheen of reverb on the lead vocals on so many tracks here all of it reads classic it's all very well produced and engineered and occasionally reminds me of stuff Danger Mouse has done in the past with the likes of The Black Keys on records like brothers or attack and release so this small change in aesthetic for Michael's music has actually meant a lot more appeal for me personally and I think Michael realizes the power in this newfound sound as well because there are quite a few vocal performances on this one that feel bolder on the front cover here he is not presented in shadow or not presented at all he is now looking like an emperor and considering this thing as a self-titled you have to assume that for Michael this must be some kind of defining moment for his identity as an artist and that's something I definitely sense in comparison with his previous records which just don't come off as confident as forthright the opening track you ain't the problem feels a lot more up front than a great deal of Michael's discography so far with its buzzing guitar leads it's zany lalalala background vocals Michael's lead vocal melody which zigzags in a very interesting way this mix of sounds feels equal parts tongue-in-cheek but also deathly serious it's an urgent but catchy blend of so many prevailing and revolutionary sounds from the 60s so that's how the record opens up how the record closes is with the very psychedelic dramatic string back ballad light which is a very moody but enjoyable finale for the project so strong finish strong beginning but everything in the middle is a bit a bit of a mixed bag especially these interlude tracks on the album I can appreciate that Michael wanted to create some cinematic through ways in the tracklist that made this album feel like an experience I think they could have been more evocative or creative though like the piano joint intro or the hero intro both of which sound like slowed down bits of music from the oncoming track that they're teasing pretty much musical extensions of these songs but again slowed down granted the audio on piano joint intro is enhanced with some very dramatic vocal harmonies and ominous drones so this one doesn't seem quite so pointless however the hero intro yeah this is just Michael's voice and guitar but like slowed down and I get literally nothing hearing this track transition into the actual song it's referencing and why these two songs are teased in this very specific way but no other tracks here I'm not sure there's also the loving the people interlude which I do enjoy the vocal snippet on some of the backing instrumentation too but the guitar solo on this interlude it's bad it's really bad it's sloppy beyond belief thank God it's short as far as abstract and transitional moments with great instrumentation and a justice message are concerned the best example is probably another human being the last leg of which with the very dark drones and the news report audio almost feels like something off of a god speed record but it still doesn't add that much to the overall sequence of these tracks for me personally so while the interludes on this thing may mostly be unnecessary the core tracks for the most part are very good like the song rolling one of the catchiest tracks here head bobbing groove very classic warm bassline strong theme melody - it's a very even blend of psychedelic rock and soul there's a little Sly and the Family Stone on this one a little Hendrix I would even say a little Creedence Clearwater Revival it's great then there's piano joint which i think is Michael's most powerfully sad song by a mile the piano progression on this track is great the strings are amazing they aren't super heavy they're not super in-your-face they add a subtle but effective backdrop to what Michael was doing on the piano what Michael is doing with his voice the sound is so stark bold somber it's lyrically simple but it's sentiment is still powerful the song hero from what I can read in lyrics sees Michael struggling with his image as an artist in a public figure what does Michael need to do to be seen as a hero or a larger-than-life icon being put on a pedestal building yourself into something you're not dying a hero's death these are ideas that this track explores pretty well and it does this against some incredible production a great tune very urgent and psychedelic folk rock with an instantaneously catchy vocal rhythm my hero my hero now the song living in denial feels like a pure soul throw back a soul hit single from decades and decades and decades ago it's very Isley's it's very temptations the grand show of horns the warm clunky bass that classic reverb just filling up the mix it's euphoric to the point where the track makes up for some of Michaels vocal shortcomings there are moments on this track where I think volume wise and delivery wise he could come off a bit bolder there's still very melancholic tone to his voice that you can't help but relate to though the track final days is the last track outside of the closer that really wowed me on this project it's one of the most undeniably modern songs in the mix here but aesthetically it's still presented in a very classic fashion the bustling beat the very smooth chord progression on this track the Moody atmosphere all of it reads more like something that would appear on a Radiohead record as opposed to what Michael typically comes off as being influenced by but again Michaels voice and danger Mouse's production makes it feel like it's all coming from a time where it just didn't exist it's like a really beautiful anachronism for sure in the tracklist there are songs that are pretty underwhelming I've been dazed feels like it is way too deep in a daze the songs solid ground dips also into a similarly dreary well as piano joint but gets less results the sequencing across the record also feels like a bit of a mess though that could have a lot to do with the interludes not being all that great overall I would say this is a very good record though Michael is sounding more charismatic than ever more compelling than ever the production is the best he has been on so far the songs are some of the best he's delivered so far the classic blend of psychedelic rock and Foulke and soul is great there are some pretty noticeable flaws on this record but nothing that kept me from truly enjoying it feeling a decent to a strong seven on this one

auy8wEk7Fww,yeah hi everyone trim Denis Boitano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new fka twigs record Magdalen singer-songwriter fka twigs she's back new album finally following up her groundbreaking contribution to the world of alternative R&B LP 1 back in 2014 it's been 5 years and even though twigs hasn't spent the entirety of that time silent listeners have been in the dark long enough to not really know where she's going to take her next record and the experimental R&B wave that twigs originally wrote in on is kind of gone at this point not to say the sound and influence isn't still there it's just that it's given away to so many other things now honestly I can't say I was too excited to give this new twigs album a listen mostly because I found some of the bigger teaser tracks to this record to be underwhelming or unlikable the track holy terrain featuring future just feels like a really awkward attempt at a commercial crossover and with loads of producers on it even though the beat doesn't sound that varied the future placements and ad-libs just are not necessary I cry I cry I cry I cry and the guys performance on the track is average at best you would think that since future is being given such an unlikely placement on this track he would pull out all the stops but no I do like some passages of the instrumental on this track I do like twigs vocal performance even though some of the vocal melodies feel muddled in the overly wordy lyrics and then we have the track home with you which had so much potential with its experimental instrumentation with its Radiohead ish piano chords but the way twigs vocals are treated on this track the way they're processed the effects laid onto them it's terrible it's so grating and so distorted is there a chorus on this too it's hideous beyond the effects I like that it sounds as if twigs is trying to be more expressive vocally on this project but I just can't stand a listen to this what's worse is the track works in multiple parts and none of those parts seem to come together they neither segue into each other effectively or they just end abruptly and then give way to a new part by the time the thing ends it's so unfulfilled Hollow it's built up little to no momentum even off the parts that are likable like that one passage with the gorgeous swell of woodwinds and synth bass it's so odd this is the only track that uses vocal effects this heavily and the only track structurally that just seems like a total mess I guess I'm happy that's the case because nearly every other track on this thing I think is good too great the only other major issues I have with the project honestly is cellophane which I loved as a teaser but as a closing track it just feels so anticlimactic I mean what I love about the track is it's so unbearably tragic with its sombre pianos and its hushed heartbroken vocals those refrains throughout the track don't do it for you but even though I love the tune love the lyrics love many passages of this song it has a non ending which leaves the finish of this album feeling very Hollow and the flow of the record for me instrumentally and narrative Lee is not really anything to freak out about either I think you could arrange these tracks in a few different ways and basically get the same results I mean don't get me wrong Thousand Eyes is very distinctly an opener with a lot of very mystical curious and shy vocals and instrumentation really lures you in it doesn't give too much away it makes you want more it's the ultimate art pop tease after a great tone setting intro the very disorienting home with you isn't the best contrast the very sleepy and repetitive but slowly swelling day bed toward the end of the record doesn't fit all that nicely up against one of the other quietest songs on the album The Closer either I do like the contrast presented in a lot of the lyrics on this track though at least in isolation I think most of the songs on this record are enjoyable the song sad day is a gorgeous track for twigs with a very clear stylistic pivot twigs very much moves away on this track from those subverted R&B grooves and chords off of LP one and she is firmly housed with an art pop territory right now and pulling from some very specific and obvious places to mostly Kate Bush the sound palette on sad day may be cold future and dark but the vocals are Kate Bush all the way that vibrato that regal but light tone twigs also really laying on her English accent and the Kate Bush worship on this record isn't entirely a bad thing I think twigs embodies the influence well even if I think it makes this record a tad bit less original than LP one and even if there is a bit of vocal overlap here and there I think twigs arrives at a lot of very different artistic conclusions than Bush ever did instrumentally songwriting wise lyrically for example this track features all of these glitchy noisy twittering passages of percussion and electronic instrumentation a lot of really cool progressions to the Kate Bush worship continues on to the track Mary Magdalene as well although after a somewhat Laurie Anderson inspired intro with a very bare and robotic vocal intro that is reminiscent of Oh Superman what's to come after this though is one of the most powerful moments on the entire record not only because of twigs very dynamic vocal performance but also because of the beautiful dynamic well-structured and ever-evolving instrumental here the lyrics are also pretty high impact as twigs gets I think more conceptual here than she is at any other point on the project with her words dealing directly in the perception of in the nature of women using Mary Magdalen story in history to explore these themes in a very smart way later I'm loving the tracks psychedelic vocal effects as well as IDM inspired instrumental passages it is very Bjork but still tasteful meanwhile the track fallen alien is a legitimate banger and maybe the most out-there track on the entire record if not only for its bright chilling and sharp chorus samples and fat base hits which kind of sound like something from Kanye Izzy's us it's very easy twigs vocals at the intro of the song are so freaky and stiff really embody the the feel of an alien trying to a moat on a human level but the singing lets loose and when I say lets loose she is borderline shrieking on this track her vocals the instrumental give off this supremely sinister vibe that I love I don't think fka twigs has proven herself on this album to be the most skilled vocalist I think a lot of her appeal comes down to weird breathy gimmicks and strange vocalizations but still I think she comes off incredibly expressive and very out there on this record in a way that is compelling beautiful intriguing the song mirrored heart is another highlight for me it sets a very bittersweet song against some somewhat awkward clunky instrumentation but the lyrics and the writing at the core of all of it are so beautiful and so great that they shine through all the weird bits of sound orbiting it and how again clunky all of it sounds becomes kind of a selling point a unique characteristic some of Twiggs best material so far is on Magdalene no doubt about that for sure that's what's feeling a great deal of the hype behind this new album which honestly I think is mostly justified I like it but is it twigs most consistent record so far no is it one of the most enigmatic or groundbreaking art pop records of the decade not really as special and as stunning as some of the vocals here are as respectable as the updates on the forms of Bjork and Kate Bush are there are some real guts in this tracklist here and again not that crazy about the flow there are a lot of great individual tracks here but as an album I don't really think this thing is greater than the sum of its parts I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please

4tMn-cTP_wQ,a little hat on my head oh that little hat a man hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a review of the new West Side gun mixtape Hitler where's Hermes 7 anyway this is the new buzz building mixtape from Buffalo rapper Westside gun first time I'm doing a focused review of his work on the channel even though he has been dropping projects for years now and effectively putting Buffalo on the hip-hop map and he's not alone in that because it's also thanks to his cohorts on the Grizelda Records label Conway Benny the butcher they all recently inked a deal with Shady Records and should have a collaborative project out sooner than you think and even though Grizelda records is mostly an underground phenomenon at this point they are turning some big heads in the industry whether you're talking about Freddie Gibbs and at doom Questlove jay-z just about every music writer in rap so even in the middle of the build-up to their shady debut Griselda is keeping up their usual output especially Gunn who seems to be the most prolific and this is just after dropping the sixth installment of this mixtape series last year a full-length album earlier this year this tapes been getting a lot of press at seize gun building his name up even further with some celebrated names like currency Fat Joe DJ Drama we have production from the likes of DJ Green Lantern also static select uh also Alchemist of course there are plenty of placements for his brothers and arms on this project to Benny the butcher and Conway now listen to a West Side gun project and you'll notice a very distinct style and set of themes right away guns very high voices very high nasal voice is instantaneously attention-grabbing for better or for worse his wild inflections are pretty unmistakable even if they aren't entirely original because there is something about his rap style that reminds me of a very specific era in Ghostface Killah 's discography like the early 2000s era pretty Tony album bulletproof wallets especially supreme clientele though gun kind of makes that creative connection for the audience already with his record last year supreme lion tell guns flows on this tape and most of his projects aren't super fast or skilled every once in a while he's not afraid to slightly slide off tempo or stretch a vowel to its breaking point and he never holds back on his trademark ad-lib even if it's mixed so high it's overshadowing his main verse get used to that so guns delivery can feel a little sloppy sometimes is that intentional probably more than anything the focus on this project seems to be on just sounding as grimy as possible in his best moments a gun exceeds on that front to the point where it makes up for his shortcomings everywhere else and those shortcomings are mostly lyrical or structural truth be told gun is not really much of a songwriter dude can rap dude can write but build a song out and create different sections or passageways not really in fact there are tracks on this thing that are so under written they feel just not finished or just like they're utterly pointless motifs mere impressions of songs that only exist to capture a fleeting vibe and then evaporate into nothing while there's something about guns style that reads classic reads old-school a time when there was substance in hip-hop there are a lot of tracks on this tape that are just as forgettable just as breezy as your average SoundCloud kid doing some auto-tune riffs over a generic trap beat what is love you if not that what is size 42 if not that Conny sun gan deck even if that track does have one of the better beats here and there are moments where these tracks are so bare so simple they remind me of other east coast rappers that also like to play it strip back rock Marciano kah but somehow gun doesn't manage to achieve the same minimal appeal now as far as the writing goes on this project the bars I wouldn't say they're terrible gun can write some verses but it's all pretty OneNote when you observe it across the entirety of a whole project there's a lot of references to high-fashion cocaine dealing violence one thing that makes guns writing sound slightly more eccentric than any other rapping about these same things is he works in a lot of wrestling references and not just giving nods to Ric Flair in the way your average rapper does these days so for sure this makes guns stand out that in his attempts to blatantly cross unfiltered thuggish nough swiff high class decadence I mean just look at the cover on this thing the ski mask the Balenciaga coat also if we go back to Supreme bla Intel we have the gun the Fendi Stocking going over his face like he's gonna rob somebody after wearing a designer stocking so I do commend and respect Griselda heavily for being so consistent with the visuals with the marketing it's actually pretty artsy and kind of reeks of authenticity too I mean certainly Conway Benny and Gunn have given us no reason to question that up until now but I feel like I have compliments and compliments and compliments for everything other than what is happening on the tracks on this tape because for me at the end of the day it really only sounds cool and intriguing on the surface for the most part gun doesn't seem to be able to or at least care about wanting to write an intro a bridge hook a topic a narrative I don't know he just kind of blurts out whatever loosely connected bars he can string together it's all just a non-sequitur soup in a way that reminds me of what action bronson was doing on some of his breakthrough projects like blue chips as well as dr. Lecter obviously with way fewer food references don't get me wrong there are moments on this thing we're gonna come off genuinely charismatic Andy says some genuinely sharp braggadocious stuff - like a oh don't try me Cartier's came out in 90 find me in the cocaine spot looking I see connect to Nomi on the first name basis I'm looking tasteless Chanel off the runway you on the waiting list we just slick but also kind of plain there's a lot of slang but nothing you haven't heard before if you've been on every major coke rap record since the 90s the wordplay is very light on this project if here at all on occasion Gunn will say something totally out there a wild simile a weird scenario supreme catcher mask looking like Mike Piazza Paul Smith fish we rained down with the choppers but very little of it adds up across the tape because of all the topical Dunnan sees the lack of coherent songs and of course there are plenty of spots on this thing we're gonna Zack Chua Lee overshadowed like on the track banana yacht where gun is actually barely on this track it's really a song by his feature guest who raps a couple of verses and gun pops and occasionally he also doesn't appear until the very end of the track it's possible for whatever reason he dedicates most of the songs runtime to one of the most comatose verses boldi James has ever recorded every Benny verse on this project though is great not only are his features in my opinion the best on this entire tape but they're actually better than many of his verses on his recent plugs I met EP especially the verse on the back end of lucha bros that signing skills line was hilarious but these are only a few of many moments on this project where gun ends up being one of the least interesting things on his own track there were only a handful of songs on this tape that stood out to me as being supremely good which is usually when gun himself is hitting a consistent flow or we're getting a great beat or the guest kind of carries the track a little bit like on Kelly's corner with that Joe or on cool G with Conway and Benny which has such good chemistry on it it has me psyched for that collaborative record or on Undertaker versus Goldberg which has a great beat switch after the first leg I love the woozy transition of synths and horns that fat dusty ass beat but as long as we're talking about production on this thing it is kind of a mixed bag every once in a while here we get some dirty fat classic hip hop drums creative use of sense awesome sample manipulations other times instead we get a very stale sample loop just playing over and over and over and over again the track banana yeah this singular string sample here is is this production is this a beat also lucha Bros and mind you I do like this track but this one sole sample playing again and again and again with only a few change ups it's mind-numbing and look there are some artists out there that I think pull off this this minimal repetitive instrumental thing very well but usually when they do it the sounds they bring to the table are a bit more evocative or the lyrics they bring to the table are a bit more thoughtful or there's a narrative or there's a concept they make up for that instrumental simplicity by providing other things to stimulate your mind but with Gunn there's not really another layer beyond what you're being presented with on the surface look there are a lot of tracks on this tape despite West Side guns very standout delivery that to my ears are just unmemorable filler and that goes for the short tracks and some of the longer tracks - honestly the vibe of this tape is the best thing that it has going for it the best thing I think Gunn has going for him across most of his catalogue if that's the wavelength you operate on which there's nothing wrong with that and you want to hear something that sounds a little old grimy dusty cold blooded then give this a shot you'll probably love it and I suppose I don't mind it either if this thing we're playing is somewhere near me I wouldn't be scrambling to turn it off I feel like I'm listening to something I've enjoyed before but now it's being presented to me in a diminished capacity I'm feeling a light too decent five on this one transition have you given this tape up listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Westside gun forever 
LFUkzI_suGY,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week they're all linked down below like usual also linked down below is our turntable a blank get a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on our channel over there we get kicked back from it supports the channel and everything we do also supporting the channel and everything we do is patreon.com slash the needle drop head over there and get some extra bonus monthly exclusive content patron only let's argues patron only classic album listening parties patreon.com slash the needle drop link down below all right the worst tracks of the week there are quite a few let's go through them one this new track from the new lil mo Z record you guys might remember how underwhelmed I was by his double XL freshmen activities this new track with him featuring trippy red never scared is so mediocre and so boring and so awful and so generic it's really indescribable at this point it's just a really bad woozi Melo trap with no soul or personality whatsoever and that is most likely the case for the entire LP all right we have a new little baby track whoa and yeah he just continues to sound like a young thug impersonator but with less charisma not quite as skilled vocally and very generic trap beat on this one too la rue has a new single out international woman of leisure and it's it's kind of unfortunate because I did love her last full-length LP I was looking forward to a new album when or if it was coming out and the beat on this track is so thin and it's so bad and it's so I guess anxiety inducing and how repetitive and I guess one-dimensional it is I don't really care for a lot of the vocals on the track either however I'm basing most of my dislike of this song on just how terrible the instrumental is this instrumental has got awful and and mostly just because it feels like it's stuck in this constant state of introduction you know what once once it kind of introduces itself it doesn't really grow all that much it's just a very flat flat instrumental that didn't really complement this track in in my opinion at all or really the song that LaRue was trying to bring to the table here so I don't know we also had this kind of a lead track off of dosha cat's new LP hot pink which I hope to be talking about very soon but still cybersex is the name of the track and I mean I've been hearing some tracks here and there from this new LP it seems so far really all over the place and just having a hard time wrapping my head around this track because it just sounds like a kind of watered-down Nicki Minaj impression like this is a song I feel like Nicki Minaj would have dropped in in the mid-2000s the late 2000s no rat rather I want to say late 2000s like in the late 2000s are really not even that this this is like some Super Bass era I would say Nicki Minaj sorry I'm having a hard time kind of placing that chronologically but still and and I don't think doja cat really brings anything interesting to this particular blend of pop rap so I don't know cybersex not really liking it I think it's kind of a little generic moving on from their new new best coast song for the first time yeah it's it's it's just very bad breezy pop rock with completely soulless production God this is this is such plan production the guitars the drums everything just sounds so plain and in an offensive and boring just kind of sounds like hanging out in an Ikea all day I just don't care for it and we also have a new track from Beck dark places I don't know how Beck gets seemingly more and more and more boring with every new single release it is heartbreaking this coming from somebody who used to love this man's output in the 90s and you know still to this day I rep heavy records like one foot in the grave i rep heavy records like the information which i think is one of his last you know great and also underrated records too but this I I just cannot I cannot I just can I just can't it's just it's just so boring it's just so boring alright let's get into the tracks I thought were met not blown away by them is certainly worth pointing at and you guys made dig them a little more than me so again pay attention we have a track nerve to reverse the song from a band going by the name of these New South Wales and again newer group they're also kind of like a comedy troupe it's it's a bit of maybe a multimedia kind of thing and this track is some not so bad very rowdy straightforward energized enjoyable punk rock and I don't know I'm just it's I'm kind of liking it I'm kind of liking it I'm sort of waiting for something distinct to kind of jump out at me and I'm hoping that that'll be the case when I try out their their new LP and just kind of see what that's all about so nerve to reverse these New South Wales check them out it seems like they have some you know some good things going for them and they're showing a lot of promise Ozzy Osbourne brand-new single the Prince of Darkness himself under the graveyard it's not bad it's not bad Ozzy has put out much worse stuff especially in the 2000s however this track to my ears kind of sounds like a 2000s you know era Ozzy track but what are the good ones you know what one of the good ones I mean it's it's got a kind of very sad and melodramatic intro the harder riffs come in later becomes super big anthemic it's very formulaic we've heard Ozzy put out tracks like this before but it's not bad it's not bad moving on from their ksi YouTube hero ksi just won that amazing match against Logan Paul right ksi beat Logan Paul KS Atlanta lemon lemon ksi Logan Paul yeah he'd beat the crap out of Logan Paul that's amazing that's fantastic I love it I love it I love it anyway he has a new track out amazingly featuring Rick Ross a little baby and I guess sx1 artist I'm not familiar with on here unfortunately but it's not great but it's it's a pretty competent track banger with a melodic chorus seems kind of thrown and cobbled together seems like you just kind of put this track out for the clout but it turned out not bad and it's kind of climbing up the the Apple music charts right now so I don't know good for him good for him came out with a popular track got some big names on it down like that ksi Jenny Beth of savages Fame is coming through with some solo material here I'm the man and it's it's a very abrasive cacophonous piece of almost industrial rock music I think there are points where the songwriting and the messaging really sort of gets lost in the chaos of what Beth is doing on this track but I still do like the the ruckus she's stirring here hopefully this is a taste of what's to come hopefully we get more sooner rather than later Jenny Beth I'm the man kind of digging it you know potential potential free nationals Anderson packs band they've been put out track after track after track after track with lots of different guests a range of different guests this new one is featuring Sid of the internet fame and it's very smooth very soulful very groovy pretty inoffensive but it's got a good vibe to it also club nights from the band dum this is a group I just kind of came across on Bandcamp Club nights is the name of the track also the name of the project they've just recently put out and it's a pretty good herky-jerky somewhat offbeat post-punk music if you like bands like parquet courts you'll probably fuck with this pretty heavy give it a try give it a shot we also have dave east new track off of his project survival this one features a little baby nightshift is the title of it and it's it's okay I mean every time I hear Davis music it sounds alright you know he's a competent rapper he seems to pick beats that aren't total trash but don't really stick out in any way shape or form and his writing typically just feels okay to me you know some similes here and there that are worth an eye roll but nothing that's like the worst thing I've ever heard you know he's just very middle-of-the-road to my ears and frankly despite how many times I've tried Dave East music every time he drops a new project and I get a few requests here and there to try it I still to this day have not been able to commit any not even a single second of his music to memory so mostly this track is going to be in one ear and out the other just like every other one and I don't know I mean obviously there are people out there who fucking with this dude's stuff heavily I mean they must be in order for him to be continuing in the fashion that he is but his music just does not really do too much for me frankly moving out from their dad who's this guy hey if you've been on YouTube a long time you know you know dad you know dad and he has a new track out featuring Danny Brown and it's all about a dad feeling good that feels good it's a song about what what's making dad feel good you know just kicking back watch watch some tube that sort of thing it's it's a weird dance rap track that's very tongue-in-cheek and very silly a shout-out to dead shout-out to dad clipping clipping has come through with a bit of a post album non album excuse me post album non-album single aqua code data breaks Shabazz Palaces featured on the song I could see why this would not have made it onto their new LP because this is not really stick anywhere into that album or could have not stuck anywhere into that record conceptually as this is not a very scary song it's it it is a really weird concept it's it's one of the weirdest concepts of any clipping song and truly and honestly it's the concept that I'm not even gonna get into it because I'd be spoiling too much I want you guys to try it for yourselves because it's one of the weirdest ideas that I think clipping is put into a song and it's just maybe a bit too much for me like okay guys like I get it you could do a song about like almost fucking anything but that doesn't mean yes I do like some of the glitchy elements of the instrumental though though some of the some vocal bits dahveed's flow I think is just kind of funny on this track and it's it's it out there song I mean I respect that clipping continues to you know really ride the fray I mean they they're just afraid the fuck out you know like they're the only group in hip-hop or really anywhere is it right now doing songs like this so you know respect for that of course even if I'm not super crazy about it still respect Beach slang covering another track from the new Beach slang record Tommy in the 80s is the name of this new one and it's it's a badass hard rock in tune production is a little blown out to the point where I think more than nuances and and likable qualities of the song and the vocals get kind of hidden and obscured in a way I'm not crazy about but still great energy good performance and you know just generally a likeable and fun fund is what I want to say fun alright let's get into the best tracks of the week tracks that I thought were the best the tracks that really stood out to me first off let's give a shout out to this you boa demo it's a demo you bow as an artist I've covered on the channel before if you are unfamiliar with their music with her music do go onto my channel look up this artist and look you're in for a harrowing experience with the latest record off of this project now what's also been teased via social media is a another project very soon not predicted to be as grand or as conceptual and experienced as the last record but we're getting a bit of a teaser and a taster with this little little demo here untitled 25 10 19 and it's pretty heavily layered and since it's a little disorienting toward the end comes to a really great climax give it a try give it a shot it's experimental as hell - alright poly Rosalia new single it's a banger banger alert and it's a one of the weirdest and darkest songs she has come out with yet I'm loving it super super super huge amazing respect for the flamenco Queen not that there's a whole lot of flamenco in this track either I mean obviously with Rosalia there's a little bit of that in everything she does but this is primarily a very groovy and dark pop song that's actually a little freakish - and loving that she's really heading in a unique direction with this track so just a huge respect amazing also this track over here which I caught from I think it was the Twitter from 100x because Dylan I think did production for this track over here to us from an artist who goes by the name of a Ravenna gold and keep going don't stop featuring little West and it's a funny little I guess blend of pop and hip-hop but it has that it hasn't it weird outsider kind of freaky colorful playful 100x personality to it that so many of us enjoyed off of a thousand gex so loving hearing that play out here in a way with a different artist and loving hearing I guess this thing that I'm enjoying with 100x evolved into its it may be its own little miniature trend you know influencing other artists and then getting them to make pop music but supremely out there as well so liking that liking that makes me excited alright poppy has come through Blood Money is the name of her new track and music video it is badasses fuck industrialists fuck loudest fuck blown out as fuck and [Laughter] it's not so much the groove metal and new metal vibes of her last big track this this is so much more dark and abrasive and very very freakin edgy edgy AF my boys a GAF I'm just like in the dark direction I think the music videos little campy probably some some huge Kill Bill vibes on it I'm not too crazy about the visuals but still loving the incredibly abrasive and experimental sounds that she's bringing forward for sure Poppy's going to find a new direction at some point in the future post this but I think what she's doing right now is very interesting all right Lucy Dacus has come through with another single in this series of tracks that she's been dropping throughout 2019 this new one is titled fool's gold and I wasn't even I'm aware of this and its original to I guess all these tracks that she has been dropping have been tied into or in reference to her inspired by a holiday that they were released around and I guess the inspiration for this one is New Year's which is actually kind of cool it's a beautiful tune Lucy's vocals on it sound great she has that wonderfully deep mature sound to her voice that definitely makes her stick out in the current singer-songwriter field give it a try give it a shot it's lovely alright mirages newest track from Jessie where it is a beautifully groovy dancey single it's a quality single good dancey grooves somewhat pristine light on the ears as well as a lot of her material tends to be so pretty groovy and euphoric I'll say that all right I want to point out a remix here of a track from gorilla toss they've come out with a little a little small remix project of moments from their twisted crystal project this new one over here meteor meteorological that's the track that's being remixed it's the cotan remix and yeah just some strong alternative house vibes coming off this remix of this track excuse me it's actually kind of interesting to hear gorilla music pursue the gorilla tosses music treated in this way fka twigs sad day song from her newest record Magdalene and not going to get too much into it because I plan on talking about this album very soon so you will get my opinion on this track and the rest of them as soon as the review on this jobs but you can know that this track I did love thought it was really good alright also shout out to Clarke whose comes through the new banger it's it's kind of a kind of a weird techno excursion a legacy Pet is the name of it goes pretty hard and is cold AF and robotic AF and I'm just loving the cold dark vibes off of this one and the black lifts they have a new record coming out in 2020 like the first thing next year and believe it or not it is if you can already tell from the last teaser which I which I didn't make any assumptions because the black lips have done all all types of tracks over the course of their career but I guess between this one that they've just dropped which is titled gentlemen and the last teaser that they drop that I thought was really good I guess they're doing a country album it's an honest to god black lips country album so again not the first time they ever dabbled in or referenced country music on their records but for them to do an entire album of country I think is a pretty cool and again gentlemen is the name of the track I think it's really good song and excited to hear the the lips go in this direction and Andy Scott has a new project out which is actually pretty you know amazing I'm just noticing now that this is like a five legged six legged zebra that's pretty cool but anyway if you like your electronic music dark and cerebral and heavily textured as Andy Scott's music tends to be then I would give this new collection of tracks a try give this track specifically versi a shot because it's really good and also want to give a shout out to the injury reserve remix of 745 sticky from 100 X it is very out there huge respect to Richy for doing what doing what he does on this track vocally a huge shout out to the production which is nuts I feel like in a way injury reserve made a stranger remix than even AG cooked it when he did a remix of 100 X you know a few weeks or a week or so ago so um shout out to the remix respect to 100 X and their influence the ripples that they've been making throughout the industry the connections they've been making throughout the industry and I think that is our weekly track roundup everyone hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this video they're all linked down below with once again our turntable a blank our patreon link and we will see you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
UtL5_lw0xtI,ah hey everyone anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new gangster album one of the best yet together DJ premier and guru as Gangstar dropped some of the most essential hip-hop of the 90s had an amazing run through that decade in a way they helped evolve the genre out of its rudimentary golden age in the 80s with more nuanced jazzy instrumentation boom bap beats conscious lyrics and cold-blooded flows that were heavily influenced by the likes of Rakim now of course gangster weren't the only artists around this time pushing these ideas pushing the envelope in general KMD De La Soul Tribe Called Quest main source which are only a few examples but Gang Starr was as early to the party as almost anybody and certainly helped lay the groundwork for more hardcore sounds to come for anyone who happens to be out of the know DJ Premier didn't just produce beats for Gang Starr his production graced tracks from numerous classic hip-hop albums over this time period Mobb Deep's the infamous nas's Illmatic ready to die ARS ones return of the boom bap also jay-z's reasonable doubt gang stars transition into the bling era in 2003 with the owners was pretty good certainly not as bad as some of their other 90s contemporaries still primo and guru decided to call it quits around the halfway point of the decade and they both kept dropping music respectively that is until guru passed tragically in 2010 now it would be safe to assume with almost 10 years since that point the chances of a new gang star album are just non-existent but DJ Premier actually made it happen with an assembly of beats and tracks he's been producing and structuring topped with vocal recordings of grew that were laid around 2005 to 2009 it's pretty ambitious to make a brand new album not a compilation not a b-sides collection and album under these circumstances even with the best stuff at your fingertips how much workable material could prima have possibly had I mean after all one of the best yet is gang stars shortest record so far by a mile the tracklist is also slightly padded out with some interludes and there are quite a few features on this project too I mean I don't think there are too many features and I think a majority of the features on this thing are very quality but if you're one of those sticklers that thinks a record can't have too many other artists on it you might be unhappy with the number of guests and again I can't say the number of people on this record bugs me all that much because for the most part they all stay pretty faithful to Gangstar sound and vision whether you're talking about artists here who are essentially voices from gang stars past or new faces whose work is obviously inspired by gang stars legacy J Cole Royce to 5/9 and throwing it back we have jeru the damaja on here we have tallied quali on here q-tip mo P big hug credit to Prima though for doing his best with what I think he had access to because this thing does feel like a legitimately new album it doesn't feel like a bunch of warmed over leftovers it flows really well like an album should and he came through with quite a few highlights there's the track lights out with mo P who have had connections to Gang Starr for years the track is pretty much a perfectly crafted boom bat banger with chilling piano chords epic shots of strings also savage performances from both guru and mo P that lights out gang chorus lights out is incredible guru on this track not only as a killer verse but it's packed with a lot of good one-liners also a very good refrain to that one bar about rappers joining sag because they're actors I liked it the following track bad name which has grown on me a little bit since I first heard it is is eerily relevant given the current rap landscape the Primo beat here is basic but classic guru is resting on a pretty tried and true flow that seems heavily influenced by Rakim it's like something we would have previously heard on step in the arena and gurus bars on this track are essentially about hip-hop losing its spirit its fundamentals to materialism commercialism it's so relevant it doesn't feel like an old guru track but more like a broadcast from beyond the grave much in the same way many tracks on Bowie's black star fell I get a similar vibe from the tracks so many rappers later on the record which is essentially about the struggles of existing in the music industry one-hit wonders show business in general we have the track hitman featuring q-tip which topically is a bit of an odd detour the track is literally about a hitman a mercenary the instrumental on this one is equal parts grimy and theatrical it's like listening to the hip-hop equivalent of a short film q-tips refrain on this one is a little silly I wish he had a verse or something but the selling point of the track is really gurus verses which go into grave detail over how cold-blooded and calculated this hitman is he's secretive he's shadowy watch out all of these tracks all these moments contribute to a pretty quality first leg of this album there's no material so far that's as thorough or as creatively genius as mass appeal or tons of guns or a moment of truth but so far all of gurus lyrics are focused topical pretty well written even though these songs aren't super long I'm not coming away from most of them wanting more and I think a lot of that comes down to primo structuring these tracks as well as he does it sounds like primo put a lot of forethought into nearly everything going into this record and the same goes for most of the guests royce two five nine generally might not be one of my favorite rappers but he does drop one of my favorite guest verses on this project I love his expressive delivery I also think it's great how primo interacts with his needle drop line with that little record scratch and the second leg of his verse becomes this beautiful tribute to guru that line about his ashes being on the boards is pretty incredible also very impressed with Jay Cole on family and loyalty too I think he put together one of his best features ever on this one second only to maybe some of the stuff he's done with jid where he's really doing his best to try to keep up with him the drums on this one feel a little light a little dry almost like something that could have been on the owners but these super dramatic strings and pianos on this track are too pretty for words guru's hook is also fantastic talking about diamonds and using it as a metaphor for things that last or should last like loyalty family in a way it's kind of a shame it's been stashed away for all this time following this is maybe my least favorite track on the entire project get together which is an attempt at a smooth flirty sensual jam I think gurus bars on the track are pretty slick charismatic what I don't really like here honestly is Primo's very weak attempt at making a luxurious instrumental with these plinky keyboard chords that sound like a cat jumping off of a piano there's also Neos hook here which is obnoxious the line about this being as much Spanish as I know is annoying MIDI Scott on the track is fine not blowing my mind or anything but I understand the need for a female voice to sort of come in and play counterpoint to what guru is saying on the track and in for the most part I again I think she's I think she does well I think she does well it's just everything else surrounding her verse and gurus verse that is so painfully unlikable in the last leg I think the record starts to waver a little bit telecoil ease guest verse in my opinion is just sounding very off I don't know what it is about his voice that just doesn't sound him that soulful warm rasp that he's usually known for those smooth and nimble flows that I've always loved from his music in the past just don't carry over onto this feature he sounds like you sticks out like a sore thumb in the mix and not in a good way the track bring it back here features a very cool verse from guru but I'm not sure I really needed this to just be a 50 second detour you know what I mean it's it's one of the only moments on the record that truly feels like wow this you this is like literally just some leftover work here and you just tossed it into the record when you really could have built it out a little bit and made this album a bit more robust the track take flight is very good though with its orchestral samples with its features from Freddy Fox and big showed the track being the latest installment of gang stars militia series essentially calling back to the first one they did also with Freddy Fox and big Suge so kind of bring in a full circle and the song bless the mic is the closer here and it's a pretty interesting change of pace as the beat here is very Spacey very ambient gurus voice is treated in a way where it sounds like again I'll go back to that phrase a broadcast from beyond the grave it's like he's giving us advice or just giving us perspective from where he's at now after having left this plane of existence also it's utterly to have all of these samples of rock him bless the mic bless the mic bless the mic the track is obviously a tribute to gang Starr's legacy guru's legacy but obviously referencing back to another great MC - overall this thing was a very good project turned out way better than I thought it was going to give in its posthumous given just how long it's been since guru has passed away how long it's been since Gang Starr wasn't was a thing even if there are some weak moments here and there I think one of the best yet does stay very true to what Gang Starr musically stylistically philosophically was all about this projects a very good celebration of that and also the artistic era of rap music that Gang Starr came from I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this one transition have you given this album

Ue7WGgA_2_Q,ah hey everyone a teeny bit tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new on amount of gucci album u.s.a yes this is the newest full-length album from chiptune and bit pop outfit Anamanaguchi and USA is their first record in about 6 years finally following up 2013's endless fantasy a project that at the time I was highly anticipating especially given some of the amazing non-album singles that led up to that point airbrushed mess my skateboard will go on aurora tracks that really painted a bright future for the bands fusions of pop rock and 8-bit music sadly endless fantasy despite highlights being on this project ended up being a little bloated one-dimensional I hoped we would get another record sooner rather than later but considering the previous Anamanaguchi album dropped in 2009 I guess I should have anticipated wait and it's not like the band to spent this entire time doing nothing in 2016 and 17 they did drop volumes 1 and 2 of their capsule silence 24 soundtracks they put out some singles Luke's knife city was certainly a little active either way Anamanaguchi is back now fully online with a new record and it's out via polyvinyl which is pretty cool the band has trimmed things back a little bit to a very manageable 14 tracks and 52 minutes I already went into this record loving the singles air online great teaser shimmering glitchy synthesis 1 manipulated vocal bits some thumping beats that sound like something out of a synth wave song and then some crunchy synth slap bass that feels like a Daft Punk relic it's an epic inspiring totally danceable electronic music composition and of course given some of the 8-bit tones and the synth patches the whole thing sounds incredibly video game music influenced specifically a golden age sitting between late era nes and early era n64 it's like I'm listening to the soundtrack to a 2d space shooter mixed with a racing game mixed with an excellent Japanese RPG we also have the equally good lorem ipsum which kicks things off with these eerie heavily processed lead vocals it sounds like a course of alien singing quietly into my ear but the song does bring another thick grand explosive display of 8-bit sense booming distorted drums as well but the percussion on this track sounds live and gets pretty aggressive too the track has an amazing build incredible melodies the whole thing sounds like I'm saving the fucking world with my closely knit group of super-powered anime friends we're all combining our lasers to create like a giant rainbow blast into an asteroid that's going to just crash into the planet and kill everyone the final climax of the track leads to this very dystopian droney ambient outro it's really intriguing especially when what sounds like ocean waves start creeping into the mix as well as some deep unsettling ghostly bass so between these two tracks these two teasers there there's a lot more versatility than there was I think throughout a great deal of endless fantasy so given that I was pretty excited to hear the rest of this album I dig the curious and strange intro that leads into lorem ipsum the slowly climbing and falling synth notes the digitized chance of u-s-a it's one of those introductions that works incredibly well just by virtue of being so weird you wonder what's going to come after past this point the band just keeps delivering one high-octane 8-bit banger after another the song CRT woods features these 50-foot high walls of burning synthesizers I'm loving the mix of sequenced as well as organic drums on this project it gives what on mana Gucci does a sometimes rigid and sometimes punky feel the mixing of all the synth layers on this track for as dense as they are is excellent I'm also loving just how nostalgic the tone of these since are just kind of hits me right in that gamer vein but this track and many others on here are still far from being purely an exercise in nostalgia as much as memory plays a role in the concept of this project because the heavy bass the punchy beats the panoramic mixing this thing is unquestionably a modern record the song sunset biplane is one of a handful of tracks here the features guest vocal in this particular case it is Caroline Lufkin I think her breathy vocal performance on this track is okay I mostly act by how her voice sounds mixed into the track in a way where it just feels like it's riding on top of the instrumental it's not in the thick of all the other instrumentation which makes the vocals feel despite how quietly sound overpowering in a really awkward way it's even worse on the track on my own featuring Hannah which by comparison I think is a much better tune with much better singing but once again the band just can't seem to get a good vocal mix on this project even with arguably the biggest guest on the project Hatsune Miku the legendary Vocaloid singer really software and in a voice bank but whatever Hatsune A's voice turns up all over at multiple points of the song PSX which is actually one of my favorite tracks on the project I love the slickly melodies on this track the bubbly 8-bit arpeggios and the driving riffs the Vocaloid bits do add a lot of character to this very aggressive track but they are amongst some of the quietest sounds in the mix you would think that it's it's a bit of a feature here that they would be displayed more prominently it's not the worst thing because that Vocaloid sound does tend to melt in with all the other synthetics in the track and it's still a high point on the project still a very energized and exciting and super catchy moment thankfully up to you with me she is the best balanced track vocally on the entire project the singing is very nicely laced into the rest of the instrumental which just makes it easy to enjoy the track sharp beats and richly layered synthesizers it's like rings of multi-coloured hearts swirling in every direction so even though some of these vocal cuts are the album's Achilles heel the highlights still continue the song overriding incorporate given this tracks video game since the very straightforward mid-paced kick snare pattern the epic builds this is like automata Gucci's take on an EDM anthem there's even something a little Porter Robinson about it but given Anamanaguchi has remixed Robinson's music before and I think Robinson is a fan as well that that just kind of makes sense we also have a few very glitchy cinematic interludes that add a lot of character to the flow of this project too whether it be a poofy neolite or speak to you even though it's longer than the other interludes here the tract tears well which does a really good job of setting the stage for the album's grand finale with these monumental synth layers that sound like a hundred orchestras just screaming on top of each other listening to it is like staring into the Sun and we also get a reprise of the us a chance then we have the tracks we die which is effectively the final moment of the album outside of the somewhat ambient outro LOM which I think does a very great job of resolving the album in a beautiful way we die takes its sweet time to evolve out of these fragmented synth passages a very soft beat begins to introduce itself and suddenly everything is following suit orbiting around that and immediately after this it's nothing but plucky 8-bit since roaring bass house inspired kick drums it sounds like if Zedd and Crystal Castles were taking turns beating Master Blaster and now they're finally at the ending credits overall it's a very strong finish to a pretty consistent and creative album which again did have some vocal mixing issues but nothing that derailed the entire LP but seriously what an accomplishment for Anamanaguchi this project is the record sounds and feels great I would say it's a must here for this niche genre and also there are qualities about this record that I think should lead to a transcending outside of the 8-bit world because the melodies the compositions the layering the mixing all around even if the aesthetic of this record is very specific they're really good fundamentals on nearly every cut here it's why I see no reason why fans of EDM or videogame music at large and be getting into this record also instrumental rock fans to don't miss out don't assume the whole 8-bit thing Pinzon amount of gucci on this record to a particular post or genre and that's it because that is merely the banner under which the group explores so many different sounds and styles I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

n8yFCmjXZeE,oh this new highly suspect album it's not good a highly suspect is a band out of Massachusetts and they've been active for a little more than half this decade now and their past couple of records they were just pretty much a straight alternative rock band sure maybe their last album was a little over produced but there was certainly nothing that was super stand out about much of what the band was doing the one weird totally unexpected thing was that they were signed to 300 entertainment which is primarily known as a rap label I mean some of the biggest artists on there include young thug Megan the stallion T Grizzly Reggie Snow is on there too Fetty WAP was on there as well again outside of that nothing particularly about the band's sound that would make you go WOW or would make you stop in your tracks I know that certainly was the case for me not amazing but certainly not terrible and I do get a lot of requests to listen to their stuff try it out so of course the man comes out with another record I am curious to try it and it is easily one of the worst things I've heard in 2019 and it's unfortunate because I could really tell they were shooting for this more mainstream widely appealing record where creatively so many different ideas and sounds and even features coalesce onto one very unlikely project I mean this thing features not only young thug but also Gojira the metal band Gojira which I don't think any modern popular record has ever done such a thing so I can at least commend the band on the variety and versatility that they are sort of shooting for on this project but God are the performances production songwriting and instrumentals on this record terrible and given just how many ideas or sounds the band are shooting for on this one it's like each crack is doing its own type of terrible it's like really a torture chamber with different sections and pathways and obstacles to make you unhappy from the opening track fly which was almost like a test of my sympathy because yes there are some serious and personally painful issues addressed on this song issues of suicide the issues of abandonment substance abuse issues - but the instrumental is unbearable it's like a combination of AJR imagine dragons in that depressive little peep angle the lyrics are so painfully sophomoric and just surface level they don't really require one to think about what's being said all that much everything is put so plainly it becomes almost excruciating like I wish I had someone to give me some love I wish I had someone to give me a hug I'm sick of the liquor and sick of the drugs I wish I could just stop fucking up which could be a genuine expression of sadness and a cry for help something that Johnny the frontman of the band actually needs but it's it's still not really playing out all that well in song nor do I really care for the tone of the track making this emotional suffering that he's going through into like I don't know a synth afire arena rock anthem the following track 16 doesn't offer much better material with the opening lyrics and the hook it took me 16 years to find you one second to love you seven years to hold you one minute to lose eeeh and what's even worse is the singing switch up on this track the vocals do not really sound much like the vocals on the intro or many of the other tracks here either I would describe the singing on this one as like a combination of Darius Rucker from Hootie and the Blowfish and Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers we are really seeing those terrible matches of the most cliched sounds of the 90s all over this project later into the lyrics we get these laments about a puppy love essentially being done being over things changing but poetically it does not really improve can't say I'm all that crazy about the overblown very dramatic instrumental even more excruciating is the following freak streak where we get one of the most garish vocals on the entire record be the shit you talk about a shot stupid drama now it's sunny out I'm riding how shut your stupid drama mouth once and why does the instrumental sound like such a cheap piece of just overly touched up synth pop it it is terrible it gets even worse with what I guess you could call maybe a rap verse in the second half where Johnny's vocals get particularly goofy the lyrics on the album just get worse and worse and worse yeah I'm an outlaw baby with a southpaw view Donald's a bitch and Vlad Putin is too what this is like some really bad fo edgy rap metal from the 2000s type of writing here I don't fucking care if you fucking care no one's gonna live forever so you better be prepared not gonna lie that part's pretty Death Grips but it's really that terrible ultra commercial alt-rock soaring chorus quality of it that makes it feel so cheap and almost disingenuous because no after this record I really don't honestly buy into highly suspects apathy I don't think that they don't care there is nothing left field extreme or out there enough about this record to make me feel that all this album serves us is cheap profitable acceptable rock rebellion the track upper drugs is another track about drugs it gives us hints of grungy guitars it's very Cobain inspired I would say a Cobain ripoff at points the whole instrumental feels like an amalgamation of all these 90s sad rock cliches and they're pieced together into this mostly disingenuous Frankenstein monster with even the final moments of the track sounding like something out of Soundgarden Superunknown the track Tetsuo spike is one of a few cuts here that is just an instrumental interlude this one is so crumbly produced and assembled you can essentially take a screenshot of fruity and just paste over it in big impact font music production is my passion and that would be this track after this we start getting some of the album's key features like the cut here with young thug gotta say thugger went way harder on this track than he needed to his vocal here is easily the best vocal on the entire record it's pretty much a big synth back trap ballad that is way too dramatic for words melodramatic I mean things get even worse when Johnny starts performing as a terrible Johnny which I guess is an alias of his that he does on record we get these really bad unbearable ad-libs in the background of what is it dirt boy dirt life dirt bike there's so many ideas that just should have not come out of the studio we then get into the track with Gojira on it SOS which is a hard transition a very hard transition as the previous cut is pretty mellow the intro I imagine kicks off with Gojira dropping in with these thunderous sludgy guitars and drums it is super animalistic I would say way too animalistic for this record as it is abrasive to the point where it sounds hideous and doesn't really fit in with anything else what is even weirder is that immediately after this highly suspect starts working in a song and these guitars that are a blatant Queens of the Stone Age rip off with even Johnny vocally sounding like he's just doing his best Josh Tommy impression like this is literally the equivalent of Greta Van Fleet ripping off Led Zeppelin and for whatever reason on the course of this track the way that it transitions into these super heavy blown-out guitars the production suddenly becomes just so compressed it is unbearable I'm just wondering what what goes into the writing of these tracks because for the most part the song so far and in really for the rest of the record just sound like completely messy sloppy almost random combinations of all these stale rock tropes from bands that I mean are super popular really obvious that you're pulling from these groups like it's it's really actually distracting when there's a moment that sounds exactly like a Red Hot Chili Peppers song when there's a moment that sounds exactly like a Nirvana song when there's a moment that sounds exactly like a Foo Fighter song after this I think the records unbearable qualities let up for just a little bit Arizona is an acoustic ballad that while not amazing is not offensively bad juzo is a decent I guess kind of very ephemeral Cinthia interlude that doesn't really add up too much and then the Silk Road with T grizzly I can at least say that this track features one of the better Teague Risley features I've ever heard I I don't really care for much of what Johnny and highly suspect in general have done on this track but it hey grizzly kills it the song taking off is also pretty difficult to digest it's maybe a very weak attempt at an industrial rock song with what sounds like these kind of thin crunchy sampled guitars it's a little Nine Inch Nails it's still a little more Queens of the Stone Age some of the vocal harmonies feel vaguely Alice in Chains and for the most part the song is not memorable the lyrics are trash the singing and production are mediocre is hell really the only thing that is maintaining my interest in this album past this point is just to see what gets ripped off next and how bad the ripoff is I mean the following track these days features these chunky heavy alt-rock guitars that are very Weezer esque I would say even some of the singing and writing is pretty Rivers Cuomo inspired to the final song not the outro but the song Snow White on the record is one of the weirdest combinations of ideas as there are elements that feel a little Foo Fighters inspired especially the vocals there are elements especially the the modern psych guitars on the track that are a little Lenny Kravitz inspired I would say there are more Red Hot Chili Peppers vibes coming off of this track too there's just not really a moment on this record truly and honestly where I feel like I am listening to highly suspect deliver a sound that is distinct undeniably them everything is like a deja vu moment from something else but done much much worse the last track Nairobi is pretty much a non-sequitur another moment that feels like music production is my passion and geez what what a sorry reflection of the state of rock music if this is even a rock album I guess there are quite a few elements of rock music to it yeah this this was not gratifying this was a thankless in the worst way this highly suspect album was not good 
3mE4p3Ctlek,ah hi everyone droned any bone tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the New Sun record pyro class this is a new record from the pioneering drone metal duo known as Sun a musical project that has been a defining force in the world of drone doom just drone music in general name something new and uncompromising ly heavy and I'd argue Sun has had some degree of impact on it the duo had an unquestionably amazing run in the 2000s things have more or less settled down since then but not completely with sun dropping a bunch of collaborative releases short form records like canon that weren't entirely made of new material it wasn't until this year that the band actually dropped a brand new project of brand new material with life metal this record also saw production from music legend Steve Albini and featured one of the richest heaviest and thickest sounds of any Sun record so far aesthetically and compositionally though nothing entirely new for Sun though I understand the option for simplicity on this one given just how great the recording was so life metal drops it's pretty good sounds great and shortly after the release of this record Sun announced another album around the corner pyro class basically more tracks taped in the same sessions but they're all stemming off of these ritualistically performed modal drones that the duo and their collaborators would engage in before and after recording sessions now given these are just timed improv essentially in a way extras one would go into this thing thinking that hey maybe it's not going to be that great maybe it's not going to be that substantive maybe there's not really much of interest here it's just extras but this record is actually really solid I will say that I enjoyed elements of this thing more than I did life metal the biggest issue I have with PI class truly and honestly is that it's kind of short at 44 minutes it's a fraction of life metals run time it's a fraction of the run time of many classic Sun Records but it still manages to be pretty engaging given the limitations of these improvisation 's and maybe their urgency as a result of that I think all the pieces on this record are a lot more dynamic and active than many of the endless soundscapes featured on life metal now of course these observations are really all within the context of Suns discography of course your average listener who's never heard of son before and has no idea what they do most of their stuff probably sounds the same and one track doesn't sound all that much more detail than another but as someone who's been listening to and enjoying and seeing son live for a long time I'm really digging this collection of tracks I'm loving the intro cut frost sea with its B steel guitar tone and harsh swells of distortion it is way more abrasive than most moments from life metal also in the mix what sounds like this otherworldly wind blowing up from hell and taking up a pretty large amount of space and the volume and textures on this track are very intense and just very huge they're moments on this song that sound like the entire world is just collapsing in on itself it's actually pretty incredible the material here was spur of the moment the drone reaches a point where it begins to resolve beautifully begins to get brighter opens up more space is in there the guitars start shifting chords pretty quickly much more quickly than one would expect in a Sun song and I love it quite a bit I'm just on the edge of my seat waiting for how these chords and and tones are going to resolve next on the track kingdoms following this the intro isn't that much different than I think your average son song or performance but in the thick of all these drones this Distortion these guitars it sounds like there are maybe some major scale melodies playing or just very righteous intervals fighting through this hellish haze it brings a bit of brightness to suns typically dark sound the following track which I hope I'm pronouncing correctly is it amplified ease either way it sounds like the Greek god of amplification the really does live up to its title with its gurgling skittering drones it's the first son song I've heard that I would dare call kind of glitchy there's a lot of subtle submerged noises hanging in the mix to that feel like they are obscured behind a wall of hideous mud either way they really pepper the main drone of the track with a lot of texture this track also hits a point where the tones that you're getting laced into the drone feel kind of serene there is a slow cycling rhythmic almost hypnotic quality to some of the secret sounds hidden in this drone that I like a lot and then there's the closer ascension whose drone is very odd it's like I'm listening to a bunch of tones individual tones lining up just coalescing and ringing in unison in a way where they feel like they are alien they're not of this world easily one of the boldest sounds on the entire record and pretty gratifying as an improvisation throughout overall for a Sun record I found pyro class to be pretty fast enjoyable direct not as major or as experimental as key records like monoliths and dimensions or the collaboration with Boris or black one but for me this one was anything but underwhelming a pretty interesting concept that yielded a lot of very engaging results feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the

f61jC1yPe4g,hi everyone sad the need a tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Earl EP feet of clay this is a new collection of tracks from mr. Earl Sweatshirt he dropped them just this past Halloween which is a move you can't help but read into especially given that it is earl will this be his darkest and scariest project yet after all the front cover does look more like something that would typically grace the front of a fiery black metal album a black goat sitting in the middle of what looks like a dimly lit forest this thing looks like it's about to ask me if I want to live deliciously I'm also curious about this EP drop in the Halloween connection given Earl's last full-length records some rap songs which came out last year and is unquestionably one of the most depressing hip-hop records of all time the lyrics Earl's dejected delivery his loose flows all over this project all of the enveloping instrumentals that make you feel like you're drowning in slow-motion yeah they all add up into a pretty depressing experience some rap songs may not appeal to most people but for anybody who's even had a brush with the types of emotions that influence that record you know so I went in two feet of clay mostly wondering are we going to hear more of that something else admittedly when I tried the track East from this EP I was pretty underwhelmed by it there were some elements of the track that I thought were likable the tight and mystical woodwinds sample that makes up 90% of the instrumental a few spare witty bars here and there the focus conceptually on the loss of loved ones but the production is very repetitive very OneNote not all that evocative and while Earl's rapping isn't terrible it's way too sloppy and rambley to feel musical song structure isn't much of a factor on this track either nor was it on most cuts from some rap songs though at least all of those tracks as a record came together effectively reinforcing each other each song on that project dragging you deeper into a depressive abyss in comparison feet of clay isn't nearly as cohesive for the most part I fail to see how these tracks really build on each other it's mostly like listening to bunch of random odds and ends that aren't very compelling the wrapping is too apathetic the instrumentals are too plain despite their low Phi and somewhat subversive pedigree beats from some rap songs like red water or nowhere to go had qualities about them that were intoxicating woozy oddly attractive despite how dark many of the album's core themes were I can't give the same compliment to most of the beats on feet of clay there are a few exceptions like with the track OD I love the grimy disorienting choppy samples on that track the instrumental sounds equal parts confusing and tragic and oddly enough this is one of the few moments on this project where Earl's wrapping is confidently metered and pretty consistent flowing very naturally it just happens to be over one of the most oddly shaped instrumentals in the batch this being pretty different from what we get on another track here and tomb where the vocals feel so disconnected from the beat why even have a beat at all it's like we're basically in spoken-word territory at this point now granted this track like many others here does have worthwhile lyrics they're still the strong sense of mourning going on though matically the 25 quarter to life bar was smart the socialite reformed alone every night bar was clever Earl also writing about still having bones to pick with his father which is continuing those mournful themes of this EP of some rap songs but still it's not enough to make this one a highlight there's also el Toro combo meal which features another instrumental i think is great there's these really haunting and maybe even pitched vocal harmonies or just a melody of some sort that sounds really ghostly in the mix also loving how choppy the rhythms are in the glamorous jazz pianos what I can't say is that the addition of Mavi a rapper who is obviously very inspired by Earl Sweatshirt was all that great of an addition to the track for the most part as he's rapping he just sounds like an angry or version of Earl it feels as redundant as having young thug and little baby on the same track at the same time I do think the really fat compressed heavily reverb vocals that Earl throws in into the second half of the track are pretty intriguing though one of the weirdest vocal placements I've ever heard Earl work into one of his projects I just wish this EP took more risks along these lines there are a few left-field ideas on the two-part tisk tisk and cookies as well the stuttering piano samples the weird transition at the midpoint Earl's rapping is actually pretty entrancing but still without stronger material surrounding this track in others here it doesn't add up to a whole lot the greatest disappointment on the record though is easily the closing track for n which is the longest here by a mile almost five minutes in length and has a Mikami feature on it and it's like Earl his guest and the instrumental are all in a competition to see who can be the least interesting the whole intro lasts about the length of half of the songs here then when Mikami does eventually come in it's like he's spitting these faux deep super esoteric abstractions they sound cool in the moment but ultimately are fleeting and lyrically Earl is pretty much on the same wavelength on this track and there are any number of rappers that spit along these lines that honestly I would rather listen to because they would show more focus and technical ability on a song like this whether it be Milo Billy woods blue uncommon NASA yeah feet of clay I'm pretty indifferent toward it I feel like in a way this project sounds the way that Earl must sound all the time to people who react to a project like some rap songs and say oh this this is boring nothing's happening Google I'm feeling a decent - a strong 5 on this one transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like feel like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out and

pkYovkFI1P8,mm-hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another great album segment where i go over a bunch of records that have dropped over the past month or so and they're ones that i loved ones that i thought were great ones that i thought were worth your attention and i don't want them to slip through the cracks anya so i point just your eyes to them one more time and just say hey make sure you hear this because i think it's pretty good yeah like the new one from Metallica huh there's there's a new album from Metallica right here buddy check them out bring in new from Metallica that's the new one those are socks coulda fooled me can a you like review them anyway uh well good colors a nice Master of Puppets embroidery they look like they're made of good material I wish I had a pair bet you already though ride the lightning and wu-tang Sachs and kick Cody Sachs stance that cab is that where I get suck yes yes Shh don't tell anyone but there's a 10% off link in the description box too well anyway let's get into some of these other records over here first off I want to give a shout out to the new clipping album there existed in addiction to blood god this is such a good horrorcore album it is a horrorcore album it is a hip hop record about horrifying things like monsters and death and blood and guts and stuff but the production and the storytelling is very much inspired less by horrorcore traditionally as a genre up until this point and more inspired by horror films horror cinema which I think leads to this album being a pretty cool and unique experience one of clippings coolest concept so far the production is heavy noisy industrial for the most part very texture rich and a lot of the stories are compelling and eerie and creepy it's a very freaky little record and good on clipping for staying creative and staying cutting-edge next the new Caroline pull a Czech record think of this album as like the art pop equivalent to the new Charli XCX record still embracing a lot of these futuristic and very PC music aesthetics in the realm of pop but going in a much heavier more cerebral art pop arts your direction with it and I like it I like it a lot really great production great tunes great vocal performances tasteful all around one of the most lovely listens I've had this year next also want to shout out the new lightning bolt record great noise rock album just melting my brain the lightning bolt embrace some poppier catchy er sweeter modes of rock music on this one some hooky air tracks some more melodic lead vocals some steadier bass work so it's not as frantic and it's not as abrasive as a lot of their earlier stuff though I still think it sounds very much like a lightning bolt record there are still some troupe banger in the tracklist here - and all around I think it's a quality project their best one in a while next Ana Franco electrical little electric chicken heart is the name of her latest full-length LP and if you want to hear a short fun bubbly album of jazz pop samba some chamber pop though I already said pop but still all of that coming together into a mix of instrumentation that sounds like a bunch of Brazilian art school kids from the 70s or playing it give it a listen it's fun as hell shout out to Danny Brown for you know what I'm saying great record fantastic record from Danny not as long and not as ambitious as a lot of his previous stuff but still a lot of worthwhile songs on here a lot of bangers a lot of great bars Danny essentially finding himself in a place where he's like attained modern vet status and really kind of coasting on that classic Danny Brown energy over some really good production so check it out don't miss it also my boy richard Dawson uk-based singer and songwriter comes through with effectively a sequel to his peasant album a couple of years ago a lot of parallels between this record and his previous one it pretty much seems like he's telling a lot of the same sad concerning societal critique based stories but instead he's now telling it to us from a much more modern perspective with this record being titled twenty twenty actually twenty twenty a little into the future so there is something that is slightly dystopian about this record basically telling us a tale of the hell that modern society and the people in it are going to be living in very soon playing as great Tunes or great energy is great love the rough lo-fi production love the versatile instrumentals also just love the concept of this thing through and through 2020 richard Dawson amazing record and finally an album that um you know I I have caught a lot of backlash on and that's fine not everyone is going to like everything that I like but the new hobo Johnson record the fall of hobo Johnson I think is a really good mix of hip hop and pop punk and fulk I think hobo Johnson tells a lot of relatable stories on this record about loneliness and love really a range of very upsetting emotional issues I think it's mostly his vocals and his lyricism and his delivery that turns people off of the honesty and the authenticity behind a lot of what he does but still it's it's not for everybody it's really truly not for everybody but hey you know if you're liking it I'm liking it we're enjoying it together uh bone Johnson yeah so that has been it for this episode thank you very much hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this vid one more shout out to our sponsor for this video Stan's calm cool socks and transition have you given these albums a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan oh great albums forever 
pccO0anCKZY,
sOBY0PcjusQ,ah hi every one month and he's stashed Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new swans album leaving meaning this is the 15th full-length album from experimental noise and post rock band swans michael gira and company are back after a short hiatus and a bit of a reformation leaving meaning is said to be from a new iteration of the band something post the recent amazing trilogy series of albums that they dropped this decade the seer which is uncompromising ly dark and harrowing the crushing and explosive to be kind and then the amazingly thick and transcendental the glowing man these records not only account in my opinion for some of the best material so far in swans discography but also some of the best rock music of this decade and after such a mind-expanding set of projects I was interested to hear where swans would go next as far as this being a new version of the band looking at the liner notes a lot of familiar faces are still in the mix here at some point even percussionist thore Harris all of the placements and involvement levels of each musician isn't 100% clear because the liner notes are a little jumbled but what is obvious is that this swans album much like every recent swans album feels like a huge communal undertaking with michael gira spearheading the whole thing we do seem to get some names outside of the usual swans powwow though ambient and electronic music artist Ben frost performs on the record singer and composer on Avon house wolf is here too even Jeremy Barnes and Heather trust of a hawk and hacksaw Fame which is a pretty amazing indie crossover that I would have assumed would happen earlier given their love of things like hammered dulcimer sonically and stylistically though leaving meaning doesn't seem like that much of a departure from what swans have been doing as of late the linear song structures the epic builds the intensity the mysticism the cerebral and hypnotic vibes that's all here again with a few variants across the tracklist the glossy tones on the track aniline guitars and sparse pianos on this track just Sparkle beautifully and elegantly and there also seems to be a bit of gospel influence in Michael Gira's vocal performance here in the chord progression and we hear the return of swans dabbling in gothic country on the song it's coming it's real prior to the release of this album I thought it was a great moment and now that I hear it in the thick of the entire record I still love it we also have the haunting and eerie vocal harmonies and creaking instrumentation on the nub which sounds like something out of a psychological horror movie or a witch's coven I also think the ritualistic and tribal chants on the track son fucker are thrilling also this song features one of the most grand instrumental progressions of the entire album with all these layers of hammered dulcimer and strings bells and what sounds like maybe accordion at one point the track transitions into this very steady sinister groove which for swans at this point is a pretty tried and true formula it's just done really well again here but as much as I enjoy the ideas on this record I feel are pretty new and refreshing across the album they're just too few and far between I think leaving meaning feels more like an album that is a reiteration for swan's more than it's an expansion with a handful of tracks failing to adequately progress compositionally across their six or ten-minute runtimes I guess I was a little naive going into this record thinking because it's 30 minutes less than a lot of the to our album swans has been dropping as of late then the tracks are gonna be more direct they're gonna get to the point but sometimes the expected climax the end or even in the middle of a song never really arrives and what we get as a result of that are just ephemeral ideas and maybe a lack of direction I mean even with enough one of the most texturally gratifying songs on the entire record the band never really puts a stamp on all this tension they're building up for the duration of the track and the last few moments are spent just giving us a drone that slowly dissipates into nothing I do find this album to be kind of a breeze in comparison with a lot of swans reefs and stuff it's it's actually kind of easy to get through despite it being 90 minutes it was also pretty simple making heads or tails of what moments and tracks appealed to me and which ones didn't and that's partially because I don't really feel like I'm listening to much of a progression or flow across the entire album I don't think these tracks reinforce each other all that well I don't feel like I'm wrestling with a large cohesively arranged beast as each track here feels pretty isolated and sectioned off and even though I think leaving meaning is a good is a solid is a likeable project they're just too many tracks here that again I feel like didn't climax in the way I would have liked or just didn't go far enough the song the hanging man for example sounds like the intro or the first leg to maybe a larger more consequential song earlier in the swans discography but instead it just gets tedious over the course of its runtime because it mostly relies on the same guitar lines again and again and again what few transitions we get aren't really that great or gratifying or tension releasing Gira's shouts on the track aren't even really as rousing as I would have liked I was somewhat underwhelmed to by cathedrals on heaven as well as some new things even though I do love the great groove and Gira's vocals on that track the tone of this song is impeccably sour and menacing but the track pretty much hits you with this same singular vibe and sound for all of seven minutes and I just feel like it could have done more my least favorite track on the entire record that was most likely the title track the vocals are way too washed out compositionally it is bland and the instrumentation for the duration of the track feels like it's constantly stuck in the state of I don't know starting or in trowing or just setting the tone but it never develops into something all that substantive or gratifying I'm happy to report though that there are more highlights on the second disc than there are on the first the nub it's coming it's real both of which I talked about in both of which for the most part I think are great the song what's this is a favorite as well I love the tribal drumming on this cut the folksy layers of strings to Gira's lead vocals feeling wearier than usual it's it's a very somber song enchanting - and the sparkling crescendo that's offered to us in the second leg of the track is fantastic it's one of swans most mellow and wondrous acts in a while and we also have my phantom limb which is a manic and disorienting closer with all these jeera vocal layers where he's shouting and ranting some of the vocals are deadpan - in a way it reminds me of very very early swans like filth and cop era swans but without the same primal noise rock Rivage even though instrumentally it sounds very much like a modern swans track I feel like that old framework of their stuff is still there overall I think this is a pretty good album from swans there was only one track that I really disliked and most of them I thought were pretty good and there were a handful that hit me as being just a little middle-of-the-road kind of predictable so-so not pushing the envelope in the way that a lot of swans recent work has and that certainly doesn't mean they're bad especially since it sounds like they still took quite a bit of skill and forethought to compose and perform I just can't tell you this record is as grand or as ambitious or as large in scope or as transcendental as swans past three records it's far from one of their worst though and certainly worth listening to if you've been a fan of everything swans has been doing up until this point especially the recent stuff I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what

-lsS6ti-UPQ,
gmKru-Is0SA,[Music] hi everyone gee thinnies uh Stan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kanye West's album Jesus is king yes this is the newest full-length LP from Kanye West mr. Kanye West it's his ninth project highly anticipated exciting to see Kanye following up 2018 one of his most blowout years where he was seen producing multiple projects the widely celebrated Daytona with Pusha T the Teyana Taylor record which had some of the biggest songs of the year on it also crossing over with rap legend nas that amazing and inventive collaborative effort with mr. Kid Cudi kids see ghosts and finally Kanye diving into the nitty-gritty of his mental health on the record yay even though each one of these projects was just 20 minutes and change or so it was still an impressive musical marathon from one of modern music's most creative minds and what's astonishing is that he managed to make all these projects happen while maintaining so much mayhem in the public eye the embrace of Trump the embrace of Candace Owens won unhinged interview after another and not keeping his bipolar disorder under wraps or in check I just find it impressive that Kanye has managed to be so prolific while dealing with something that would undoubtedly paralyze most people personally anyway even though it's a new year and Jesus is king is a new album this record very much feels like it is born out of this same chaotic Kanye era except this time around the results are a lot less fulfilling for one this is another twenty-something minute album which I think was a cuter look last year when Kanye was hitting us with so much not immediately after scrapping what sounded like it could have been a pretty decent project in yandi and if that record got scrapped because of a new creative direction because of Kanye wanting to make godly or music how was this not the original plan I mean after all Kanye has been using these Sunday service performances and the embrace of Christianity as a bit of a public IRA demson arc for most of this year I assumed his next project would be or gospel inspired as early as April either way the album we got is the album we got and Jesus's King sounds like again we're basically in the same place we were on yay even with the intended change in sound and topical focus I really don't feel like Jesus is king as the gospel album that Kanye has been building it up to be even with all the references to Jesus even with him completely avoiding swearing it's really more of a record about Kanye's personal faith as a Christian than it is about God Jesus or anything related to those things big picture but it's not really revealing on that front if we're being honest I think what this record reveals more than anything is more about Kanye's mental health so in a way Jesus is king is a record about one thing that is actually about another thing and not in a way that's conceptual or deep as I think Kanye's ego makes it difficult for him to focus on the topic at hand without him making it about himself case in point the track hands on and there are elements of this track that I like I like the glitchy and heavily manipulated vocal passages I like the ice-cold synth swells I like how eerie and minimal the instrumental feels but I can't say I care for the lyrics on this one at all especially as Kanye gets into people criticizing him for making a gospel album and and how Christians are judging him there are like 2 billion Christians on the planet the ones that are even aware of Kanye's shift in style and theme most likely have a wide range of opinions on it and the ones that may be showcasing a slightly judgmental attitude might be doing so because they're looking at the wider context of Kanye's past I find it funny that Kanye would bring up hypocrisy in this instance when I mean the man is no stranger to hypocrisy himself either way it's annoyingly reductive and egotistical to act as if Christians at large are against Kanye's new shift and message not to mention I see this track as a part of a pattern on this record of Kanye using his faith in a way to indulge his persecution complex I'll be the first to acknowledge the public can be pretty hard on Kanye but going as far as to create parallels between himself and the treatment and betrayal of Jesus Christ on the tracks Allah which in my opinion is one of the better tracks here that seems like a bit much in fact a whole lot of much not only is it probably a tad bit blasphemous but on top of that I'm pretty sure in the end even Jesus himself was saying Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing the underlying attitude with Kanye's message here feels more like a middle finger the same one he pulls whenever he's told not to focus his creative energies in a certain way and there are multiple spots on this LP where Kanye admits to not really being christ-like yelling at the chauffeur yelling at his dad on the track follow God which again makes me feel like this is less of a gospel album and more of an album about Kanye's own personal interpretation of Christianity which of course is molded in the image of his flawed personality I mean maybe this is a very obvious point but let's look at the very popular Matthew 19 24 you know the one about it being difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven despite that yayyyy justifies the prices that I charge on the track on God as if it's a virtue or something I'm sorry but I don't think overpriced merchant shoes are what's standing between Kanye West and his family's starving I mean the Kardashians are pretty much set for life so there are a lot of complicated layers on Jesus's King ones that I'm not even sure Kanye was intentionally trying to work in here if he was I don't think the lyrics would be so reductive half the time I don't think the production would feel so rushed because even though Jesus is king is rough around the edges and short just like yeh was I feel like we're only getting a fraction of the effort and the self awareness now this is not true of every track on the project again the cut Salah is fantastic production is incredible the gospel choir sounds amazing the chilling organ chords the building instrumental Kanye's steady authoritative rapping push a tee very clearly has a co-writer credit on this one without even looking especially during the last verse that sounds like it's it's very much a push of t flow push it to you wordplay huge presentation amazing performance easily one of the best songs here and as long as I'm talking highlights on this thing we have to mention use this gospel featuring not only Kenny G but also the reunion of clips which is pretty fitting given that Pusha T's brother no malice formerly malice is now a Christian rapper we have some beautiful singular keyboard notes on this track those classic those trademark warped Kanye vocal harmonies solid vocal line from Kanye starting the entire track off the lyrics for him are a bit general with mentions of angels and heaven and so on and so forth but still it makes for one of the more powerful moments on the project the push of tea and no malice features on this track are pretty short but they are really good especially the no malice part of the the track his lyricism there is impeccable and I think in a very brief way he goes over his own transition into being a more faith oriented artist also the elegant sax solo at the end is great and the way the beat comes back in and the very last leg of the song it's a cinematic so great track I mean I wish nearly every song here featured as many fantastic musical and lyrical elements as great a structure and truth be told there are elements of other songs here that I think are good like the groove and the flow on follow god I wish the song developed more but I think the energy on this one is like a mix of Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and yay also loving the bright shots of keyboard on the track on God ty dolla sign's vocal harmonies on the track everything we need are also great but a majority of tracks on Jesus is king just leave me with a mix of either disappointment or just wanting more whether you're talking about closed on Sunday which starts off very dramatically with those acoustic guitars the pom-pom choral vocals but come on man closed on Sunday you're my chick-fil-a number one with the lemonade are you kidding me hold the selfies put the gram away look out for vipers don't let them in doctrine eight which is not only an instance of projection on this song obviously but the lyrics on this trackers so silly and just do not fit the tone of the instrumental or the song at all how am I supposed to take this seriously second silliest on the project might go to when I thought the book of Job was a job and even though there are elements of on God that I like what I don't care for is how weak the rhyme scheme is how one-dimensional the song structure is how slovenly Kanye's delivery is on this track it feels like more of a rough sketch then some of the cuts off the yandi bootleg meanwhile the track water has maybe the worst instrumental on the entire project the splashy little chords the clunky synth bass it sounds like a bad animal collective demo meanwhile the opening vocals just sound like Kanye meandering riffing the singing is not good at all and not that Kanye is an amazing singer just sounds like he's not really trying all that much here like he's just kind of throwing something out there again another moment that feels like he's kind of spitballing and maybe would ever find it if he were in a better place and willing to take another pass at it down the road then we have the almost monotone verse of Jesus do this Jesus please that which honestly to me comes off more like a dependency than a prayer granted the gospel vocals on the track sounds stunning just like they do all over the rest of the record but they just don't make up for the bad performance and lack of direction on this one especially that the last 40 seconds of this thing feels totally unnecessary the song God is is basically Kanye giving a very blemished vocal performance over a pitched gospel sample it's a song on the record that kind of reminds me of ghost town from yay and not necessarily in a bad way I mean the the parallels that I see between these two tracks are both positive ones I think if there's any song on this project that displays Kanye's faith in an endearing way it's this one but it still doesn't change the fact that to me the song feels like I'm just listening to overblown karaoke the opener and the clothes are on this thing I like the vibe of both of these tracks but I'm not sure what the benefit is of providing us with these really short snippets one being the intro that is basically a clip of the Sunday service choir doing their thing out of what sounds like what could have been hours of audio when it cuts in it's like it's been going on for minutes prior and when it cuts out it's like the recorder just stopped again like what they were doing but it didn't really flow in in a way that felt like ah this is an intro it felt like oh this is like a weird snippet and it only finishes because where it was going was left on the cutting room floor the sonically Jesus is Lord in my opinion feels more like a fitting intro with beautifully layered horns and lyrics that would be a pretty good tone Center for just about any Christian album but it just ends abruptly before even a minute I don't really know what to make of it just like much of this record honestly it's kind of cool while it's on and I get that I can play it over and over and over to get that vibe again if I want I guess but I don't think I really get enough of it to really make a call on it so - I guess just stick a fork in it I I don't really care for this record and what's really hard to acknowledge right now is that I feel like we are at a crossroads with Jesus is king we're really standing at what is either going to be a weird creative detour for Kanye that will just pass on into something else and the whole to do about him being born again and only making Christian music now will seem even sillier in retrospect or we are potentially staring the end of Kanye's career in the face here because I don't think Kanye's career can handle four more records like this and by like this I don't mean a Christian album if Kanye continues to make gospel music I would love to hear him drop a record where he sticks to the Christian ethos more effectively and not just use it as a throughway to air out other grievances I would love to hear a longer more sensibly structured project with better songwriting less skeletal instrumentals - I mean for a Christian album this thing again is not very christ-like nor is it very a boom like I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should our next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit

listening parties so yeah yeah they're a good time so patreon patreon comm slash the needle drop head over there support support yeah boa mellon and let's get into the worst tracks we only have a few but they are not good in my opinion not good at all first off we have a new track from sleigh bells it's a cover of the song where did you sleep last night by none other than a folk legend Lead Belly yes they have chosen to cover this song and sleigh bells renditions for as much as I have enjoyed a lot of sleigh bells recent stuff I do not care for their take on this track at all it's a really a mess in my opinion and not sure how else to put it let's just move on to the new galantis and Dolly Parton track featuring mr. probz faith which is this where electro house is at right now because it is a hot fucking mess this track is a blemish on humanity and never should have happened from the instrumental to the ultra bright uppity trying to feel good but failing so hard instrumental to Dolly Parton's voice which sounds so touched up that it's almost alien everything about this track is over-budget and I don't know underperforming yeah let's let's just get into the tracks that I thought were met not blowing me away but definitely worth checking out worth checking out worth pointing in your direction first the new tonight track Dollaz which um I don't know to me just felt very mild just felt very mild didn't hit as hard as a lot of the the duo's classic stuff and while serpent wasn't exactly a total you know barn burner either I liked that that track was kind of weird you know I liked how out there some of the sampling was and some of the you know rhythmic elements were toward the back end however this one feels just very plain average and not really going into the red in terms of groove percussion BOM Basset II intensity just felt like a very mild version of some of the hard-hitting electronic music trap inspired hard-hitting electronic music from the duo's debut EP I guess we're getting another EP very soon in November and I don't know hopefully the other tracks are better moving on from there Selena Gomez lose you to love me a track that a lot of people been talking about this week because some have said that the lyrics on this tracker about Justin Bieber and if that is the case damn Justin Bieber is like almost evil uh-huh the lyrics on this track are pretty cutting I would actually say the lyrics are probably the best element of the entire track the vocals the piano I think are maybe a tad bit generic but um you know at least the lyricism hits pretty hard and and I think the the whole notion the refrain the hook of having to lose someone to get him to love you or to kind of spark this real genuine feeling of love is a pretty smart interesting taking a pop song I don't think I've quite heard before so good on Selena Gomez for getting some good lyrics packed into this track that have gotten people talking we also have another track from Julie Doran as well as Phil Alvar under the Mount Erie named lost wisdom part to their collaborative effort that dropped a while ago the first time they cross paths on a mount Erie record we are getting the follow up to that very soon this new cut over here is a very slow burning piano ballad that didn't really get a whole lot out of on my first listen but um I don't know it's a song that could grow on me in terms of appeal once I hear in the context of the entire record belief is the name of this track and it's it's slow it's very somber give it a try give it a shot if you're a mount Erie fan if you're a fill Alvar and fan you kind of know what you're getting into at this point we also have a new track from little dragon which I'm not as crazy about this one as I would like to be tongue-kissing is the name of it not only because of the title but also the grooves the vocals the whole song it all just sounds very faint I just feel like a little dragon are stuck in this weird limbo period in their career where the music they're dropping now is just nowhere near as bold as it used to be when they first kind of launched onto the scene and they've never been a super crazy in-your-face band but their music and their sound is just more and more just becoming like a pastiche or something and it's a little disappointing I don't know just hoping for something a bit more structured and memorable in the future from them we also have a track from this artist that I just stumbled upon this week Lorado Khalil I open pronouncing that to name right bro nem is the name of the cut it's grimy it's Earl influenced I would say some of the bars on it are pretty great I like the dark nasty just dirty mean energy of this track I like the weird alternative instrumental and the the music video it's attached to as fantastic as well you know this dude could be someone to uh to look out for in the coming months I would say so keep an eye in an ear out we also had this new track over here from none other than Kesha and it also features a Big Freedia of all people I'm loving this combination of a piano ballad G which sounds almost like country song writing and and legitimate bounce music are raising hell is name of the song I think the elements of these two styles come together really well on this track I just think a Ke$ha song writing and her singing on this cut could have been better you know loving the fusion of ideas productions pretty solid the tune I'm just not entirely sold on but admiring Kesha's ambition here you know under a willingness to reach into a genre that doesn't often get the shine that it should in the mainstream and we also hear a new cut a new single from none other than a producer Kai Whiston although with this new track um blue dots not the the type of banger music that people may have been expecting from Whiston given his last record given the collaboration with baby and with a glucose that dropped not too long ago no this is a pretty heavy progressive piece of electronic music I'm not gonna call it IDM or anything like that because it's it's not totally embracing a lot of those classic IDM what you might call IDM elements but still it's a very linear and heady piece of electronic music composition and I don't know it underwhelmed me quite a bit frankly but I thought there were still a lot of great ideas on it and I don't know I'm willing to check out this new direction that a potentially new direction that he has going in and see where it uh kind of heads so blue dots CAI Whiston give it a shot we also have doja cat rules yes dojaquez come through with a pretty popular new song in music video a lot of great visuals and in looks in this music video the people have been going crazy for the song itself though is a pretty straightforward piece of a pop rap and and despite how underwhelming it is in some respects I feel like she was really trying to like position herself as a lyricist on the song like this is gonna be her track where she really dropped fucking bars and despite it being pretty clear that that was sort of her intention on this one I feel like she fell terribly short that not that there were any terrible like awful like totally trash lyrics throughout the track but there was never a moment lyrically and and flow wise as well given in comparison with other tracks that she's dropped in the in the recent past she raps more aggressively on this track than usual that I think people are used to from dosha cat at this point but there's never a point where I heard a flow or a bar and I was like oh my god oh my god she's killing it like she's trying to go hard but she's not like an animal on the mic or anything like that but of I don't know I guess we'll see where this goes from here it's not bad it's not a terrible track I mean the instrumental is fine the flows are fine the energy is fine I just don't think it's a standout as some of our more recent songs so those are cat rules it's decent it's okay also we have destroyer over here Crimson Tide new track given the groove and some of the electronics I thought that we were headed into more of like a sophistic you know resembling that of the classic destroyer record could put but no that is in fact not what we're getting here I don't know it's kind of a wash you know it's it's a very linear groove it seems never-ending and it's got a great vibe at first but it grows very stale very fast and it seems like eventually we will hit a point where some changes in the songwriting might calm or a strong hook might reveal itself or all of this tension all this repetition will eventually pay off into something grand whether it be something musical or a lyrical statement but it never really quite happens you're just kind of waiting for something to occur that never really occurs I mean for the moment that it's on it's fine again Crimson Tide is the name of the track but I'm not super crazy about the entire six minutes of it you know I feel like it really fails to justify the the length of the entire song we also have a new track from deep East over here nas on the track he really dominates nas really dominates the song barely feels like a davy east track honestly instrumental gets a little repetitive but there are a lot of you know quality thoughtful shit is deep type of lyricism all over this track it's it's traumatic excuse me it's dramatic it's traumatic as hell Godfather for also Coldplay has dropped a couple of new singles orphans arabesque and orphans I think is just okay the other track actually ended up in in the the good section the best tracks of the week section but orphans to me feels like Coldplay writing like a half-hearted u2 song or something I mean they're elements of it they're way less annoying than a lot of modern u2 songs but it pretty much just feels like I'm listening to Coldplay play a u2 song so I'm not really crazy into it but I'll get into my thoughts on the other track when it when it does come up let's get into this over here we have a 100 X who have just dropped a an Ag Cooke remix yes of freakin PC music fame AG Cooke PC music Fame coming through with a remix of money machine which um I'm not crazy about how indirect the whole thing is I wish that it kind of celebrated the fun and the melodies of the song originally but I you have to kind of appreciate how noisy and abstract some of the ideas that cook comes up with and this remix are so you know that's cool that's fine and also I want to give a shout out to 10k cash and artists who I am now just learning about through the song over here featuring Rico nasty gun also Mattox the track is titled haunted Bikini Bottom and it's just basically a grimy aggressive SoundCloud rap song with like a bunch of spongebob samples in the instrumental and as hilarious as fuck you should listen to it all right let's get it's gonna the tracks that were that excuse me literally dying on the microphone here let's give a listen to the tracks best tracks of the week over here best ones oh this a new one from the 1975 I am enjoying listening to them do their thing with this shimmery ass pop song over kind of a pulsating two-step rhythm frail state of mind if I didn't say again is the name of this track and diggin it liking it between this and the last single the band came out with for this forthcoming record a lot of surprises so far a lot of surprises and not in a bad way not a bad way also we have Megan the stallion and Vicky low rider died on this new track over here banger alert banger alert banger alert it goes and it's about riding that D so uh so yeah you know if that's if that's what you're looking for if that's what you're in the market for which um you know I'm not gonna lie I usually am you're gonna want to hear this track so there you go we also have a very good as he'll remix of the song good as hell from lizzo featuring ariana grande oh they have some decent chemistry on the track and I think given everything that's been going on recently good as hell should have absolutely been remixed so yeah good on Liz oh for coming through with remix and drawing more attention to this track doing some good marketing and taking advantage of the fact that Liz OH while she has been around for a while too many people who are just loving her music now she is kind of a new artist in a lot of respects and she is a kind of making a really taking advantage of the fact that - a lot of new people she is a new face and just continuing to keep her name and face out there by revitalizing her material like with remixes such as this so good on this up smart on her great track good remix we also have the track Salah from the new Kanye West's record Jesus is king did a full-length review of this track over on the Fantana channel highly recommend that you check it out we will link that down below love the track love the hallelujah chorus vocals on the song the kickoff look how epic all of it feels I love the energy a lot of the lyricism and flows very clearly influenced by Pusha T who is given a songwriter credit on this track don't know exactly how much Pusha T wrote on this track my guess is probably a whole lot but but still enjoying the song quite a bit and looking forward to talking about this new ji K record with you and we also have another banger alert here gwap dad Isaiah is the name of the track featuring ki Mac so cream and Denzel curry production from kenny beats and it goes hard as fuck energy is amazing the Maxo and Denzel vs are good and yeah yeah give it a try give it a shot give it a listen it's fantastic and one more time Coldplay with the other track that they are released because they dropped two singles at once the track arabesque and loving the horns on this track the kind of foreign international groove of the song and basically the message of you know I could be you you could be me you know we should be looking at each other as you know fellow human beings and so on and so forth in the midst of all these political and cultural divides and all this war and all this hatred and all this xenophobia and so on and so forth like the message of the track like the energy of the track think the vocals are good I think the tune is good I think it sort of Cole plays better singles in a while honestly and definitely better than orphans as well so I'm digging the track though I don't know if this is gonna pan out into like a great Coldplay album or anything it's gonna be a pretty big record and that that just means more chances of songs that I'm not gonna like but hey I can at least say that I like this track I at least liked this track quite a bit so Coldplay Coldplay Coldplay that has been the

jtPlfmhPnNg,ah hi everyone ghoul that he's spooked a now here the Internet's creepiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new clipping album there existed an addiction to blue this is the newest record from experimental hip hop trio clipping clipping to this day features the production and sound design of William Hudson as well as Jonathan Snipes and of course the rapping and the storytelling of mr. Davi Diggs now since turning heads and turning noise rap on its head in 2013 with their mixtape mid-city the trio has consistently proven themselves to be one of the most creative acts in hip-hop today whether it's through their spectacular Sub Pop debut a year later or with the narrative concept album splendour and misery in 2016 a record about an escapee on an intergalactic slave ship and the ship falls in love with him it's complicated anyway it's been a few years now since we have heard from clipping in a studio album capacity though it seems like each members kept pretty busy with their own respective solo projects in film work soundtrack work some solo stuff too but despite each member being split into their own lane for a little bit they have convened on to this new record in such a way where it sounds like they just haven't missed a beat because they come through with one of their most cohesive focused conceptual and Big Idea records yet now there existed in addiction to blood isn't that far off sonically and thematically from a lot of clippings previous work there is a lot of storytelling on this thing a lot of very fast verbose rapping the production is noisy vaguely industrial at points but above all this new album here is scary it's frightening it's kind of the linchpin of the record one could potentially classify this project even as horrorcore with it's morbid infatuations all of its blood all of its gruesome details so yeah there's a lot of bodies buried on this album it's kind of creepy though again for clipping that is not entirely new what our tracks like body and blood or break the glass if not attempt at inducing fear but basically that whole fear thing on there existed in addiction to blood they push it so much further it is the focus of the album they are dropping this project just before Halloween for Christ's sake there are lyrics on this thing referencing bad horror movie plots and jump scares also pretty much every instrumental on this thing feels like an overt nod to horror movie soundtracks both new and old whether you're talking about the heavy and droning Club down or the track nothing is safe whose persistent pianos and synth sound very John Carpenter inspired also you have some of the interlude cuts on here such as haunting which is I think a very old vintage tape of a woman describing herself as being haunted by Satan her descriptions are pretty unnerving and then there's also possession which sounds like a audio clip from an old horror movie it's very campy a little corny but still adds to the character of the record so the trio's appreciation of horror as an art form as a medium of expression is very much on display on this project but even though again I think you could effectively categorize this record as a horrorcore album there's very little about what inspires it that seems rooted in horror core as a genre there's not a whole lot here that sounds like or reminds me of old three 6 mafia or the Memphis scene back in the day in general Brotha Lynch hung or ICP or grave diggers and not that I think clipping has anything against those artists they probably enjoy a great deal of them but clearly the sound and style of this album is a lot less about horrorcore as a music genre up until this point and more about trying to embody expressions of horror especially in film in their own way on this record in such a way that it leads to a unique and almost cinematic experience which shouldn't be too surprising because when you look at the background of the trio you have soundtrack work you have acting you have writing you have sound design there are numerous tracks on this project just like with splendor and misery where Dobby does rapping speedily over these mostly drum 'less instrumentals that have huge atmospheres huge droning bass again with the track club down the massive hits of industrial noise on the song are huge the song he dead also features very little in terms of rhythm but still there's lots of eerie droning tones on this track distant metallic bangs the IDI balloon chorus is great and the instrumental on the show features all of these metallic glitches and distortions occasionally bringing in some handclaps to shore up the pace of the song though I will say this isn't one of my favorite tracks on the record compositionally and it's one of the few moments here that makes me wish there were maybe some more traditionally musical elements placed here and there on the record just to break things up and just add it a bit more sweetness even if it is bitter sweetness especially on cuts where WT is bringing the most head-bobbing flows but still I do love the storyline on this track which seems like it's about a torturous murderer who's breaking bones and cutting skin and sawing off shoulders and I guess he's subjecting other people to all of this it's it's almost like a saw in a way but what else would you expect from an album that puts you face-to-face on the cover with 49 nails just pointed right at you like you're stuck in a death machine even more challenging those the track all in your head which features all of these deadpan refrains from dahveed wild hurried ranting from counterfeit Madison thumping sparse rhythms metallic clangs lots of synthetic noise but then there is this chilling dusty sad chord progression that introduces itself and we get this wonderful vocal passage from Robin Hood it feels like the Sun coming up after a long dark night of everyone just slaughtering each other in the streets it's bright out it's a new day but then all the blood and all the death and all the mayhem is is revealed not crazy about the first portion again but I do love the singing on this portion of the track feels vaguely gospel inspired too it's easily one of the most powerful moments on the entire record the song attunement sees dahveed putting more of his flows over these industrial sounds more heavy bass more noise more fast rap flows which i think are great i also love how the numerous references to burning on this track lead us effectively into the album's final cut the 18 minute long piano burning which sounds like a field recording of a piano burning and that's it for 18 minutes still another track with the same instrumental type as attunement does make me wish there was a bit more sonic variety or just variants across the record I guess the song does still add to more of this feel of the the sound design of this record feeling akin to that of a modern horror movie trailer but a bit harsher a bit noisier almost as if the people crafting the trailer listened to a lot of Whitehouse or perience or MERS bow or maybe even some throbbing gristle thankfully the more accessible cuts on this record of which there are plenty are consistently great and versatile again the track nothing is safe which is essentially about a trap house a trap spot which ends up being under siege everyone thinks they're locked and loaded they're safe nothing's gonna happen they're protected that does not end up being the case though and the carpenter' inspired instrumental and the tense rapping and storytelling from dahveed just keeps you on the edge of your seat we eventually reach a point on the track where we have these panoramic layers of scents tight trap rhythms also the track key dead which again at balloon kicks off perfectly his singing and the melody almost reminds me of an old young father song but overall the vibe of this track is a lot droney er a lot creepier dahveed's intense rapping on this track basically flips an all-too-common trope in today's news police brutality depicting a police killing almost as if you are being chased down by monsters by almost werewolf like creatures who are going to kill you the track la mala ordina is a somewhat weird change of pace given that the that buzzy lead synthesizers and dusty lo-fi drums sound like something off of a black moth super rainbow record it's a little kooky the track also features guest verses from metal candy as well as Benny the butcher and if you're familiar with those two rappers you can see why obviously W would use this as an opportunity to take a lot of themes of violence and drug dealing and do a bit of an eerie flip on that also I should mention that the last minute or so of this track is really just a harsh wall of noise and it is fucking awesome and as long as we're talking about features on this thing my favorite is probably let chats off the track run for your life chat basically plays a a killer cur grimy southern flow and twang adds a refreshing dynamic to the tracklist also I have to talk about how genius the production on this track is all the found sounds and field recordings give you the feeling of the protagonist being outside existing in the space that they're rapping about also there's a moment where a beat swells under dahveed's voice that he's rapping in time with but the beat arrives by way of a car driving by which is like one of the weirdest and most insane ideas I think I've ever heard worked into a hip-hop track but is oh my god amazing though this really thick bassy beat pops in when chats feature pops in later on the track in full and it sounds fantastic I love that we get this slow transition to slow progression to this point that is so fulfilling it's so gratifying the song blood of the thing I think is really where the album's title and main theme gets explained pretty thoroughly with dahveed as a protagonist explaining the society the context that he lives in basically having this infatuation this desire to consume violence murder and this also comes along I think with a commentary on normalization as well because it seems almost as if at points on the song davido is trying to escape the blood escape the murder but then he's almost being indoctrinated into it like a cult love the sputtering beat on this track the really prominent and strange esoteric vocal samples the dusty chants in the background as well Debbie eats flows just dart in every direction and are impeccably executed I guess I should also mention the track story 7 which for longtime clipping fans is another addition to the story series every major clipping project so far has had a story song on it and they usually end up being a highlight of some sort and occasionally they even reference each other the story on this record though still plays into the murderous and creepy fantastical and ghoulish themes of the record though as this story is essentially about a woman who turns into a beast I'm assuming a werewolf because there's reference to a there being a full moon on the track and she's basically killing men that she's seducing she runs into a character from a previous story that clipping has done though I'm not going to spoil too much of the story beyond that the instrumental on this one is really odd though the transitions are breakneck and don't even seem logical but the more I listen to it the more I found it to be incredibly catchy how did Orion glitchy and occasionally harsh it is almost remind me of moments off of clippings wriggle EP which is not necessarily a bad thing as I think that's one of their more interesting projects overall though I think this is yet another great album from clipping a few tracks that I thought paled in comparison to others along the tracklist sure maybe the final cut is a little excessive with it being as long as it is but I still think this project showcases a lot of great rapping storytelling production and sound craft great theme and concept even if it makes this album maybe one of the more niche records and clippings discography but still I see no reason not to make this record a tradition in your yearly Halloween music rotation though I would not call this a Halloween album though it just happens to be a horrifying scary record that clipping smartly dropped near Halloween so people would kind of be in the creepy spirit that's just good marketing okay it's just good marketing everything else about the record though is good music even if occasionally I think clipping does go out of their way to sacrifice some of the musical elements of this record and even with their last record a little bit too just so the narrative shines a bit brighter but given how unique intriguing and entertaining clippings narratives typically are it is a compromise I'm totally fine with I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition

ieXeM1YpqDg,hi everyone nice the need a tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Caroline Polo check record pang this is an album I've been tracking ever since the release of Caroline's single door which was dropped this past June and every song she has teased us with in the lead up to this record has been good or great what sounds like a futuristic and progressive take on art pop Peng was shaping up to be one of the more promising albums of the year and while it was unfortunate to see the demise of Caroline's former band chairlift in 2017 I would like to hear her move on to greener pastures with a solo effort and that's exactly what pang is and does it's pretty hard to deny just how sweet cleanly produced and fantastical many songs on this record are it's like I'm listening to bits of Charli XCX meets alternative R&B meets Kate Bush meets maybe some top 40 music in 2019 and that direction shouldn't be too surprising considering some of the people producing this thing people like Andrew Wyatt of Mike snow as well as AG Cooke and Daniel Horrell of the PC music camp together they handle the bulk of the production on this record the future of pop is here and it's PC so I was pretty psyched to try this thing however I was a little scared by the initial moments of the record which I don't think are all that great not at the quality level of singing and songwriting I was expecting given the singles the intro cut the gate is very smooth but it's about as fulfilling as an exchange with a Walmart greeter it's short and by the time it's over I realized I've got nothing out of it and after this a few bland cuts like the title track I like the angular since that play throughout many passages of this song but the tone and the energy of this track is just way too subdued for the start of an album this is more like a cool down moment on the back end of a full-length record not to mention the song features one of Caroline's most underwhelming vocal performances - and the song new normal the beat on this instrumental just sounds like a cheap attempt at working some foreign flavors and rhythm into the record that didn't really need to be there especially since they they kind of clash with these strange country-fried guitars that pop in here and they're just sliding in with a touch of distortion I think the record continues to get better from here though the song hit me where it hurts is a really effective attempt at working some glamourous R&B into the project Caroline and Wyatt put their own weirdly minimal spin on it I love these soaring vocals and rich chords on the hook I like how disjointed and sparse the beat is behind the verses there are also hits of background vocals at some points on the track - that almost feel like ad-libs it's really like I'm listening to deconstructed R&B the song I give up features more solid tune writing as well as very fractured sparse rhythms the vocals on this one are raw very naked but so angelic and how bare the verses are just makes the choruses feel even more you work with that rush of background vocals and bass when it finally hits now look all of this is good so far we have some momentum going in the tracklist Caroline's vocals are sounding great well-executed expressive mature but something you should anticipate with this record is that the whole thing is very very very low-key very moody - this is not a snappy pop record which is something some people might have assumed going into this project given some singles like so hot you're hurting my feelings the vibe of the track is pretty smooth but it's honestly the most high-octane moment on the entire record so if the shiny synth chords and lightly distorted guitars in the background of this one are not enough boom for you you might not dig on this one I don't really see the lack of fireworks on this record as entirely a bad thing though especially given how gorgeous and enchanting nearly every song here is you have the dreamy and acoustic look at me now the vocals really sell this one it's so elegant and elements of it reminded me of breezier jangly or more euphoric cuts from the Cocteau twins discography meanwhile the dark subterranean bass on insomnia paired with the bright futuristic synth tones and vocal harmonies feels like taking PC music aesthetics and applying it to like an ambient pop blueprint the song ocean of tears was a great single in the lead-up to this record I still love hearing it in the midst of this record and the more that I listen to it I swear to god they're elements of this track aesthetically that kind of remind me of Travis Scott's 9:02 uh no off of rodeo it's the atmosphere it's the small hits of auto-tune ad-libs in the background it's the singing that sometimes reminds me of Casey Hills it's also the punchy beat while again I do think there are some esthetic similarities the tune is vastly different very heady but very catchy which is part of the course for most of the tracks on this record while this is certainly a pop album it's structured like a pop album it is hooky like a pop album there's something about the mood the tone the vibe of the whole thing that just comes off very cerebral the beautiful songs and the tracklist keep rolling with hey big eyes also go as a dream although I don't know how much I care for the intro on this track which in pure PC music fashion is auto tune sounds alien almost as if a cyborg or an AI is singing the song and I think that's something that works with most artists who work with Danny work with Cooke work with even Sophie and are deeply embracing all these futurist sounds and visuals but for the most part it makes this track stick out like a sore thumb not in a great way because a lot of the songs up until this point feel pretty organic at least vocally one thing I do want to point out is some of the background vocals on the song the ha ha ha which I see is a very conscious Laurie Anderson shout out appreciate that I think the song Caroline shut up sticks out for much better reasons though there's quite a bit of swagger on this track vocally even though the song is about expressing doubt in the realm of love and wanting to quell that so Caroline sings to herself when she's filling her head with these ideas can a line shut uh the track isn't 3/4 and I think it does a great job of taking the stereotypical blueprint of an old-school spacious waltz II type of ballad with lots of drama and applying some modern synthetic elements to it the songs door and parachute make sure the entire album ends off on a really strong note back in the city I'm just another girl in a sweater yeah pang is just another great forward-thinking quality produced and super catchy thoughtful pop record in 2019 granted it's not the most innovative or consistent record in this style that I've heard this year and I think the tracklist mostly runs like a bunch of disjointed ideas not really any overall themes or concepts on this thing at least to my ears though a lot of the tracks do seem to center around love personal connections and emotions and as I mentioned earlier I think the album's initial moments are not quite as strong as the album's final moments but a vast majority of these tracks these 14 tracks are are pure fire and I can only hope that Caroline's efforts from here grow more ambitious thematic as well as focused although I can't say I'm complaining too much right now because as is this is really great feeling a light to decent 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Caroline polo check forever 
a2l3o6Rzyzg,
sZzwK3n_KEI,hi everyone Bethany coughed anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new lightning bolt album sonic Citadel legendary noise rock duo lightning bolt Bryan Chippendale and Brian Gibson they are back following up 2014's fantasy Empire for over 20 years now the Bryan's have been creating some of the most delightful sonic mayhem within all of noise rock with just drums and bass mostly together they had been responsible for some of the most crushing and psychedelic records in the genre from the 2000s really of all time wonderful rainbow Earthly Delights also hyper Magic Mountain a record that I love despite the fact that more often than not when I listen to this album all the way through I get a head splitting migraine it's sad that in recent years Lightning volts output seems to have slowed down a little bit the new stuff is not as aggressive or as explosive as the old stuff however I would love to hear a record we're lightening both is capturing their former glory once again and I gotta say sonic Citadel is a pretty welcome addition to their catalogue and astonishingly they don't achieve this by pushing their sound to another level of insanity lightning bolt actually reels it in a little bit on this one not hitting listeners with as many frantic finger taps on that bass neck not as many overdubs or layers or loops it's like the Brian's are breaking it back down to the simplicity of the wonderful rainbow era from here the duo starts delivering songs with clearer structures a bit more melody a smidge of method two lightning bolts usual madness Chippendales vocals on this record feel a lot less like a demented person yelling at you through the talkbox of a McDonald's drive-thru and more like somebody who's really trying to hold a tune under that occasionally Gibson's bass riffs are a little steady follow a very straightforward chord structure whether you're talking about whose skirt don't or Don Henley in the park especially all insane now this shift in tone is not amazing from front to back on the project personally I think some of Chippendales vocals can feel a little tedious these singing on USA is a psycho is just okay while the melodies and head-bobbing grooves once again on all insane do get very repetitive very fast for the most part this track is a really straightforward rock song and while I do admire lightning bolt for trying it I don't know if a track of this style is really in their skill set especially since the recording and the mix doesn't exactly show the dynamics that maybe a four piece or a five piece would display playing a track that is equally as simple thankfully this more melodic shift in tone benefits more tracks on the album than it doesn't the track Husker don't is easily one of my favorite lightning-bolt tracks ever now Chippendales vocals on this one have a classic punky quality to them the bass tone and usual lightning bolt fashion is grimy as hell and I love the just cascading raining down of harmonized fiery screaming bass leads that pop in in between each verse also the way the whole thing shits around the second half with that amazing epic descending bass line is great not to mention the de-evolution into just disheveled chaos for the last minute or so the song Don Henley is almost meditative in a way with Gibson playing his bass at a very high pitch and with these lines these chords these phrasings that are very jeroni it's almost like he's playing a sitar especially toward the start of the whole thing where his bass is sounding particularly thin and jangly it mostly evolves into a mess during the last leg that when it could have gone somewhere more interesting now while sonic Citadel does show a slightly sweeter side of lightning bolt no doubt there are still plenty of tracks here that sound like the soundtrack to a hailstorm of asteroids breaking through Earth's atmosphere unscathed to completely tear apart the Earth's surface and just leave all life on this planet obliterated the song big banger is literally what the title describes loudest song on the record I would wager maybe one of the loudest and lightning bolts discography with total blown out drums these trippy delayed lead vocals just swimming in this very compressed noisy mix these bass riffs that are just sliding the world they just sound like hundreds of giant motorcycles revving up it's just one of those lightning bolt tracks that grooves on this one insane a weird idea for a very long time thankfully we do get some tension release transitioning out of this at one point with some quickly strum chords mystical lead melodies it's like we've suddenly transitioned into a desert or something and we're just trying to survive a really intense sandstorm the song blow to the head the intro to this thing features some speedily rolling drums booming hits a bass easily some of the most exciting noise rock I've heard this year the triumphant bass leads on this track and vocals add an epic melody to an already gigantic sounding mix also the very messy and everything but the kitchen sink bridge on this track is gratifyingly disturbing thankfully the song air conditioned did grow on me at first when I heard it I did not like it at all I chalk a lot of that up to the sound quality of the first upload on Bandcamp being very bad thankfully the better fidelity version that I'm hearing on streaming services sounds great loving the very nutty lead vocals on this track the righteous chords the intense flurry of drums that pop in on the chorus in a lot of ways this track is a classic lightning bolt formula but performed with some riffs and some ideas and some writing that I haven't quite heard before it's it's familiar but refreshing I feel roughly the same way about Halloween 3 there are some ideas on the track that feel maybe a little deja vu for lightning bolts but the performance on that one is incredible as long as I'm talking about moments on this record that are a little predictable or underwhelming though Tom thump is easily one of the weakest links in the chain throughout the tracklist as it is quite obviously the most under written track on the entire record I would argue there are quite a few songs in the second half that are kind of so-so bouncy house is fantastic but then there's also Van Halen when the father behind the closing track on this thing which is over nine minutes long whoo and this is an amazing ending to this record it's more of a journey than it is a song lightning bolt has put out some pretty long and indulgent songs in their back catalogue over the years and this is easily one of my favorite closures they've ever done it starts out like a very raw chaotic Jam with both Brian's not really seeming like at first they have too much of a concrete idea as to where this is going they're just basically both making a lot of noise however the whole thing is gaining more and more and more momentum as it barrels forward into infinity adding on more and more of these unsettling dissonant layers eventually we reach a point where this incredible amount of momentum breaks and we're getting more coherent riffs more of the Brian's sounding like they're they're more in sync with each other but still the whole thing sounds incredibly unhinged even some noises I haven't quite heard on a lightning bolt record before it sounds like um occasionally there's some screaming blurting harmonica what it's actually ingeniously abrasive I'll say that again a fantastic finish to the album and its oddity as a track almost makes it indescribable overall I thought this thing was a great album I enjoyed it more than lightning bolts last record I think that it is pretty solid throughout a few lulls in the tracklist here and there but a really enjoyable admirable effort from lightning bolt I don't prefer this one to a lot of the group's classic stuff but still they are trying a lot of new things on this one and it's mostly panning out I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is

Ufd4o67Ze6w,hey everyone very thinnies sick tan oh here the Internet's most coughing music nerd not feeling well but still doing a review of the new Anna Franco electrico album little electric chicken heart this is the sophomore full-length album of Brazilian artist and a Franco electric oh who I am just becoming hip to now though it seems that she's been releasing music since last year under this name so I tried this record just like I do many albums that I see getting a bit of a mild buzz on the internet and I admit I didn't really know what to expect when I went into this one it's pretty short just a 30 minute album and the cover is just so simple and straightforward in fact it looks like an intentionally blurry shot out of a smartass French art film that's just in love with how unconventional it is but know this again is actually an album cover from a Brazilian rock artist and her band that creatively fuses together elements of chamber pop and Samba jazz and they do it with a style in a recording that sounds like it's straight out of the late 60s early 70s yes despite this album being very new anna Franco electric oh is actually mustered an authentically vintage sound one that gives me visions of hip art scenes where everyone's wearing tightly fitting black clothing and doing zany choreographed moves and smokey jazz clubs but don't let these similarities make you assume that this album is just boring or stuffy because this thing is actually a very fun playful colorful album with a lot of personality and smile inducing instrumentation to look at it as if it were that indie pop supergroup superorganism but instead what we have here is like a weird 70s Brazilian art school kid version of that the whole thing kicks off at the track so uh which I admit is a little repetitive but it's still incredibly lush groovy I love the jazzy and warm horns on this track the background vocals everything about it is so just bubbly the lazily strum guitars the plinky glockenspiel the whole thing just continues to ride this groove and gets progressively louder and louder and more fun the following track tones things down a little bit more it's a loose somewhat jazzy slow burner I'm not crazy about the more amateurish passages of this song or how long it takes to really get going compositionally there are a lot of things about this track I enjoy I just think the listless performance takes some wind out of the sails for a more subdued track I think the track chocolatte is a lot better there's a lot of grace shown in the performance despite how slow and spacious a lot of the instrumentation is also that transition into the second half is fantastic the tracks say no cinema seems to pick up the pace in the first leg though with more fusions of funky Samba rhythms as well as jazzy horns chords melodies as well as lots and lots and lots of cheeky group vocals the song almost feels flirty with how knowingly silly some of the musical components are but it's all executed so well even if it is a little funny you can't help but take it seriously the track temp sortez another great song in the tracklist here but one that makes the lo-fi recording quality of some of these tracks very apparent as some of the louder and more cacophonous spots on the song just get a little abrasive the vocals almost have a punk attitude that's a little reminiscent of groups on the more North American side of things like King Khan and the shrines how they had their own punked-out twist on the sounds of soul and funk also the drums in the background occasionally reach a point where they sound just like white noise pummeling away in the background still despite all that this track still features all of these characteristics of funk and rock and soul and pop music and samba coming together into this zany dance party with heads and arms waving in every direction the song Vendetta is a cool little sad guitar vignette that transitions into the next song on the project the song tour tour Doris which is mostly a very subdued watery guitar ballad a few old-school horn lines here and there it's a somewhat sleepy but cute track loving a lot more of the following debía terra cotta menos the absolutely dejected intro on this track is great it's clunky it's awkward reminds me of tracks off of like Iggy Pop's the idiot with how alien it sounds at least in comparison with other tracks off of this project but then the band explodes occasionally into these more aggressive passages that really lets loose the tension that they were building up on these weird-ass versus the girthy horns the noisy drums those background vocals again during these passages are amazing the song caspo is a pretty sweet send-off for the entire record feels like the credits rolling on a weird foreign film that i just watched a lot of groups singing a lot of jazzy horn embellishments a sweet chord set - it all ends in an endearing ly noisy fashion overall this thing I'm loving it but I'm left wanting more but still loving it this is easily one of the most fun records I've heard this year and it's great that this Brazilian artist was able to come through with this old-school yet refreshing and exciting sound hopefully more people pay attention to this band and the Brazilian music scene as well as a result of this project not to say every other album an artist from there sounds like this they don't but Ana Franco Electrico could certainly be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the fantastic stuff going on down in Brazil right now I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if the bail is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel kathan e Fantan o little electric chicken heart forever

and yeah yeah support the channel support the show get some extra content in the process and let's get into the worst tracks of the week we have quite a few we have quite a few we have quite a few I'm not a million but quite a few first off uh our buddy Marilyn Manson you know somebody who's who's cataloged the early years of which is near and dear to my heart a lot of his latest records have been a pretty mediocre in my opinion ups and downs and this new track over here is especially not gratifying it is a cover of the track God's gonna cut you down which is a traditional folk song but for whatever reason his version sounds exactly like the Johnny Cash version that Cash recorded with Rick Rubin except with like worst vocals and not as good production hopefully he's not planning on doing a weird folk album or something like that or if he does I hope the rest of the tracks are a lot better than this one because this one was a not good Katy Perry Harley's in Hawaii new track new single not all that good really annoying tropical bland pop with boring verses and obnoxious choruses it's a little sensual I guess but that's truly an honestly the only appealing thing I saw in the track not digging it at all and a full track review of this one over on the Fantana channel - if you are interested we also have another track from have a nice life new record on the way a lot of people hype for this one especially since have a nice life is considered to be one of the most celebrated Internet music projects out there - solid albums so far but this next one is not shaping up to be all that interesting in my opinion science beat is the name of this new track over here and it's just like a really synth-heavy very washed out bland piece of post-punk without much in the way of progression or excitement and eventually it reaches a point where some very mediocre post rock guitar start popping in and it's it's just one bad transition after another not really taking it sadly Gucci Mane with new record wacht Ober to this song over here bucking the system with Kevin gates is easily one of the most understated in boring flows and deliveries that Gucci Mane has put on record in a long time not really getting what is so exciting about this track and gez and gonna appearing on the same song and it is as repulsive as one would guess given that it's a collaboration between G easy and gonna but let's move on also Beck is back Beck uneventful days he's put out a couple of tracks but uneventful days is the one I would like to focus on here I guess it's a very boring underwhelming piece of the semi synth pop with I don't know man Beck is just really in the woods at this point he just cannot seem to write much of anything that can even bring up just a lick of excitement and it's sad considering he was once a man who wrote some pretty exciting albums some pretty exciting songs back in the day with a lot of personality and attitude and humor as well in humor and wit and all of that seems to have been totally drained out of the very middle material he's been dropping as of late so yeah alright let's get to the traction I thought we're kind of met blowing me away but certainly worth pointing out one vagabond indie artist vagabond has a very dreary little ballad over here that sort of stopped me in my tracks every woman I wish there was more highs and lows across the recording but that's it's still not a not a bad track and I like that too vocally she's headed in more I guess if it's of a distinct direction with her stuff as well so vagabond every woman liking it a little bit we also had this new song over here from from perfume genius mic coming through with another track that is very washed out a little poppy a little dancey I'm just sort of underwhelmed by this new material because it seems so impersonal you know I'm used to Mike's stuff just being so intimate and being so intense emotionally and being so song centric and this latest stuff that I'm hearing just seems like like it's just an abstraction and vocally it just seems so distant I'm just not really all that crazy about it I mean certainly it's it's new ground for the perfume genius project and it's it's an experiment it's something new it's something different but I'm just not crazy about it so far walking on a string a new collaborative track from Matt Berninger as well as Phoebe Bridgers instrumentally it's nice Matt's vocals are I guess if you love the National you'll love them there they're very I guess fried and very sleepy sounds like you just got up but Bridgers vocals on the track are great so I don't know I guess stick around for those moving on haagen-dazs new single from a collaborative a recently minted hip hop collaborative titled ghetto sage which features Cimino saba and no name and it's a decent little track track beat is little generic on the song honestly but good flows good bars almost seems like what you would get if these three were paired up in a cypher just kind of going toe-to-toe big moe but for Chicago on this one Chicago stand-up not mind-blowing but pretty good and certainly has me intrigued to see what these three are going to be coming through within the future Gangstar bad name not as heavy-hitting as the j.cole single that dropped not too long ago this one seems a little more rough around the edges and more the quality of material that you might expect considering that that guru is no longer with us and this material is sort of being put together I imagine of you you know obviously I'm just like leftover pieces and everything because the song doesn't really feel too finished but it's it's okay you know if you're a hardcore Gangstar fan which obviously any hip-hop head anyone who considers themselves one should be you know at least the classic stuff you're gonna want to hear this you're gonna want to take notice you're gonna want to give this a try the free Nationals Anderson packs band they are back eternal light new song new single this one with chronics so it's kind of smooth soulful funky with just a hint of reggae mixed in there - it's very vibe it's very vibe UI be vibey not the best single they put out but it's cool that you know they've essentially crossed over with chronics here and and were able to pull off what they did DHL Frank Ocean brand-new single thought it was okay there were aspects of it that I liked song is mostly a vibe full-length review of this track over on the Fantana channel not one of his best songs not one of his most focused tracks or anything like that the whole thing just seems like a very vibe homage to being high on pills and pretty much that's it the production reminded me a little bit of ASAP Rocky of Earl sweatshirts some rap songs in some respects but again tune wise not super great hoping to hear maybe something a bit more melodic from Frank in the future I suppose and foals new track new single Neptune it's very long and very very much okay the second half of their kind of two part incoming project is arriving soon and I don't know I've been super crazy about anything so far from from the second record so and I don't know if I have if I'm gonna have much to say about it we'll say Chris Ferrand born hot fun little single over here check it out hilarious music video I think there are some elements of the instrumentation that a little bland in my opinion Chris Ferran is is not as much a favorite of mine as he is to many others but I do like his personality I do like his humor I do like that he comes through with quite a bit of character in his tracks so born hot Chris Ferran and let's get into the best tracks of this week the tracks that I thought were the best ones the ones that really stood out to me the ones that made me the happiest let's go first off black lips Oh Delia yes they are back with a great kind of garage country fusion stopper it's a bit of a hootenanny it's a great track it's great fun it's great energy the black lips still sound fantastic after all these years moving on from there next one next one next one next one we also have Teebs who has a brand new single out featuring none other than Sudi and archives who is an up-and-coming artist on these Stones Throw label I'm diggin the beat on this one dig in the vocals diggin the psychedelic abstract weird-ass vibes kind of looking forward to the new Teebs record which is something I haven't been able to say I have I've wanted to do I've been anticipating you know we're really really excited to hear Teebs album in a long time a long time also student archives speech speak of the devil student archives has a new track out which I'm just continuing to love her inventive fusion of art pop and hip hop and violin music and it's it's just so insane it's just so all over the place and yeah it is so seamless I'm diggin it I'm loving it I'm excited also the boy Rex orange county another cute little frickin tune over here link down below with every other song that I've been talking about here also the Soudan archives track that I was talking about is glorious the team song that I was talking about is black dove and our friend over here Rex orange county Pluto projector is name of this track over here and it's just it's just a cute little pop soul tune with a good nice warm heart it's cute and fuzzy just like him alright Michael Kiwanuka hero is the name of his brand-new single and it is a lovely combination of folk rock and psychedelic rock it's a bit of a throwback but feels current good lyrics as well that's it's a little woke to and it's it's just a cool little urgent ballad that I like quite a bit simple folk rocky tune with some good guitars on it also mayhem has come through the legendary black metal band with the most savage teaser of this new album cycle the track is falsified and hated the performance is amazing it is fire it is a brimstone it is hellish I'm loving it alright moving on

FhuRfJsjs-A,hi everyone needs a nice leap tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new big thief album two hands two of them this is the newest full-length LP from buzzing in defaulters big thief fronted by currently one of the most distinct singers in the genre right now Adrian linker big thief has been making quite a bit of headway over the past few years the band's mix of intricate but enchanting folk instrumentation and odd but expressive lead vocals have not only earned them a 4ad record contract but also leagues of diehard fans ready to go to the mat for them and while their record you FoF earlier this year was definitely a breakout moment for them despite the wide praise amongst fans and many publications I just could not bring myself to get into it as much I just did not see what was so profound about it meanwhile while I don't love the band's 2017 record capacity at least that album was a bit more focused consistent seemed like it had an identity meanwhile you FoF in comparison is so the scattershot unsure of its direction and occasionally despite the unique characteristics of big thief's music drowning in its influences just not not that strong of a personality to it so with this wave of success that big thief is writing the band is doing something that is rare for a group in indie folk especially one that is up-and-coming and that is drop two albums within five months of each other where all these tracks written in workshop and recorded within that time period I don't know but either way it's a lot of music to be dropping in such a short amount of time big picture I suppose it does make sense as big thief is just as subjected to the over saturation of the music industry as any rapper making three mixtapes a year is I went into this record worried though that there would be no reason to even listen to it because within this span of time how would big thief come through with a distinct sound instead of songs that actually feels different from you FoF and hopefully more appealing to me than you FoF but the band actually did it and not by indulging in a bunch of experiments and abstractions know this record is very much about big thief taking it back to basics instrumentally I would say it's kind of the spiritual successor to capacity as in the tracklist here the banned folds one tuneful expressive subtly weird folk tune on top of another sure the production is not as slick as it was on UFO f there are not as many bells and whistles but there's really nothing to distract from the focus of just delivering some quality straightforward solid songwriting here which when you're talking about a genre is simple and is rustic generally as folk music can't be a bad thing now maybe this is to a point where some of the instrumental pallets here are a bit bland like on the very subdued those girls or on these somewhat breezy replaced or maybe a song such as the intro comes off a little brief under written still though there's a very nice handful of highlights on this thing most of the tracks on this record are incredibly enjoyable for one the track forgotten highs one of the most solid and/or playable songs and spanned has ever put out I love the rich acoustic chords on this track I love how nimble and dynamic linkers vocals are she's just ice dancing on this instrumental easily one of her best performances on the entire record and the song has this lovely almost romantic intoxicating quality to it just gets me swaying immediately and I'm so taken with the lyrics on this one too which range from being incredibly surreal but beautiful forgotten eyes are the ones which we lose forgotten hands are the ones which we choose then we get spots on the same track that are wonderfully relatable like everybody needs a home and deserves protection hmm I also love the track two hands with these speedy quickly played guitar arpeggios and the somewhat metallic and rickety percussion in the background it hits a good pace all this sets a very simple and a raw foundation for linkers slightly low five vocal performance here it's a wonderfully organic in the moment recording that just feels so intimate also that melodic transition into the chorus the it's just so warm and inviting and welcoming it feels familiar but also refreshing and new leggers voice reminds me of points of like a violin we also have the track not which is a grim piece of full crock with lots of distorted extended guitar solos it reaches this urgent darkness that reminds me of like an old classic Neil Young song or two and wolf despite being one of the quietest tracks here is easily one of the most compelling and worthwhile the hypnotic acoustic finger-picking is tight as hell the rustic lead melodies as well as some of linkers most poetic writing on the entire project the sense of longing on this track is so thick you could cut it with a knife stab it with a fork scoop it with a spoon I don't have an incredible amount of praise for this record past this point but it is a very good in solid set of tracks I enjoyed it certainly much more than big thief's last record I may be in the minority on that but it is what it is I would love to hear the band in the future be able to build on this sound without losing sight of these characteristics that make them what they are and even though there are a handful of tracks here that I wish were more fleshed out or a bit bolder I still find this to be a very solid and enjoyable indie folk record a don't miss if you're a die-hard for the genre I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is a another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to

fpATa8UJPh8,hi everyone gloom Denis doom tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new richard dawson album 2020 this is the latest full-length LP from english singer and songwriter richard dawson who in my opinion has been one of indie Fulks best kept secrets for the past decade or so over the years dawson has amassed a strange but versatile discography which piqued my interest with the release of his album peasant a few years ago a project that featured basically an hour these neo medieval folk songs with bold but blemished acoustic guitars basically archaic noise Foulke and through some very animated vocal performances Dawson would tell these stories inspired by the days of yore mentioning cauldrons and kingdoms and soldiers while also singing about the dark and savage side of this era to the abject poverty selling children for grain Richards latest project here is a change of pace though of course the antiquated but updated English folk isms that have inspired much of Dawsons discography also carry over onto 2020 but there's a lot more electric instrumentation here there are some weird synths and vocal effects occasionally drums too this album is very much a product of our modern era not just in its sound but in its lyrics too I mean the title of this thing is 2020 it's very obviously looking forward to the very near future with one song after another reading like a slightly dystopian take on our late stage capitalists present there are tracks on this thing referencing our current day problems with modern technology our environment the political landscape also workers toiling away in an Amazon Fulfillment Center and even though this project is different the matically and sonically from Richard Dawson's previous peasant there are some interesting ways in which these records parallel in their runtime in the melody writing both albums actually feature a song titled no one a short little interlude track on the second to last song of the record and even though both these albums are from different time periods narrative Lee they both feature stories with protagonists that are essentially caught in or struggling against the prevailing problems of the society they were born into so in a way it's safe to say that peasant in 2020 our sister albums or connected or one is the sequel to the other and in my opinion 2020 is every bit as ingenious and creative as its predecessor though maybe Dawson's lyrics on this one are bit more cutting because he is a product of the era that he's critiquing and while I really do love the ideas that Dawson is putting forward on this album the instrumentals in my opinion are just as intriguing the explosive tracks civil-servant is an amazing kick-off to this project at the very start with these grunting grinding off-kilter riffs paper bran that mechanical repetition I feel like I'm being ground into the gears of a failing society or chased down by a madman with a knife after this we quickly transition into these tense narrative verses the day for our protagonist begins very mundane getting up morning pouring some cereal and being subjected to another day at a job that you despise we get an epic triumphant chorus on this one with some odd falsetto vocals some of the medieval elements of peasant really come back during moments like this our protagonist goes into these inner thoughts later into the track about wanting to beat a co-worker's head in basically to a bloody pulp wanting to call in sick and struggling with processing the traumas of the people that this person has to deal with which all sounds little self-centered yes but Dawson's characterization of people in these civil servant positions isn't too much different than what is often reported by people who are social workers in the u.s. working crazy hours dealing with a lack of resources being worked to the point where you're jaded and you don't care about your job anymore just take it as the Avant noise full UK version of take this job and shove it Dawson reels it back in a little bit with the much less noisy the Queen's head which is a sobering tale about an English town flooded which when researching I saw is not too uncommon of an occurrence in the UK with notable and recent floods happening in oh seven oh eight oh nine twelve and fifteen I love the plucky weird folky instrumentation on this track the grand rush of synths and vocals on the hook but most interesting on this track are the vivid descriptions of people dealing with this ordeal whether it be the vape shop guy ferrying his chocolate labs on a leaky kayak or a local butcher handing out food while loudly proclaiming the lack of flood defences is because of foreigners coming over and making use of public services and of course we have the genius mantra on this track of how little we are basically depicting humanity as being helpless in the face of the wrath of nature which they are stirring through the destruction of the environment then Dawson dishes out two of the catchiest song is on the entire record with two halves and jogging the come on come on refrains on the former are just too good I also love the galloping groove on the latter two and while it seems like Dawson is singing from the standpoint of other people on this record much of the time his descriptions of dealing with anxiety on this particular cut just seemed too detailed to not come from a personal place next we have the track heart emoji which sees the skipping muted guitar lines repeating along with these sporadic synth embellishments that are very gentle essentially it's a song about finding out that your partner is cheating by seeing some texts on their phone the whole thing comes to a bloody end that I won't totally spoil but I think that Dawson's character comes to the conclusion that some infidelity is going on pretty fast and maybe the ending would have been more interesting a little less absurd if the protagonist had realized he had come to a false assumption or something the song black triangle has one of the loudest and weirdest intros of any track on here it feels like a warp take on some classic arena rock song with grimy guitars and these fast little synth chords do it's like listening to the who's who are you but nightmare version the whole thing quickly transitions into these fast angular post-punk guitars and drums black MIDI fans take notice so you have this long winding multi-phase song structure these hard grieving verses and all this is attached to a story about a guy who had a run-in with a UFO then he becomes obsessed with UFOs to the point where he has a website and a YouTube channel where he tracks sightings his obsession seems to be destroying his marriage - it's a hilarious and enthralling song about getting caught up in a very weird thing but there you have it also the zany vocal harmonies during the last climax of the song are fantastic it's like in listening to a sci-fi folk Punk epic then we have fulfillment center which is a 10 minute long track and maybe has way more for thought put into it than any song about working in a fulfillment center should but I think Dawson does a great job of depicting the daily health at people who are caught in these types of jobs have to face the repetition all the products having to be shipped at such a fast pace people falling asleep on the job or disgruntled workers being escorted off the premises also having your movements and your work be timed and peeing into a bottle because you can't go to the bathroom Dawson also depicts this work as being an endless cycle with his protagonist saying that there is nothing left of them by the time they go home before they have to just go to sleep and wake up again to just start all over freshers ball is a decent low key moment in the tracklist here it's a so-so song about feeling lonely and missing someone while also finding solace in some little things and some silver linings of these clouds and the closer dead dog in an alleyway is a really climactic end of this record the grim imagery of the dead dog and having trouble finding a place to sleep and rest juxtaposed against the cold and callous never-ending movements of the city which Dawson depicts as a labyrinth of neon which is one of many moments of poetic genius across this project I'm really loving this one I'm living the shit out of this one what a challenging smart witty fun and unsettling contribution to the full catalog I'm also loving the personal and story centric songwriting throughout many of these tracks - which in a way reminds me a little bit of mark kozilek Sun Kil moon but obviously a lot of the storytelling here is much more dystopian and the instrumentals are coming from a totally different planet then there's also the case of Dawson singing which is just so expressive I think that Dawson's voice - many newcomers might sound a little homely but it certainly fits there snugly in these very sour and oddly catchy instrumentals if you're looking for a more pleasant and breezy and eful experience you might want to avoid this one maybe but personally I'm loving how unique and daring this project is I think that maybe it would be great if all of the themes and the stories tied together and in some way conceptually by the end of the whole thing they don't it's really just a collection of tracks but there's a great amount of focus amongst all of those songs and and a hell of a lot of great playing creative writing very memorable lyrics and stories and even though this thing is so dense it is so replayable at least for me anyway I'm feeling a light too decent 9:00 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana richard Dawson forever 
9mhJ74tBV0E,uh hey everyone there theny there tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album Ghost teen this is the newest record from legendary singer and songwriter Nick Cave and his band the Bad Seeds who have spent this decade sounding a lot more mellow than bad with records like push the sky away as well as skeleton tree and now ghosting all three of these albums essentially accounting for some of the most ambient moody and low-key records in the entire Nick Cave discography and for me that's meant a lot of highs and a lot of lows while I wasn't crazy about push the sky away I did love the profoundly dark and mournful tone of skeleton tree and ghost teen is essentially the third and final installment in this very melancholic trilogy now of course I can't say that I was surprised to hear that ghost teen was equally as low-key as its predecessors especially since this album comes well after the sudden passing of Nick Cave son and Nick spends quite a bit of time meditating on exactly that I mean he is essentially the ghost teen the album is titled after if anything is surprising about this album though it is the very lush and flowery cover depicting this idyllic green garden with flamingos and a horse and all these flowers it's beautiful its inviting it looks like something that would be on the cover of a book of fables and Nick uses exactly that iconography in his lyrics to explore his grief whether he's referencing kings and queens on the opening spinning song or on this collection of lyrics from the title track the three bears watched the TV they aged a lifetime oh Lord mama bear holds the remote papa bear he just floats and baby bear has gone to the moon in a boat these are not necessarily themes and aesthetics that I typically muscles it with a Nick Cave album that's not necessarily a bad thing either I think a lot of the writing on this thing is a welcome change of pace for Nick but I do think there are some elements of the music of the instrumentation that doesn't fully line up in fact ghost teen is like listening to two albums within one album and I don't just mean by virtue of this thing being pretty much a double or a two part album with a lot of these short moody vignettes kicking off the first portion and then we get these longer monstrous ten minute plus cuts in the second half no there's also the case of the instrumental tone the instrumental pallets of this project switching up and not I guess cohesively flowing in a way I care for that much it's either I'm listening to Nick Cave totally broken up over these ornately arranged beautiful rich organic instrumentals with an orchestral edge they're very weepy and occasionally cinematic so we have that where we're getting these long stretches of time where Nick is crooning over these minimal beds of synthesizers now sometimes these Styles overlap and pretty creatively I might add like on the track galleon ship which transitions from these droning very simple synth leads to this gorgeous rush of strings that is is really one of the prettiest moments on the entire project but not every synth bass track here meets that same glorious finish nor is every synth backed song on this record topped with the same quality poetry I'm also left wondering who exactly programmed these synthesizers because the sounds they're generating are not really all that great or immersive or flavorful much of the time the synths on this thing sound very rudimentary clunky awkward tinny generic I would say they ruin the moods of these tracks more than they enhance them most of the time and as long as we're talking about the sound of ghost teen this record is way too compressed for an album that is this quiet the whole thing just feels artificially loud and it's especially distracting considering how gentle the performances come off plus there's at least a few tracks here mostly ghost teen speaks as well as Leviathan where I find the compositions to be very banal and repetitive I get that this record is mostly about just kind of creating an instrumental vibe for Nick to just do his thing vocally and lyrically on top of again these tracks are very much vignettes motifs meditations extended quite a bit though I like a good record you can really marinate in the issue is I just don't really want to marinate in the sounds of the Nick and his band or generating here I just don't find the generic synth and occasionally sterile strains to be all that intriguing now look this is not the case for every track and if there is a major saving grace to pretty much every song here it is Nick's poetry it is Nick's singing these characteristics are really what make the sadness the potent sadness of this record translate so clearly especially on the opener especially on the whimpering eerie vocals and the second half of Hollywood especially as on the track waiting for you Nick's voice cracks like really hard as he is singing waiting for you waiting for you waiting for you making it easily one of the most powerful vocal performances of the year just from an emotional standpoint also on this project there are plenty of moments where Nick's words reach poetic genius like on the track Sun forest which features all of this very surreal and unsettling imagery of children climbing up and up and up it's profoundly chilling in one of the few moments on this record where Nick's voice hits that very grim Stern tone that he's known for the title track which works in multiple phases has this amazing build of strings around the midpoint which is enhanced with all these pianos and group vocalists it's grand it's gorgeous it's a high point on the album so there are certainly things I appreciate about this record and I think at the end of the day I came out enjoying most of it I just don't perceive it to be as one of Nick's best though is it one of my favorite sounding Nick Cave albums not really do I think it's one of his best composed do I think it's the most focused on the concept at hand not necessarily but from the standpoint of the vocals the lyrics as well as some of the narratives coming out of this thing it's easily one of Nick caves best so if you're someone who's more attracted to those elements of music and songwriting I highly recommend this record so it's certainly likable I see why people are more into it than I am and regardless of whether or not this is one of my favorites of Nick caves I am glad that he put out this record and was bold enough to share the turmoil he's been going through so earnestly feeling a decent too strong seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate

Q5rDfedBC3c,ooh hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sturgill Simpson album sound and fury this is the newest album from country renegade Sturgill Simpson it comes several years after his fantastic and widely acclaimed a sailor's guide to earth a great contribution to the modern country catalog fusing the genre with elements of rock elements of soul with some very grand and vast production occasionally some progressive compositional transitions Simpson is essentially a country artist who has the potential to do things in the genre that are left field that are outside of the norm that are ground breaking while simultaneously appealing to the core audience of that genre which is rare and because of that I have very much been looking forward to whatever his next record is going to be so here we have it sound and fury several years later but it comes after a turbulent series of events first we have Simpsons 2017 Grammy win for a country album of the year then a sinus infection so bad it required surgery leading to a lengthy recovery process that I'm reading Simpson mostly spent hi out of his mind he spent much of this downtime listening to old favorites outside of the country genre so eventually when he reconvened with the band they were ready to do even more unlikely fusions with the style sound and fury was also recorded in two weeks and comes along with a companion film on Netflix that Simpson wrote and produced along with the founder of a Tokyo animation studio kamikaze Doga the whole thing is about a post-apocalyptic Samurai so it kind of goes without saying that Simpson is coming from a somewhat weird place on this one and sure at its core it doesn't sound like Simpson has changed his songwriting style too much many of these tracks as out there as they can be do have a distinct country twang to them but Simpson and his band are dressing these country tunes in tons of compression tons of overdrive hardrock guitars disco rhythms vintage semi futuristic synthesizers all you have to do is hear a few seconds of the sci-fi synth leads and the chunky rhythms and the mind-numbing to know guitar leads on best clockmaker on Mars to hear that we are not in Kansas anymore look I'm not going to beat around the bush on this one these tracks are pretty experimental for Simpson any major relevant country artist working today really some of these experiments sound fantastic and others go so awry they make for Simpsons worst material to date for one I love the tracks sing-along which was great as a teaser even better as a poor song on the record fat drums on this track are fantastic the funky gurgly keyboard licks the whaling slide guitars too it's got a great groove I love Simpsons totally buzzing fuzz doubt lead vocal on this one the song sounds like an old friend but also like an alien from another planet the screaming synth leads on the bridge of this cut are nice - it's like I'm listening to dystopian cyber country I also love the track good look which is backed with these very fast peppy groovy disco beats that bassline that hip shaking beat those bright fluttery layers of strings on the track they all sound like something straight out of 1975 and the way the whole instrumental transitions into this loud laser synth breakdown is crazy when the instrumental clears on the verse a very solid tune is revealed as well as some smart and snappy lyrics about the end of the world Fame copyrights the song Ronan isn't the bad instrumental kickoff to this thing even though I think it does drag on a bit too long it's a little too impressed with its own lumbering rhythms and somewhat bland guitar passages remember to breathe there's also a track that I think contributes to the first leg of this album being incredibly solid however once you hit the midpoint of this thing I think the quality begins to take a nosedive for one I cannot stand make art not friends it takes way too long to get started and when it eventually gets there it's this slow lumbering awkward patience testing song you couldn't have up to the tempo on this one a little bit just just a smidge at this pace this track sounds like a bad Gary Numan song or at least like the band is is trying to perform in quicksand already voiced my annoyances with best clock maker on Mars those two note guitar riffs are awful all said and done is a very sweet mellow melodic oasis in the second leg of this record but it's still not a highlight for me meanwhile the production on Last Man Standing is trash it just sounds like a really bad live recording with the guitars blaring to the point where they're smothering everything the drums sound like they're being played at a distance the vocals are muffled and and just really unintelligible much of the time so even if the song at the core of this one is one of the bettors of this entire project you you wouldn't really be able to tell from just how not good it sounds some of the new wave elements that were very lightly referenced earlier on the record come back on mercury in retrograde where it sounds like we have some nice punchy drums some lightly phased and gently strum guitars it's plucky it's pretty sounds a little intergalactic when you get that wonderful rush of instrumentation on the chorus there are some parts of it that remind me of the cars then we have the fastest horse in town the longest track on the entire record and it is so goddamn loud especially the guitars it just gets more and more distorted the whole thing is like an asteroid burning up in Earth's atmosphere look there are some elements of this album that I admire that I think are risky that I think are very cool and there are others that again I don't think compliment Simpson all that much I don't think go over that well I think frankly sound awful I like that Simpson and his band really let loose on this one but a lot of terrible ideas and sounds go completely unchecked and there are really enough of them to make this record a very spotty inconsistent listen I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana sound and fury forever 
iFhKD4KPLV4,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks the week had a busy week this week so I'm going to try to go over a lot of these songs quickly and effectively they're all linked down below per usual there are a few links that I want to shout out before I get too deep into the weekly track roundup of course down there in the description box is our patreon page get over there get access to some exclusive monthly bonus content and we also have a link down below is a pre-order for our wonderful charity compilation with money going to the immigrant legal Resource Center we have a limited amount of vinyl pre-orders and in fact I

here too if you want access to all that grab that vinyl and yeah that's that's it our Amazon and turntable lab links are down there as well and this is the worst tracks the worst tracks this week which which there were quite a few of honestly last week we kind of got by with no worse tracks at all no songs that I thought were really worth talking about that I hated or disliked this week not as lucky unfortunately first off panda bear with a brand new single playing the long game panda bear essentially vocalizing in his usual way over a shimmering trap beat did not need to know that this could happen had no interest in this fusion of sounds I mean it's it's not a stereotypical trap beat it's a trap ish beat I'll say that it's trap enough to be distracting and just feel like panda bear contextual II is putting himself in a really average place that is incredibly unimpressive so not really diggin on this new track especially considering how creative a lot of the sound palettes were from his last full length LP we asked we also have a little TJ over here with the song one take which is a painfully bland nasal a little crooned trap ballad with not much going on for it in terms of flavor or memorability we also have French Montana twisted Juicy J logic and not not really ASAP Rocky he's on the track but he does not do a feature and Juicy J is is pretty much just on the hook here the French Montana verse is not good and who the hell would ever want to hear logic mixed up with with these three on a track plus the instrumental is bland as hell not into it it's it's not good all right we also have fka twigs brand new song over here I thought this new track would be much better than the Future cut that dropped a little while back but um outside of the Radiohead ish piano chords and some of the vocalizations here and there I am not liking this track at all in fact the production is so horrible it's embarrassing some of the weird vocal manipulations and effects thrown on Twiggs voice sound quite bad and don't really do anything for the song which is weakly structured boring not really captivating in any sense of the word not really sure I have anything positive to say about this song at all just thought it was really weak incredibly weak next cigarettes after sex continued to be one of the blandest and most uninteresting indie pop outfits now they're falling in love is the name of the new track over here I'm just not really getting the appeal the guitar sound dime-a-dozen the drum sound dime-a-dozen the vocal sound dime-a-dozen the songwriting sounds dime-a-dozen there's literally nothing about this band that is distinct or memorable or they're really worth noting I just don't I just don't get it oh and the new Camila Cabello track easy it is the most stereotypical formulated piece of pop balladry that i've heard at least in the past few months right down to the boring subdued verses that do absolutely nothing to the overly processed vocals on the hook that just sound alien it's it's a really um gutless piece of pop and yeah it's it's a completely useless we also have blue face and in god blue face close-up terrible track you know it's it's really saddening and shocking how quickly blue face like lost all the original appeal that he broke into the scene with I mean sure there are a few funny one-liners here and there on this new cut over here but for the most part his wild delivery his off-kilter offbeat wrap and flow style is just uh really out the window now and and he's settled into a very slick very commercial very predictable sound that um really doesn't do anything other than neuter the the I guess I want to say the the the Bay Area sound I guess it's a it's boring and let's get into the tracks that we thought were kind of meh not crazy not driving me up a wall or anything but a little underwhelming certainly worth your attention you might dig them more than me first off you hate to say it and you hate to see it but the new swans track the hanging man many of the guitar passages on this track I thought were a little tedious Michael jiriz vocal performance is probably the best thing about the entire cut it's animated he's shouty although I won't say that there's anything groundbreaking about his singing on this track and it's really just the progression of the song that that's the most uninspired because while sure the first several minute minutes of the track are nothing new for swans very much in the same vein as everything else they've been dropping off their past three records I mean I could see myself liking this track if it progressed to a more exciting place over the 10 minute plus runtime that it offers here but it really doesn't all I can really do is hope that maybe this song is like a transitional cut along the length of a larger project that swans is going to be releasing very soon if it's not I'm just not really sure why this track needs to be the length and the size that it is while there are some intriguing passages here and there it doesn't really head to an interesting or a climactic place by the finish so I'm just not sure we have Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds this track Hollywood off of the new record ghosts teen which I'm going to be talking about very soon we're not gonna get into the depths of this track because I plan on reviewing this record very soon but do know that the Nick Cave record is out I do plan on talking about it and this track Hollywood is a very lengthy instrumentally intricate epic with a lot of sombre vocals from Nick himself we also this new track from money bag yo and Megan the stallion there are elements of this track that I like all that is the name of the track and I I guess I'm just disappointed that this is like the most raunchy and sexual track and it's just not really sexy at all it's not sure what's off about it I think there could be more Megan on the track I also think money bags voice is a little goofy and some of the lyrics are a little corny you know I do like the raunchiness of it but there's nothing really all that sexy about the track unfortunately and I do like some hard-hitting raunchy rap music but to my ears this this was just not it we also have Liz Phair who is back Liz Phair Liz freaking fair who has never completely disappeared from the limelight ever but but still good side is the name of her new single over here it's a pretty decent little indie / alternative acoustic rock tune you know it's it's a little cleanly produced and a little predictable but it's it's not bad it's not bad vocals are pretty good the tune is fine and Julian Baker who who has come through with the song Tokyo a another sad slow burning indie singer-songwriter banger over here Julian Baker shout out to her gucci mane featuring little baby quirky instrumental on this one few dope lines from gucci but little baby tends to weigh down any track that he appears on because he's just absolutely boring and DJ shadow unfortunately this latest track from his upcoming project urgent important please read featuring Rockwell knuckles tempo and Damon is just does not excuse me a little underwhelming it's not all that great I think the beat is a little bland and the features could have been more couldn't more exciting we also have a JT's first day out from city girls yes one half of the city girls is now back out of prison after what I remember to be credit card fraud five again if I recall correctly and while I'm not super crazy about every bar that has dropped in this track it's pretty YUM it's pretty heartfelt track it's pretty passionate song about essentially making her a long way to return and I guess let's let's see if city girls kill it past here and let's get into the tracks I thought were the best ones this week quite a few quite a few quite a few a lot to cover ba-bam we have this new Nina Kravis vocal remix of st. Vincent's in New York as there is a new sort of expanded or sort of I guess remix version of that record coming out very soon excuse me and this one's a pretty heady very heady very cerebral a lot of very understated vocals driving dance beats it's pretty minimal but but I like it a lot we also have a loving this new track sugar honey iced tea s H eye tea from Princess Nokia loving that she's making this amazing entrance into the realm of horn backed pop rap and she's doing with so much personality so much humor and with a focus on just haters you know the typical shit people like to hear but still she is killing it in this format of again vocals and flows sound great energy is amazing personality is out there and bold and music video is pretty fun too so shout out to princess Nokia Omni the scroop I'm now finding out about thanks to us Sub Pop Records has this track out titled courtesy call and it's a very fun angular piece of I guess art punk post-punk with some weird tight bass and guitar licks and very strange out there lead vocals it sounds a lot older than it actually is this actually sounds like some post-punk that you would hear in like 1981 but instead it's like 2019 and it's a still pretty fun digging it a lot it's very good shout out to a Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth Fame who is a really kind of building up big-time to this new solo effort that she's a gonna be releasing or rather has released and I hope to talk about soon I'm not gonna talk too much about this track it's wild it's noisy it's exciting I'm going to be talking about this record soon you'll hear me lights up Harry Styles new track liked it full thoughts on a track review over at the Fantana channel thought that the moody nocturnal shift Harry makes on this track along with some of the shimmering beautiful choral vocals worked into the track were quite nice it's a little maroon 5 it's a little Sam Smith but I dug it a lot also shout-out to gorilla toss who continued to kill it with some of the most futuristic angular rock pop and post-punk music in the game digging on this new track over here that they have dropped titled future doesn't know also caribou with this wonderful wonderful song called home which features a lot of driving dance beats some hip hop loops some soul samples some the subdued but sweet and effective lead vocals it's a real mix of genres over here not a mix that you typically hear in a caribou song but it comes together really nicely really effectively anam love love loving it also shout out to Bronte Bonnie Prince Billy who continues to drop one solid ballad after another from his forthcoming LP in good faith is the title of this new one it's a beautiful tune beautiful tune Black Mountain comes through with one of the most badass tracks that I've heard them drop in a while what's your conquest is the name of this new one good riffs good drums good grooves vocals are okay but I'm loving the fusion of the those analog synthesizers into the mix sounds a little futuristic for them and I'm loving it bj the chicago kid in re linux time today remix who knew these two had this level of chemistry on a fucking song goddamn I mean I I it's rare that I am blown away by bj the chicago kid admittedly I've not dived deeply enough into the re Lennox record as much as I should have this year and I do have plans to do that at some point but I am incredibly impressed with what these two have done together on this remix again chemistry off the charts on this track wonderful energy they're bringing together on this one very sexy very sexy very loving very sensual very fun and a big thief big thief new record out I believe and this new one over here two hands I'm digging on it quite a bit I'm very happy to be going into this new record with two songs that I am enjoying a lot as opposed to their last record which I thought was very underwhelming so I'm being given hope you know reason to be excited to listen to this new LP I don't want to count big thief out because they seem like one of the biggest new things in indie folk and so many people love him and are excited about them and I see the talent there I just didn't think it was executed all that well in the last LP maybe this new one will wow me we will see we will see an - Nico stupid young baby Tate on the feature it's a weird tongue-in-cheek left-field zany neon-colored banger with some very blunt and pretty funny lyrics I'm liking the energy that ash Nico is bringing to the table it's weird it's wild it's fun let's go and Oh am a an artist who I came into thanks to an email from from the the artist herself slip is the name of this new track over here it's a quirky fun super catchy a little blend of pop and alternative R&B it's it's great track it's a great track it's it's really good also fun little music video attached to it as well and looking forward to hearing where she goes from here because to my ears this is not a bad single there's not a bad single at all so and that has been the weekly track round up everyone thank you very much for watching hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this vid all the songs that I talked about are linked down below check them out for yourselves and remember once more linked down below our compilation charity compilation immigrant legal Resource Center pick up copies before they go out the last thousand you know we've already sold well over a thousand of these so far so we are down to less than a thousand of these pick it up before it goes away and remember our our patreon is down there too and you know yeah yeah you guys are the best Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
d3MJLRnWAxQ,haha hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Billy woods record terror management this is a record from one of the most mysterious rappers operating right now Billy woods he's from the east coast at least I think he is who really knows where Billy woods is from he's like a shadow one that's being cast by a street light or the full moon he's there and he's also not Billy woods is the dark web he's the feeling of knowing that a pair of eyes are watching you and he's pretty prolific too between his solo works as well as the increasingly popular duo he formed with a lucid Armand Hammer he's put out like nine projects over the past seven years many of them account for some of my favorite hip-hop records of the decade race music paraffin history will absolve me known unknowns his recent project with Kenny Siegel has been one of his most widely celebrated yet turning a lot of new Billy listeners into hardcore fans and that thing just dropped this past March now again for new Billy listeners I could see why that project would be a bit of a revelation Billy's delivery is unique and one-of-a-kind it's a mix of rapping shouting narration the tone of his lyrics are a mix of grim realities and depressing social commentaries loaded with wit dark humor and presented in a way where it's a little esoteric so it's not coming off to direct or preachy case in point the track Trivial Pursuit off of his new project over here where he's going on about a white person recognizing him by his voice if you don't know Billy woods likes to keep his face pretty obscured so Billy being recognized by his voice and then saying white people are born cops one more line that stood out shorty Cantino book is what I told Tana hussy coats and there's so much truth at one bar when you unpack it with it obviously being a nod to poverty going hungry and then tying that into the work of writer and political commentator Tana Haji Coates who does have some smart observations about the current political landscape but in his own way Billy acknowledges that his observations as well as his solutions to modern problems come from a place of privilege as it's really difficult to fuel a revolution on starvation wages the messages being reinforced later about all of the lies Billy woods learned in Community College or not being able to read a book if he tried and the way all this compounds into a commentary on Western education its miss truths but also its ineffectiveness for those who are born into poverty with serious material needs so this is often how Woods tracks work he throws raw ideas and snippets and observations out there that are obviously connected in some way but you sort of have to fill in the blanks to see what he's getting at and realize all of the answers are overlapping like a crossword puzzle and being able to make these connections often requires the listeners to have a framework of American history and so much more as they're still tracks from woods back catalogue that I love but I'm still decoding to this day so going into this new one I was basically just hoping for something new refreshing maybe even thematic creatively the dude really seems to be on a streak and personally I think he's been putting out great stuff all along and it's just amazing to see that that now finally people are beginning to realize it I gotta say though this new one I'm not finding it to be as gratifying as many abilities a recent works a lot of the instrumentals here are textured but very repetitive dusty a little humdrum as brooding and dark as some of the instrumentals are on Marlow and myth and blood thinner the loops just get very stale very fast it really means something on this project when Billy spits a bar like I wish I could have waited inside that moment forever like a beat loop occasionally it does feel that way in a way this record does remind me of Armand hammers second project Rome as that's easily the most under produced project Billy has released with a lucid so far and here Billy is sounding similarly loose rough around the edges a little unfocused a direction that I think complements some artists very well and given Billy's very grimy pedigree I can't deny that it does compliment him to some extent but I still think multiple core tracks from this project leave a lot to be desired whether it be the very was II and nearly comatose cornstarch which is wrapped in this very lazy slow-mo style it's like Billy's is on the verge of falling asleep it's a cool experiment but the lack of direction and structure prevents it from having much in the way of any impact quite a few underwhelming cuts on here and even when Billy manages to do something more in-your-face often the energy feels misdirected numerous tracks on this thing are also surrounded with these much shorter cuts that just feel very fleeting they don't really inspire much outside of a spare quotable or two that was then myth dog days and these songs are not to be confused with the multiple wrapped vignettes off of Billy's very ambitious 2015 record today I wrote nothing an album that was essentially a very creative exercise and brevity there are also a few other tracks on here that aren't quite as short but maybe toward the end or even in the middle transition into a very lengthy vocal snippet maybe from a movie or a series I'm not familiar with the source material and this is certainly not the first time Billy has worked stuff like this into his records and I most likely would have enjoyed these bits more had the songs been hardy ER but these spots often feel unnecessary distracting like filler and usually communicate more than the music preceding them does which brings me to some of the guests on this thing especially fielded who appears on this project more than anyone else while I do enjoy her singing when it pops up it certainly makes this entire project a lot less monotonous often her appearances just allow Billy to extend an otherwise underwritten track either taking up the whole first leg or second leg of a track before it just fades to black the closer on this thing is mostly inconsequential to I just feel like I have so many complaints about this one and maybe that's because I have such a high opinion of Billy's work up until this point but there are cuts on this thing I like quite a bit Western education is forbidden that I was talking about earlier the song gas leak whose instrumental is fantastic one of the best on the entire record with these very raw and resonant drums eventually leading into these shots of industrial noise rhymes that dart back and forth like a man going through a manic monologue in his head the beats which in the middle of the track is fantastic I also love the insane psychedelic on low five birds on one of Billy's best lyrical and vocal performances on the entire project all the guest verses here from maka me pink Sifu as well as acai solo certainly improves long grass as well as wind Hoek and Fonua new which I'm not sure I'm pronouncing correctly but still easily the most eerie song in the entire project billy's refrains on this track compiled with the either effects or overdubs on his voice sound like a nightmare also the plucky strings on the beats which in the second leg of the track the way Billy's vocals just intensify as he's delivering some of the best lyricism on the entire record so yeah there are certainly highlights here and there's nothing honestly on the record I thought was terrible incredibly disappointing I was just left wanting more from most of it and still at the end of the day this is a billy woods album by that fact alone you are going to walk into this record with a certain level of talent and style and flair that you're not going to get in many other places so even in it's as is somewhat dodgy current state there are still some cool beats there's still a lot of details there are still nooks and crannies just a lot of it isn't fleshed out very far I'm feeling eight decent too strong six on this one transition have you given this one

V2ZTJ8oD4TQ,hi everyone vibe the new check tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Danny Brown album you know what I'm saying Michigan rapper Danny Brown who has been one of the grime iasts to ever do it and he's back with a new album what can be said about Danny Brown other than that he is the definition of ahead of the curve raised in a hip hop landscape he was just too unorthodox for as his career didn't really begin to take off until he hit the age of 30 with his breakout mixtape of the same title in 2011 but when Danny did eventually start to turn heads his unique qualities became a draw his druggie raunchy excessive lyrics his party anthems that were simultaneously a dark cry for help and all of it delivered in this wild yell pee inflection that really sounded like nothing else at the time though in retrospect it's really easy to draw stylistic comparisons to pioneers like the wu-tang's ODB as well as Cypress Hills be real now while this is not something I discuss too often in reviews but another draw - Danny was definitely his look the side shave his colorful clothing and of course his missing front tooth it's worth it to bring up though because since then since the earlier leg of this decade it seems like Danny has cleaned up and matured quite a bit even going as far as to fill that legendary gap it's like he's transitioned from being the biggest party animal on the planet to everybody's cool uncle and I've been wondering what this could mean for future releases from Danny essentially giving up that reckless look and lifestyle that fuelled his most popular material especially after his last record 2016 atrocity exhibition took such a dark turn it's a record I named my album of the year that year Danny's performances and lyrics and instrumental choices on this one are so extreme I doubt he'll ever top this record not that I need him to ultimately all I want Danny to do is evolve so where do you go after such a dark and challenging statement well with you know what I'm saying it sounds like Danny is pretty much simplifying things streamlining reeling things in on a lot of fronts for one this is his shortest project in a long long time would have to go back to some of his earliest mixtapes to hear something shorter 11 songs 34 minutes there also doesn't seem to be a concept or a major theme pulling all of these tracks together either and Danny still has unique taste for beats but there's nothing on here that's as wild or bombastic as like a blunt after blunt or ain't it funny in fact multiple tracks and instrumentals here feel like a bit of a stylistic throwback it feels like a slightly subversive update on a lot of classic rap formulas as a matter of fact none other than A Tribe Called Quest's q-tip executive produced this thing and it shows in its old-school ear so given these potpourri and somewhat scattered characteristics of this record the enjoy ability of it really boils down to whether or not each one of these tracks is great individually or if it's somehow it gets tiresome before the record is over I can tell you that last one is not really an issue I am actually left wanting more by the time this thing is finished and most of the tracks Danny delivers here are actually pretty good there are some underwhelming spots though like the intro change-up which in my opinion is a slightly boring tone setter it's almost like Danny is not trying to build up expectations too much for this thing we have an atmospheric instrumental not a whole lot of groove a clunkier version of a very familiar flow understated delivery at least for Danny anyway I like the sentiment of the song this idea of Danny not looking back going forward being unwilling to change in a way that would cheapen his art or himself it's just a somewhat bland kick off we also have the title track here whose instrumental sounds more fitting for that of a young alternative R&B singer just swimming in a lot of space and atmosphere the messaging gets a little tedious too with Danny relaying a piece of advice or a life observation and following that up with know what I'm saying it's certainly not the worst thing I've ever heard Danny put out but it's so OneNote the biggest breath of fresh air on the track is actually the featured artist or bong Junior who brings these deep smoky vocals of this track really pops out I love his voice on belly of the beast - I have complaints about that track too though Danny's writing on this track is some of the funniest and wittiest on the entire record I'm anemic with the ink you a Stevie Wonder blink I take a piss in the same sink you wash dishes with you're illiterate you're Bisquick soft I put the biscuit then you dip like cocktail sauce I use so many shrimp I got iodine poison hose on my dick because I look like Roy Orbison that is certainly some classic Danny Brown if I've ever heard some but I just do not get this barely there whooshing instrumental that doesn't really support Danny or his guests on the track it just feels like just just a very weak foundation thankfully the rest of what's here is pretty high-grade the track three tiers featuring run the jewels also has production from JPEG mafia totally bangs even if the rtj feature is pretty standard for them at this point I love the track theme song on which there is a mystical and strange instrumental Danny delivers these brutally frank bars he's kind of flexing his vet status on this track I never thought I would see the day where Danny transitions from partying weirdo who's widely misunderstood to having enough clout to look down on younger rappers as if they're uniquely lost or clueless but here we are even going as far as to say you need to learn some respect and I've done more for the game than you it doesn't leave the best taste in my mouth but I guess Danny has earned the right at this point he could have easily lost it all like many other rappers who popped off around the same time he did but instead he's still going relatively strong after well over a decade in the industry and holding on to his artistic integrity the whole time I wasn't crazy about dirty laundry when I first heard it it has these weird squeaky synths laced into the instrumental and Danny's flow read to me more like spoken word at some points with how I guess mid-paced it is and how much space there is in between many bars but it's grown on me with more lessons mostly because the instrumental is so odd and I'm loving the concept lyrically that Danny has pulled through on this track talking about dirty secrets and experiences from his past working in all these references to laundry dirtiness soap cleaning with the whole narrative tying back up at a laundromat on the finish easily one of Danny's most well formulated tracks so far we also have the killer savage nomads which goes harder than any other cut here with those droning bass hits those sparkling guitar lead samples that classic lo-fi hip-hop beat the quotables on this track are on fire whether Danny's saying something simple like same shit different porta potti or it's quite simple I'm mental all over instrumental detrimental to hit lyrics is quintessential it's a good mix of flash and brutality on the song best life we hear kind of a hopeful forward-looking Danny which is rare it's like he's embracing his new life path over a rich soulful instrumental that is very feel-good kind of blissful I love the tight string samples on this track how well they complement Danny's lyrics about moving forward progressing getting away from your dark past and things that used to stress you out also got a compliment the tight-end busy Negro spiritual which features some great production and and playing from Flying Lotus and Thundercat the drumbeats are intricate they are shifting Thundercats bases just wild angular all over the place it provides a very strange intense foundation for Danny's almost manic rapping we also have JPEG mafia on the hook here sadi didn't have a full verse to add to this track but his very expressive raspy tone on this cut which which is almost wheezy I guess I'll say wheezy was kind of a surprise the man has so many inflections and in deliveries he's easily one of the most dynamic artists out there and he killed the hook I also love Danny's writing style and delivery on this track it's almost like I'm listening to a more insane version of hybrid era Danny it's like he's finally channeling the dark energy is that surround him that his music embodies a lot of the time and focusing them in a creative way danny is also complemented by blood orange on the following track shine which emotionally is a mix of hope and tragedy danny is reveling in the success in the shine that he has built up but he's also feeling paranoid and vulnerable like his career can be ripped away from him at any moment by I don't know what but still even as he's moving forward and doing better these dark thoughts still paint the back of his mind now if this album were more thematic or conceptual I would love a closer that kind of ties things up and and tells us exactly what this record is about but we don't really get that instead we get the track combat which is still a great track you know it's it's one of the punchy ER songs here one of the slicker songs here so it doesn't make for a bad finish it features production from q-tip vocals from q-tip also consequences on here of all people that's awesome that he came through and the song is great I mean instrumentally it feels like a classic tribe anthem with these fluttery horn samples and great somewhat chunky lo-fi rhythms vocally Danny tones it down a little but not as aggressive not as in-your-face not as nasal lower register and in this gear over this instrumental Danny actually sounds like the rap veteran that he truly is skilled expressive lyrical clever dealing in themes of trauma violence and survival not too much more for me to say about the album broadly I mean it's just a really great collection of tracks a few duds here and there but that's it the vibe is definitely more casual than that of Danny's other core projects but it also speaks to his talent and his artistry for him to drop a project of this caliber without having to overthink it I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if

SS979VU0o4s,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a y-you know review where I go over a series of records that I didn't have a chance to do a formal review on over the past month or so I give my thoughts on them in brief here let's go I wish I could get into this cult of Luna album as much as many of the metalheads I'm seeing around the internet are but I'm just not really all that crazy about this particular brand of post-metal it's just so slow-paced and I don't find the sound or aesthetic of it all that interesting while it is atmospheric and it is sludgy I just don't find it all that heavier heavy enough to interest me and then a lot of the guitar passages to me just read like very watered-down post-rock bits the vocals are kind of savage but across the length of the entire record I think they could use a bit more variation it's it's okay it's alright it's it's not bad while it's on but it's it's not anything that really excites me or stirs up anything in me honestly skwydd EP check out this band making fantastic post-punk music oh my god the energy of these tracks is excellent the intro track is a bit odd and how jeroni and abstract it is didn't really anticipate that but the other more rock-oriented cuts that come after are great can't say it's all that substantive as it's it's really just a very short EP with a handful of cuts on it but it is one of the better EPS I've heard this year no question no question no question and it's definitely got me wondering where is this band going next what is the next sound what is the next record I want to hear more let's go new men I trust record which I've been getting a lot of requests for a lot a lot of requests for and I've gone back to it again and again and again and again and it's it's Pleasant while it's on there's some pretty good tracks on here - but I'm just failing to enjoy the entire record I mean this thing is it pretty sophisticated and slightly groovy maybe even a little jazzy dream in indie pop record but it is so long and kind of faint and a little one-dimensional - I mean I can't really say there is enough variety and highs and lows across the 70 minute LP to justify the length by the time I'm on track 12 I'm like okay this is pretty good but I mean unless we're going anywhere with this I'm just about done now while I admire the ambition that went into this many songs being on one record and basically how passionately the band are essentially diving into all of these dreamy nooks and crannies wider scope the whole thing just seems a little narrow in focus but hey if you want a really long chill dreamy poppy album listen to it new corn record I can't say that this is a horrible album it's not i think corn has returned to form a little a little a wee little bit on this record there are some tracks that are easily some of their worse on here like ringmaster which is absolutely obnoxious however Jonathan Davis and company are sounding pretty solid on this one the vocals are pretty intense the drumming is good I wish the bass lines were a bit more out there like they used to be when filled he was in his prime but they're just not really there the band's sound generally is a lot cleaner then I think it used to be a lot smoother then I think it used to be not as animalistic but it's it's it's it's not the path of totality it's not the path of totality I've been waiting to see if an interesting opinion bubbles up out of me in regards to this new Willow Smith record for a while now but unfortunately it's just not the case I don't think it's very good I get that she is letting loose a little bit and she is letting her freak flag fly a little bit this one's more acoustic this one certainly artsy er than her last record seems like she's less inhibited on this one but some of the production is really really rough some of the singing is very very bad and some of the lyrics aren't really all that great either I mean it's cool to hear willow in a context where she doesn't seem like she has any limitations to what she could try to do if she had it in her heart to do it but I think there's a lot of skill lacking here skill in writing skill and performing that is going to need to be brushed up on for any future release from her to be interesting ceremony is back and they are once again diving into the post-punk transition the classic post-punk transition that they made not too long ago at their last record that was incredibly lackluster in my opinion this one is actually a lot better nowhere near as good as their hardcore punk stuff but better hooks better writing better production on this one it's it's just still painfully derivative though when it comes to this style of music while I don't mind bands dabbling in this classic Joy Division Bauhaus esque post-punk sound maybe a bit more angular grooves on this one a little Devo ish at points I I wish that the approach they took was a bit more memorable distinct but it's not however I will say again improvement so maybe the next record will be even better new dive record has some pretty nice textures on it I will say that it's definitely not the most creative record out there that has a shoegaze e slant to it though when it comes to Sonics and ultimately what makes this record so lackluster to me because the sound is quite nice when it's on a lot of the songwriting is kind of dull definitely highlights on here but a majority of the songwriting is is very very dull and not that memorable if I take away anything from this record again it's the textures which once more are not the best I've heard in my entire life it's a just very middle-of-the-road I guess but if you got to hear every sound and every record in this style then I guess try it the new Slater mixtape which I was pretty psyched to try given how enjoyable I thought a lot of the singles leading up to this thing we're but a lot of the tracks on this thing are previously released songs so there's not a whole lot left up to the imagination here there is a lot of Britney Spears worship on this thing especially the edgy ur side of her discography those toxic type tracks that tends to be where I think Slater gets a bulk of her inspiration though I will say the production is slightly more futuristic than a lot of what Bernie Spears was doing around that time and that's certainly what puts Slater in line with the Charli xcx's and the arena so Yama's of the world right now though I don't think Slater is nearly as bold or putting as interesting a spin on her 2000s pop inspiration that's really what I would truly love to see from Slater going forward and maybe we will there's definitely potential here new Kano record did not like this one as much as made in the manner just really melodramatic to me I love so many of the grime cuts off that last album and there just wasn't really enough of that on this new one I thought the production was weaker when he sings on this one it's not really all that good just a really scatter shot record that tries to deliver the audience a slightly more introspective emotional tone but for the most part that kind of fell flat for me so just not really into it sadly oh this new Pixies record whoo what do I even say at this point but the comeback is not good it's it's just Oh [Music] Opeth new record once again English and a Swedish version of this one that's nice and the band is still kind of inhabiting this space where they are coming out with some slightly vintage progressive rock with some very glossy production I'll say that this record is is a bit more theatrical than their last one but I find a lot of the compositions to be a little long-winded I think that the vocals aren't really all that interesting either it's well produced it's very clean it's very tight very derivative though but that's pretty much part of the course for everything in the progressive rock vein the band has done thus far I mean this is really marked the most uninteresting era in a pets entire career thus far but it seems they just have a really deep passion for it because they are not letting up and and I assume hardcore fans care for it quite a bit so yeah not sure I have much more to say about it other than if you love some old-school progressive rock but with some newer more modern slick clean theatrical sounds and you've been enjoying everything that Opeth has been doing in this prog year era of their discography try it and you'll most likely dig it I love that Milo has grown in profile so much that he can essentially start a poet gang call it Ruby yacht and come out with a record this one is it's not bad the instrumentals are pretty creative though many of them do get very repetitive I mean the the loops are nice anyway and there are a lot of very wild rap styles and deliveries across this thing even Milo himself really gets out of his comfort zone and and starts giving us flows and inflections you wouldn't typically hear on one of his solo efforts but I gotta say the talent gap between many of the members of Ruby Yacht is at least wide enough to notice you know there's not a whole lot of a consistency across each member and as a result the quality and and just the sound the cohesion I think suffers everybody is doing their own thing even if at the end of the day you can couch all of it into this very esoteric weirdly abstract maybe even a little tongue-in-cheek rap style new Liam Gallagher record it's okay it's a lot like the last one frankly I mean enough that's a bad thing you know if you're crazy about his brand of singer-songwriter music his brand of Britpop you're probably gonna dig on it you're probably gonna dig on it the production is quality sometimes a bit too high gloss the songwriting for the most part is solid but I mean if you've been listening to Liam songs for years there's nothing really all that new on here a few tracks rock a bit harder than others it's very middle of the road it's very middle of the road new Jenny have all record I was pretty excited to listen to this one unfortunately I found many of the tracks to be pretty one-dimensional when stacked on top of each other as an album as individual tracks and his teasers I did enjoy the mystical linear groovy vibe that a lot of these songs brought but there's just not really enough variation across the entire LP to make it an interesting listen from front to back which is kind of unfortunate because I thought that a lot of the material off of Jenny's recent EP was pretty good while I do think this album is one of her most accessible releases yet I think it could have used a bit more variation I am struggling to think of an emo trap record that has worse lyrics than this little Tracy album like nearly every track has one garbage bar after another and the singing isn't even good it's it's easily one of the worst releases in this genre why are we getting another not so good m83 album makes me sad new Lumineers record not interested if I wanted to listen to basically all of the most generic tropes of indie folk from the 2000s and watered-down in such a way where they're nearly soulless I would just watch a car commercial because that's most likely where you're gonna hear music like this in a car commercial oh this new Kemba record I was so excited to try this I thought that I was gonna end up loving it canva formerly known as as YC the cynic really talented New York rapper and there are definitely tracks on this album that showcased that talent really well and I'm enjoying some of the personal themes coming out in this record as well because there are some verses and tracks and moments that focus on the fact that he's recently lost his mother to a stroke and those moments are pretty dark pretty intense but the record generally is his most inconsistent yet he tries out so many different instrumental styles songwriting styles more singing different flows and deliveries and while I do appreciate that because prior Kemba were YC was usually a pretty OneNote but still incredibly talented rapper and lyricist like dude could spit and spit and spin spit sure he usually stayed within the realms of hardcore hip-hop and jazz rap and and more boom-bap centric styles and sounds and obviously he's branching out here branching out being a good thing but I think a lot of the sounds and what he's attempting here has not been entirely smooth out yet so there are some again attempts as stepping outside of his comfort zone that I think are very rough around the edges and could use quite a bit of work still though I do encourage generally you know stepping outside of that comfort zone and trying new things and doing something different but I still think there are a lot of kinks that need to be worked out here in terms of individual song is not going over all that well and finally there are so many various ideas spread across this record it doesn't really come together all that effectively as a project it feels almost like a compilation or a very scattered mixtape so with this one I definitely admire the ambition I like some of the personal themes but I think the execution could use quite a bit of of work on this one unfortunately new metronomy album I'm struggling to decide if whether or not this is worse than their last one and not that every song on it is terrible there are some pretty funky fun tongue-in-cheek tracks here with some good lyrics some memorable choruses however those are very much canceled out by the songs on here that are annoying by the songs on here that just seemed like completely unnecessary interludes that don't add anything to the tracklist it's very much a mess the highlights are not enough to keep all of it afloat in my opinion certainly not one of their better ones I'll say that all this time and I'm still yet to really get into Melanie Martinez and I can't say that this new record is is doing much better I mean I I do think some of the songs on this one are more interesting than her last full-length LP but generally I just don't find her vocals all that great I don't think the production is all that interesting the best thing that Melanie typically is going for her is just her eccentric look and vibe and the concepts that she usually laces throughout her albums I mean those are all pretty cool but I just don't think the music the writing the instrumentals are nearly as out there or as creative as the visuals and the vibe and the themes that Melanie presents newgate Creeper record which is a pretty heavy death metal record if you're looking for some mosh anthems it's it's not bad I think it's kind of OneNote and and I don't care that much for the guitar tone on this one it's just got this very high-pitched buzz to it that gets grating to me after a while not really in a good way again it's some pretty throttling modern death metal that's relatively badass if you need that itch scratched listen to it given how good their compilation was I am very sad to hear Cu space cowboy transition from being one of the more interesting revivalists of this spazzy post hardcore metalcore sound and and now they've essentially become a group whose music i am scrambling to put back into the CD rack at my local Hot Topic the chunky riffs and the breakdowns and the vocals and the lack of eccentricities on this one frankly the eccentricities that the compilation have on many tracks is is just not pleasant to hear new girl band record and I thought I would like this one more than the last one and I definitely love the roots of what this band is trying to do here you know the noise rock influences the No Wave influences it there are points where it's savage but I still don't think the band has that interesting of a sound it's not abrasive enough sometimes and I occasionally think some of the tracks here pretty repetitive and not really in a gratifying or a hypnotic way either so I don't know it's kind of animalistic it's got some guts on it I just don't think it's the most interesting noise rock I've heard and and that and that's really all there is to it I think new titus andronicus album is certainly less shoddy and more consistent in their last record but the productions are okay the performances are just okay the singing I think could be reined in a bit a bit more direct and less like Patrick is just growling over a lot of these instrumentals indiscriminately the sloppiness of it I think takes away from the potential that a lot of the songwriting has and some of the songwriting isn't that bad you know it's it's that continued and somewhat quality mix of punk rock and Americana and folk that titus andronicus is known for but just with a lot less gratification for me personally anyway Kim Petrus just stands Halloween this is her second project and even longer one where she's just coming up with spooky Halloween themed pop sadly I don't think it's as good or as consistent or as well written as clarity it could be scarier I mean the lyrics are a little edgy and bloody and morbid but certainly the sound of this thing I think could be going into a darker place though I do give her credit for singing over more instrumentals that have a bit more of a synth we've qualified of a an old horror movie a B horror movie a slasher flick from years and years and years and years ago again not as crazy about as clarity I think it's a bit of a mess sometimes and some of the hooks are not really all that great but if you're fine with trading that off for some Halloween vibes some Halloween themed pop why not ashin and thank you for watching this latest episode of the why you know review we will

car Rae Jepsen covering no doubt and for some Spotify singles that's linked down below - alright worst tracks this week the worst tracks the worst track is the worst tracks are no tracks no tracks there were literally no tracks I heard this week that I hated you know maybe I wasn't digging hard enough you know that there was like a really weird Jesus and Mary Chain cover by David Hasselhoff but I don't give a shit I really don't care and maybe it turned out okay I have no clue but really of all the music I listened to all week and I listened to a lot of music this week I didn't hear anything I hated you know didn't really hear anything that I thought I needed to talk about that that was all that bad so yeah there's no terrible tracks this week no worse tracks this week what are you gonna do dodge the bullet maybe something y'all come here for the negativity but hey it's it's it's fine with me if if I enjoy and sort of feel somewhat neutral on most of the tracks this week or rather all the tracks this week alright first off full-length review of this track new Travis Scott on the Fantana channel highest in the room thought it was okay pretty standard by Travis Scott you know standards nothing too impressive about his flows his vocals the ending instrumentally was amazing the way it was ascending would be really cool to hear what this builds up into but I think the song could have used a switch up could he used a feature could he used a little extra something truly and honestly I mean I guess it's cool that it sounds like Travis is sticking to his typically psychedelic sound but I want to hear him innovate on that when he Romilda you know like you did on astral world I went here and build this does not sound like a a build to me but I was decent it was okay it was alright we also have sleater-kinney there back non-album track non-album single animal and yeah it's it's kind of a bit of an afterthought post they're very underwhelming new LP and truly and honestly while I'm not blown away by this track there are some parts where I think the vocals could have been better it's actually a it's actually quite better than um a lot of the material off the new LP rocks pretty hard rocks pretty hard we also have a note a new track from Remo Drive an extended version of their latest LP that I found very underwhelming they have a new track out that I guess it's going to be released along with this and this version of the LP yeah I guess again extended a few extra tracks and this song that has made it onto the extend version is a bit more gutsy er than I think a book of the material that has been on the last Remo Drive record I mean again it's it's not like anything as awesome as like their big breakout record they dropped a little while ago but but still you know it seems like a bit of an improvement hopefully they put out more music that has just this level of bite in the future I guess we also have King princess who has dropped this amazing tune over here somewhat amazing I'm a little underwhelmed by some aspects of it but I'm loving the fact that it's um just about sex from a very submissive perspective that alone makes it a pretty interesting listen hit the back is the name of this one and yeah I mean if this is I don't know if if you're the sub type you know you you you like a nice Dom daddy this this might be your jam this could be your anthem let's go your anthem we also have bandit new track from juice world also featuring a young boy never broke again on this one I think juice worlds flows his vocals the melody on this track and the instrumental are great a lot of juice world similes are bad they are not good and young boy had nowhere near as much finesse on the beat as juice world does juice world sounds smooth over fucking instrumental young boy sounds awkward I did not see the appeal of him appearing on this song frankly it kind of ruined it you know I think kneecapped the potential not considering you know how mediocre some of the writing is though we also have this new track from Gucci meagan the stallion big booty gucci mane clearly had had me in mind when he wrote this track writing a song about one of my favorite things on the planet but what I do not love is that Gucci Mane's delivery on this track is so goddamn monotone and OneNote like what the fuck you're you're writing a song and rapping about one of the most beautiful things in the world please be a little more enthusiastic Meaghan of course killed it like the instrumental thought some of the shouty refrains about big booties are really funny the track is playful its tongue-in-cheek but I think Gucci Mane could have done a bit more it kind of um I don't know yuk it up a bit more just again be a bit more enthusiastic make the track feel as fun as it's trying to be we also have this new track from gwap dad 4000 who admittedly I haven't I haven't talked about too much up until this point I'm sorry about that but still dude has this new cutout with chance the rapper it's not bad it's cool pop rap R&B blend and chances verse isn't too bad so at dig in it it's not bad we also have a toe Brian of Radiohead Fame who is making his entrance into some solo work with a new track out that is a somewhat abstract impressionistic ambient piece with some really cool sounds I mean I'm not crazy about the composition of it but still thought texturally it was pretty interesting link down below we also have three tiers Danny Brown run the jewels on production we have JPEG mafia awesome instrumental kick off first from Danny was pretty cool run the jewels pretty much standard in terms of their performance here I wish the track was a bit more all guns blazing you know but I am looking forward to reviewing this new Danny record you know I am waiting to see if this track grows on me a little bit more in the context of the album very little of this record in terms of like the teaser tracks with like really floored me but Danny is is sometimes can be more of a grower than a shower and we will see we will see we also have this new track over here from churches which isn't too bad certainly better than some more gussied up stuff they've been releasing as of late and the chromatics are making their return this week new album out not sure if I'm going to cover it in a full-length review just as of right now it's a little up in the air but I will say that I think the material I'm hearing from it so far is slightly more interesting than their last record but overall their aesthetic and very faint dreamy performance and song writing Styles is still not really my thing truly and honestly but if you like if you love somewhat dark moody dreamy pop music that's a little cinematic give it a shot give it a try this new one over here that has been turning heads is the track you were no good oh yes Buju Banton rhasta got soul new project and this song over here that I've been diggin that he really goes ham on this song like he is killing the instrumental smothering it with his vocals I'm a little torn on it I love how expressive his singing is but simultaneously I just wish there was a bit more oomph behind him to support just how animated his his singing and uh emotions are all over the track lend a hand is the name of this one it's pretty inspiring and uh beautiful straight from the heart we have been frost experimental music artist Ben frost he is back and this new song over here a lot like the a lot like the Ed O'Brien song I love what's going on texturally here it's very odd it's very left field it's very cinematic in a way but simultaneously I'm not crazy about the composition I I feel like it sounds like a bit of a mixed bag compositionally I don't think there's a whole lot of flow or a whole lot in terms of arrangements that are all that intriguing but I love the noise I love the sound you know the that's not enough in most cases to kind of keep me there forever but it's certainly stimulating while it's on I suppose the name of this new track over here is catastrophic DET delicous the questions deliquescent and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best ones this week the best tracks this week quite a few quite a few we had this new track over here so happy Channel trace is getting the recognition he deserves because there were some really cool tracks off of his new EP and he's making some very smart and somewhat fringy I guess fusions of hip hop and house it's it's cool it's cool and now he's come through with this hip House version of earthquake tyler's earthquake and that's awesome it's amazing it's fantastic sounds great good production great grooves great beat 11-11-11 shadow channel trace keep doing your thing we also have Sun over here who have been promoting a another album kinda like a record of afterthoughts from their recent life metal but from what I'm hearing so far it sounds like it's produced just as well and just as intriguing this new track over here frost sea is a bit more meditative than some of the stuff off of the last record but I am like I am liking the brighter textures on this one the brighter textures on this on this tracker are kind of what I would have wanted out of many songs off of life metal but still kicking ass sounded good more Sun is better than less Sun it's been a long time so they dropped a new full-length album so why not spoil us come on give it to me yeah poppy has come through I disagree new single music video her deal with Sumerian Records pretty much points in the direction of yeah she's gonna drop a fucking metal album and it is sounding good so far the riffs are great the choruses are super anthemic and sweet and poppy I don't know I'm just kind of loving the fusion of new metal of power metal of pop metal it's it's it's a very odd mix of sounds but it works in such a functional and anode kind of way that it doesn't come off as smart as it actually is you know it's just really direct catchy enjoyable and ultimately that's what matters the most we also have this track over here bad baby club mix negative Gemini very groovy very spacious if you love your dance music dark and a little moody little Spacey you love some Crystal Castles you'll have some vaporwave give it a try give it a shot we also have more mother an artist who I'm just learning up now through this single through this project that she has coming out via Don Giovanni records she's been at it for a while though so a very unfortunate that I'm just stumbling across her stuff now but still I'm loving her fusion of hip hop and noise and experimental music and plunder phonics it's it's really like um it's it's really a treat to hear all of these noises kind of brought together on such a visceral way and what a what a commanding fucking voice what a commanding voice some industrial elements to I would say as well afterimages is in the name of the track try it it is badass as fuck we also have lightning bolt whose new song whose skirt don't not crazy about the title but still I'm liking the sound in the direction of this new track much more than the last track this one over here is quite a bit of a change of pace for the duo where they're almost writing like a pop punk song but in their typical lightning bolt style with Brian Chippendales kind of obscured screamed the somewhat brittle vocals and the those really grimy bass riffs and the frantic drums but but it's it's quite poppy and it's quite direct but it it's a long track and heads into some very heady winding passages toward the end they're really cool so give it a try give it a shot definitely one of the more ambitious tracks the duo has come out with in a while and certainly them getting out of their comfort zone and sounding pretty pretty damn good doing it oh yes I've Kim Petrus she has a new project out her second project that's that's basically a big Halloween celebration Kim Petrus stands for Halloween and this new track over here I don't know what's wrong with me this new track over here is there will be blood and it is one of the better songs on this new record I love that Kim is embracing more like synth away vibes on this record slightly more I guess dark wave vibes but still a huge pop edge it's it's it's very very subtle for the most part the project doesn't sound as dark to my ears as I would like to and a lot of the songs on this thing do sound incredibly rushed but no doubt this one there will be blood is one of the best tracks on the entire record it's a very fun pop song it's a little creepy little ghoulish some morbid lyrics get you in the Halloween spirit give it a try give it a shot and also want to give a shout out to over here mr. Jacques green whose new song over here for love is really fantastic great piece of a very funky dance music that I'm gonna be listening to until I hear his new project drop because it is tasteful it is lovely it is super groovy loving it sexy sexy GT Greta Greta Sundberg climate activists her speech at the UN has now been covered in a death metal style so based basically her her speech just redone death metal vocals over just like some some classic Swedish death metal vibes coming out of the instrumental and it's it's actually it actually kind of kicks ass and the riffs are pretty decent and it's funny but hey listen to this thing buy it I guess it's available for streaming but also sale and proceeds go to a good cause proceeds go to a good cause so it's it's a it's a charity song it's a fun charity song so a GT GT how dare you is the name of the show next time I want to point out is the track bloom by a band named great grandpa that I'm just now finding out about what a great great piece of pop rock this is like the vocals like a really sharp they're unique the transition into the chorus is fantastic it's engaging from front to back a lot of personality looking forward to hearing more songs from this project again first taste of this loving it so far curious intrigued I want to hear more try it out it's fun I also want to give a shout out to floating points who has come through with a great piece of very melty heady cerebral dance music here loving it loving it loving it loving it floating points hell fucking yes also dosha cat bottom bitch dojaquez come through with basically a summer jam at the start of fall i I don't know what drove her to do that but but here it is it's kind of twang e there's some guitar in the background she's it maybe intentionally maybe inadvertently kind of stepping into the emo rap ring on this one I'm not gonna call an emo trap because I don't think it's emo trap but but primarily she is a singer and a rapper and she's kind of she's kind of she's kind of encroaching on that emo territory with the song and it sounded kind of good and not that it's all that sad of a song it's it's more of a more of an instrumental aesthetic and a vibe to me that is uh that's feeling that way the attitude for the most part is a very flirty very sensual very playful very tongue-in-cheek a little bubbly little breezy carefree it's got a great hook to it it's a fun song it's a fun track I'm liking it liking that dojaquez really coming into her own and doing some bold stuff that really reflects her personality last out and I thought was just okay very faint very boring not really showing her true eccentricity as an artist seems like she's really finding out ways to flash that around now and it's sounding good also Daniel Cesar cyanide remix coffee on this one shout out to her fantastic that she's made it onto this track I mean that song is obviously a hugely reggae inspired and it's amazing that she's been able to pop onto the track and add her own flare to that and it's sounding good she really enhances the song so was so awesome amazing and clipping IFO god for whatever reason I found this clipping song in the music video attached to a particularly disturbing blood on the Fang it's an amazing track dahveed kills it on this song and while the instrumental is not nearly as unorthodox as a lot of clippings classic stuff it is grimy as fuck and I am starting to like that they're going into a more direct direction with this one you know especially after the last record being like a weird that's like abstract hip-hop story piece about an intergalactic slave ship which is kind of still a mindfuck to me at that point at this point that that exists and that is a thing that we that we exist in a timeline where that is an album that is real but still I'm loving the creepy incredibly dark unsettling vibes coming off of this track and the music video really um is is again a mindfuck Wow big thief over here come through with a great piece of angular and very weird folk rock over here not sure if that is going to carry on into the rest of their new record because they're dropping two albums this year which is a pretty ambitious of them but but still big thief loving the new track forgotten eyes is the title and it's sounding really good also automatic Gucci over here err on line amazing fusion of rock and 8-bit and anthemic balladry it's sounding fantastic Anamanaguchi with these two new singles are sounding better than ever I'm hoping that the fans are really pulled together and build some hype for this thing because Anamanaguchi is sounding amazing they're sounding amazing on these new tracks they fucking bang and that has been the weekly track round up everyone thank

Jo2mZw2vNSg,hi everyone earth any hurt a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new weather day album come in this is the new semi breakout album from Swedish music project weather day and I say breakout because this record has stirred quite the commotion in the underground music community mostly within the realms of lo-fi and bedroom pop and from what I can tell the buzz is not due to some celebrity endorsement or a major label deal it seems pretty organic with many fans hailing this album as an artistic feat for DIY whatever Sputnik the mastermind of weather day is doing it's really striking a chord they're not working with an unfamiliar mix of genres though there is certainly some indie rock going into this record some noise pop some emo occasionally all of this is enhanced with some great background vocals pianos some samples or even electronics and the whole recording is as low Phi as a motherfucker if you're the kind of person who might avoid a Neutral Milk Hotel album or a microphones or a Mount Erie album because there are too many noisy lo-fi bits within it you are not going to have a fun time with this one think of taking the incredibly low fidelity of a waves album in early waves album and then trying to apply to that the instrumental ambition of an old Sufjan Stevens record and while that's not a perfect comparison it's close in some respects this album is more abrasive and harsh than a classic Scandinavian black metal album I mean those squeaking wailing lead melodies that top the choruses of the track cut lips are absolutely ear piercing not just ear piercing but ear stabbing they're most likely giving someone tinnitus right now who's listening to this thing way too loud I can't say Sputnik isn't doing a lot with a little on this record though they're certainly very creative with how they choose to operate within the very limited fidelity of sound that they work with in the performances on this thing aren't bad either sure they are pretty sloppy but still they are delivered with a lot of heart a lot of energy certainly all the chaos of this record is complemented with the explosive energy it presents case in point the song older than or easily some of the most fun throttling rock music I've heard this year between the crunchy rhythm guitars and sparkling arpeggios the distorted and sandpaper rough drums on this track to adding all of this together I think Sputnik shows more guts than most major label rock releases dropping this year and again that is despite the low fire recording that is despite all the instrumentation sounding so claustrophobic it's like it's been squeezed into a drainpipe and I'm not exactly sure what's causing that obviously it's intentional but is it because everything was recorded too loudly was it all done in post I'm not sure either way the whole thing sounds like if you were sitting comfortably in your living room on the couch but every other piece of furniture around you was on fire in that respect come in isn't too different from the early works of let's say car seat headrest and even though I think most of the similarities between weather day and car C headrest end with their low fidelity recordings I have no doubt this album is thriving because of the demand that projects like twin fantasy as well as teens of denial have created not just for rock music that's low Phi but low Phi rock music that's also thematic as well as ambitious and conceptual in some ways come in as like low Phi's answer to the rock opera as this record features 10-minute songs melodic reprises as well as tragic lyrics car seat headrest isn't the only comparison I'd like to make in this review though because I'm seeing other artistic parallels with the likes of early Conor Oberst whether that be super super super early bright eyes or commander Venus some 90s emo maybe even some more melodic cuts from the hüsker dü discography and most certainly Phil elrom everything Phil elrom I would say their points on this thing that are blatant Phil elrom worship like on the final moments of sleep while doing your best the droning basins singing on that track and certainly there are some piano passages that have that really sharp ringing pain to them that I remember so vividly from records like the glow part 2 so truthfully some of the material on this project if you are familiar with the worlds of lo-fi and indie singer-songwriter music can feel a little derivative or even kind of bland like on the track water dreamer this the first leg of which I think could have used a little something extra it's not bad but it does feel like the album is beginning to paint itself into a corner the instrumental switch in the second leg of this track drags on a little bit - then there's also the very same Ian's underwhelming first leg of the track porcelain hands the closer here I do love that the main theme melody of this record that pops up also on the intro comes back for a grand finale but the washed out vocals and guitars that have little to no flavor or rather have lost their flavor by this point on the project aren't doing any favors for this thing being the closing track however the majority of songs on this record if you can get past the lo-fi production or even enjoy and appreciate what Sputnik does with it then and only then I think you'll find come in to be pretty catchy anthemic ambitious and emotionally compelling the first two tracks on this thing are fantastic a great tone setter for the record mio mio mio that's where a lot of the album's lyrical themes and narrative become very apparent where we see our protagonists sad over the loss of a connection they had with this person that obviously meant very much to them it's too rare in life to find someone you love that can stick around after thunderclouds it's too rare in life to find someone you love to open up to sometimes and not regret you did - and the vocals on this track are incredibly incredibly distressed in a way that benefits the song also loving the crescendo of noise in the first half of this song the anthemic guitar leads that lead us there the curious instrumental shift after the halfway point and the grand chorus of singers that kind of coast the song out it's very lovely and even bigger feet is the song my Sputnik sweetheart which is a 13 minute epic kicking things off with some very raw and bittersweet guitar chords the vocals are way more buried at the start than I would have liked but once they get louder they really pop in the mix then some kind of tragic but also slightly melodramatic lyrics are revealed but also learn to eat like nothing's left who is your influence losing sense of self in place asking who I love the way the first leg of this track builds up into this swaying heart broken spiral of sadness still on the same track and very nicely into some plucky acoustics and gorgeous vocal harmonies electric guitars then bring the music to another punky rush backed with all these crashing drums then some of the most unhinged vocals on the entire record some of the harshest noise on the entire record and at this point we're only in the middle of the track there's still six minutes or so to go each one of them more thrilling than the last I also love how embarrassing painting serves as a very necessary somewhat mellow and woozy cooled down moment a palate cleanser that really shows that Sputnik is paying very close attention to how all of these tracks flow into each other as long as i mentioning highlights there's also agatha you're being dramatic which features some gorgeous forlorn choral vocals singing some very high notes over crunchy guitars more rough sandpaper drums I really appreciate the change in instrumental palette this song brings it once again reminds me of the flow of the record being so good and how cinematic it all is in a way overall I found coming to be very enjoyable while also flawed in some pretty apparent ways the influences are a bit too obvious there are points where I wish the vocals were a bit more up front or just performed a bit better and yes of course there are parts on this album where the harshness and the low fidelity I think kneecaps the enjoyability still though this is easily one of the more creative rock records I've heard this year one of the more creative lo-fi and indie records I've heard this year I can't claim to be as passionate about it as some of the biggest disciples of this project but this certainly has me looking forward to more I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana weather day come in forever

avfDv8uY3Ys,hi everyone cutie boy can hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Brittany Howard record Jamie this is a full-length commercial debut from singer-songwriter guitarist Brittany Howard and Alabama native who's primarily known as being the front woman of the Alabama Shakes this isn't her first musical for a outside of the band though she did have that Thunder bitch record drop in 2015 which was mostly met with very lukewarm reviews but from what I gather this is her first record under her own name a short and sweet project mixing together elements of psyche music blues soul hip hop and loaf I also managing to sound a lot more unorthodox and raw than she's ever sounded in Alabama Shakes brittany undergoes quite the reinvention on this project sounding like a totally different artist on some tracks whether it be on the very intimate and classic sounding vocal jazz ballad short and sweet or the fat beats and very grim spoken word about her racist surroundings growing up on the cut Goathead the production here sounds like something out of a ganja Sufi song also the opening track on this thing history repeats it's groovy its Basie its drum heavy it's a pretty seamless fusion of funk and R&B it's topped with these zany ass vocals that sound like something out of the last D'Angelo record and the production the compression is so blown out that it creates this this very just massive juggernaut sized vibe it's thick it's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal mind you this incredible amount of compression isn't on every track here and on the tracks where it is present it doesn't compliment every one of them so while Jamie is not that long of a record just 35 minutes or so Britney is sounding incredibly bold on this project really letting loose on a lot of tracks here and going on musical and Sonic excursions that I don't think she could have or would have in other contexts and even though the prospect of that is pretty exciting because Howard is incredibly talented still the downside to all of that is the flow of this record is incredibly scattered shot it is just not really sure of what it wants to be at all as an overall-experience so there's little to no consistency on this thing and there are a good chunk of the tracks here that feel like mere impressions of songs or songs that in my opinion don't really resolve like tomorrow or just and abruptly such as baby and presence I have a hard time imagining Britney's listeners who are just into her for the blues stuff for the soul stuff really getting down with tracks like the haunting minimal and distorted run to me or the song 13th century metal one of the most compressed tracks on the entire record and a song that sounds like a part psyche part noise jam that's like a cross between a Velvet Underground song and a religious sermon and look personally I love this track but I wish it was reinforced by other sounds and ideas on the project truly and honestly I think this record is at its catchiest and most consistent in the first leg where again we get that amazing track history repeats which is booming angular impeccably funky it's really out there with its blown out sound it's hypnotic strumming it's angular guitar leads it's very chunky drumming and in squishy keyboards yes they're squishy honest to god they're quite squishy we also have the song he loves me which is lovely it's endearing it also puts a bit of a bittersweet twist on your typical love song it's got these fat drums these dirty projector s guitar leads grimy base and those unapologetic lyrics talking about how Brittany's significant other loves her when she's getting drunk smoking blunts when she does what she wants I also love the track Georgia which by comparison with other cuts here is a lot softer on the ears but still those drums those bass II bits still sound like they could be heavier go harder this track sounds like watching a sumo wrestler pull off a ballet routine the massive gargantuan size is there but still all the instrumentation manages to sound curious and shy meanwhile stay high as easily the most classic and accessible track of the bunch if there is anyone seong on this record that would not sound out of place in the midst of an Alabama Shakes tracklist it is this one still though there are elements of this track that do make it stand out like Britney's vocal performance where she just absolutely kills it to the point where I'm just vocally hearing her in a very different light I mean some of the falsetto she hits on this track almost have a husky kind of manly tone to them and as much as I do enjoy the more left-field and fringe spots throughout this record mostly toward the end there is something in me that wishes there were more cuts like this in the tracklist because at least a good chunk of these experiments either don't finish off all that strongly or don't really feel like they are building toward anything on a record that that very much feels like a potpourri of solid songs but also weird exorcisms of ideas that I feel like Britney just had to get out there on some record it just happened to be this one still got to say I enjoyed this record quite a bit these songs that were well groomed and the experiments that did manage to be the boldest of the bunch certainly had me looking forward to more music from Britney in the future in a solo capacity or at least hoping that in her other projects like Alabama Shakes she manages to work in more left-field ideas such as the ones that landed on this record either way feeling a light too decent 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you could check out

hYhnMyZc-js,hi everyone Rupp toninho's tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of great albums where I go over a series of records that have dropped in the past month or so in this video two months because in the previous there weren't as many albums as I would have liked to have gone over in that one so we're gonna be spanning two months in this video but yes a lot of records that I thought were fantastic Worth's shouting out worth drawing attention to making sure they're not slipping through the cracks Sanja reviews - all of them are linked down below let's go first a shout out to the new high women album they are a singing songwriting country music quartet they formed not too long ago and even though each member has been seeing varying degrees of success in the industry been in the industry for a different amount of years basically have have different songwriting styles to their name they still effectively come together for a really great and impressive batch of tracks on this new record I am loving it from front to back pretty much a few songs were kind of duds in my opinion and it's not exactly reinventing the wheel or anything but again good Tunes thoughtful lyrics interesting song topics great performances don't have a whole lot negative to say about this record obviously it's really great it's really great it's really great give it a shot and hopefully we hear more from the high women in the future sooner rather than later next the new JPG mafia record all of my heroes are cornballs definitely want to draw some attention to that as Peggy pretty much kills it once again with another solid glitchy left-field experimental slightly edgy album this time around I think that he is hit a bit more of an accessible pitch with a lot of melodies on this one veering more toward the field of pop and R&B can definitely tell that some of that 2000s pop influence I think some of you may remember he did that Backstreet Boys cover a little while ago and there's also a TLC kind of interpolation this new one over here anyway I think that he hits a bit of a sweeter note on this record and it kind of leads to some incredible high points there's some other tracks that I thought were just okay but for the most part this is a pound for pound nearly as solid as veteran in my view so loved this one it's really good and also want to give a shout out to the new Charli XCX record Charlie Charlie has killed it on this one oh my god what a fantastic pop record it's so forward-thinking it's so sweet it's so glossy it's so oh my god just one great tune after the next amazing features amazing sounds on this one might be the pop album of the year if we don't hear anything else better than it by the time the year is out in my view and yeah just like what a bold forward-thinking move for just pop music in general yes also want to give a shout out to the boy Alex Cameron who has come through on Miami memory here with another great batch of songs I was afraid I was not going to like this one as much as forced witness and I pretty much do enjoy both equally but for different reasons the tone narrative Leon this new one is much different given that Alex is singing from a more personal place not only diving into his relationship with his significant other and the lows and maybe some highs but mostly lows around that and also diving into some other topics like being a stepfather also analyzing masculinity obviously not embracing it in a stereotypical way but more pulling it apart on songs like bad for the boys this record has swagger it has humor it has wit it has great tunes it has great structures solid performances and production Alex Cameron knocks it out of the park once again go go go go go I also want to quickly shout out the new tropical fuck storm record this art punk group has come through with a sophomore record that is just as enjoyable as their debut it is gnarly it is grim it is esoteric it is weirdly structured it is oddly shaped but also very visceral badass and creative I don't think I need to go too deeply into how much I enjoyed the new Lana Del Rey record as well Norman fucking Rockwell easily her most mature project today the consistently lavish instrumentation is beautiful the moving songs and the slightly better vocal performances this time around are really good too I don't know exactly what switch got flipped for this one but this is definitely Lana's best record to date and very excited very excited to hear her turning a new leaf artistically in a way also want to give a shout out to the new Brock Hampton album ginger loving that one as well it's really amazing that the boys were able to take a lot of the negative energy and sad energy that has been dogging them over the past year and turn it into a positive with a quality and a consistent album yes it is very mellow yes it is very sad but I love that they're able to collectively just meditate on those feelings over a good series of songs loving this and looking forward to what the next chapter from the group offers also digging on the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album infest the rat's nest the Australian garage Punk psych outfit is back but this time they are doing thrash metal and it is with a somewhat sci-fi inspired concept that is essentially about killing the rich so the performances on this thing are great the guitar riffs are fantastic they are hard-hitting they're badass as hell I think that yeah maybe there are some ideas on this thing that are pretty derivative but the vocal songwriting concept aesthetic of this record make it all stand out in the greater field of thrash metal in my view and it's a certainly one of the better records to come out in this genre in a while despite the fact that these guys are not typically a thrash metal band and I'm just really happy that the group continues to stay experimenting continues to stay adventurous and finally I'd like to shout out the new rhapsody project eve which even though i don't see this record as consistent as her last i do think she gets out of her shell a bit more gets a bit more animated and easily i think this record is one of the best executed concepts in the world of hip hop this year - with each song being interviewed - or inspired by a powerful black woman in the fields of either politics or art entertainment you can see exactly who each track is about just by looking at the tracklist much of the production on this one is great rhapsodies rhymes also continued to be some of the best in the industry and it's great to see that as her profile is growing she's not shying away from interesting or challenging topics in her music I think those are all the records I wanted to mention in this video again all the reviews for them linked down below thank you for watching transition have you given any of these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're

EicmyzgvdNY,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where i go over what i felt were the worst and best tracks of the week of the week we link all the songs that we talked about down below you can check them out there and also want to give a quick shout-out to our sponsor in this video before we get too deep into it the ridge they make these nifty metal plated sexy-ass minimalist wallets with a money clip on the back if you hit up the link down below and join the minimalist wallet revolution use promo code melon and you get 10% off that ish cool cool alright and we also have our Amazon and turntable app so see links down there to treat yourself treat yourself and worst racks of the week worst racks the we have quite a few unfortunately this is this has been a a so-so week so so week we have some great tracks toward the end though so stick around for that but still a few a few rough patches to kick off one the television series peaky blinders for years has been using caves Nick caves red right hand as their theme song and over the course of the series they've had a few artists covered the song to kind of break things up a little bit which is nice creative interesting not the first show to do such a thing but still have different artists covering the theme song and whatnot but now they've had Snoop Dogg do it and he just pretty much goofed his way through it and it's easily one of the worst cover songs I've ever heard in my entire life and it you know it just is what it is I guess it just is what it is Robin Thicke when you love somebody painfully boring pop soul with almost no soul who needs it we have REM new demo track newly released demo track which is going to be coming out with a box set for their album monster which is now I think and 25 years old at this point not one of the Bands most celebrated records but still an album I think considering the time it came out and the shift in sound a presenter for the band still a record worth looking at and going back and maybe reassessing but still this track revolution 421 again demo that has been released in in an effort to tease toward this box that is trash is repetitive as hell obviously it's a demo but the recording is not doing the song any favors and I don't really like how Michael stipes lyrics come off really um ugly dismissive patronizing there there easily some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard the dude put on to a record and maybe that's part of the reason why the song didn't make the cut don't know if Michael intended to come off as much like an a saying jackass as he does on this track maybe the song could be open to a series of different interpretations I'm open to that I am fine with that I'm not again assuming anything about the song but um I would I would like to think that maybe whatever he was trying to communicate with this track it didn't quite land or maybe completely get across and I'll just leave it at that we also had this new song from Noah Cyrus lonely which does legitimately have me concerned because the the writing does seem to come from a place of genuine isolation and depression and I hope that she has support and I hope that she's have having some help with this the song though I mean is underwhelming and boring as hell and really short and not really all that built out and there's a lot more it could be doing vocally I don't find it that interesting either but still considering the substance of the song that I am concerned I hope that she's okay I hope that she's alright we also had this awful new single from French Montana featuring post Malone and cardi B Russian writing on the wall this is basically the musical equivalent to a new fast in the Furious movie it is over budget it is under written and it is absolutely annoying and has no memorable qualities whatsoever it's just basically a lot of big names in lights with no redeeming qualities whatsoever alright and basically you could map most if not all of those criticisms over on to this new track Diplo crossing over with the Jonas Brothers for a bit of a ballad here that um if this disappeared from the planet tomorrow nothing of value would be lost in my opinion let's keep going into the tracks that I thought were kind of met not blowing me away but certainly worth pointing out pointing in your direction I have quite a few songs to get through so I might not get too deep into every single one of these tracks we have Zedd and Kalani come together with a mix of pop and R&B and some EDM aesthetics and it's actually not that bad you know I'm not usually crazy about a lot of Kalani's vocal performances but I think she really kind of laid it down on this track the beat was pretty dynamic as well they work together relatively well so check it out it's not amazing or anything but it'sit's pretty nice we also have this new track from a producer who goes my name of vegan who has worked in the past with Frank Ocean I'm sure a lot of you are recognizing the name from that and this new cut over here that is making its rounds on the internet features none other than jpeg mafia I think it trails off a little bit too much toward the end but but still there are a lot of good qualities about this song we also have a new track from black metal legends mayhem which is not too bad at all not too bad at all the name of this new cut over here is of worms and ruins goes relatively hard but is pretty standard by mayhem standards at least as far as like their most recent material vocals absolutely kill it though vocals kill it we also have John party over here country music artist singer songwriter and has this new track out titled ought to know that and while I love the roost the roots II kind of gnarly twangy instrumentation it certainly is not as gussied up as a lot of more recent country productions are I think John's lyrics do leave a lot a whole lot to be desired but still I do love the sound of the vibe of the track I'll say that much we also have her joining together with yg slide instrumentally vocally there are some parts of it that I think are kind of bland but I would not be telling the full story if I did not come through here and say that yg and her definitely are a pretty good match you know musically I think they complement each other sounds really nicely we also had this new cut over here featuring hemlock ernst none other than you know sam from from future islands who you guys know it as hemlock he dropped some rap verses here and there I guess he's got a new project coming out production from Kenny Siegel on this new track over here and the instrument is not bad I think that the rapping lyrically is maybe trying a little too hard to come off very very deep but you know nothing nothing awful about that I just think it's going a bit too overboard or maybe it's a bit too self serious in a way I guess I could you know leave it at that self series without really communicating too much in my opinion and again I'll leave it at that but it's still not bad listen still not about a track try it out and we have a Foo Fighters they've dropped a new sort of rarities random whatever's EP that's got a bunch of different offshoots on it one of which is a live cover of Dead Kennedys holiday in Cambodia it's not a bad cover it's not a bad cover it's little rough around the edges vocals are slightly goofy but you are trying to fill the shoes of one of the oddest singers and punk rock history so you know what are you gonna do but yeah it's not a bad cover it's not about cover at all we also have foals they have a new song out a new record on the way part two of the one they drop not too long ago so looking forward to that this one was a very dreary almost Radiohead ish ballad thought it was just okay and we also have a new track from flume I kind of predicted he would go back in this direction post the mixtape that he dropping it to not too long ago that I thought was really good this new track over here rushing back features vocals that are very bland very generic EDM but I guess I appreciate that the production is a little out there and that it continues to bring these maximal EDM vibes together with these very odd filled glitchy experimental almost like wonky ish characteristics I'll say that it's it's definitely more palatable than some of the other stuff out as more commercial works but still not blowing me away we also have a Kate Lebon as well as Bradford Cox of deer hunter Fame coming together for a new collaborative EP of tracks this one that has come out so far is titled secretary just because sort of tees tour the release and it's very dreary it's very sad very dramatic the pianos are incredibly strong and it's a little Nico inspired I'd say a little Nico ish most of the track we have a Lebon singing throughout the track and then we have Bradford bringing it up toward the end with a bit of a spoken word passage so give it a try give it a shot if you're a fan of either of these ARS they complement each other pretty well and we have a Broken Bells yes Broken Bells as a project is back can't Sam too excited given how underwhelmed I was by the last record but this new single over here is not all that bad nothing that's really getting me going or getting me really excited for the new project but it's not a bad thing it's not a badge it's not about track and away oh we also have I'll say over here black metal outfit which I'll say that I thought this track was less boring than some of the other recent singles that have come out from this band sapphire is the name of this new one over here I thought I thought the guitars had a bit more edge on this one you know I'll leave it at that alright best tracks best tracks the ones that really floored me the ones that really left an impression on me first Wiki of Rat King Fame he is back the new single Madlib on the production lyrics are solid flows are solid I think a lot of his word play on this one goes over well and yeah i don't know i mean i think i think Wiki solo has always had quite a bit of potential that he hasn't fully capitalized on and I'm hoping that he does that on a new project if he puts out more tracks like these like this one it's going to happen we also have tonight who came out with this new track last week but I failed to mention it serpent is the name of the new one over here and I think that there are some people who are having a hard time adjusting the track and and I get that it's probably not going to have as much widespread appeal as any number of songs off of their EP that I mean it's been like I think five or six years they dropped original material and that original tonight EP count so long ago and the the trap wave that that rode in on is like totally gone now and I don't mean trap in terms of like hip hop I mean trap in terms of like being a huge prevailing trend in EDM like obviously it's still there to a degree nothing leaves forever but it's it's not like you know the new hot thing as it once was when these two as tonight you know Lunas and Hudson Mohawke because they each respectively have their own careers when these two dropped on to the scene as tonight as a duo were effectively able to come out with one of the most unique EPS in that genre in that style one of the best EPS to in my opinion this new song over here sees them drifting away from those trap cliches a little bit and even even kind of reeling things in a bit not even dropping a banger is much because I mean while the beats on this track do go pretty hard a majority of the song in my opinion is spelt is spent building up with these really weird kooky totally out there vocal samples and in strange little sound effects I mean I don't know how this track would go over on a nightclub floor but I could say at least on headphones I think it's fun I think it's interesting I think it's intriguing I think it's a weird crossroads between experimental sample-based music and really aggressive you know electronic dance music I think got a lot of interesting qualities to it it's not as visceral as maybe some fans were expecting tonight's music to be given their past material because it does take so long to kind of build up to these very heavy shots of percussion which again do not last quite as long as some of the weird vocal passages but I think it's a really intriguing track we also have this band that I'm now just learning about via our buddies over at invisible oranges and and Brooklyn vegan as well the Nightwatch this track that is out is titled Mendoza and if you're into instrumental modern classical fusions of metal and I guess I guess progressive rock as well get this thing a shot because it is beautifully orchestrated and while I find a lot of the compositional elements to be very complex and pretty pretty impressive as well III think that the the performance is very visceral too and I love to see that balanced you know I I hate to see overly produced crap you know even if even if you did manage to compose something kind of impressive but you've cleaned the sound up and you have quantized it to the point where it just has like literally no human touch to it then you're kind of missing the narrative in my in my opinion and I feel like these guys are able to or rather this this project is able to maintain that organic beauty while also just pulling off some really impressive musical feats throughout this interesting and very lengthy track moving out on the next one we have an artist who goes by the name of Tay she she has a brand new single out featuring blood orange and itself oh my god it's amazing it's an amazing pop tune with a beautiful gorgeous vintage 80 sheen to it while t she and blood orange don't particularly stand out as the best vocalists on the block individually because their singing is very light it's very breathy that I don't think the the either of them would really stand out without all of the pillowy instrumentation surrounding their singing but-but-but-but-but together they have quite a bit of chemistry on this track they have a lot of chemistry on this track and that really sells this song this track is gorgeous it's gorgeous it's beautiful it's beautiful it's gorgeous it's gorgeous it's beautiful it's beautiful don't miss it it's fantastic it's gorgeous it's gorgeous it's beautiful it's gorgeous we also have an artist who goes of the name of Sudan archives on the Stones Throw label and this is not the first track I've heard from this project but this is the first one I think I'm talking about mostly because I was kind of waiting to see like well what is this developing into what is the sound here like with I'm not entirely sure but confessions is the name of this track I would love to point in your direction and this is a really interesting combination of some pop some R&B almost like Baroque music as well because the the string work surrounding all of it is very pretty and very intricate and very sharp in terms of its execution so it's an interesting crossroads it's an interesting crossroads it's very groovy it's very tuneful it's very sensual but simultaneously there are those like weird complex elements that just like add so much detail to it that make it feel slightly left-field but simultaneously like instrumentally muscular really liking it you know really liking what I'm hearing from this project so far and looking forward to what's coming down the pipe we have new track from Phil Algrim and Julie Duan it's been a long time since Phil dropped one of my favorite projects under the Mount Erie name and that's lost wisdom and that project was was a trio which also included Phil and also included Julie and now it seems that they have returned for lost wisdom part two where they seem to be collaborating on a series of songs the first one to drop is love without possession and it is a multi-phased very lengthy ballad that is a pretty intense in my opinion I think there are a couple spots toward the start where it felt like it took a little while to get going but once it really kind of gained momentum and Julianne Phil's vocals started to bounce off of each other a little bit it really got um I don't know again motion alia motion Aleppo t'en and quite sad and profound too and I don't know again lost wisdom originally has been one of my favorite and fill album related projects and to hear that there's a part two coming on the way is pretty exciting and Jeff Lin's yellow formerly known as just yellow electric light orchestra they have a new record on the way from out of nowhere is the name of the new track and it is loaded with top-notch production beetles esque vocal harmonies quality songwriting some good vocals - if you know anything about elo I guess you have reason to be excited okay Jeff Lindsey yellow new track out give it a shot it's really good and we also have George Clinton teaming up with Nick Hexum of 311 because apparently George the Boy George Klan of 100% electronic of Fame is a big 311 fan I mean which you know we discussed that in our interview with him on the Fantana channel all the music I used to listen to back in the day but dudes a big 311 fan and I guess it's a kind of a momentous occasion for him to be collaborating with with Nick from the band on two different tracks crash pad king for a day and the vocals on these tracks are a bit more naked a lot less obscure than they were on many songs from from slide and those vaporwave sent their synths are still there the hip hop beats are still there some of the 90s pop radio pop cliches are still there it's a really interesting mix of sounds and some quality songwriting - I think the mixes on these tracks are a bit odd but I don't know I expect nothing less from George plan just coming out of left field maybe we also have Gang Starr attract the trap last week featuring Jay Cole it's been well over a decade since Gang Starr came out with a full-length album since guru has passed away I'm imagining that they have enough material just in the vault left over where they can kind of make a new full-length album out of all of it DJ premier has been just promoting the hell out of this and saying that it's a really significant project to him and judging from the sound and quality of this new single over here it sounds like they're putting everything into it I mean the Jay Cole feature is great the beat is great the hook is really solid with its play on diamonds and memorability and significance and so on and so forth the Guru verse is solid too I don't know just looking forward to seeing how exactly this comes together when it comes to projects that you know you're talking about a posthumous you know project in a sense obviously DJ Premier still here but still posthumous in a sense and kind of going on from there and also considering that it's it's been so long since the last record though DJ Premier is not totally disappeared from the limelight he's producing all the time so you know who knows who knows how this is gonna turn out I hope good and again judging from this track over here so far so good so and we also have this new track over here from battles featuring none other than Xenia Rubino's who you guys have seen me cover on the channel before pretty sweet loops and beats on this one and I love the vocal performance on here certainly the most stunning vocal performance of any of the tracks released so far so I'll leave it at that the name of this one a loop so nice they played it twice and everyone that has been the weekly track

CZXJizIr3xE,ah hi everyone in the nation here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new blink-182 album 9 yes this is the latest full-length LP from big-league California pop punk band blink-182 it's their ninth album hence the title it has now been three years since the group dropped their terrible 2016 album California for years since the band saw a major lineup change with co-songwriter Tom DeLonge leaving the group being replaced by the alkaline trios Matt Skiba and it's now been eight years since the band made the comeback that maybe they shouldn't have with neighborhoods in 2011 and now we have 9 which is is not good it's not a good record it's not very good at all I mean you know it I know it I don't need to lie to you about this it was pretty much common knowledge going into this record that it was not going to live up to blinks best I feel like all I can do at this point is just sit back and watch the variety of ways that blink and just shit on their legacy right now that that's essentially how listening to 9 feels granted there are a few decently written Tunes and choruses on here that are sweet mildly catchy also it's admirable that Marc and Travis do better by Matt on this record by giving him more mic time giving him more songwriting spotlight at least allowing him the space to try to fill Tom's shoes as a songwriter but beyond that I don't really have anything positive to say about this album the production is god-awful it is way too glossy it is way too clean sometimes it's so compressed it's it's crushing its head crushing its depressive just blown out to the point where it's irredeemable and the vocals are so touched up they had the strange chorus tour overdubbed quality about them that just makes them sound alien or inhuman especially on many of Marc's verses I mean listen to the opening vocals on the track happy days this does not sound like Mark Hoppus as much as it sounds like a badly programmed Mark Hoppus AI just singing a lesser version of a song that he would stereotypically sing as some of the twang of guitars and the marching snares on there sounds like a classic blink song but much much less gratifying I'd also like to believe my AI theory also carries over into the songwriting aspects of the record because I can't imagine a person writing down I want to feel happy days happy days happy days happy days walls of isolation inside my pain and just say yep that's it the lyrics get weird as mark describes himself on the opening of the song heaven committing arson I guess then there's the song dark side which is sung by Skiba and sounds like it's about not being able to get a goth girlfriend she doesn't know you exist she doesn't seem to have any interest in you but you follow her to the dark side anyway in an unconsenting fashion I might add I don't know Matt maybe you should have saved this one for the next Alkaline Trio record because I don't know if creeping on goth girls is really like in the blink narrative not that this album isn't loaded with cringy breakup songs that make you worry about everyone involved being in an incredibly unhealthy state of Arrested Development the song I really wish I hated you certainly puts Rivers Cuomo suppose at Peter Pan syndrome in perspective it's a track that makes just about every 90s songwriter who refuses to just branch out into a more mature songwriting style look like a fucking adult mark and company also blame it on their youth on the track blame it on my youth which is loaded with all of these skittering drum edits and bright shouty choruses for the younger Millennials and Zoomers out there I guess plus a boomy drumbeat and keyboard line that sounds like the kickoff to a Matt and Kim song the song runaway features both mark and Matt doing some very dramatic raps singing over a tight drum loop and some very sad keyboard passages it's like what Linkin Park must sound like two people who hate Linkin Park and the transition into this pop punk chorus is so freaking loud and blown out it may cause irreparable damage to your eardrums the song Black Rain is another weird stylistic transition it features all of these pretty aggressive drum beats very fast soaring vocals staccato riffs that read like something out of a gym song maybe even it's a little Baroness inspired I suppose it's interesting to hear them try what they're doing here but I don't think it came out particularly good the song Mitzi's mark putting on that really whiny emo affectation on his voice and writing lyrically from a very dramatic place it's not the worst song here but it is just generic emo pablum at least blink isn't trying to hide it I mean after all they do have a song a few tracks later just titled on some emo shit which is boring yes but come on you're gonna make me wait to listen to this terribly titled song all the way at the end of your record and when I finally get to it you're not even going to give me the satisfaction of hearing you sing on some emo shit in the chorus it certainly would have been a better excuse for a hook than what you have on this track currently it's better than hungover you though which I guess is an attempt at some clever wordplay as I'm hungover because I'm drunk but I'm also hungover you emotionally so there's all these references to essentially being stuck on this relationship stuck on this person but also just waking up just hungover it's also got a weird ass beat that sounds like the band is trying to work some foreign flavor into the mix but it's gentrified to the point where I can't tell what it is are you trying to do a dancehall thing a Latin thing one time two times and what is this awful vocal melody I was all wasted I couldn't see you didn't seem like a choice now you could never leave you who is going to come away from the song humming that it's just darting in every direction and utterly failing at creating a likeable melody the closing track ingeniously is titled remember to forget me if I'm lucky if I'm lucky this is terrible there are only a few passages on a few songs that I thought were okay no wonder pop punk is in dire straits these days and I don't mean to shit on the new generation but when people who have been big influencers in the genre are doing this I'm sure it's tough to see a way forward the terrible vocal processing the sucky songwriting all the sequence drums the blaring over compressed choruses the lyrics the lyrics the lyrics I just cannot stand a great deal of what this album brings forward frankly I'm feeling light too on this transition have you given this album did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I earn you next

j7-mXvXB4uc,oh yeah hi everyone Yatta Yatta the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Vivian girls album memory rock trio Vivian girls they're back five years after they're announced break up in 2014 new album once a humble band from New York the Viv's became an overnight sensation on the indie blogosphere after dropping their self-titled record in 2008 also gaining some pretty high praise from established outfits such as pitchfork and AV Club though I think the trio sound was more ahead of the curve than some people may have realized back in 2008 helping to set the table for some pretty major trends in the indie scene for the next five to six years meaning they were there doing their thing before loaf I became a sensation with waves breaking onto the scene meaning they were there before surf rock guitars suddenly became a huge trend thanks to groups such as Beach fossils and the drums and if Vivian girls never existed I fail to see how you get all this very popular dreamy rough indie rock music with a really strong feminine voice whether it be best coast or dum-dum girls or Frankie rose who played with Vivian girls and you could even fast forward to hear the band's influence on newer groups whether it be conscious or not such as Heinz now this is not to say that the Vivian girls happen in a vacuum that they didn't have their contemporaries that they didn't have their influences they most certainly did artists like Jay retard and Black Lips were already killing it at about the time that they burst onto the scene and the roots of low fight indie music go all the way back to the 1980s but Vivian girls base of inspiration spread out much further than that into surf rock and toot we into noise pop into sixties girl groups and classic punk as I remember it they were one of the few bands around this time trying to genuinely make the sounds of the Ramones the Ronettes the ventures and the Jesus and Mary Chain all coexist on the same recording now sadly following this album up the trio hit a bit of a sophomore slump with very so-so record the music scene was flooded with similar sounding bands many of which had a larger commercial appeal and by the time they dropped their third full-length album the band to clean their sound up so much I think they started to lose their original appeal even if it did feature standout singles like heard you say which is easily one of the best tunes the Vivian girls have ever put out the band took a few years past this point to call it quits but now they're back and it's a very odd time for a return I mean the way that the trio helped initiate is pretty much gone now and if it doesn't have a trap beat behind it the mainstream is pretty much deaf to it as well as a good portion of the underground the girls don't sound like they're vying for wide appeal on this one though it's more like they are going back to their very noisy and chaotic roots it's 2008 all over again with the trio bringing that smudgy blaring distorted sound they were once known for but somehow on certain tracks here it is heavier more distorted maybe a bit thicker especially on tracks like most of all and sludge easily the most brooding song the trio has ever put out the guitars on this one are very fuzzy certainly live up to the title of sludge most of this album though does sound like you're hearing the classic make up of Vivian girls record all those noisy ringing almost droning guitars just roaring and roaring it sounds like what you would get if you tried to make a Sun record but with more of a surf rock guitar tone and that sound that wall of sound is basically a canvas for the trio to Laysan all of these wintery chilly strange vocal harmonies that are very breathy very soft the drums especially the snare just pierced through all that noise and in the bass in the background very quietly provides a groove occasionally the trio reels it in a little bit like on the track you're kind of life where these demented warp guitars scream away in the background underneath some very clunky bass then there's these strange metallic chime e tones that dance on top of all of this the sound is pretty twisted the song itself is sour as hell but it offers more clarity sonically than most of the tracks here also comparing this record to the group's earlier work while it is noisy the instrumentation the performances the way everything syncs up it seems a lot more methodically assembled the singing isn't especially good in a traditional sense though and can definitely hold a track back if they are spotlit and not really selling the song all that well namely on the track lonely girl but for the most part there are quite a few strong highlights in the first leg of this thing that seemed to build on the usual Vivian girls blueprint like on the opening track most of all as well as the song something to do which has some of the best momentum and chord changes on the entire thing but for every track like this that stands out there's another that seems to house pretty much the same sound the same aesthetic but the tune at the core of it is just not really all that good like add it again or even the title track on this thing which might even be the most half-baked moment on this entire record and the song all your promises is where and I can't believe I'm saying this because this is not usually a focal point of Vivian girls music but the drums are particularly lackluster here the drumming is not usually like the best thing about a Vivian girls track but it is so tedious and sparse on this one it's really just kind of the snare providing most of the backbone when the percussion could have been doing so much more as this track has one of the most gargantuan walls of guitar and waves of any song here and it just really could have used a bit more support a couple of risks sludge that I mentioned earlier super heavy super noisy also the song I'm far away whose dark groovy bass lines and drums and screaming washes of guitar sounds like the soundtrack to a goth doubt beach party I have my criticisms of this record sure but I didn't find any one track to be outright terrible I just thought there were some tracks quite a few that were underwhelming quite a bit of this record I think sounds very say me to those who might not be all that into Vivian girls incredibly noisy and increasingly abrasive sound on this one I think this is a definitely one of the gutsier records in terms of harshness they've put out so far and even though I do like that quality in Vivian girls music I do have to admit it does suffocate quite a few of the songs here but I mostly feel like this album is a pretty decent comeback for the band hopefully they continue to change things up and right sharper songs and bring the noise I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another

XVVtKcvQ5vM,hi everyone lick that he fast tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new collaborative album featuring igloo Ghost Kai Whiston and baby XYZ so this is a new collaborative record from an interesting trio of characters igloo ghosts who in my opinion is one of the most enigmatic producers of this generation pushing wonky and pushing UK bass and pushing bubblegum bass and pushing a host of other things too jittery new heights with a very mystical and otherworldly flair check out his album neo wax bloom if you haven't already also had two very solid EPS drop last year that I liked quite a bit there is also banger wizard Kai Whiston who also had a pretty nice record drop last year he is on igloo ghosts glue label and then there's baby vocalist songwriter producer whose solo work admittedly I wasn't all that deep into before this mini album of 9 tracks in 28 minutes so yes while there were a few exciting teasers going into this project I was already excited to listen to it given the names involved also to hear how each one of them might maybe break new ground or just do something new and refreshing as a result of just working with another person on a full-length record but aesthetically the sound of this project it's not too far off from what you may have already heard on igloo ghosts two recent EPS both of which make for very beautiful expansive busy almost disorienting electronic music that just sounds like it's from the future from another planet from another dimension in fact there's a whole narrative even lore behind igloo ghost music that deals in pretty much those things whether or not this album adds to that ongoing story though I'm not entirely sure I'm assuming maybe no but again aesthetically I think a lot of the tracks on this record resemble that of the dizzying and mind-expanding compositions that landed on ghosts last couple of EPS but with some subtle changes and additions the bass and the beats certainly go a bit harder I think having a dedicated vocalist collaborating throughout the entire project certainly brings a refreshing dynamic so this thing mostly seems like a very subtle fusion of each artists strengths going into this record and maybe I could see some disappointment coming out of this album from some listeners if you miss how each artists typically sounds and you don't like the compromises each of them make in order to create these tracks or maybe you're not thinking that this project is substantive enough as it is pretty short and I will admit there are some tracks on here where it seems like each artists efforts they cancel each other out a bit and the results just lead to a very so-so song whether it be on drown you where the vocals get really really really tedious I don't care that much for the thin tone I think they get really repetitive I mostly feel the same way about the tracks see-through as well and the track Lux to read to me as if you took a song from ghosts clear teme EP and then through a bunch of tonight style banger beats in the background and vocal chops we do get some truly unique and memorable moments later into the tracklist though we have the Songhua key which was a great teaser track to this thing it sounds like a buzzing raging explosive Whiston style banger but with some of the edges smooth and rounded out with eagle ghosts beautiful mystical synth passages past this point we have some subtle vocal embellishments from baby we have some buzzing fluttering bass notes I like the song mouth shit but it is a little disorienting at first and and I think it's still a bit disorienting now even though I'm kind of used to it because there is a particular sound in the track that sounds like crying toddler is being sampled and if you've ever heard like a kid crying before it may just like get you to look around is there is there a child and look if that is not the source of this sound whatever it is it sounds like something crying and it's it's a again very distracting and takes me out of the track even though I think a lot of the progressions and grooves on this one are pretty cool I found babies singing on teeth tizzle to be surprisingly beautiful easily her best performance on the entire record I loved her weird lyrics and I love the gentler musical passages that her voice was housed in and how that contrasted really nicely with these more aggressive beats and other sections I just wish it were longer I thought the flat beat and very zany somewhat obnoxious samples flying in every direction on barely twins all of that was a bit excessive even though I do generally think the song is pretty fun and the track lamb was an incredibly strong teaser turned incredibly strong closer easily the most robust track of the entire record multifaceted awesome flow I also loved the kick off where baby's very cute monotone wrapped vocal set a very interesting tone for the track however we do reach a second half of the song where we start getting into some very jittery passages that don't sound too much unlike what a cool ghost was doing on his neo wax bloom record but if that similarity doesn't bother you then you should get through this with a smile on your face this project doesn't break new ground for anybody involved I wouldn't say but I think everyone here complements each other really well on a vast majority of the tracks here there wasn't really anything on this record that I thought was terrible just a handful of tracks that I just wanted more from still those moments didn't take away from the cuts here that actually were pretty fantastic all of which make me look forward to seeing these three crossover more into the future hopefully on another full-length project that is a bit longer a bit more ambitious maybe even a bit riskier I'm feeling a light seven on this one transition have you given this record listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video

zcn-Kp_OWfI,hi everyone fly the kite Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new ameer van EP emmanuel this is a new EP from rapper and texas native amir van once a member of the boy band phenomenon known as Brockhampton amir was ousted from the group last year after some abuse allegations were levelled at him van released a pretty unsatisfactory apology and Brock Hampton released a pretty nondescript explanation of the situation in his departure Brock Hampton member donik Lennon later on social media revealed that Amir may have had something to do with a friend of his being jumped something that he goes into lyrical detail about on a song from the group's last full-length album ginger the track dearly departed this whole thing is a great big mess that led to a huge fracture within the group I would say almost ended them certainly it ended the creative streak the group had going up until that point and despite a bit of bounce back on their last full length album ginger which i think is their most cohesive full-length record yet Brock Hampton still has a very vocal portion of their fanbase that seems angry about Aamir leaving and maybe with a mirror now being back putting out his own stuff those people will now have a sense of closure they'll have the ability to listen to his music and get that fill that they desire from that and even though the demand for a mere to be back in music has been loud and has been very present and constant ever since his departure from Brock Hampton maybe his comeback was inevitable maybe it was only a matter of time not sure if the plan was ever for him to disappear from music completely given that when he reappears he has a billboard as well as production from Hit Boy and cool and Dre with some pretty spendy and cleared samples this thing is not just some random indie hip hop project from a guy who's been abandoned by and blackballed in the industry because apparently the distributor for Amir's Winston wolf label that this EP is on is the orchard and even though I don't begrudge Amir his right and ability to come out with his own music and tell things from his own point of view this whole situation just feels like the industry trying to make a profit off of both sides of this very dramatic situation now on this very short EP which is like 15 minutes long a mere does kick up some dust about everything that has transpired over the past year but lyrically and narrative Lee I would say even musically he doesn't give us a whole lot to chew over throughout this thing Aamir comes off as very petty very bitter without even a lick of regret on anything that he may have responsibility for and not to say that Aamir should be automatically understood as guilty of anything he's accused of but he doesn't really take the time on this EP to make the case for himself or prove otherwise instead he's dropping bars on this thing about losing friends and finding it hard to say sorry but I guess with whatever he's saying he's doing it in his usual Amir flow I guess you could say Amir does take some responsibility in acknowledging that his hard upbringing makes it difficult for him to fly right and make the best decisions I get that we're all products of our environment but Amir is clearly self-aware enough to put himself in the right direction if he wanted to he doesn't need to accept his bad behavior as fate or you suicide as an answer to the problems he creates as far as drama on this EP goes the song Los Angeles is even juicier making claims that Brock Hampton are greedily profiting off of his name by mentioning the situation that came about in their songs as if acknowledging this thing that shocked the group shocked their fans and still dodge them to this day is some sort of moral injustice I mean the wrapping on this track is impassioned Amir clearly feels this way legitimately and it features one of the best beats on the entire EP but what a pity party why would I want to sit here and be voluntarily gas-lit finally on the song Sunday night there's another handful of bars that are very clearly connected to this situation I do shit that they wish they could people supposed to stick up for their family but we see they don't I got all that gutter and that meaning that they feigning for so again Amir is not being stuck up for or protected he has a special something that nobody else in the group has and that they need this is essentially the narrative that his most hardcore fans that are angry he's out of the group now have been spinning over the past year if I wanted to be told this I would just go to the Brock Hampton subreddit and also does this EP have that gutter that we are feigning for I mean as far as the lyrics go and the music there is some gun talk some drug talk some traumatic experiences brought up that have obviously shaped a mirror to be who he is today but this thing is far from the nastiest EP of hardcore hip-hop I've heard a mirror is still a unique voice though with a style that sticks out even when he's not at his best lyrically I'm sure that'll be enough to draw some fans in but there is an over lack of attention paid to the choruses on this thing many of which are incredibly subpar or just not there and the instrumentals leave a lot to be desired - not that I expected a mere to hop on all these bouncy Brockhampton esque bangers but one beat after another is just bland trap instrumentals the outro tract does absolutely nothing no point to it even being on this thing and pop trunk is maybe the most painfully generic track on the entire record not to mention just again the chorus not that good I think the one true standout on the entire project lyrically instrumentally musically has to be the song Glock 19 I love the eerie chime e synths in the background I love that Ahmir changes his flow up a bit on this one the rumbling bass the haunting little vocal samples laced into the instrumental our operatic intense delivery from Amir on this track killer chorus I think Amir is a talented artist no doubt in a track like this proves that but if he's going to push forward and be successful he's gonna need to get over himself in the situation and just put up more tracks like this and even if Amir does that I still worry because in the best-case scenario I feel like he's going to hit a point where he still is a bit one-dimensional because his style has sound the topics he usually approaches don't tend to be that varied maybe we will see an evolution from him in the future where he is changing things up and he is taking risks and he is getting outside of his comfort zone I welcome that I guess we'll see that change when he makes his next move on maybe a longer more robust project I'm feeling a light too decent for on this one transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

best you're the best let's get into the worst tracks of the week not too many worst tracks the week a good handful the new Tegan and Sara don't believe the things they tell you they lie is just like a really cheap piece of acoustic pop rock that is a really obnoxious just very sad the Tegan and Sara not really artistically in the state that they they used to be I'm also sad that that is the case for m83 who can't seem to stop dropping teaser tracks that pretty much sound like bad progressive synth sci-fi soundtrack music the music video for this latest one which is not exactly safe for work or anything also confirmed also confirms that as it just looks like a bad art film not really getting at all what the point of this new record is outside of just like pairing each teaser track with like a bat a section of a bad movie I can't say I'm caring for it so far and we also have this this new track from little mozi whoo you guys might remember had a very mediocre performance during the whole double XL freshmen everything and this new track featuring him and gonna is not surprising in the fact that it's horrendous given that it's a very generic trap beat gonna completely underwhelmed little mozi completely underwhelmed neither artist is really all that impressive this is really bad trap auto crooning with no compelling or interesting features or aspects whatsoever so whatever let's get to the track so I thought were kind of met not blowing me away but still worth mentioning we have one from soccer mommy which is a musical project I haven't really been crazy about up until this point but this new song Lucy is a pretty solid piece of alternative rock good guitars good drumming good hook fine energy vocals and tune could have stood out a little bit more in my opinion but still a solid piece of alt rock give it a try give it a shot also digging on the new Phineas single a little bit it's kind of short I wish there was more to it but the production is a little eclectic the tune that he sings throughout the track is cute and it's essentially a song about not missing anyone anymore I don't miss you at all is the title of it so it's it's it's about what the title obviously makes it out to be about and I don't know I there are aspects of it that I like more than Phineas's last single and neat I mentioned that Phineas is in fact Billy Eilish his brother producer and songwriter Billy Eilish his brother so I there are aspects of this again that I like more than his last major single that was attached to a music video so I don't know I mean the guy's obviously super creative and a great producer given the input that he had on Billy's record and how good that came out in my opinion so you know I think it's maybe only a matter of time before he finds his own solo artistic voice and we also have this new track over here from Alicia Keys featuring Miguel which I think could have been a bit more fiery but I do like the simple guitar licks the sensual GRU the very sexy atmosphere and despite how low-key this track is Alicia Keys and a Miguel on here show me love is the title of this cut quite a bit of chemistry quite a bit of chemistry I'll say that some really good chemistry on the song alright let's get into the tracks that we're really leaving a positive impression on me really blowing me away or just making me love him hold on I had to make a note for myself over here alright let's go let's go let's go first off we have Wilco new Wilco record on the way this is the first bit of music that I'm hearing from it that was really kind of blown me away this song over here is titled everyone hides and it's a bit of an acoustic rocker with some great Drive an attitude it's kind of fun Jeff Tweedy really kind of bring in a the personality back on this one it's a very engaging exciting little tune we also have this track over here that I'm digging quite a bit from none other than Teebs of brain feeder records Fame who has this new single out titled study featuring none other than than panda bear and yeah I mean I do love it I love the production on it I love the energy of the track I think that the vocals on the cut are fantastic as well but given that it is Teebs like not every song on the record is going to sound like this you know panda bears not on every so while I do think this is good and is exciting and the production is very creative and it's thick and it's colorful and it's kaleidoscopic and you know it's got those classy wonky flavors but he makes those very necessary alterations that one I think would need to in order to complement pandabear and his style it's it's a really great track it's a fantastic crossover and collaboration goes over way better than I originally thought it would have when I went out to go try it but um I don't know what to to think going from here because it's it's been a while since the team's project really kind of like left an impression on me but you know I guess we'll see looking out looking out we also have this track from keybord kid who many people should know for his many production connections to none other than the legendary basedgod little bee he has a new little project mixtape out it's incredibly short some of the tracks on there don't really leave much of an impression but this one there's one particular track that hit pretty hard in my opinion ashy to classy featuring big baby scumbag is a banger alert it's a banger alert don't miss out on this one it's zany the bars are funny the beat goes hard as fuck hell yeah tacky board kid hell he had a keyboard kit we also have free nationals who you should know is basically Anderson PACs backing band they have a new single out featuring jid and some other artists as well it's groovy it's sexy its social its soulful its its sensual and the jid feature is fantastic we also have DJ shadow who surprisingly like blew me away with this new track over here I guess he's probably got something on the way very soon this new track Rosie oh my god the vocal samples on this one the way he chops it up and the B this is one of the most insane tracks Shadow has put out in a long long long long time long time long time this was fantastic this was fan-fucking-tastic I'm not sure what else to say about it other than that you know it's it's classic it's zany it's colorful it's it's not as abstract or moody as a lot of shadows classic stuff which i think is fine it's very upbeat I mean if you're heavy into I'll say the avalanches you will love this track not to say that he's ripping them off or that it's exactly like the avalanches I'm not saying that but if you like a lot of very upbeat sample-based music with some great groove to it you're gonna love this you're gonna love it we also have this new track from dive Zachary Cole Smith and the gang had been building up to this new full-length album deceiver and Damned at first I was not all that into this track because it seemed like very apparent to me that it was a bit of a krautrock ripoff and not doing anything too original but the longer it went on and the more I got a feel for the groove and the more embellishments and production tricks the band started to employ into this very lengthy kind of jammy track the more I was impressed like the energy is great the grooves are great the the direction and progression of it of it all is really good too I don't know what to say I guess this is the most I've been impressed with a dive stuff in a while and noting that they had not that they haven't had some good tracks here and there like on their past stuff but this has actually got me kind of kind of hyped for the new record you know could actually end up being a record that that I really do end up enjoying and it's it's always saddened me that I don't enjoy dive as much as some people do so fucking with this track heavy heavy Danny Brown also has a new track out best life loving this one certainly liking it more than last one the super soulful bright sunny instrumental on this track is great Danny's lyrics basically detailing this grimy lifestyle used to lead at one point in essentially celebrating his transition to a new and better way of living and you know essentially kind of bringing it to a point the matically and philosophically where you know you've only got that one life so just bit live your best life essentially is is what the message of this track is it's great I'm loving and the flow is improved on this track to the flow is a head bobber that yell pee type type of inflection and delivery is back in full force and liking it Lebanon fantastic and intro to baby the baby's back the new track you know the baby's latest record I wasn't really super crazy about I think he's a very good rapper but a lot of the beats are pretty one-dimensional not a whole lot in terms of like focused song topics or anything like that when I heared a baby I'm mostly impressed by what he's doing in terms of like you know feature or something like that I see him as like a feature rapper but this song over here intro certainly like started changing my mind on that a little bit it's like shit he is like focusing so hard on everything that he's saying it's all lining up narrative Lee it's so personal it's so compelling and it's it's great you know it's it's structured really like a story and I didn't know that was you know something that even cared to try to do so um at least as well as he's doing it here over a very fantastic colorful and almost cinematic instrumental to so you know great great beat choice on this track to to sort of tell this story and spit this spit these verses so I'm really great track from the baby I'm fucking with it heavy and also lovin as well this new Caroline polar track track she is just dropping great single after great single from this new album it may be one of the better pop records of the year when it drops it's a turning out pretty good you know fuckin with what the Caroline is doing really heavy it's it's bold its melodic it's catchy its artsy its creative loving it and Brittany Howard this track Georgia from her newest LP I'm not gonna talk too much about it because I am semi planning on covering this record this week so again don't want to talk about it too much because you will get my thoughts very soon eventually and I want to give a shout out also to Boards of Canada who this track XYZ which has been in the rounds for a while now it's like it's been around because this is from appeal session years and years and years ago decades ago with this and apparently this track is being included along with many others and a new warp records compilation of session recordings radio recordings that sort of thing it's a very spendi spending collection of tracks if they're gonna put out in a vinyl box set but this one's fantastic it's really good I haven't heard it before personally so um you know give it a listen give this anyway this this rendition this performance listen give it a try if you're a huge work records fan or a huge fan of a lot of the artists that are being featured on the Kop look it up maybe you'll want to blow over a hundred bucks on the vinyl box and who knows and that has been the weekly track roundup everybody has been the weekly track roundup you are the best best best again remember all the tracks that I've talked

RZyr_nc936Q,Hey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Alex G record House of sugar Alex G is a multi-instrumentalist a producer a loaf eye wizard he is an artist that made it pretty big on the band camp platform until transitioning off of it at the midpoint of the decade with eight Domino Records contract and his profile would grow even bigger a year or so later when named as a collaborator with Frank Ocean on numerous tracks from endless and blonde Alex has a legit reputation as a musical brain and a production talent but I'm yet to be really floored by one of his records all the way through or impressed beyond some of the creative production choices he typically makes in his songs because when it comes to the singing and the songwriting end of things in Alex G's music I am left wanting so much more these were mostly my feelings on his last record in 2017 rocket pretty much a breakthrough record for Alex that even though I was underwhelmed by it I was looking forward to the future hoping to enjoy his next release more not only because I thought a few of the teasers from this new record were good but hey Alex G could also come into his own as an artist in the same way that will Toledo did as he transitioned on to Matador Records and quickly became after a so-so album one of the labels MVPs so as much as I went into this new album with high hopes and just fingers crossed it feels like rocket all over again and not to say that Alex G made the same record twice he didn't I just walked away with a lot of the same complaints and issues and remember this is relative at the end of the day because there are people who are living and dying by the Alex G discography and loved rocket and you know I heard it that those who enjoyed that record are going to love this too maybe even love it more I mean sure by comparison the production generally on house of sugar is a lot less low five I'd say the way Alex mixes and arranges instrumentation on some of the tracks here has actually kind of Orthodox whether it be on the song hope or the track southern sky tracks don't sound too far outside of the purview of Indy balladeers of the 90s and 2000's there's a very apparent Elliott Smith influence on a few key tracks here - I have to admit though Alyx comes up with some amazing gorgeous haunting layers of instrumentation surrounding the acoustics on the track Gretl probably the best tune and instrumental assembly on this whole project the listless vocals and the grunge ish guitar chord progressions as well as the melting descending tones it leaves me feeling like I'm just floating down a river of depression in a relaxed state under a starry sky I'm similarly enchanted by some of the droney hypnotic layers on the track walk away a meditative track that is somehow sparkling but also a little low fine smudgy easily one of the most psychedelic transmissions to come out of the Alex G discography but it's a really odd way to kick off the album it's one of the lengthier tracks on the record a record of songs that generally are somewhat short and not that built out and as far as the song goes there's not really a strong song at the core of this thing and that's the thing while I like the sound and a lot of the instrumental palettes of house of sugar a lot probably even more than rocket the singing and the songwriting hasn't gotten that much better there are some pretty robust and well assembled tunes in the first leg of this thing but after that consistency and structure kind of goes out the window Alex starts bringing these tracks that more or less feel like motifs or vague instrumental ideas as opposed to a complete song it's one short transitional moment after another and yet none of them are really transitioning into anything or reinforcing each other either the song taking sounds like a pretty good instrumental bridge to a fuller song but it's it's not much else it's like we're just not allowed to hear the rest of the track I mean the brightly melodies shimmer beautifully and I love the taking taking hypnotic refrains toward the back end of the track - but again I wish it ended or started somewhere else different the song near is downright the most annoying song on the entire record with it's murky and gargling rhythms and bass the very busy repetitive somewhat jittery vocal parts and harmonies and as well as the guitar passages that seem like they don't really care about where they fit into the track it's like they're just kind of making a mess in the midst of an instrumental that already has too much going on project to essentially sounds like Alex trying his hand at some vaporwave since at the very least a far side virtual ripoff and it's not very compelling then we have another stylistic change right after this with the song bad man which is pretty country influenced sounds like what you would get if you fused a country song with some very busy rhythmic angular indie tronic ax it's tough to put my finger on because it's easily one of the most varied strange and seamless genre fusions on the entire project the instrumental breakdown in the middle is pretty cool and even though this thing is one of the shortest songs on the entire record it feels longer than 1 minute and 50 seconds maybe because the tune coming out of the vocals is so catchy and you have these various very well defined parts that make you feel like you're progressing through something that's pretty well put together also loving how morbid and serene the lyrics are toward the end about a bomb dropping and laying in the grass of the tangerine sky the track sugar though is another head scratcher in the tracklist the vocals are fed through this really weird robotic filter to the point where you can't really tell what they're saying they're squeaky a little warbly honest-to-god it sounds like an animal crossing character it sounds like a freaking animal crossing character but at a lower pitch and sung in a way in a repetitious way where it's it's almost like they're performing a chant I really have no idea it's it's one of the more difficult to interpret and digest ideas on the entire record however the instrumentation happening underneath this is actually some of the grandest on the entire project very regal gorgeous thick the string sections on this song are fantastic yes we're essentially listening to this baroque ish r raakhee type of instrumental that's pretty powerful immense it is a stunningly beautiful out-of-this-world oasis kicking off the last third of record and it links to literally nothing else on the album sounds like nothing else on the album alone it's great but it doesn't really do anything for the flow of the record this tracklist much like that on Alex G's other projects is like a crapshoot of semi-finished songs and offshoot ideas the final moments of this thing are spent delivering one very low key so so bland song after another though there are some ideas within each that do stand out like the slow drone II enveloping guitars on in my arms I love the fuzzy syrupy rough aesthetic of this track but again the songwriting the vocals do literally nothing for me the song cow with its twangy lead guitars sees some of those country vibes coming back over a tune that is semi sweet the vocal harmonies and court progressions on the track crime remind me of what you may get if you took of Montreal and had them write some country tunes which I guess they've they've had some tracks in the past that feel little influenced by that here and there though I think Alex's approach is significantly sadder and a bit more despondent also the vocals have way less personality than anything Kevin Barnes has sung over the course of his career the closing track oddly enough is marked as a live cut and is pretty Pleasant pretty sweet features some groovy bass and sassy keys and saxophone seems like something maybe some Jimmy Buffett fans could get down to over although I can really take or leave this record I am very indifferent toward it though I am impressed that despite the lack of a macro vision for this project Alex still does manage to come up with some great ideas on a micro-level passionate fans who loved Alex's music the way that it is the way that it's been on projects like rocket you're probably going to love this and I guess that's exactly why I continue to not be so won over I'll just have to sit this one out I guess you know feeling at decent 5 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Alex G forever

nA-_v2cJges,ah hi everyone char the Neely's tan oh you're the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Charli XCX record Charlie this is the latest full-length LP from British pop futurist Charli XCX who's been putting out music for well over a decade at this point but for me personally it's felt like she's only come into her own artistically over the past several years forging a path for herself in the pop field that a lot of her contemporaries are now only catching up to it's crazy for me to think now that I really used to dislike a lot of Charlie's older music and I guess I still do she's made this incredible transition from one of the least interesting personas in pop to one of those who are most willing to push the envelope now you could attribute a lot of this to her embrace of the bubble gum bass and post pop absurdity of producers working with the pc music label which is by no means a mark against Charlie's artistic vision or originality because while many artists embrace the PC trend for the minute that it was hot charlie is one of the few voices out there who have consistently grown their brand off of the productions of Ag Cooke and guru and easy fun for year after year after year now this latest step in Charlie's studio album evolution feels like for me personally it's been taking forever it has been five years since the release of her last length LP sucker which in comparison to this sounds completely different worlds apart since then Charlie has been honing her new direction with some smaller releases with some mixtapes the very fantastic vrooom vrooom EP pop to number one angel and i love a lot of tracks off these projects I like the direction of these projects but I still got the feeling they were a little rough around the edges not the complete package Charlie wasn't gonna come out with a record until she had perfected got right exactly what it is she's trying to do and also not without getting some big names to come onboard as well because over the past several years Charlie has embraced collaborations in such a big way racking up features on this record in the same way a mainstream rapper would Troye Sivan the hyams sisters lizzo sky ferreira christina the queens just to name a few so with more production from AG cook as well as complementary performances from voices across the pop spectrum not to mention numerous singles from this record being incredibly good this thing was building up to be one of my most anticipated records of the year the expectations for me personally were reaching a point where I was getting afraid Oh No this records never going to like be as good as I want it to be but actually it is as good as I wanted it to be maybe a little bit better oh it's such a good pop album and don't get it twisted this is a pop album I'm not trying to oversell the experimentation or the futuristic aspects of Charley's music on this record this thing isn't some kind of weird post pop experiment but what I love about this record is that it effectively balances experimentation and trusty pop formulas in a very nice way as far as a few of the weirder spots on here that are a little reminiscent of ideas off of number one angel or wroom wroom we have tracks like clique which is a roaring banger with kim Petrus as well as Estonian rapper Tommy Cash whose previous input on Charlie's material I didn't really care for but I actually liked his feature quite a bit here the glitchy abrasive beat on this thing is incredible the very noisy noisy noisy outros freaky as hell the braggadocious and auto-tune mix of rapping and singing throughout the track is really nice Kim and Tommy adds so much to the absolutely zany flavor of this track it's like this weird synthetic again I'll say futuristic mix of rap and pop and who knows what else there is the song thoughts that originally was a bit of an adjustment for me the slow pace the ringing and whipping synthesizers coming at you in every direction and they're they're very deeply layered all of the vocal processing and auto-tune on Charlie's voices is very bold very in-your-face their few pop artists on Charlie's level that are embracing digital aesthetics in the way that she is on the tract to the point where she sounds like she is an AI singing her swan song as the building that houses her mainframe is burning down it's really off-putting at first the track sounds alien but also soulful the lyrics meanwhile are full of regret and just basically about missing someone and the final odd moment on this record is the track shake it and this track is amazing if not merely for the fact that Charlie is the only artist out there right now who would have and who could get Big Freedia the queen of Bounce cupcake wrapper cupcake also Pablo guitar a Brazilian pop singer and drag queen as well as brick candy all on the same track and yet it all makes sense I also love that there are some melodic bits as well as some through line grooves that carry the entire track while every different passage for every different person on this song shifts or changes in some significant way to complement their style essentially making the song the one train of pop bangers I love the Sinister fluttery melting whaling string ish synths that occur under big Freitas appearance here there's also cupcake who suddenly drops into these yin yang twins s whisper raps Brooke candies features absolutely raunchy and demented meanwhile Pablo sings over an overblown distorted flip of the original beat so while these tracks do account for the weirdest moments on the record I wouldn't say they stick out like a sore thumb or anything like that they fit very nicely within the overall aesthetics of the album they just add a bit more spice and flavor and variety to the tracklist the rest of the record though is pretty clean consistent and laser focused on producing pop anthems pop ragers pop ballads even though there are a lot of sounds on this thing that feel as if they're coming from a distant future let me remind you that nothing on this record would not be possible without huge huge huge huge huge amounts of influence coming from the eras of 80s synth-pop or 2000s dance pop especially on key tracks like 1999 featuring Troye Sivan which is a total throwback sonically and thematically as the track is essentially about Charlie thinking back to a time where things were simpler things were nicer things were easier also kind of for back to references to music based pop culture at that time the whole thing sounds like a pristine and updated tribute to an era of boy bands pop divas y2k and TRL now in 1999 Charli XCX would have been 7 I don't know how much of the nostalgia she's basing this track on is is personal nostalgia or if she is just referencing a memory of an idea either way as someone who is maybe a bit more conscious during that era because I am older than her I think she's recaptured the the musical and aesthetic vibe of this era very very well we have more pop lists on the track blame it on your love now featuring Liz oh this song was originally track 10 off of pop 2 and in that version of the song it was this weird droney ballad that felt like it was existing in some kind of glitched out matrix but now it is this arena sized very urgent and melodramatic pop anthem with intimate verses a fantastic feature from Liz O on the back end this version is definitely a lot more orthodox than the track 10 version but I love both for different reasons you have to admit even if you like that weirder version the dynamic and decadent take on this this new edition of the track is something to behold the flow of this entire project - I have to remark is pretty impeccable there are lots of great high-energy cuts in the first half you have the very powerful gone featuring Christine and the queens which was one of the best pop songs of the year the day it came out it hits so hard and yet it is so glossy it's so sleek the chemistry between Charlie and Chris is great some of the tight rhythms and Chris's very strained little vocal embellishments are very very reminiscent of Michael Jackson I just love how huge the production of this track feels how huge the performance feels it's just larger than life there's also cross you out featuring sky ferreira which at first I did not care for all that much but with repeated listens I appreciate it a lot more and that was mostly because the beat is kind of a slog the pacing of this song I don't think is going to be for everybody but as I hear it more I like the growling industrial ish in the background I love how the production gets thicker and thicker and heavier and heavier as it progresses along the whole thing becomes pretty immense at the point where Charlie and Skye are hitting you with all of those vocal harmonies on the refrain of the track at the very final moments the vocal break the sky brings to the table right before those last spots are a very nice transition and in a great low-key moment to make the shock of the final climax hit so much harder the only track in the first leg that really truly fell flat for me was the song warm with Higham and it's not that there aren't good ideas on this track there are it's just that I wish there was more contrast through the song more separation between the verses and choruses more progression across the track so that it feels like I am moving through this thing instead of just cycling through the same beats after the midpoint of this project we hit a row of moodier mellower tracks that I think provide a nice I guess a vulnerable spot on the record we have the song white Mercedes which is another glistening love song but what about not being good enough the person who you have in mind always forgiving you when you hurt them this person making you better you not deserving this person the track features an impeccable hook backed by a very familiar chord progression but it does not take away from how powerfully sad this chorus is I also cannot get enough of the thumping buzzing almost lo-fi aesthetic of the song silver cross it has all these passages and melodies that are just darting in every direction they're so angular but still the song at the core of it is incredibly sweet and gratifying just like a righteous ass pop song should be the song I don't want to know is a pretty vulnerable moment on the record a very raw spotlit synth back ballad it's kind of a dirge there's a lot of emotional potency there but I still wish there was more meat on the bone instrumentally the mix generally is pretty washed out to the point where everything sounds really mushy I much prefer the very intimate and subtle official which is not only about I guess confirming love confirming the idea or the existence of a relationship but the swirling little electronic embellishments around this tuner so pretty it's like being transported into a digital fantasy garden I went into this thing already pretty impressed with February 2017 within the context of the tracklist it feels more like a transitional moment bringing us to the album's grand finale with 2099 the album is also booked ended by two fantastic songs as the intro feels like we are essentially booting up to a new version an upgrade of pop music itself meanwhile 2099 which sees Troye Sivan coming back is like a semi dystopian send-off which looks forward to a potentially darker future for pop music and maybe even society itself I think it's pretty fitting that the closing lines on this hook I pull up roll up fuck up don't make decisions for me you don't know nothing and also I'm Pluto Neptune pull up roll up future future their spots and the lyrics on this thing to feel disorienting spots that feel like they're fearing control or some kind of authoritarianism in a way and then again there's also that look to that future some bits of the instrumental or kind of harsh very glitchy and odd it's a satisfying finish that also leaves us on somewhat of a dark cliffhanger in a way it is not only a defining moment for Charlie but I also think a defining moment for pop this decade which potentially sets us on a path for the shape of pop to come and look I'm not gonna argue that this is the most cutting edge things happening in music across the board right now that's not my argument what I'm saying is I'm impressed with how well performed well produced sweet catchy and enjoyable this project is while simultaneously in a very creative way working in some of those futuristic and forward-thinking elements to add a bit of edge add a bit of flair to me that is what Charlie does well here so impeccably well in fact I would say she killed it there were a few tracks that yes I think could have been better with some very small changes but for the most part I was very impressed with this from front to back feeling that a decent a strong nine on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like feel like please

the forever 
ZGmQ9_ceFoY,Oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new jpeg mafia album all my heroes are corn balls this is a new album from producer rapper singer-songwriter mr. jpeg mafia who suddenly became an overnight sensation in the hip hop underground shortly after the release of his album last year veteran I've been aware of PEGI stuff for a while I took the time in 2016 to celebrate his incredibly confrontational single with freaky I might vote for Donald Trump which was one of my favorite songs of the year and also early works of his like black Ben Carson I thought certainly had a lot of untapped potential potential that was fulfilled on veteran which is still an incredibly radical fucking record uncompromising challenging aggressive and yet so deeply in tune with much of what makes mainstream hip-hop as appealing as it is constantly borrowing from it whether it be with a bit of an accessible flow or rhythm and then subverting it on a track like 1530 $19 calvert thug tears Macaulay Culkin as well as who can forget I cannot fucking wait until Morrissey dies simply labeling JPEG mafia as abstract or experimental or even industrial hip-hop it doesn't really give you much of a picture of anything that he does especially considering his consistently edgy political and in your face lyrical content as well as how disorienting and unpredictable the flows of his projects tend to be it's like it's all functioning on a gigantic very unhealthy mood swing so going into this new PEGI project I hoped it would be out there I thought it would be especially given the vibe of the teaser tracks more or less I expected the Pegman to stick to his guns and continue delivering those esoteric slaps I didn't necessarily foresee him doing more singing on this record though bringing in a bit more influence from the worlds of pop and R&B especially as he goes on his own melodic interpretation of TLC's no scrubs during one of the interlude cuts here even though he didn't do a whole ton of it on veteran Peggy singing on his own songs is nothing but it's really the emotion the vibe the mood of this record that feels different and unique from every other project Peggy has dropped up until this point and for some reason this has made corn balls at least for me a bit more difficult to sum up than veteran it's not nearly as obvious or as straightforward as veteran was and that record was already pretty Impressionists in nature constantly changing but still greater than the sum of its loosely associated parts the increase in moody synthetics and tuneful singing and vapor wavy textures and sound palettes has led to an experience that is a lot mellower and even more depressive than any JPEG project up until this point which is not necessarily a bad thing because I think Peggy shows a knack for writing these alt rap dirges if you could call them that there were some pretty key and alien synth passages on PTSD on beta male strategies on the end of the dots freestyle as well as grimy waifu that sound like they are straight out of a vapor wave album taking all of these changes in I'm not surprised that Peggy with semi ironically promote this record telling fans they're going to be disappointed with it because I think corn balls does ask a lot more from fans than veteran did I'm not even sure if I'm crazy about everything going on on this LP but I guess I'm happy Peggy didn't make the same record all over again but there were quite a few songs in the tracklist that for me felt very uncommon tum' or theme or central idea across their runtime especially toward the end of the project like the dots freestyle which I think kicks off well enough low key beat smooth flows witty rhymes but just starts trailing off in a really unsatisfactory way after the guest vocal comes in and then again we transition into that weird vapor wavy passage that while I don't mind it in theory it just feels really tacked on the post verified live style has a lot of admirable parts to it but the disjointed structure of it all makes me wonder what exactly this track is trying to be is it an instrumental with what sounds like found sound effects is it a weird vocal snippet or scale it's just like I'm being constantly shifted back and forth between listening to a snippet or rather just one fifth of several different songs thought tactics I thought had some good bars and a great vocal line from Peggy toward the end but the very subdued and glitchy beat just felt like a hodgepodge sort of weak foundation for the song and a giggly outro that just feels like one more distraction from the fact that a song here didn't really have a strong ending and while I am complaining I guess I'll point out the track life's hard here's a song about sorrel which is excruciatingly not only does the instrumental feel like a OneNote Rick's point never replicas rip off but the purposefully horrendous strained auto-tuned singing thrown on top of that is just a very difficult lesson thankfully there are many more positives than negatives throughout the tracklist on this thing especially on the more tuneful cuts here the opening track Jesus forgive me I am a thot you better count your blessings phobia I love the glassy and distant keys on this track and the bass is heavy as hell Peggy delivering all these coarse and dark humored bars many of which seem to center around his creative process it may in fact be a comment on his popularity and him operating within the music industry in the state that he does there are standout lines on this thing like I hope these crackers don't Columbine as well as addressing his odd fashion sense talking about how he's wearing your grandma's hand-me-downs which also reminds me of the line where he is talking about keeping his non-existent pussy closed on the hook we also have a bar on the next track where he's quick to compare himself to Princess Peach another song Rhys quick to compare himself to Carly Rae Jepsen I guess you could say that Peggy is kind of showing off his feminine side on this record and in a good way because he's looking gorgeous on the cover the song beta male strategies is also relatively low-key with these oddly grooved Airy ethereal samples again very vaporwave ish lots of threatening lyrics throughout the bars being pointed at internet trolls say what you said on Twitter right now I love the tracks distorted and strange chord transition around the midpoint of the song sounds really apocalyptic and almost Radiohead ish then there's the song grimy waifu which for one transitions fantastically out of the previous interlude cut JPEG mafia-type be a short song here that I think works in a few different layers for one the jittery busy beat and pitched down screaming Atari Teenage Riot sampled vocals together it all sounds a lot like Death Grips I think JPEG mafia may be in fact poking fun at tight beat culture on platforms like YouTube as well as calling out the constant comparisons that he gets to acts like Death Grips despite not released sounding all that much like them but to get back to grimy waifu i love these sparkly acoustic guitars on this track the beautiful synth leads again all very mellow very pretty but the lyrics detail a different tone a different mood as this track is essentially a romantic ish ode to Peggy's gun his weapon that's my Grammy wack boo the lyrics throughout are pretty smart very playful very funny the theme of this track is pretty significant given Peggy's background in the Armed Forces which I think also plays into some of the themes and the title of the next track PTSD which has a very disorienting and strange sample-based tone setting intro that eventually gives way to these mystical ringing synth passages some plucky embellishments here and there - it sounds like something out of a tragic scene in a Japanese anime and it's as these gorgeous melodies are cycling underneath that Peggy jumps on top starts delivering these violent threatening bars talking shit like y'all deals looking like brexit which is the funniest and most apt line about some rappers record label deal that I think I've heard in a long time the song rap grow old and die No Child Left Behind is a cool little two-parter with these sweet buzzing chord progressions it's kind of lo-fi it's kind of blown out and it is through this nastiness that Peggy is able to broadcast one of the most beautiful vocal melodies on the entire record with him singing in this very robotic tone about being caught up in these vicious life cycles I wish there were more tracks on this thing that were this tuneful and inspired this much loaf I wonder it's after the title track on this thing that I think the material starts to grow a little inconsistent and again low-impact kind of underwhelming sure there are amazing highlights past this point like the explosive prone the title track is fantastic and there's also the amazing and super catchy free the frail which not only has one of the most melodic and stunning choruses on the entire record but this song is maybe the most vulnerable that JPEG mafia has been on a track so far and it's mostly about his fame his image feeling like he's completely out of control of this whole situation he's existing at the whims of the audience essentially I think what he communicates lyrically on the chorus of this track says so much don't rely on the strength of my image if it's good then it's good break it down the shit is out of my hands but again quite a few tracks in the second half of this record in my opinion aren't terrible but just so-so and I barely scratched the surface of how many incredible one-liners there are from front to back on this thing even when you're talking about tracks that maybe the instrumental or the structure leaves a bit to be desired that one line about one shot turning Steve Bannon into Stephen Hawking oh my god also better than me rather than you on the barrier right trying to lead these neighbors to freedom Peggy Harriet target practice on an Aryan redneck tiers whoo what a beverage again bars like these are on every corner of this album even though at this point I still have a hard time summing this record up I mean surely it is experimental it is abrasive it is in-your-face it is harmonious it is beautiful it is raw it is vulnerable it is everything that you have expected jpg mafia to be up until this point those glitches that noise the hip-hop influence that trademark rap flow but this time around its a bit glossy er it is more sterile and in a way where it tries to become a bit more emotionally numb it's more despondent it's more depressive and again those weird digital very alien vaporwave influences are just bleeding into so many tracks here I loved it I'm impressed I wouldn't say I liked it as much as veteran though which has grown on me significantly since the release of that record but even though I'm liking this record slide less than its predecessor that is not to say that I don't enjoy the mood change this record brings I do and this dude is unquestionably still one of the most unique rapper producers out there operating right now and he's saying shit that 99% of rappers don't even have half of a mind to say this dude is still a young internet got producing the soundtrack for the despondent late stage capitalist age that we are all currently trapped in feeling a light eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it well would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I ever be next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana jpg mafia forever
