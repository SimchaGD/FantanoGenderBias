ooUmHvnjmwg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new aghia and the Stooges record ready to die Iggy and the Stooges Detroit based band Iggy Pop frontman one of rock music's original badasses van has three seminal records under their belts they are bloody they're dirty they're filthy they're earned the band lived fast and they're very abrupt break up in the mid 70s reflected that because for their time there was very little about their brand of rock music that felt civilized and I would say that this energy that the band would put into their music really paid off in some long-term dividends because just the guts that they laid out in their records like raw power in funhaus have withstood the test of time and feel just as high-octane today as I'm sure they did back then after the demise of the band there were some post Stooges musical projects to take note of that were pretty great like Ron Ashton's destroy all monsters and Iggy Pop as well had a pretty successful solo career with a handful of grey records he mellowed out a little bit musically but not in a bad way he put out some interesting post-punk stuff some art rock stuff he got a little more adventurous past his Stooges material and put out quite a few records in the 80s and 90s but the 2000s saw these Stooges actually reforming for live performances with mike watt from the Minutemen playing bass and this performing in the band's popularity just kind of getting going again led to the result of a new studio album the band's first studio album in decades the weirdness in 2007 Steve Albini produced it and in my opinion this record easily one of the most tragic studio recording comebacks a band has ever made I mean literally so tragic that the band and its label literally omitted the existence of this album out from the press release for this new LP saying this album is like a direct release after rock power really the raw power on the weirdness was gone the band's intensity was just replaced with very terrible lyrics my idea of fun is killing everyone and these lyrics were delivered with vocals that really really lacked ferocity and the guitars really kind of lacked ferocity to just didn't have the guts that they used to back in the day to me there was just a certain tameness to their new sound on this record the Stooges were sounding like the groomed and commodified version of what wild rock music is sold as today as opposed to what it was when the Stooges were playing now with this latest record ready to die which unfortunately comes after the passing of Ron Ashton we have round two essentially this comeback and I have to say admittedly the Stooges are sounding a little gutsy er than they did on their previous full-length they are completely missing the mark the band still has their very Garage sound songs like dirty deal have a very fast energetic riff pretty solid solo as well but that desperation that just being pushed to the edge feel of the Stooges music is just still not on this record it's still not on this recording I mean I I can't express I can't put it into words just that that feeling of like my life depends on this music existing that vibe is not on here for sure this record is not really an insult to their legacy in the way that the weirdness was but essentially you're just getting a lot of wild garage rock tracks here that do not feel that wild and a few of them especially tracks like beat that guy that experiment with strings and background vocals venture into territory that has never really been the Stooges strong point so I'm just wondering why they're even going down this road to begin with there are some tracks on here that have lyrics that make me cry and cringe like the song job I got a job and it don't pay they're just the moments where he pops words just are too obnoxious for words to be completely honest and his voice it's it's like him and the band are really worried about how it sounds at all whether or not it's just underwhelming during a point that is I guess shooting for something high energy or just warbling awkwardly or just off-pitch on some of the moments where it seems like the band is pulling together something a little more ballad like I do think the guitars overall on this album are better they're more ferocious it's more nasty that's just showing those canines and as far as guitars and drums locking together and making a groove just making a tough-ass vibe songs like Dee Dee's dirty deal or ready to die these songs really have their stuff together and the song gun 2 is pretty good as far as guitars and drums go but there's so many tracks on this album I feel like would have gone over so much better if agiza vocals weren't so just a flat overall I did think this album was a step up from the weirdness however that doesn't necessarily mean that I enjoyed it though there were some bright spots coming out of the guitars and the drums together I didn't really care for the vocals I'm not a single song there were some tracks that I didn't really care for the mix either or it felt like the guitars were turned up so high I can really appreciate much of anything else in the mix and like I mentioned toward the beginning of this review there were songs on you were seeing like Iggy and the Stooges were experimenting with some softer ideas that I just don't really think went over all that well I'm really feeling a light two decent four on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Iggy and the Stooges forever 
MYJHHxjlwOQ,something hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's yes music nerd and it's time for a review of new Colin Stetson album new history warfare vol 3 Colin Stetson is a Canadian saxophone player and he has been quite the buzz over the past few years in jazz and experimental music circles but he has sort of an indie music appeal as well of course his last full-length album was also recorded at the infamous hotel to tango which has been home to many a great Canadian artists such as silver Mount Zion Orchestra and Godspeed you black Emperor on top of that Colin is actually toured a little bit with God speed too and while all of these connections have brought Colin a lot of visibility nothing is quite as attention-grabbing as this man's performances his live performances and just his musical style in general when it comes to playing the saxophone really no matter what the size this man is a machine and the man's albums in this new history warfare music series basically consists of these one take saxophone pieces that flutter and howl endlessly thanks to Colin's continuous breathing techniques making us a never really needs to stop playing not only are Colin's technical abilities really impressive but to take it even further his music has been recorded in some really interesting ways too with some very strange mic placements that not only pick up his breathing the saxophone as well the notes that it's making and the sounds of the valves on the saxophones opening and closing creating kind of a rhythmic background for the melodic side of these pieces that Colin is writing these have basically been the main characteristics of this new history warfare series and from what I understand this is going to be the last installment of it and I wouldn't say the Colin is ducking out prematurely or anything like that he does create music on this album that does have a sense of finality here there are a lot of tracks on this album that to me feel like very sentimental feel like a hug goodbye Colin takes a lot of the very obtuse and polarizing saxophone experiments that he indulged in on his previous two album and tries to interpret and express them in a way that feels beautiful Colin creates moments on the south and they feel like a new day some kind of ascension like I'm listening to an emotional wake-up call just some reminder that my heart is beating and that my lungs are pushing out air it's time to just stop walking through life as a stone-faced drone and just feel something there's just something about the way that the Stetson he blends very simple with very complicated ideas in his solo sax pieces from his endlessly evolving saxophone arpeggios and runs up and down a spectrum of pitches and how he has these howls coming out from his throat in the background sort of like this very eerie crying voice in the distance that is muffled by the sax Reed jammed in his mouth and also on this album singer/songwriter Justin Vernon aka Bone Iver comes along and contributes vocals on a number of tracks here helping to enhance that sentimental vibe that Colin was going for on a lot of these tracks however there are moments where I feel like Justin's version of sentimental and Colin's version of sentimental might not necessarily I guess mesh like the opening track on this LP and in truth where Justin is singing in his trademark falsetto multi-tracked soaring over Colin's fluttering saxophone lines and to me it just kind of feels like Justin's voice is overtaking what Colin's doing as opposed to sort of complementing it but Justin doesn't always sort of stay in his comfort zone on this album there is the song brew where Colin is playing especially fast on the track just plaquing clacking his valves he's breathing as hard as hell making his sax just blare out furiously and toward the back end of the song Justin Vernon actually comes through and contributes what sounds like death metal style growls on the song this album feels like a metal nightmare the only other track that featured Justin's voice that really sort of impressed me was the cover of what are they doing in heaven today originally a Washington Phillips song a gospel tune where we hear Justin's singing in sort of a normal range of voice which is actually very soulful very emot-- it actually complements the track really well and it makes me feel as if well maybe a normally some voice would have suffice not just a falsetto on some of the other tracks as well of course there is also the 15 minute monolith of a title track that is on this album that I am pretty in love with the beginning of this track has a lot of fluttering sax lines too but the way that they're played and the phrasing that they're running up and down it feels very pretty in a way but the back end of the song as the track evolves it gets really heavy really intense the track feels like I'm listening to just mammoth calls like extinct tundra mammoths that are 50 feet tall and made of gears and pulleys they're like mecha mammoths and they're just leaving giant freaking footprints in snow dunes and sheets of ice there are a lot of highlights on this LP for sure no question no doubt but for me personally the downsides that this LP offers some of the ideas are say me say me across the album especially if you were a huge fan of Colin's previous to LPS as well though yes there was a little bit more tenderness musically on this album it doesn't really feel like Colin is pushing his technical ability that far on this album at least to my ears which if you're head over heels for Colin might not necessarily be a deal breaker but for me personally I wasn't really in love with every single vocal contribution that Bon Iver brought to the table I was much more enamored with what Shara Worden and Laurie Anderson did on his last full length LP I'm pretty much feeling a light to decent 7 on the cell P if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana Colin Stetson forever you 
PsHF5uXu9js,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd here to do a quickie do talking about a bunch of tracks and albums that I haven't discussed lately that I've been meaning to talk about but want to touch down on in this video let's begin a lot of people been asking me about the new deaf Punk single now that the official radio edit of the song is out featuring Nigel's million as well as Pharrell singing and honestly I have to say that the song has a pretty good groove very strong disco vibes on this track I especially like the hook with the robot voices it definitely feels like you know Daft Punk ten years or so ago all over again however as far as the progression of the song goes at least on this radio edit of the of the song it feels kind of monotonous a little tedious and while Pharrell does feel like a capable singer on this song I have to say it's not like he's flashy enough or has large enough of a range for me to be that interested in him singing for the length of an entire track it's a decent tune doesn't exactly have me disappointed or anything like that I'm just hoping that there are better tracks to come on this new Daft Punk LP the one and only janelle monae has also dropped a new song titled Queen featuring Erykah Badu she has vocals all over this track it's incredibly funky a little cheesy has an old-school 80s pop and R&B vibe to it a little bit of prints coming through on this track and a really strong heady rap verse on the tail end it's an interesting listen MGMT also has a new song out titled alien days and it would seem from the likes of this song that they're going into even more strange out-there psychedelic rock and pop territory with this new song I actually even read an article saying that they don't expect some of the fans of their older pop singles to come back around on this new album it's it's sad to see that the band is losing fans because people didn't jump on board with the more psychedelic sounds on their last full-length LP but this song I actually found to be pretty weird and stimulating and just sort of obtuse but also very sweet and psychedelic as well I like in the track and I'm really interested in seeing where the band goes next disclosure has a new single out featuring vocals from Eliza Doolittle it is a funky UK house banger and has a really old school 90s vibe to it that I'm liking a lot and also make sure to stream this new full-length LP from Netherlands hardcore punk band this routine is held the album is howl it's been produced by Kurt Balu of all people and has a lot of hard ass guitars a lot of raw energy and just passion passion push a tee numbers on the boards a really interesting track whether you like it or not from push a dude comes through with a lot of charismatic bars not exactly the tightest flow or the most impressive flow on the block but man was it a risk for push it to rap over the production on this track which is incredibly clunky noisy and weird and has a very generous jay-z sample on the track it is a weird ass beat and finally UK female post-punk outfits savages has a new song out titled shut up from their new full-length LP silence yourself alright let's get into albums - tor is the latest full-length album from this swedish black metal project and this is an album that I could easily see people getting enthralled with if you are a huge fan of that old-school lo-fi grimy black metal sound but it's not truly lo-fi or abrasive or anything like that there is somewhat of a balance in all the fuzz and compression that is on the songs the very long songs monolithic songs on this album the tracks on this help here rich with frosty distortion wretched vocals pounding drums that are just sort of floating and all the distortion all the haze repetition extreme repetition is used throughout these songs like it's said really long tracks sometimes breaching the 20-minute mark to create something really hypnotic and kind of ambien I don't find the songs on this album to be that musically engaging however they're not really supposed to be in a traditional sense like I said they go for more than ambient vibe this isn't something I would typically find myself in the mood for but if you are in this mood I do think the cell is gonna hit you hard MTM HDV music producer who pretty much spearheads this project is also the mastermind behind the senior coconut project which if you check them out has a lot of fantastically Latin music infused Kraftwerk covers and anyway this guy's like just a one-man craft work in himself and I just like this guy's really digital robotic aesthetic he definitely takes that old school craft ver cribe and brings it into a modern setting really sort of sucking the humanity that has evolved into the world of electronic music Adam TM definitely captures those vibes in some really interesting ways and has kind of a few strange standouts on this album like a track with Jamie Liddell which is a little corny but fun and an odd cover of the who's my generation Adam TM can produce there's no question there I mean some of the sounds on this album are really great and there's aesthetic here too and some of the more abstract tracks on here are pretty interesting as well it's just that there are some moments where I find this LP just a little too cheesy to handle the new Marne Eastern el Nene chronicles of narnia this is the latest full-length album from eccentric indie rock guitar heroine and her earlier stuff had a lot of elements of math rock and noise pop flowing through it and definitely these characteristics are on this new LP as well but I have to say Marnie Stern is a lot more easygoing on this album but still even easygoing Marnie Stern rocks pretty freakin hard if there's anything I didn't really care for on this LP though even though I do like Marnie's energy and sometimes your songwriting can be really sharp it's that I don't really feel like the production translates on this album too well the guitars feel really sort of sharp brittle kind of bodyless on a lot of these tracks the bass lines don't feel that strong in the drum just are really razor thin at some points and on top of it Marnie's vocals which are at sometimes multi-tracked and singing in these really strange ear piercing pitches even though Marnie does have some really adventurous ideas when it comes to songwriting and guitar playing this very flat production makes all the songs on the album feel sort of homogenous definitely get into Laura's debut full-length LP if you're looking for something that is a bit of a pop soul neo-soul blend that is a little eccentric there's definitely enough color on this album that will hook in fans of let's say Kimbra or maybe even Lianne La Havas their spots on this album where Laura will be singing ballads that just feel very refined and string kissed other moments very high-energy multitrack vocals on the song textured rhythms and beats sort of odd but still very sharp and straight forward with its melody if there's anything that doesn't really appeal to me all that much on this album it's that Laura isn't exactly the best lyricist in my opinion but outside of that as far as neo soul goes I do think this album has a lot of Appeal and the new uncle acid & the deadbeats LP mind control is the latest full-length album from the uk-based rock outfit that is extremely extremely nostalgic in nature referencing back to the old world of doom metal as well as stone Arak heavy psych as well and while there are some other bands out there that do play with these genres but do in a very modern way uncle acid & the deadbeats are content to go for this production sound that makes the songs they're playing feel like they were produced in that time period very fuzzy very sort of condensed the vocals very buried underneath the guitars the recording the production it's very very noisy and that's fine I do think people who are into this genre will like the sound that the band has to offer me personally I don't really like how obscure the tunes are by all this fuzz and at times the way that the band plays out these riffs and the drumming - it feels very very sort of stiff and not that alive I do realize that there is a lot of older do metal music that does have this feel to it because of the space that the band wanted to leave in between its riffs but I wouldn't exactly say uncle acid & the deadbeats are stretching their riffs out to the point where they should feel like they're this lifeless it's not a bad album by any means I would just say overall it's more for the nostalgia seeker than anything alright and that's it those are my tips on those releases and songs thank you for watching Anthony Fantana quickies you 
BSKuO06eluM,monomania hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Deer Hunter LP monomania deer hunter is a Georgia based rock band this is their four full-length release and they've pretty much been one of the bigger names in indie rock for the past five or so years and their style tends to lean toward the more psychedelic side of things noise pop dream pop as well as a little bit of shoegaze the band's earlier releases were very much sonic explorations through rock music whereas on their later releases they would flex their pop sensibilities through the songwriting of Lockett punt and Bradford Cox with albums like micro castle as well as the very well produced and instrumentally lavish Halcyon Digest with the direction that the band was going and you would think that they were just one album away from making some kind of big indie cross over into the mainstream where you had this underground band and slowly over time they gained more pop appeal and then they sort of you know get that sliver of limelight from more general music listeners given the material that was on Halcyon digest the last album they came out with and how high that album charted on the Billboard charts I thought that Deerhunter would be capable of making an album that had a lot of pop appeal even more pop appeal but still maintain their personality but Deerhunter is nothing if not full of surprises and it seems that the band has completely turned around on this new album and have gone back to their noisier roots on this album Deerhunter dishes out a lot of rock tunes with a strong garage rock attitude and tracks that are really sort of straightforward and just get right to the point not so much the more psychedelic and spaced-out jams that were inhabiting an album like cryptograms so it's not like monomania is a return to form or anything in a way monomania is most definitely progression you could say that over time Deerhunter has been working to kind of eliminate from their musical formula and monomania in its own sort of way does that by getting rid of very lavish detailed layered psychedelic production in favor of a recording that sounds more like it was recorded very shoddily in a bedroom if anything a lot of songs on this album kind of feel like some of the more straightforward material to come out of Bradford Cox solo project Atlas sound but in this instance weighing more lively instrumental E and a little punchier in a way this new album actually kind of has the guts that I wish Bradford Cox's last full-length LP did the very rough aesthetic that Deer Hunter goes for on the self he definitely makes a lot of these songs stick out Bradford Cox's vocals are mixed very high smothering almost all of the instrumentation underneath his voice the guitars are pretty distorted and when they're not distorted they're just very clear sharp and upfront the drums are very dirty gritty the more subtle tracks on the cell P come off very catchy and clear as well but newer fans to Deer Hunter who are really huge into albums like micro Castle as well as Halsey and digest may see songs like this as as possibly being just a little overly simple for sure the direction that Deer Hunter goes in on this LP does have appeal it's helped the careers of many garage rockers over the years neo garage rockers like Jay retard as well as ty Segall so it's really gonna make this album stick with people is whether or not the songs are memorable if they're catchy if they're passionate the band starts the selfie pretty eccentric with the song neon junkyard which is this tune that features are pretty captivating vocal melody sharp guitar leads Bradford Cox on certain parts of the song makes these really weird mouth noises echo out into oblivion just kind of adding a psychedelic characteristic to this song the song has a pretty basic structure but that doesn't necessarily ruin it because the melodies are so sharp what sort of ends up being a downside to the tune is that at the very end when it seems like the band gets kind of tired of building the song one piece after another they just sort of embark upon this very static underwhelming noisy jam until the song just sort of Peters out this is something Deer Hunter doesn't quite a few tracks from this LP actually and sometimes it just feels sort of boring and other times like for example the song monomania the title track on this LP it comes off as really intense thrilling and chaotic if there was any question that deer hunter was going into garage rock direction with the south and the song leather jacket clears that up with some really jagged wailing guitars just an attitude filled riff I just cannot stress how much attitude just no more plays a freaking role on this album to the point where it really sort of overshadows the song sometimes or makes a really lackluster song seem a little more interesting than it really is the track the missing is maybe the first song on this album that people will acknowledge as being sort of a traditional Deer Hunter song it's more toned-down more subtle the instrumentation rings through clearly not much distortion on this thing Bradford Cox things are really sweet vocal melody and the emotion behind his voice comes off as as very charismatic yet sort of emotionally disconnected cool I like the really warm synthesizers that come in after the verses on this track too it adds a really nice touch I think people will find a lot of appeal in this song for a long time Deer Hunter fans as well as the track dream captain where Bradford Cox has some pretty quaint lyrics on the track that are really sort of cute and the song sleepwalking - is a quieter number on this LP that comes off pretty charming through its subtleties even if you don't necessarily love what Deer Hunter did on this new album I think that some of the quieter moments on the selfie are worth salvaging and just sort of you know taking into consideration in terms of ideas for when Deer Hunter does another full-length there are some moments on this album though where the simplicity doesn't necessarily work into your Hunter's favor like the song blue agent which I feel like in terms of a tune is a fine track but as the band is performing this song without introducing new ideas as it goes along the track just feels really tedious and the song THM as well and there are some instances on this album where some tracks don't even feel like that like the song Pensacola just sounds like really bad alternative country it's actually like the band was trying to do an alternative country parody with these really hokey guitar leads and very generic guitar chords and the way Bradford Cox is singing on this song this really can't be wait it seems like he's really kind of ended up on what might be a joke an honestly night bike toward the end of this LP is another sort of least favorite of mine where Bradford Cox seems to be very indulgently strumming and singing in this very directionless way that does not feel entertaining at all it's at this point on the album where it feels like the attitude that toward the beginning of the LP that felt very refreshing and kind of badass and exciting is now getting really tiring especially given how many tracks on the self he felt more like posturing than you know just a good solid song while in theory I would have been interested in an album where Deer Hunter went in a noisier garage rock direction I mean that's what I assumed based on the title track that dropped before this album which I still love but when it comes to the practice of putting this album together it seems like Deer Hunter left out some essential details some catchy er songs and really just some more raw energy I'm feeling a light 2ds and six on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and here's another opinion hey listen Cal's gonna give it to you straight I've listened to plenty of deer rider in my day and the man mania Rex I've heard plenty of sangs with guitar and drums but none of them nice is

rTiya-mIJUU,so hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new seven skin 7-inch sugar red soap and skin is the pseudonym of Austrian singer-songwriter Anja Francisca last year she came out with the album narrow one of my favorite albums of that year very short too short so short that it made me a little sad inside but an incredibly potent album in terms of songwriting power of motion Anya has this fantastic voice that weighs so heavy on the heart sometimes it's very eerie and smoky and throaty and very high and soaring above all of this just sadness and despair other times it's very kind of deadpan and haunting and of course she does this once again on her new 7-inch EP I'm gonna call it an EP it's like three tracks and it's a solid set of songs it kicks off at the track sugar bread which is a really impressive track to lead this 7-inch off with on this track anya basically takes that more industrial and beat heavy vibe that came from her last album but really beefs it up with an epic choral group as well as some horns and strings the added instrumentation on this song sounds huge its massive I'm just crossing my fingers hoping it shows up on her next full-length and the blood-curdling screams that she has the beginning of this track it's just so chilling the huge horn hits on this track that sometimes feels synthesized to have this kind of rigid awkward robotic feel to them the driving beat behind this track that also feels very mechanical the song is really well mixed not only is it massive but it has this kind of ambiguity to it where I can't exactly tell what is synthesized or what synthetic or what's real all I know is that Anya's voice in those weird hurricane of apocalyptic sounds and effects and chorus vocals she is just singing so it's almost as if emotionally she's completely unaffected by all this insanity going on around her and she was just this chilled eerie freaky straight-faced demon bringing all of this hell up from behind her and she just like taking bitch surely her artistic vision is a little bit deeper and more interesting than that but that's how it feels to me if there's anything that's a crime about the song is that it is a short three minutes and 36 seconds I mean the song definitely works sort of on a verse chorus verse structure has a nice eerie organ lead bridge toward the end of the track but with bringing all this extra instrumentation in and just making a song that is absolutely huge I can't help but feel like Anya's ideas are getting just a little too big to just totally encase into a just normal song length because while I do feel like this track is great and I do think it has just stuck into my head from repeat listens what the song is doing musically and melodically isn't exactly obvious on the first listen because how much is thrown at the listener in such a short period of time the songs I actually ended up liking a little bit more on this track were the two more subtle ones after this song like me and the devil which comes second it's a string led ballad with Anya's voice singing very passionately and a lot of points on this song it's actually the most passionately sung song on the entire EP and a lot of the lyrical themes coming up in this track and the repetition that was coming through in her lyrics on this song it felt very blues inspired and then it freakin hit me it's a very I saw you can cover and it's a fantastic revision with key hits of strings and noise and just dramatic throws of panel quartz just jutting into the mix as Anya says key words and the lyrics like the devil and Satan and the song pray that finishes the EP I was one of her more somber piano ballads a lot of piano arpeggios throughout this track but the song just finds this very beautiful beautiful kind of uplifting brightness to it as horns start swelling up in the background and the piano courts change mood the marching staccato piano notes toward the end of the song or a nice touch as well but it just feels like the song could have gone a little bit longer than the two or so minutes that it lasts overall I really join the CEP I do think that these song lengths could be a little bit longer and that some of these bigger ideas could be spread out and just fleshed out into something a bit more climactic I think it'll make the emotional power of Anya's songs even higher to have some of these ideas just sort of grow still not really a lot of complaints on this thing I'm feeling strong seven to a light tape on this EP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana soap and skin forever 
s0DvP63D0B0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new yeah yeah yeahs LP mosquito yeah yeah yeah our New York rock band who made a lot of noise in the early 2000s with a fantastic debut full-length fever to tell with the band's very straightforward simple approach rough guitars Keira knows screeching vocals they had characteristics that made them stand out against the Modest Mouse's and the Conor Oberst and the White Stripes is's and The Strokes --is that were helping popularize indie rock music around this time there were moments that the band would embark upon these very garage rock influenced tunes but really just sort of noisy and very textured and rough and stripped-down songs like black tongue for example but sometimes the band was enjoyed even more for their more tender side because it seemed like they were just as great at belting out these really awesomely constructed ballad songs like maps or even tracks like why control which seemed to kind of fuse these two sides of the IAEA's style the band has four full-length LPS at this point with mosquito and as they continue to release albums they gained more pop appeal started employing more instrumentation into their tracks but one thing even though some fans did fall off in this process they don't get enough credit for is that the yeah yeah we're pretty much able to maintain their style and their persona as they went for more mainstream acclaim they were able to put out tracks with this rock and pop blend that still had a lot of Flair character and fire to them however on this new LP I was kind of expecting a bit of a return to their grittier side considering the first single that dropped from this album sacrilege with the distorted vocals on this track the awesome hook melody as well as the gigantic gospel chorus that pops in at the end of this track sacrilege is easily one of the best and most ambitious singles that yeah as have ever put out with this track it seemed like the band's sights were set really high however when I ended up getting this album a listen I didn't tour find a lot of tracks following that suit I found a lot of inconsistency on this LP unfortunately like with the song subway which comes right after this great opening single the track just meanders mundane ly with this boring vocal melody and not much happening through the guitars either the track is very spacious it's very atmospheric I would say it's more atmosphere than substance I think the only interesting thing I found about the track was that it sort of sampled that subway rail click-clack for its rhythm section there are some other slower tracks on this LP that are great though like the song under the earth which to me has a fantastic vocal performance from Karen oh she is sultry on this track and I love the way that they futz with a lot of effects on the guitars throughout this song to really create subterranean atmosphere on this track the title track on this thing is one of the more upbeat tracks on the album it's a garage rock influenced tune almost as if it were a jungle music garage rock tune with the way the staccato bass is playing and the drums the way they have that primal Amazonian vibe to them and Karen brings some really awesome charisma and energy on the strap or lyrics definitely leave I don't know a little bit to be desired with the suck your blood and the suck your blood and the mosquito does this the mosquito does that I mean I could appreciate what the band is going for kind of but I just feel like they didn't put enough interesting things in the song throughout by the time I've done with one third of this track I feel like I kind of heard the rest of it the rest of this LP kind of bounces back and forth between rockers and crooners the next few tracks on this LP felt kind of safe to me I mean just not really all that adventurous in terms of what the yajes have done already I think the most interesting track around the middle point of this album was area 52 which is a hard noisy garage rocker but kind of suffers from that one-dimensional characteristic that the title track does in terms of what you expect from yaayyy as I think the most surprising thing since the opening track on this LP is the dr. Octagon feature on the song buried alive and while it may be surprising to hear a hip hop artists come in and contribute a verse to yeah yes on kind of in a in a bad way it's not actually dr. octagon that makes the song feel so underwhelming it's actually the very bland guitar playing in chords and Karen hoes ad-libs that make the song feel kind of haphazardly written and put together just to have a backdrop or dr. octagon to rap over you know I don't slag the a a as for doing something simple on some of these tracks for sure simplicity and minimalism plays a very big role on some of the pants earliest and best work to me it's just an idea that sort of overused on this new LP there's not a lot of balance there's just one overly simple song after another they're not consistently putting out these dazzling ballads or songs like they used to which definitely makes me prefer an album like it splits over mosquito on this LP you get tracks like always which overuse lyrics and doesn't even really have that interesting of vocal melody and what the corny cents on this track the cheesy Casio preset beat which aren't even really reframed in a way that's interesting and the overuse of effects just to make this track feel bouncy like it's got some kind of depth the song just kind of feels like a b-side that wouldn't have seen the light of day if mosquito hadn't come out the last few tracks on the selfie are pretty capable the song despair despite the title the way the song progresses and the guitar chords on this track they actually feel kind of like a sunrise like you're rushing toward a hill and the Sun is coming up and shining in your face it's actually pretty beautiful in a lot of ways in its simplicity and the last track on here wedding to the you neither very sort of quiet understated subtle but beautiful ballad which is kind of the IAEA's Forte when it comes to closing out an LP there were tracks on the selfie that I like to lie especially sacrilege I didn't really find any tracks on here - you know overarch that song in terms of just impressive ideas performance and just instrumentation and and sound the other songs on here while there were some good ones most of them I would either want to steer clear of where I could just kind of take or leave I'm feeling a light - decent five on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana yeah yes forever [Music] [Music] 
TJEvrZHcEMY,Ghostface hello hi everyone Anthony Pham tan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ghostface Killah LP with Adrian young handling production really Adrian young and Ghostface Killah double-billed 12 reasons to die Ghostface Killah is a new york NC who's best known for his work and his place and his affiliation with the infamous hip-hop outfit the wu-tang clan but his musical fame is not just limited to the wu-tang clan he is actually in my opinion one of the more consistent members of the outfit when it comes to so material over the years he's put out a lot of albums that people consider to be East Coast hip-hop classics like Iron Man supreme clientele as well as fish-scale the only album in his discography that I really sort of steer clear of is ghost Dini I just that LP is just way too tender for me to tender while Ghostface Killah is last full-length LP Apollo Kids was good 12 reasons to die is undeniably a bigger and more ambitious project for one Ghostface Killah works from front to back of this album with producer Adrian young and while this guy is not a household name it is great for Ghostface to work with one producer for the duration of an entire project especially someone who is so seasoned musically the dude is a soundtrack composer multi-instrumentalist and the guy has an unquenchable thirst for these old-school B movie soundtracks that are parsed psych Rock part soul so while the album sonically is is no fish-scale in a lot of ways twelve reasons to die is just as cinematic if not more cinematic for one it's the first album that Ghostface Killah has put out in a while that tries to string together a strong narrative from beginning to end this album is coming out through a record label affiliated with another root Tang member the RZA and apparently there's a comic book that has inspired the narrative of this album or vice versa while on the surface this does completely breathe gimmick gimmick ah gimmick the album does sort of live up to this connection to the comic book with a lot of strong features from wit affiliates RZA occasionally popping in to kind of move the storyline along with some narrations Ghostface Killah 'he's very vivid and directional linear storytelling through his verses and of course adrian young's very soundtrack influenced production style these guys together definitely do not let the concept of 12 reasons to die overshadow the listening experience it enhances it instead if there is one negative about this LP though right from the get-go for people who are familiar with Ghostface Killah ghost is not exactly creative or inventive when it comes to creating this brand new character for him to kind of act out in this new album because a lot like on fish-scale Ghostface Killah finds himself again being a drugged on movin keys he's sort of the leader of an organized crime syndicate there are all these references to italian mafia culture he's showering women with jewels and money he's pulling triggers there are a lot of parallels with fish-scale on this album themes of vengeance and not being able to trust people around you and of course drugs violence all these things come up once again however it's not like these albums end the same way though toward the end of fish-scale Ghostface kind of finds himself on the top of the world but kind of regretting his life choices and seeing that the drugs that he's been selling is sort of destroying lives at least the lives of the people around him and he's kind of having this moment of clarity if anything puts 12 reasons to die above fish-scale it's that 12 reasons is way more direct with its storyline and its concept it's way more focused on the concept there are no real or detour tracks or anything like that separating away from the story that Ghostface Killah is trying to tell Ghostface Killah is a thug he's a street thug he joins with a mob mafia the DeLuca family DeLuca's he moves up in the family gets a lot of credibility he makes money then he starts a war with them separates off from them starts his own gang falls in love gets set up by this person then he is killed by the family that he started bad blood with and then shortly after he was killed he arises from the dead to exact his revenge Ghostface Killah tells this story track by track by track in his enigmatic his trademark gritty Street cipher flow super enthusiastic Ghostface Killah has this ability to spit so fast and yet hit the listener with so many things that are so freakin quickly clear there's a reason people call his rhymes ghost stories because throughout the entirety of this album you get a lot of vivid pictures of situations and characters especially his character well mostly his character there are other moments where woo affiliates come in to spit verses that are vital to the storyline like on the song center of attraction with Cappadonna he comes in and spits this very loosely flowed verse that seems like it's purposely over acted to be as if it were from just really bad b-movie or kind of hilarious especially at the end of the track where he's like oh my god you sleep his eyes man oh she's a set up jack and once Ghostface Killah rises from the dead he's back to spinning those kind of hyper violent hyper vivid very graphic almost cartoony 36 chambers esque bars where he is out to get who killed him and if there's a way to sort of imagine offing somebody it seems that Ghostface Killah does threw out all the verses on this LP but you know some people take the violence and hip hop and then you're really offended by it or they think that the MC is is super duper duper serious about it when the fact of the matter is a lot of these situations that Ghostface Killah paints it's almost just comical with how outlandish ly violent some of them are and this outlandish violence which can at times be very hilarious lasts for about the last four tracks of the album if there's any downside to the last four tracks this album is that they can get a little redundant with this hyper violence I like that the first half of this thing told this story very directly and with detail and it seemed that each track was trying to tell a different chapter where is the last part of the album the plot doesn't really seem so exact it's more a bloodbath if anything I would have loved to have heard maybe some longer tracks or some more detailed tracks where Ghostface Killah is specifically getting revenge on these twelve or so people who were a part of this family who offed him in the first place not only would that have made the album for me a little bit more interesting lyrically and conceptually but it would have made actually kind of feel and read a lot like a Tarantino film which it already kind of feels like due to the beats the Adrian young brings to the table I think my only issue with some of the tracks overall is that not only are some of the songs toward the end of the LP a little redundant but there are moments toward the beginning of the LP like the song Rises the black suits though the song does tell a pivotal part of the story it seems a little short some of the songs and I guess this album overall can be a little short for something that is supposed to be so conceptual and telling a full-length story instrumentally this album is freakin solid if you listen to the instrumentals alone with Ghostface Killah not on the tracks at all it sounds as if the beats themselves are telling a story because you have faster more intense beats that drive tracks like blood on the cobblestone that very much fit the subject matter a lot of fighting going on a lot of black market crime going on fighting with the police that track specifically has this weird funk rock blend with very fast detailed drums other tracks feature very grainy guitars sometimes there's a little bit of tremolo on there warm warm bass some eerie organs as well rich pianos with a lot of ambient noise around them if there's any issue I have with the production overall it's that the ambient noise around some of the instruments specifically the drums does take some of the beef out of the sound that the beats could have brung but still Adrian young does do a great job of taking the flaws that some of these sounds have and making an aesthetic with that making that old-school be movie soundtrack aesthetic but having enough production prowess and is sort of detail in there to make it feel like it's modern and not just shot especially as you have these female group vocals coming in singing parts of the story in this really dramatic way you have a member of the Delfonics appearing on one track which is fantastic his vocal presence on this song is not only beautiful it's eerie it totally fits Ghostface Killah style and the way that his voice is mixed and recorded it has that old-school soul music Motown vibe to it other tracks feel really glamorous with touches of strings horns what feel like tubular bells as well seriously Bravo to Adrian young whether it's some of the more instrumentally or fine tracks toward the beginning of this album or the really gritty layered boom-bap on the latter part of the LP the beats on this LP have a strong old-school hip-hop vibe but Adrian's compositional prowess adds a strong musicality to a lot of these instrumentals so I really loved listening to this album I would definitely recommend it to a hip-hop fan to a wu-tang fan I'm pretty much feeling a strong a to a like 9 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it Ghostface Killah Adrian young twelve reasons to die forever

D3ZoR4mwdnw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kurt Vile LP neo on a pretty days Kurt Vile is a Philadelphia guitar player and singer songwriter who first started gaining momentum in the late 2000s on a wave of popularity for lo-fi and home recorded music though the album constant hit maker in 2008 was not Vile's first LP it was an album where you could hear him moaning in on the sound that he would refine on later releases now this LP in particular had a lot of just bare simple indie folk tunes that sometimes were very straightforward and minimal and other times very psychedelic layered and hazy that more psychedelic side of vials musical persona was growing as he put out more releases until about 2010 when he really sort of had his first big breakthrough with the album smoke ring for my halo an album that I did not review the year it came out mostly because of just some very strong negative reactions to a few characteristics for one though I did like that the production was very sort of lush and and hazy and very psychedelic it made a lot of the songs feel so uniform throughout and on top of that I didn't really feel all that much love for vile as a lyricist though I haven't always been impressed with vile stuff once I dig a little bit deeper into it I've always thought that there is a certain charm to his slow tone down drawl doubt vocals style he always tries to surround himself with the most vibrant sounds that he can and his voice sort of explains things as he's singing in an inflection that's reminiscent of someone like Lou Reed I like these things about Kurt's style but there are times when I listen to his music and I feel like he keeps his lyrics his song structures and his melodies ultra ultra simple just for the sake of maintaining this style and maintaining this vibe this very sort of psychedelic homogenous vibe that is really only interesting on a surface level and even though that sort of lucid and very subdued vibe contain this new LP as well anyway Kurt kind of turns a new leaf and becomes surprisingly ambitious on a lot of these tracks on this 70 minute album I change some of the psychedelic haze gets put on the back burner with some of these tracks in favor of some stopping baselines a little bit of cowbell some very sharp guitar leads and phrasing it's definitely reminiscent of artists like Bruce Springsteen or even Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers this is especially true of a track like Cavey crimes where the guitar phrasing on this song feels almost like arena rock guitars but of course they're sort of very lightly distorted and modestly played but the bass line man it really struts out there on this track locked in step with the drums like it is the of the walk the song shame chamber too is one of the catchiest and most concise songs Kurt Vile has written yet really stepping beyond the psychedelic sounds and writing a song that feels really really confident strong hook strong riffing and a very clear emotional message coming through on the lyrics and on the song snowflakes are dancing it feels like some of Kurt's old ideas are being revitalized to be something way more straightforward and just sharp some very Neil Young inspired chords on this song the song is kind of psychedelic and the drums behind this track really punched through the A's and drive this song confidently which is kind of an idea a style that Kurt has explored on previous tracks as well as in the band the war on drugs Kurt's voice is front Center on this song too he is a very convincing vocalist in my opinion not necessarily the best singer in the world but he's very sincere in a lot of his songs my only issue with this track though is I'm not really in love with some of the lyrics snowflakes are dancing discman is pumping headphones are loud chilling on a pillowy cloud while you're at it add some Doritos and a bike it and some slippers or a cup of chamomile tea you know honestly when it comes to lyrics I'm not incredibly picky I don't need a lot of flowery language if you're a longtime viewer of my reviews you may know at this point that I don't even really dwell over leer that often but there are some times where I feel like the lyrics are unag Nora belong the song because they come off as just being so vapid like on the song too hard where Kurt seems to be making all these promises just out of nowhere he promises to smoke less he promises to do his best for his God in his country he promises not to party too hard then later into the song he says that a man has to hold tight to the heart of the matter at hand and you know I agree throughout this track Kurt makes a lot of promises to himself or someone else I'm not sure and just a lot of agreeable statements about maybe life or just his philosophy but it doesn't really seem like it's pointing to anything thankfully the production and the instrumentation is gorgeous it's just kind of disappointing to see how beautiful the sounds and just the instrumentation is on this album its blissful it's heavenly but then some of the lyrics just are so plain this is the case as well the song was all talked recur kind of falls back into his old ways by writing a song that sonically feels pretty homogeneous from beginning to end the production is slightly more lush than the stuff from smoke ring and I do like that the song is a little hypnotic but Kurt spits out this one line where he's like makin music is easy watch me if that was the point Kurt was trying to prove it this song I agree I feel the same way about the song err but to with how homogeneous it feels from beginning to end not quite so bad there are some very fast since that pop in and out of this track that I like again these are not really terrible songs in my opinion I just feel like they could be more interesting especially with what Kurt brings vocally thankfully that's really it for the songs on here that I feel sort of indifferent toward other tracks on here the vast majority of the tracks on here I actually think are great like the opening track on this thing the nine-minute not a pretty day a really awesomely grooving and sublime full rocker sharp guitar leads all over this thing cut through the psychedelic haze I love the stop that they do in the middle of this track the sort of segue that they play into immediately after the feels almost linear skynyrd inspired the song girl called Alex appeals to me as well in a lot of the same ways the song never run away is one of the sharpest singles Kurt Vile has written yet one of the shorter songs on this LP really catchy refrain verses with a lot of momentum being driven by some rhythm guitar just very punchy drums and another track I love on this LP the 10-minute clothes are gold-tone which is a spot on this album where Kurt again goes back into that sort of personal musing mode of his where he's giving a lot of personal thoughts feelings but on this song they come off in a way that feels sort of reasoned or sensible in a way that the listener can actually relate or just understand brokers coming from he says right at the beginning of the song that when he gets into his zone he gets into this mental state where if you saw him it would seem as if he is high so he says in the song he's never touched this stuff then he goes on to say this personal pain that he feels he tries to basically exorcise it get rid of it dump it through creating gold tones just pretty sounding music sounds that he feels are beautiful or sweet which to me says a lot about the makeup of this album philosophically and musically it's basically a behind-the-scenes look at Kurt's mental state when he goes into the songwriting process but aside from the mental state of this track the instrumental is beautiful as well again a sublime instrumental closing out this album I'm absolutely in love with the instrumentation on this thing it is so lovely is there vibraphone on this track it is so pretty with that the acoustic guitar the bass the drums the vocals they all blend together into yet another haze and yes there is a lot of haze on this album but there's a lot of detail and lushness to the haziness i mean it's all just so dense and detailed and that's what I really love about this LP though I don't think this is a perfect album it is Kurt Vile best yet and there is reason to believe that his next album could be even better because up until this point with every new release Kurt Vile has improved upon what he did before he shows more more ambition every year and even though I haven't been a huge fan of Curt vials for a majority of his career that does make me excited for the future I'm feeling a light eight on the selfie if you've given to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh all down a pretty days forever [Music] [Music] 
paeXfCrBNqs,hi Anthony hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new phosphorescent LP muchacho phosphorescent is the musical project of singer-songwriter guitar player Mathew hall he has six following albums under his belt all of which sit under the umbrella of neo folk indie folk all country as well as Americana the student is a singer-songwriter through and through and a lot of the early releases to come out of this project have more of a sort of raw tangible sound to the instrumentation sort of lo-fi and recording quality but still pretty mellow and having a lot of emotional vulnerability and this sense of mellowness really took over the bands of music in a huge way especially in 2010 word even showed up in the album title of the LP here's to taking it easy now there are a lot of different ways to play folk music and country music but it seems that these sweeter and more pleasant sounds in these genres are what really sort of speaks to Mathieu artistically yet he tops a lot of this heavenly Americana instrumentation with this warbly voice of his that is very pleasant as well but also maybe a little sad now the band's latest LP muchacho is no less easygoing than much of anything else they've put out in recent years I would actually say it's just as easygoing but it sort of goes about capturing this vibe in a different way because glistening reverb kind of psychedelic and pristine production is essentially the game changer on muchacho I wouldn't necessarily call muchacho a safe record but it is certainly a friendly record a record that is sure not to offend much of anybody it's quite pretty a lot of the time the lead vocals often have harmonies behind them the production melts them together and soars them above the instrumentation and the instrumentation itself is often very soft del like it and and joyous as well as far as Matthew's lyrical content goes a lot of what he says seems to kind of revolve around the same Americana type tropes evil good the devil love being downtrodden emotionally instrumentally a lot of the same sort of culprits show up on this record bass guitars drums vocals maybe a little bit of horn a little bit of string as well as some lap steel very funky and familiar chord progressions all over this LP a lot of which seem to be rooted back in traditional American music much like the track on this LP muchachos tune which is a waltz in three four three four waltz with very bouncy keyboards echoing out nicely guitars that wander up and down scales plinky pianos and though it's all playing at a tempo it's also distant there's so much space in between all the instrumentation it's as if it's all kind of like one small atom and everything is kind of rotating very loosely around this one idea and though Matthews voice doesn't exactly cut through the reverb in a really aggressive or or very ear catching way some of the things he says can be very poetic very sharp been  up Shepard to Lamb like wave to the sand and the very uplifting horns toward the end of this track this song has a very strong strong sense of romance to it another track I really dig on this LP is song for Zula it's one of the longest songs on this LP and maybe one of the sharpest and most passionate as well there's some great string arrangements on this track the bass instrumentation is really reverb din glassy Matthews vocals have a really striking and memorable vocal melody to them and not only that but his lyrics seem to be a little more audible on this track than they are on others it's like there are moments on this LP where he is super impressed with his own lyricism and he wants to make sure that everyone hears it and there are some pretty interesting lyrics on this track where you singing about love disfiguring him into something that he's not recognizing or another line where he's saying that he is not going to struggle or stand to be acknowledged by his gnarled hands there are a lot of themes of just loving unconditionally rejection desperation and maybe I think a little bit of pride that comes up in this song in a really interesting way and another one of my favorite tracks on this LP is the longest the seven-minute quotidian beasts I really like that the band sort of ventures out into a jam on this track it is a strong Americana flavor jam there's a real hard groove to this track despite how pleasant and sort of reverb the production is on this song however I will say that this is one of the moments where I feel like something a little bit clearer and a little bit meteor would have been more interesting it actually sounds more like a one microphone live recording of the band just performing in the moment very far away from the stage the microphone that is sometimes the CRP production masks what could have been a good song even though I do think Matthew is a good singer capable singer he's a good lyricist as well when he wants to display it he doesn't exactly have the boldest voice or demeanor it also doesn't help that many of the melodies that he sings follow very closely in roots music footsteps maybe Matthew is sort of hoping longtime fans will follow phosphorescent up until this point and sort of fill in the gaps that are being created with all of this reverb that is being laid onto this LP because I think sometimes the reverb on these songs can hide more than it enhances this combined with a few tracks on here that are maybe not so pointed or well written this album can at times feel sort of say me say me the song right on right on while the track does bring a different vibe to the table it's essentially the album's rocker average guitar noodling this stomp strutting bass line to it I like the minimal percussion to the song is very simple and I just like that the band took a kind of stripped-down Velvet Underground kind of approach to this song but Matthew doesn't exactly display the kind of charm and and swagger to pull this sort of song off I really sort of sway between being really enthralled by these songs and being really underwhelmed by these songs as I sort of trip through this album from front to back some tracks on here have a strong melody and personality to and others it seems like the very pleasant production and just soft instrumentation are the only real positives I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana phosphorescent you 
dLSyfSJ00VQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new oh C's album floating coffin VOCs is a San Francisco garage rock outfit of the lo-fi persuasion that I've been following for a while now since like 2008 and though garage rock is definitely at this band's stylistic roots there are very clear elements of noise rock psychedelic and experimental folk and psychedelic rock - sort of bubbling within the OCS or a noisy cacophonous rock music the band is pretty prolific with an ever growing discography under their belts sometimes putting out two albums within a year span of time and though I did enjoy a lot of their early output there was a moment a few years back where I became just ever so slightly disillusioned by the o'seas music over time the band's production and just recording grew more and more brittle and just noisy and trebled for me it was difficult to hear interesting song ideas and riff ideas shining through all of the guitar distortion and the ear piercing echoed vocals still the band is really noisy they're colorful they're undeniably energetic they can really freakin rock a groove sort of blame it out in the way that a band like the fall may you can really sort of get lost in the momentum of their songs was last year when I heard Putra fires - that I kind of got back into the bands music a little bit more and wanted to just sort of see what they were up to and on this record though they did keep a lot of their usual garage rock sounds I heard them incorporating just a little bit more string work I heard just more tunes shining through with more clarity in the production - not quite so brittle and just noise ridden this did make me excited to listen to the band's next full-length LP and for sure floating coffin is nowhere near the OCS most distorted or noisy release there is quite a bit of clarity on this LP some heaviness - to the bass especially when the band is going at a slower pace on some of these songs where they maybe get a little sludgy but still the changes the OCS make to their sound on this LP to me are very very few overall floating coffin is the OCS back to their old tricks once again for sure this band has something really really special when it comes to rocking your freaking face off I think even really cynical listeners can at least see the appeal of moments on this LP like the opening track from the mountain the pummeling drums the noisy burning guitar leads on this thing the fevered vocals of course all these shouts of whoo and these quirky synthesizers too the song is fast furious and it's fun and I think the next track on this LP is pretty appealing too it's one of the slower songs I've ever heard the band done and the guitar riff on this thing is just buzz it's heavy it's mid paced it's a beefy ass riff grimy filthy garage rock vibes all over this thing this noisy riff kind of dies down and gives way to a quieter version of it the band starts laying some interesting guitar leads on top of it starts harmonizing them a little bit with vocals they sort of like to throw a louder version and a softer version of the same riff at the listener and build a song structure on that as opposed to having legitimately contrasting verses and choruses or just a really strong a lot of character director the title track on this LP has this incessant chromatic bassline that is just so repetitively boring and there are these redundant four note falsetto vocals that pop in it again this is a moment where the band has great fantastic energy and they are loud as hell but it's not really that much of a song and I find it weird that these moments aren't really appealing to me that much I do like jams usually I like hearing a band play together I like hearing interplay I like hearing momentum but I don't really think they have much of anything else beyond that because the band rarely showcases the kind of flashy playing or really the intensity or the kind of melodies that would make these songs a little bit more dynamic layered interesting the song strawberries one and two sort of breaks this typical song structure and introduces a new riff idea partway into the song but still the the melody on this track isn't really that strong the playing isn't that strong either the guitar chords seem very Sammy Sammy it's like a lot of the tracks on this album are based on half-baked improv the rest of the LP just kind of continues following this suit it's a riff idea riff idea riff idea riff idea but song ideas kind of come second a lot of the songs on this up here loud and they're exciting but not a single minute of any of them really sticks with me even immediately after I've listened to them I can't figure out whether or not what's playing in my head after I listened to an OC song is what I've just heard or me just sort of unconsciously making up something that sounds like what I just heard Nana Nana Nana Nana Nana da da that did aside from the surprising flute on the song tunnel time I think the only moment on the back end of this LP that I liked was the closing track miniature which was the track initially that I heard from the album that got me excited to listen to this thing in the first place now the track isn't amazingly written but it is a legitimate song in comparison with many of the other tracks on here it has a verse it has of course it has audible lyrics and the vocals sing a melody that's kind of memorable the guitar chords jut into the track very quaintly I guess and there's some strings backing the song too that are very nice the hook swells on this thing I like the female background vocals and the melody that the strings play on this track is really airy and angular I like it if every melody on every track here was was this sharp or at least every track incorporated a melody that was this sharp somewhere into the jam this would have been a pretty interesting album instead a lot of these tracks just seemed like very basic dime-a-dozen guitar riffs of the garage rock variety that play out for two to four minutes until the band just sort of has played them loud played them soft played them loud again and then play them soft and then it's kind of choose your own adventure from there like I said earlier there are some things I like about the OCS in general and this record to the Bands energy is just their their ferocity their noisiness and the recording on this LP but not much of this album is memorable and that's because the band doesn't really write the songs to be memorable honestly so I'm pretty much feeling the light too decent five on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh oh cease forever you 
UO3iVVkcf9A,ghost hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ghost LP in infest assume ghost or ghost BC is a Swedish traditional doom metal slash heavy metal slash hard rock outfit and this is their highly anticipated sophomore LP very anticipated by me and much of the metal community since the hype died down from their very very popular full-length debut opus eponymous for the most part the band plays this old-school style of heavy metal that has a strong strong occult vibe Blue Oyster Cult and Black Sabbath influences aside opus eponymous had some characteristics that made it a pretty odd modern metal release the album is incredibly hooky and in melodic and not in a very technical way or a way that is alienating to your average music listener their course is all over this album that just buried themselves deep within the brain songs like ritual as well as Eliza Beth and in comparison with other frontmen out there these days ghosts vocalists is really one of the most agreeable metal singers out there not really having anything too sharp or abrasive or just aggressive about the way that he sings his voice is incredibly friendly at times kind of smooth if there's anything that's sour about it can at times be eerie the only thing that is overtly off-putting about ghosts music are these strong dark and and satanic messages that come through in the lyrics and they display these things in a really theatrical way not quite as torturous as some bands that seem to take these themes a bit more seriously despite all of these issues this album took the metal world by storm however I have to admit I'm not really enjoying the sophomore full length as much it is very clear that ghost shoots for some really ambitious changes on this new LP but not all of them add a prose for the most part it's it's a lot of cons for one this record was recorded in a new studio on a new record label with a brand new budget and it definitely shows and shows up in ways that on paper would seem like a really good thing like for one there's all these huge monstrous gothic choruses that pop up occasionally on these tracks bringing this huge sense of epicness the songs overall on this LP are longer there are more guitar solos some more instrumental passages more movements to the songs more layers of guitar more layers of background vocals synthesizers come through in a big way on a lot of these tracks on this LP no question ghost is sounding thicker they're sounding more detailed they're sounding more fleshed out but all of these additions have created some really glaring issues in my eyes it's sort of distracted ghost away from songwriting and hooks which was the best thing opus eponymous had going for it and instead they're turning their eyes toward things that aren't necessarily their strengths like pulling together these sort of epic instrumental moments which has never really been one of the best qualities of the band mostly due to how stiff some of the guitar playing can be on their records as a fan of opus eponymous I can admittedly say that the four minute closing instrumental on the album is really one of the weakest points on the entire LP so I'm a lot of these tracks the band is showcasing this instrumental and compositional power that they don't particularly have and on top of that all of these added about bells and whistles and sounds and and choral vocals they all add to this sense of hokey Nastase they were close to being maybe a little over the edge with it but like I said earlier the songwriting and just that strong eerie vibe that they had made up for it certainly there are spots on this LP where ghost is able to take these choral vocals this newfound detail these longer song lengths and pull them together with a really good tune the song Body and Blood sticks out to me as a song like that it's a very very eerie ballad lots of guitar leads interjecting between chorus lines on this track it's just so freakin dark and cultish and successfully blends the sound that you typically expect from ghosts with some ideas that feel sort of psych rock inspired and progressive rock inspired however it's really the song Year Zero that I think is able to maintain the most focus with all of these new additions it's a great song that gallops away valiantly with this monstrous gothic chorus right at the start of the song great verses great choruses a really fantastic guitar solo toward the end of the track with some tubular bells chiming away epically it's a huge ending with a really dreary outro right on the tail end of the track it's just a full package deal these awesome choral vocals also show up on the very melodic closing track on this album another favorite on the LP for me to me these are just highlights on the album some of my favorite moments and and really tracks that I'm happier there because it gives me at least some level of faith that the next album will be better and maybe whatever issues I have with this LP will kind of be smoothed out by them it songs like idolatry which really kind of get me cringing the song is just littered with these inexplicably wimpy guitar riffs and schmaltzy organs and I can't really put my finger on it because the vocals sound roughly the same as they do on other tracks here but on this particular song I just feel like I'm listening to some really bad bark of herb and the vocals just don't really have that eerie vibe on this song that they do on others they just sound kind of silly on this track the song just kind of sounds like this really old bad psych pop single that would have never ever ever seen the light of day if it had been written in the 60s for me this track really sort of steps over a line and I just can't believe that the band didn't see it especially with the terrible falsetto is all over this song and they sound even worse when they're harmonized one of the lead singles off of this LP secular haze also crosses this line for sounding like it was conceived underneath the circus tent these same obnoxious scents dampen a perfectly good vibe on the song per aspera the song Kiki gollu is another track that just sounds like really had heavy psychedelic rock that would have been better if the instruments were actually played with any guts but there none because they're not and there's not really a particularly interesting song on this track just sort of a guitar riff that's supposed to have some momentum maybe it just falls flat and feels hokey and I have to say I was pretty disappointed for the most part with the longest track on this LP gulen zombie queen sure it's ambitious the man is trying to write a longer song something that's gonna feel epic but the slow melodic intro without that strong compositional power there the moment at which the song starts just feels kind of boring and when the band finally kicks in and starts bringing some power to the song the drums pop in the guitars pop in synthesizers pop in baby it just sounds like a really bad surf pop tune blending surf with metal is something that I've heard before in bands like ghoul for example but even they maintain some level of badassness as they're doing it whereas ghost just sounds ridiculous the huge climax at the end of this track is really the songs only redeeming value for me overall I was just not feeling this LP was really really sort of let down by it I feel like ghosts really let their budget and let their ambition blind them from just writing good Tunes for sure all these additional elements could have been added to the recipe to make it fantastic it happens on this album with songs like Year Zero but rarely do the stars all aligned in this way on these songs there are moments where just all these additional things block the song from even shining through and there are moments where ghost is really sort of trying to put forward a hard rock and psychedelic rock influenced riff that just doesn't have any real balls on it overall I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this album if you've given the listen what did you think of it did you like this album did you hate it why here's another opinion don't listen to this guy over here I listened to this album the vocals wrecked the guitars wrecked the big voices wrecked in the key Birds rats Anthony Fantan Oh ghost forever [Music] 
7_OZ4Bsyipk,Hey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Big KRIT mixtape free album collection of tracks thing a king or king remembered in time Big KRIT is a Mississippi rapper and producer known for his very personal lyrics detailed Southern Fried beats catchy hooks and versatility these strengths of his have given him a lot of visibility a lot of exposure outside of the Mississippi area over the past few years with his breakthrough mixtape scrit was here as well as return of forever and his forever in a day free mixtape slash kind of concept album as well as his full-length commercial debut live from the underground on Def Jam Records which actually made it to number one on the charts which was a pretty big step up for Big KRIT at least in terms of music industry noticeability he had some pretty large features and ambitious features on this LP featuring people like BB King as well as 2 Chainz and this bigger budget definitely showed up in crit's production as well with guest singers horns guitars their smooth soulful music samples though it is easily my least favorite of his recent projects still proved to me that he could put out a big-budget album on a major record label but still come out with a series of tracks that didn't cheapen his style his direction or just his sound in general and maybe that partially has to do with the interesting position that Big KRIT is in in the world of hip hop right now he's one of the few MCS that is so versatile he can put together bangin catchy very hook heavy singles but also turn around and do something that's really a motive or vulnerable personal socially conscious as well the fact that he can wear many different hats as he is making songs and not sound like a fool when he's doing one or the other is a big help to him and it's the guys rapping style in his production that sort of adds this very solid base underneath every narrative he tries to string together on a given LP that brings the consistency that I guess sort of makes it all believable when it comes to changing the sound of his rapping or his production style crit is very much about slow and steady wins the race however as crit has continued to release music it seems like maybe a little bit more and more he is recycling and reframing a lot of the catchphrases that he uses in previous tracks song topics and themes euphemisms flows when he's rapping as well as maybe grooves and in synth lines and his beats and looking back on all the big crits recent albums now it's become kind of apparent that many of his full lengths flow in roughly the same way and Creek pretty much carries that redundancy on to this new LP as well because between a lot of the tracks here he rounds many many familiar basis in terms of song themes and where certain songs of certain emotions are placed at certain points in the album for one on the cell P there's the track king without a crown which is very hard-hitting essentially it is a personal determination anthem of which there are a lot of that pop up at the beginning of crit's full-lengths however this one is incredibly well done and there's no reason to sort of throw it away just because there are a few songs out there right now that may be sort of telling the same story as it but this version being a little more updated because crit right now is that a different part in his career than he was two or three albums ago on this track he does manage to rehash some lines that have appeared on previous releases like what's a king without a crown what's the car without some sound and I'm not sure if I was totally feeling the line split in the peach fruit ninja' the song shine on is sort of a hard grooving the slow and chilled kick off of the album which crate has definitely done before and the vibe that saw meditate goes for as well will be familiar to crit fans it is a slow burner where crits singing vocals are right at the forefront although this is in my opinion is definitely one of the best songs that he done in this angle because of how melodic and detailed the beat is I love the guitar on this track as well as the jazz vibraphone very pretty I also like the lyrical angle that this track takes with just vices crit has some other interesting messages on this LP as well later in the album where typically the more highfalutin deep tracks are placed the song banana clip theory is an interesting track about somebody who has a gun for protection mostly but of course there comes a time where he acted irresponsibly with it and then he's dealing with sort of the aftermath and the regret that can come with making the mistake of pulling the trigger at the wrong time or at the wrong person or just for the wrong reason the song multi till the Sun die is another one of these tracks right at the end of the album where quick kind of checks his mental state his status and music his personal life and this is really one of the most epic tracks that he has done in this vein yet a lot of these songs especially ones like the vent tend to be very sort of sad and introspective this one just as introspective but really sort of triumphant and it should be considering where crit is right now in his career nice work on the sample there too even though there are times where crit sort of approaches structuring an album like doing a mad lib or something okay we need something sad in this slot we need something upbeat in this slide he does manage to put himself into some interesting situations on this album like with the song REM which very successfully I will say samples the James Blake song the Wilhelm scream he flips this sample perfectly and he does it in a way that doesn't feel too cheesy or in a way that is just sort of hamming up the James Blake sample a little bit too much he raps over this sample very well he chops parts of it and adds pianos keyboards to make some really nice verses for the instrumental and this is just another track where it seems to be getting kind of personal very personal where his dreams really sort of fueled a lot of passion in him on previous tracks he really takes this Blake sample and and creates a theme where he seems to sort of fear his dreams or be doubtful about them right now especially with the line on this track where he feels like he has sort of disappointed fans with his recent output considering how some of the reactions to life from the underground were sort of negative the song served this royalty is essentially a love song for cred which isn't the first time he's done something like this but not quite so much in this angle or with this sort of passion on this track he really seems to be desperately sort of looking for some kind of companionship throwing in all of this imagery of Kings and royalty in there with the storyline and he manages to sample a Cody chestnut track which was recently sampled by the underachievers on their indigo is a mixtape I have to say at the end of the day underachievers did the sample more justice adding some more interesting drums but they both roughly go about pulling this track apart in a lot of the same ways it just happens that Chris sampled a completely different vocal part from the song and build his narrative around that the song good together there's another surprise for it it's sort of another love song and has a very nice vocal contribution from Ashton Jones and what makes this song so surprising is how just upbeat and just bright and flamboyant it is it's a really kind of peppy neo-soul track with just very dynamic vocals jumping all over the place feels sort of like a janelle monae song janelle I think would have pushed it into maybe slightly more eccentric territory where as when crit's doing it on this track it feels maybe just slightly a little hokey now the final five tracks on this LP are incredibly solid some of kraits best material to come toward the end of an album the song what the is really one of his most intense lyrical endeavors yet his flow and his delivery on this track is fantastic and the song life is a gamble is an interesting track where crit is really sort of dealing with people taking Gamble's with their lives trying to get ahead weighing the risks and and dealing with the sadness of seeing people have to because of the choices that they've made and surprisingly he raps over a ninth wonder beat on this song it's the middle of this LP where things run really thin in terms of fresh or interesting ideas the middle of this LP is some of crits weakest weakest straightforward stuff the song just last week which features future and and that feature alone is enough to get some Big KRIT fans freaking out it's such a letdown critz flow on this track is incredibly dumbed down the beat is really really basic and doesn't even have an interesting sample and the lyrics are incredibly below crits potential and the thing is future isn't even the worst thing about this song his presence isn't even really strong on this track and I don't know why kripp didn't want to flesh this song out it says just last week featuring future snippet in the title it's almost as if midway through the song realized it was a bad idea and just stopped but wanted to put it on the album anyway the song my trunk while it's not my subpart 3 it kind of feels like it it has a roaring guitar and a pretty detailed beat but again I'm getting more lyrics that are sort of below crits potential this song feels to Sammy Sammy alike other tracks I've heard from him already and the trinidad james' feature is just not saving the track either the song essentially kind of feels like reheated leftovers as well as the song only one that has Smoke DZA and Wiz Khalifa on it the beast sorta reminds me of the song time machine and there are some pretty corny lyrics on this track - like with Wiz Khalifa sticking to his cheese like a microwave and Big KRIT actually getting me to sort of turn the gears in my mind about the inner workings of a squirter which is something I think Danny Brown would have done a whine about way better the song how you love that feels kind of below crits potential - in terms of production and lyrics there's just a serious dry spot in the middle of the sound that gets me down overall though this is still just a handful of tracks the beginning of this album is relatively solid the end is fantastic this albums really enjoyable crit does put his heart on his sleeve on a lot of these tracks again he brings great production but the stress sure that he approaches building albums with is getting a little stale and some of the song concepts that he does can be a little too referential or just obvious rehashes of previously produced songs at times though I do like this album a little bit more than life from the underground I do think crate was kind of resting on his laurels on this LP and not really pushing himself as consistently as he has on previous projects I do know crit is more creative than this and I'm gonna look forward to seeing that creativity flourish a little bit more on future projects I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Big KRIT forever [Music] [Music] 
1f06pXojMmQ,mm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for like a quickie review video where i talk about some songs and albums that have been meaning to touch down on but haven't yet video thing let's do it first swedish post-punk act Holograms have a new track out called flesh-and-bone new LP on the way on captured tracks the track is great way more layered and detailed than some of the stuff on their debut LP which I also thought was really good it's a solid track loved it also the Connecticut indie rock and emo band the world is a beautiful place and I am no longer afraid to die as a new track out called Beverly Wyatt you can stream it on our website the needle drop calm it is one of four tracks on a four-way split coming out soon on top shelf records and run for cover records which also features code orange kids Tigers Jaw as well as self-defense family also Mississippi rapper Big KRIT has a new mixtape out called King remembered in time download it that's all I got to say Scottish experimental hip-hop outfit young fathers have announced their second full-length LP on anti Conner records already but they have dropped another track from it called I heard the release date is now set in June for the record and while this track is not necessarily a straightforward hip-hop type ordeal it is actually a very sort of pretty moving ballad though very reverb and distant electronic music duo tonight has a new track out called acrylics and it's a banger maybe not their best and most eccentric thus far but it does hit hard and another thing that hits hard the new Queens of the Stone Age Jack my guys the Sun oh my god josh homme me me home but oh mom hi mama I'm a man win when guitar leads at the opening of this thing are like totally marvel to ask and once the riff kicks in it's just oh and the hook on this thing my god is the Sun it's pretty epic blood pumping you know what there are ton of tracks and stuff that came out this week the new G's Z track Shmuel came out with some new songs as well I'm just going to shove it all down there in the description box it's all going in the description box let's get into albums the new black angels LP indigo meadow these guys are a few albums deep at this point on this new album they're kind of a garage psychedelic rock revivalist outfit but huge throwback and they tend to on this record and a lot of their records sort of sit in the more eerie side of this genre and I do like that the mix on this thing is heaviest hell the vocals are pretty solid these guys definitely know their way around a hook as well the band is good at tastefully recreating a lot of old classic rock tropes from groups like The Doors some early Pink Floyd stuff as well these guys are certainly preservationist stew the highest degree I can exactly call this album exciting or or adventurous or anything like that in my opinion though you know still well recorded solid if you're into this kind of genre you're a die-hard for it give it a listen the new wire LP change becomes us this is the latest full-length album from classic art rock post punk outfit wire actually an interesting release for longtime fans collectors just nerds for this sort of genre because the band is recording what was I guess at the time sort of unreleased or really sort of unrecorded material from the late 70s and early 80s so there are quite a few tracks on this record that do sound like chairs missing and 154 arrow wire and certainly the vibe of wires early 80s era stuff comes through really strong with some danceable post-punk beats synthesizers but continually wire with their newest releases just aren't really impressing me that much when it comes to Colin Newman's vocals which to me just don't feel as passionate or as thrilling as they used to and on another album the band returns to this very booming compressed suffocating kind of production that in a lot of ways compliments their louder and more aggressive tracks on this album and other albums that they have put out recently but comes to the slower and more delicate tracks I would say it is not just feeling or sound and all that great the new church is EP recover the recover EP these guys are a synth-pop project with an indie flair mostly getting a ton of hype right now off of a hit single that is actually titled after this EP recover which is a fantastically written track really sharp hook very sweet female vocals nice melody on this thing I love the glistening atmospheric production but the beefy bass on this thing as well it's just got a lot of texture and is incredibly hooky that song is so good it's worth getting it out on an EP or a single or anything ASAP but as far as the other songs on this thing you have some remixes and a couple other originals the second track on here which sort of has a male lead vocal feels much less enthralling than the vocal delivery that was sort of given to us on the first track it's just to me in my opinion way less passionate way less engaging it feels almost sort of lethargic in comparison of the vocal that we're hearing on the first track and the third original that we're getting on this EP which wasn't bad by any stretch but was really sort of drowned out in 80s nostalgia which to me was a bit of a disappointment considering what I think is so great about the song recovers that it sounds so futuristic in a way Tara mellows xed out these guys are a math rock indie rock outfit their third full-length album right here I've never really been the biggest fan of them however on their last full-length LP I did find the plane to be so impressive that of course it would have been worth it to at least check out this new album and see if they were I guess sort of writing songs in a way that would click with me a little bit more and of course the very tight guitars and drums that are typically on a Tara Melos LP are here maybe feeling a little bit more straightforward at times maybe sort of going for something a bit more driving and kind of I guess her straight into the point actually found some of the guitar playing on this album to be a little more groove oriented and kind of gutsy which which was a cool thing I just ended up being disappointed by a couple different things though the vocals on many of these tracks were just almost completely inaudible or when I could hear them they felt so lifeless and just lacking in passion that I really saw a reason for them to be there and I just didn't really care for the mix on this thing either the drums felt so distant when I thought they could have given the record just a little bit more punch and the guitars on this thing are blaring just so brightly and and so aggressively that it was like almost kind of sort of giving me a headache and I like lightning bolt still I like the fact that the band can pump out these flashy grooves and and even though they may be technical and maybe different they play them some naturally just vibes really well but in terms of the vocals the recording on this thing and just a lot of the songwriting I'm still not a huge Terra bellows fan and the new Depeche Mode LP Delta Machine and pretty much on this record and I actually have to say him I'm pretty happy to see new records come out from some of my favorite bands and synth pop a new wave just of all time all in one year new order Depeche Mode OMD as well and I think this record basically Depeche Mode comes through and proves that they're still capable songwriters capable song producers the sound of this thing is very modern and yet the band does a fantastic job of just sort of recapturing that vintage synth pop sound when things felt so cold and robotic and the only thing you were going to get humanity from in the music was the vocals which of course still have that Depeche Mode very sort of moody mood to them there are some really great ballads on this LP to like the song heaven however some of the more upbeat and punchy er tracks on this record I just felt like I could sort of take or leave a lot of them by no means as a threat or sort of revolutionary or anything like I said it pretty much proves that the band is just still capable at making their sound work in the in the modern age I guess you could say and those are the records and songs that I sort of wanted to talk about this week thanks for watching Anthony Fantana albums quickies forever

listen to this record and then play chess as you're listening to it with someone else I'm guessing what Jimi Hendrix's hey Joe is getting a new single release on Record Store Day as is the Cure's KissMe 12-inch which I understand has been out of print on vinyl for nearly a decade also Daniel Johnston's fund will be back on a 12-inch which is a huge favorite in his discography for a lot of

real right now also mercury red deserted songs a bunch of demos sort of rough recordings of songs that were on there classic seminal album deserter songs Steve Moore from zombie horror business doing

Record Store Day forever 
7VLIVkZyCgY,Mack pepper stand - hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new mecha verse can album - these guys are a Swedish rock outfit this is their second full-length LP obviously and on this album they're doing a little bit of a tweak to their sound their debut full-length was chock full of punk in Iraq and post-punk influences hectic guitars and drums and all this sonic chaos was sliced through by the band's very sharp voiced lead singer Maya Milner and Milner's voice still kind of cuts its way through to the front row on this album but it's not through incredibly distorted guitars on this LP the band still has a lot of gutsy punk energy just look at the refrain on the opening track on this album which is essentially but this time what Milner is sort of singing through on this album is reverb it's sort of noisy / jangly guitars cat6 style melodies the attitude and the distortion is most definitely still there but it's replaced with the kind of songwriting that influences other modern bands like the panes being pure at heart now even though this band is kind of a few years behind the revival of this kind of stuff back around 2009 they still sound really great doing it and it's nice to kind of hear a group take this kind of rock songwriting this kind of rock and pop songwriting and add a bit of noisiness to it be kind of feisty with it a lot like some of the older more noise pop oriented bands in this style used to like the shop assistants or black tambourine because of the straightforwardness and the melody and just the speed and the energy of the span throughout this album a lot of tracks on this LP are incredibly catchy the opener anti bus or the song asleep which comes right after which is just as infectious not so much fun actually a little bit sweeter a lot of tracks on this LP are kind of the perfect combination of sadness angst eNOS but also in in-your-face attitude and on top of that very sharp blissful melodies that make me kind of want to run outside and spin around in circles staring up at the Sun not caring just being very unfortunately a lot of the guitar strumming patterns and chord progressions do play into those jangle pop stereotypes but for the most part the band is entertaining and catchy enough to sort of make this quality ignore I guess another major issue for me on this LP is is Maya even though she sings very well on a lot of these tracks her transition from being kind of this punk heroine to someone who was really sort of singing some ballads or just some pop tunes on this album she I guess is a little too overbearing with the sharpness of her voice this is most definitely the case on songs like slowly sinking as well as something more but there are some points on this album where I do feel like the band does make some of these pretty songs intentionally ugly they do bring a an element of gruffness to some of them like the songs outshine and no mercy which both at certain points on the tracks have guitar leads that toss in all sorts of wonky or too sour notes to kind of just muck up what the song is trying to do musically and plus this long drama wind Maya's vocals also sort of reaching her upper register on this track but they come off way more pleasant not so much I like that this track in comparison with others on here is kind of a slow jam has that 60s to do to epic drumbeat quality to it heavy guitar chords pounding and ringing out and there are some points on this album where Maya's abrasive voice does sort of work in her favor when she's singing something really sad or just angry like on the track no mercy which I mentioned earlier where one of the refrains on this track right before the chorus she's seen me when I was 17 yeah I mean she sounds absolutely Oh pissed on this track and not only is the song really catchy with its melody and guitar leads but like I said it's moments like this where her brashness really sort of pays off despite some tracks on here with vocals that I was sort of on the fence with one of the only songs on here I didn't really care for was the track distance which was maybe the most overtly punk song on the entire album and because of it because it didn't have one of these sort of blissful twee kind of melodies it sort of stuck out like a sore thumb and not really in the best way and I'm not exactly sure if the speed at which the band plays on this track really sort of complements the production choices they made on this album as a whole for the most part it complements this twee jangle noise pop kind of vibe that they're going for with all this reverb in terms of the sound quality of the instruments it kind of runs thin a lot of times plus I'm not even really a big fan of the lyrics on this particular track overall I did enjoy this LP quite a bit it's got tunes it's got personality it's sort of recaptures this older style of rock and poppin and brings their own kind of angry attitude and an aggressive flair to it a lot of solid tracks on this thing it's a very likeable album I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it back to have her skin to forever 
dYLX9FtIzN8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new Flaming Lips LP the terror this is the latest full-length album from Oklahoma band The Flaming Lips really one of the most important groups if not the most important group in modern psychedelic music really one of the biggest advocates of taking psychedelic rock and pop and just furthering it progressing it with modern technology and ideas and a lot of rock bands even experimental rock bands as they get older they tend to kind of mellow out a little bit however that has not really been the case for The Flaming Lips at all it seems like since the late 2000s stylistically they've been getting stranger and stranger with their music and their antics like the very textured noisy challenging and difficult album embryonic that they dropped in 2009 as well as the collaboration streamed compilation that they put out last year Hedy Fwends gummy skulls 24-hour songs Pink Floyd cover album hmm disturbing music videos verizon advertisements the band has been incredibly entertaining to follow in terms of their antics but all of this has you know sort of been in the way of putting out a new freakin album however I don't think one could say after listening to the terror that the band was at all distracted or was there are cheapened by all of these sort of extracurricular activities because for sure the terror is one of the Flaming Lips most focused and odd musical experiences thus far that they have released in their career in terms of concept and sound now the album embryonic that the band put out in 2009 in comparison to some of the more psych pop-oriented albums that they put out just before it is really a chaotic and freewheeling record and the terror in comparison with all of that is is most definitely not wild it's not rocking hell it is not even poppy instead the band goes on a sonic journey on this LP that is very cold it desolate its robotic all over this LP there are just throbbing pulsating rhythms on electronics wandering guitars that are very repetitive in nature vocals that tend to sort of hang in the falsetto range and range from being heavenly or even eerie you really could have named this album the terror : The Flaming Lips in space slash 2001 a Space Odyssey because there are a lot of parts of this album that remind me of the frightening and surreal imagery that that haunts the latter portion of that film as I move through the album and I'm listening to this album I can see that time is passing by and that the songs are going from beginning to end but there's a serious sense of stillness that is just all over this album in general the opener on this LP feels like it's pretty much in the same chord from front to back and a lot of songs on this album feel the same way the band will jam on one single chord for the length of an entire track but they will progress the track and introduce new ideas by experimenting with sound instead on this particular track throbbing electronics synthesizers that are both sort of light in area and ethereal and heavy low and monolithic brittle guitar screaming and panned all the way to the side of one channel and while this track seam is very repetitive for the five minutes that it lasts on the surface it sort of glides into the next song nicely not only does it have a cool segue like many of the songs on this album do moving from one to another but the song seems to sort of fade into the next logically as well like this album in a lot of ways feels like one giant song the next tracks on this LP be free away and try to explain are easily my favorite songs on this entire LP I actually think they're the best moments that the Flaming Lips achieve with this aesthetic that they're going for on this album the songs are very still they're very repetitive they just feel suspended in space and the vocals that just fly over the the weird soundscape that the band creates they are heavenly they are just haunting they're beautiful and simple as well it's like the opening track on this album was creating a ruckus and sort of propelling things forward whereas when we get to these next two tracks you're literally kind floating in space now you've gone from the ground into the atmosphere and you're past these songs the album continues to be even more psychedelic twisted surreal with the song you lust with just 13 minutes long and length this song is massive and it actually feels pretty krautrock inspired to tell you the truth if this song came out at around the time that noise was dropping their early stuff it would have been revolutionary but the thing is it's 2013 and as of today this song didn't really come off that way to me because while the song did open up with some really interesting sounds that were seductive very weird I felt like I was tripping into this whole different world by the time we get to the middle of the song things aren't really moving at a pace that keeps me engaged or interested the song gets pretty thin when it comes to new or interesting ideas the very simple guitar leads and the stale sense on this part of the track just get very old very fast and to me this progression is actually mirrored in how I enjoy the entire album in itself even though this album is under an hour and only nine tracks it feels like it draws on much longer because it doesn't offer a lot when you get to the middle point of the album in terms of melody or playing and even sound craft - I appreciate that the terror is very sound oriented and the band wanted to create a more sound and texture based composition as opposed to just a traditionally musical one but it seems like around the middle point of the album they're sort of recycling ideas that they used at the first portion of the album and not in a way that feels interesting or fresh either I just get a lot of these falsetto moans that aren't even necessarily on pitch a lot of the time over a slew of different synth sounds and noises or percussions the song you are alone to me just feels way too obscured to be enjoyable and the falsetto on this track is is really one of the most sour out of the entire album I'm just really too distracted by how off it is to really feel much of anything about I like the song butterfly a lot but the reason that I like that track is that it kind of houses a lot of the same musical or sonic ideas that the first three songs on the album do actually to me this song feels like a fusion of the first three songs in a lot of ways and I like that the song turning violent has a pretty apocalyptic ending to it with some chilling group vocals but the song serves up just another sour falsetto that I don't have much interest in and the closing track on this LP is easily the most rockin and cathartic on the entire album and not that really needed a song like this to sort of make it a good LP but actually despite the fact that it is loud and that it does have a strong beat to it it feels like just extremely anticlimactic for sure the terror has style it has an aesthetic and it has some vocal melodies that are worth buying into the sound palate on this album is awesome but I just don't feel like The Flaming Lips come up with enough sounds to justify an album of this length and the thing is the album isn't even that long the band is undoubtedly created something nightmarish but I will not be waking up from this in a cold sweat anytime soon I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it hey des why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana The Flaming Lips the terror forever [Music] you [Music] 
D4sv3XN9-Ag,artist album title hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest be a second 'red it's time for your review of the new Bring Me The Horizon album sempiternal these guys are a UK based metal outfit from what I understand they have been together for about ten years at this point this latest LP of theirs is allegedly their most creative and ambitious musical endeavor yet and a breath of fresh air in some extreme music genres that consistently catch a bad rap for lack of creativity and fresh ideas like metalcore and certainly in comparison with other metalcore acts you could say that to an extent bringing The Horizon is being pretty forward-thinking on a number of tracks on this new LP like the opening track on here can you feel my heart there's a lot of electronic skits and edits throughout this track soaring guitars that glisten and fly over the chorus epically catchy synthesizer melodies sort of spread throughout the track too there are a lot of elements of this track and other tracks on this album that actually remind me of like hybrid theory era Linkin Park in a good way with the screams that the band's lead singer dishes out kind of reminded me of Chester Bennington screams as well but I don't think the influences that this album showcases stop at just Linkin Park a lot of the more pleasant more melodic elements of this new album actually remind me of quite a bit of radio metal acts from the early 2000s there are other tracks on this LP that don't really sort quite as much they go a bit harder they have a bit of a more cutting edge they pummel the listener with the monstrously produced rips that are locked in step with little bass drums and the band adds some dynamics to this track much like they do on other songs here with kind of a quieter interlude with some group vocals a bit of glistening piano out in the distance the band does work pretty hard to diversify their sound across this album always throwing something maybe that's quieter or a little bit more melodic at the listener so that they're not always simply getting this riffing the song Empire does this as well but with like what seems to be a string action on the song and the band's frontman Oliver Sykes very smoothly switches from these screen vocals to some actually pretty nice cleanly sung vocals as well and though I don't really see anything technically bad with Oliver's singing he can be kind of melodramatic at times when he's going for maybe a little bit of spoken-word whether it's him or another member of the band on a given track or when he seems to be singing or screaming at the top of his lungs some pretty cliched lyrics about finding your way back home Hart's writing on the wall letting people sing or being on the edge of the world and you can't really take them for any more than they're extremely melodramatic face-value it's really actually quite difficult to connect with this album in a direct or meaningfully emotional way unless you're just really kind of looking for that because a lot of the things that Oliver seems to sing about at least to me anyway he's pretty vague at times with the things that he says it's just that it doesn't really come out to be all that impressive poetically there's just a real lack of inspiring emotion on this album despite the fact that the band consistently seems to be shooting for something really epic all the time it just all kind of seems like it's only relative to this overproduced pop rock offshoot of metalcore music sure there are choruses on this album that reach for the stars but numerous tracks on this thing are loaded with dime-a-dozen boring uninspired metalcore riffing and breakdowns the riffs don't really hit any interesting or unique angles or grooves much of the time it's just kind of weird that the band is really sort of reaching for something that they think is kind of ambitious and beautiful but they match it together with these musical ideas that are just so lowbrow these kinds of metalcore riffs and listen I don't mean to diss every metalcore band out there they're fantastic bands and albums in the genre but what I'm saying is these particular riffs work on a formula that's is obvious as the dubstep drop but it's four times as stale because it's been around longer certainly I do admire that the band wanted to do something different I like certain parts on tracks like the chorus isn't like the melodies like the sense like the post inspired climax on the song hospitals for souls clearly the band has an ability to change things up but it just seems they refuse to get rid of their addiction to this metalcore style of riffing that they seem as stuck on as little Wayne is stuck on writing rhymes about his dick so I mean I'm really kind of feeling up strong for it to a light five on this thing if you guys have given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it but here's another opinion hey listen I heard this album sometimes Cal don't like the rare right kind of music but this album wrecked Anthony sometimes he don't get music all right it's a result of a horrible upbringing and just bad parenting it's not his fault don't blame him pray for him okay just pray now for me I'm saying this album Rex give it a listen it's goodness it's in your heart it moves the emotions hurry there you go Anthony Fantana Bring Me The Horizon forever you 
vAA_szh6cDg,James Boyd overgrown hi everyone Anthony Pham tan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you reviewed the new James Blake LP overgrown James Bullock is a multi talented musician hailing from the UK he's an electronic music producer as well as a singer piano player songwriter and after some really admirable EPS which kind of dabbled in the musical styles of future garage a little bit of dubstep a little bit of wonky in 2010 he went on to make a huge splash in 2011 with his full-length self-titled debut and I really like this LP when I first reviewed it but it ended up growing on me just a little bit further and ended up being unquestionably one of my favorite albums of that year mostly because of the album's creative production it's a mode of singing and kind of radical variety among this array of tracks through the songs he released on this LP James has proven that he exists uniquely on this weird border between electronic tinkerer and singer-songwriter James brings these two worlds together in a way that's exciting and refreshing and intriguing surprising his listeners is something I hope James Blake continues to do on further releases even as on his new LP overgrown he seems to come together with a pretty uniform set of tracks and shoots for that kind of standard 10 song formula that it's not too long not too short just like I'm James Blake's previous stuff there are elements of piano singing ballads electronics too but James doesn't really dip too far into any one of those directions to the point where the album feels unpredictable are sort of disjointed which was kind of equality that the self-titled album had however I don't think he's becoming dull on this new LP though James definitely takes some risks but still ends up with a pretty smooth auditory ride like the song take a fall for me which has these dreary pianos on the track these weird pitch shifted samples what seemed to be saying he's gone merry huh a very subtle beat and as this instrumental continues it appears that the wu-tang RZA is featured on the song does a couple verses on this thing and he really doesn't stick out on the album in a bad way he actually seems to conform to James Blake style really nicely I can't see why what RZA does on this track wouldn't vibe with you unless you're totally against rapping and hip-hop altogether Riza's bars on this track are heartbreaking in the emotion that he's displaying in his verses it's almost as if just this woman that he loves leaving him and just no chance of ever loving her existing forevermore it's like the end of the world the song retrograde is kind of another risk for James where he goes completely R&B which is definitely an influence that has appeared on his previous tracks but not so strongly not as strongly as what are you showing on this song the songs are really pretty ballad I love James's vocal melody the one that he hums right at the start of the song and the way the track progresses is nice too the chorus is really climactic with James reaching into his upper register singing in this very sharp pinched voice ending with this huge since well as previous tracks that he'd written especially on the self-titled LP and as well it's really moving single and there are other tracks on here that are just as concise not quite as abstract strange or obtuse as songs on the self-titled I'm talking about songs like life around here or I am sold maybe the difference with these tracks though is that they're a little bit spicier because of their atmospheric electronics and there are other tracks on here like digital line which are every bit as much a ballad but toward the end of the song the track seems to go on kind of a an electronic Odyssey the one downside on this LP as James seems to bring these two worlds this singer-songwriter and this electronic world closer together they don't always meld perfectly there are songs like overgrown as well as the last track on this LP to where James writes a pretty good tune but it meanders a little bit and doesn't stay as interesting toward the end as it is in the beginning despite having so very pretty piano sounds and so he doesn't really seem to tie up these tracks with interesting endings or even structure them in a way where toward the end of the song I really get any kind of closure the way these songs finish and sort of fade out it almost feels as if they could kind of go on forever the way leaves them off plus a handful of tracks on this thing do end in that since well climax formula that retrograde kind of follows but none of them really sort of reached the excitement retrograde quite did when it did its thing plus a track voir where genes takes that formula where he grabs a vocal snippet of himself singing sort of repeats it throughout the track as he progresses the beat this track it's not really one of his best in this style not one of the most enthralling for the most part especially toward the end of the song it seems so dense cacophonous and just not interestingly layered more elements of this track if you'll work against each other then compliment one another and once again the lone short piano ballad that James seems to kind of toss in on this track of 10 songs proves to display him as a good singer and he can certainly play piano but it just sort of runs around a lot of the same chords that he typically plays with when he does something in this style hardly throwing anything at the listener that makes me feel like he's sort of evolving this part of his persona that he seems to be so passionate about displaying though I do have my issues with this LP I think a majority of the songs on this album are real displays of beauty I will say this album is not as adventurous as his self-titled debut though James Blake while he is still a good producer and still really meticulous about the sounds that he crafts and where he places them his productions don't seem as out there as bold or as an Orthodox on this new LP making it just a little less thrilling overall I'm failing a decent strong seven on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it James Blake overgrown forever [Music] you you know marry her 
X2b-MqwDkAc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the weekly semi-weekly kind of quicky segment where i talk about a bunch of songs and releases that i haven't gotten a chance to speak on but i kind of want to just touch down on them in a video like I said I typically call this thing the quicky quickness quick segment but it's never really that quick to even watch or do but I'm gonna try to make it quick this time for the sake of my buddy Jeremy who's gonna be editing this thing love you all of these things are linked in the description let's go Mudhoney has a new music video and track out called I like it small not only is the song just you know got that alt rock classic 90s riff equality to it but the music video is really clever it's Alan there it's got a lot of sort of visual humor to it that I dig a lot cold cave also has a goth II tortured dark cold wave post-punk new single out called God made the world and boy is it catchy and just the print thing also seen em are seen mister I don't know how to say that but anyway this person has a new collection of beats out called the Chinatown tape and it's a colorful set of instrumentals that are psychedelic they're sort of hypnotic they're kind of long they're Spacey and they're out there lo-fi garage rock fuzz rock multi-instrumentalist Michael Cronin has a new track out called wait as well it's a bit of a piano ballad more melodic and just more ballad like than you would expect from him but it's actually an incredibly catchy and sweet tune and also make sure to stream the new doppelgangers LP hark if you're looking for some moody boom-bap New York 90s inspired hip-hop I'm definitely planning on getting a little bit deeper into this album before I say anything more on it and it has been 30 years this year since the release of Huey Lewis and the news --is sports and how is that being celebrated Funny or Die put up a hilarious video of Huey Lewis and Weird Al parroting the infamous axe murder scene from American Psycho it's freakin funny as hell one of the funniest things I've ever seen ever in my life also this album is 10 this album is 10 years old it's 10 this LP anxiety and an album of alternative pop and R&B so if you're into that style if you're into that kind of thing definitely check it out but for me personally I'm not really feeling the vocals on this album no matter how many times I return - I just cannot get into the vocals I don't think they're particularly good in terms of being able to hit a pitch or improvise you know threat kind of improvisations as well nothing on this album vocally really moves me in a good way if it moves me anywhere it's just away away from the album for sure the the overall aesthetic of anxiety and a lot of the beats and the since on this thing are different and I feel like the fact that this album is kind of alternative it does get a pass for embracing a lot of those corny 80s cliches and not having the best vocals in the world and I'm not saying that's you know a cop-out or anything like that I definitely accept that this album does have its merits because it does different things with these old pop and R&B ideas there are some likable slow jams on this thing like the song counting and there are other tracks on here that are just sort of weird and have a strange flair to them and definitely musically think outside of the box but I just really can't get past the vocals maybe they will appeal to me more on future releases this new piece Swanson line is is basically a combination of experimental techno and house music and harsh noise this is not a road a lot of people go down but the way these elements come together on this EP it's it's kind of obvious there are four tracks on this thing they range from five to twelve minutes though P Swanson has toyed with this idea in various ways on previous releases the fact that this one is a little bit shorter does make it kind of easier to digest and I will say that this is the most interesting he sounded so far doing this thing but still I don't really find it incredibly moving or interesting in terms of song structure or anything like that to me it just kind of sounds like an electronic song maybe I could hear anywhere but maybe just over modulated and distorted and and and fuzz down the history month helping man History Month this is an indie rock album that pays tribute to really the old world of indie rock pavement to silver Jews a little bit of modest mouse maybe some Built to Spill maybe a little bit of Smaug there's an indie rock and indie folk blend on this thing a lot like that pile album I reviewed last year dripping this album actually comes off of the same record label while I wasn't completely enthralled with the songwriting on this LP it is a decent release it does have these classic indie rock and indie folk characteristics they're pulled together nicely if you're looking for a little bit more in this style then definitely check this thing out because it's not bad we insured her without a net this dude is a jazz great a jazz monster awesome horn player dude totally left over from like Miles Davis bitches brew era fusion I mean this dude oh he contributed so much to jazz music around that time and he is still an amazing player at 80 years old not only are his solos just really fast they're intricate but he surrounds himself with some awesome musicians on this album as well and together they just create a very interesting and electrifying live recording Wayne and his collaborators are still there compositionally as well on this album dishing out some challenging stuff like the very sinister opening track on this album or the very rigid and tight and kind of relentless SS golden mean with that with just the pianos very staccato it's a quick piece it's an intense piece he's still trying to push himself into new places and that's what makes this album so impressive personally I feel like the recording leaves a little bit to be desired but the performances the writing the pieces they're all there to me by myself my relations black puss is essentially the solo project of music producer singer drummer Brian Chippendale one half of the noise rock outfit lightning bolt and while I did casually enjoy some previous releases from black pus I was kind of disappointed with this new album in just kind of finding that it felt like essentially a lightning bolt album without the other half of lightning bolt essentially the drum patterns are there maybe Brian goes a little bit crazier with his vocals at times but there are all these sort of distorted heavy bass rumbles as if you're hearing the other member of lightning bolts bass playing on the track but instead it sounds as if these sounds are being sampled or triggered in some kind of way with maybe a drum pad or something while he's playing or maybe they're added in post-production I'm not sure however it's assembled or performed isn't really you know at the of my head what's kind of bugging me about this LP is is like I said it just feels like a lightning bolt record but without that strong melodic or creative riff element that typically the band will bring to the table through albums like hyper magic mountain and then wonderful rainbow and without that there I guess Brian would be free to kind of explore other things and ideas but it doesn't really seem that on this album he realizes anything by himself so yeah that's it those are my quickies for this week if you've given any of these albums a listen what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantino quickies forever you 
p5PwUsqFfuE,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the internet business music nerd and it's time for a review of the new knife LP shaking the habitual the knife is an electronic music duo hailing from Sweden consisting of brother sister Karen and Olaf drear and for years these guys have been creating synth pop electro pop art pop through their handful of releases with some really great singles like passed this on silent shout and their sort of sleeper hit heartbeats which was a huge track for them surprisingly just blowing up in the middle of the 2000s but the thing is by the time everybody was getting hyped on this track getting introduced to the knife people from all around the world paying and paying and paying attention to their music getting open to this new sound that their purveying the knife was already kind of setting sail for much darker and more shadowy territory when they ended up dropping the album silent shout in 2006 by the time silent shout came out the knife already had a pretty bold eccentric style to their brand of synth pop Karen and Olaf were just diehards for synthetic sounds drum machines and Karen's voice and her lyrics her one-of-a-kind just strange out there voice was just so freakin attention-grabbing but kind of moving is as well in a strange way and stylish out took much of these characteristics and brought the knife into just more shadowy territory with some elements of ambient music and techno popping up here and there and sort of blending in with their synth pop and art pop and electro pop style deep cuts did have its zany moments like hanging out at the end of the LP that was the only thing that I think silent shout really kind of cut out of the equation and swapped out these weird unpredictable eccentricities for just a record that was way more concise now after silent shop came out it would be a while till this record till fans would hear anything else from the knife in of a normal capacity and this is actually around the time that the needle drop started and a lot of what the knight was doing around this time would actually lead to some pretty important reviews for this channel like when Karen drear Anderson came out with her solo debut with the album fever ray which ended up being my album of the year in 2009 an amazing record that I am still a die-hard fan for and then of course after that the knife put out tomorrow in a year a collaboration with planning to rock and mount Sims which was sort of this avant experimental opera a commissioned ode to Darwinism that I like to pretend doesn't exist because it led to one of my most infamously negative reviews on this channel ever of all time but honestly I don't really think I can ignore the existence of tomorrow in a year anymore because that album seems so pivotal to the development of what is going on here with shaking the habitual because of tomorrow in a year the experimental floodgates are open on shaking the vidual they're open all the way and also like tomorrow and you're shaking has a pretty huge sense of purpose to it as well it's incredibly ambitious at 98 minutes features a variety of different tracks and different flavors ambient tracks soundscapes interludes freaky deaky whacked-out dance-pop tracks that go on for very long periods of time and have pretty linear hypnotic progressions and whacked out as a phrase that I would like to reiterate because if deep cuts was essentially like the knife's pop album silent shout was there sort of nocturnal LP then shaking the habitual is the album where they really go completely insane that's not to say this album doesn't have composure though because this LP does seem to have a lot of detail to it there's a lot of care put into the details on this album every move is more challenging than the next on this thing and I would also say that it is beautifully strange it's kind of like being the first person to lay eyes upon this undiscovered species of jungle bird whose tail feathers are so bright and plentiful that they cause this emotional just visual sensory overload that hits you with all this ah because this healthy really is a rush of different ideas and feelings and sounds and even though the knife does play with a lot of pop characteristics a lot of pop motifs on this LP there are some catchy melodies there are courses on a lot of these tracks because these things are here people are going to hear this album and because people have heard their previous stuff they're going to expect some immediacy on this LP they're going to expect just some directness however I would say this album is really anything but direct or immediate I would actually say that in a lot of ways this album is kind of difficult to digest to the point where on an initial cursory listen what is on shaking the habitual may seem like nothing more than incoherent babble but if you sort of look at the details of what's going on on the greater arc of this LP it becomes apparent that this double album the two sides of this album essentially mirror each other in some really interesting ways both sides of this album feature a weird experimental interlude that is under a minute both feature and incredibly experimental track like a cherry on top which is this weird noisy intense soundscape and the other half of the LP fracking fluid injection is the track that comes off as being incredibly out there experiment wise which sort of seems to be this weird venture into the world of metallic string notes and vocals laid with this delay that makes these sounds to sort of bounce on and on and on to oblivion both tracks are sort of puzzling colorful and add a lot of character to each side of the album both sides of this LP also feature fast unsettlingly freakish electronic dance numbers like full of fire as well as stay out here both sides of this LP also feature slower jams and other tracks too that fit into this spectrum of being pretty or just sort of straightforward and complex the only odd-man-out is the 20 minute long ambient sound scape which ends the first half of the LP which if anything is just sort of an effective intermission in between the two albums one just sort of separating the other you've just got this huge gap of downtime before you hear the knife essentially put together the same album once more but in kind of a different fashion now given that the knife historically has been kind of a synth pop band electro pop band maybe a long ambien interlude isn't the best of tracks to sort of throw at knife fans but by ambient music standards I will say that this track is I mean pretty impressive the sounds that they come up with are vivid they're vast I love how formless the track is I love how it goes through multiple phases this track is not enjoyable in the same way that other tracks on this album are enjoyable I understand if a lot of people don't necessarily get the same excitement out of this track they do out of a song like full of fire but I do think this song on the sell piece serves a unique purpose not only that but I feel like characteristically sonically musically this song fits in with a lot of other tracks here because it does share a kind of primal primeval and very simple and rudimentary characteristic the track tooth for an eye feels kind of primal in a way as well especially because of its beat which feels hugely influenced by African and just afro beat music in general the woodwind melody on this track and the metallic Polly rhythms dancing all over this brigham as well also totally gives off that vibe but the knife totally knifes it up with these shiny shiny arpeggios just glistening atop this rhythm as well as the heavy resonance synth bassline and Karen drear Anderson's incredibly eccentric and sharp vocal another drum heavy primal track comes through with the song without you my life would be boring I love how booming the drums are on this track and just how cacophonous they are the percussion and the woodwind the way it all comes together it feels like just I'm listening to a drum circle and listening to me music I'm listening to people to sort of come together and create a ruckus just to make it and I am as the listener and just locked in the middle of it it's electric it's energetic it's inspiring it feels rootsy it has no inhibitions pulling it back and yet the hook on this track is so sharp I love Karen's vocal performance as well which seems incredibly composed I loved the freakish group vocals on this track the song wrap your arms around me also has a booming bass drum on it and has these metallic swells of synthesizers it's a slow-moving ballad it's chilling and the way the melody comes off on this track it also kind of reminds me of like portishead but much much easier and only the way the knife can do an eerie eerie heart piercing track I actually think this song is one of the most beautiful tracks I've heard this year hands down the more electronically flavored tracks on here like the incredibly weird full of fire the track networking which has a ton of busy 808 sequenced rhythms on it or the songs rate is which has just some very strange duet vocals on it which totally freaked me the hell out not only are they just kind of weaving in and out of pitch or sensibility but as they're doing it they just feel so passionate they feel so otherworldly and just man they just pull up all these emotions in me that I just cannot make sense of the beats pretty intense on that track too and you know these songs are a little more synthetic than some of the other sort of drum bass tracks though I'm sure are looped you are hearing a lot of natural acoustic drum Tambor's on there I guess what I'm getting at is that these more synthetic tracks they feel no less a part of the album than tracks like a tooth for an eye because they too have strange vocals catchy choruses long hypnotic linear song structures repetition experimentation and of course they're bold as hell so again to reiterate overall this album though it can be difficult to digest and separate and organize in your head it is not chaos it is not unplanned just sort of meandering and black black blacks or just throwing all these ideas at the canvas and just hoping that something sticks which can kind of be the case when you're talking about an album this long so there is flow there is an arc there is consistency to this thing now not only is the way that the album is built structurally interesting but the performances are really good too I mean the songwriting is definitely there the vocals are passionate they're moving and when they're not that they're just kind of eye widening and awe inspiring ly weird the sense on this LP oh rich they're sharp they're heavy some of the added instrumentation especially the woodwinds are very real they're organic they're raw the beats and grooves on this thing change and progress enough for the songs to remain interesting as they go into these longer lengths the mix on these tracks is stellar there's tons of variety among these songs I'm actually pretty freakin enthralled and impressed with much of everything that this album had to offer maybe there are some spots like the more experimental tracks on this LP and of course the big intermission that separates these two tracks that I feel it could have been on the whole a little bit more interesting but man when this album is awesome it is awesome I'm feeling a light too decent 9 on this album if you give it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it the knife shaking the habitual forever [Music] you [Music] 
np1X_MIt84I,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for one of my monthly kind of vinyl update things that I typically do with you guys cool sorry about the last one which if I remember correctly I said hey this is gonna be raw I'm not gonna edit this one I was kind of having weird cut see weird things go on with my memory card where it was stopping every 30 seconds so I did in fact have to had to splice all that stuff together but this video not gonna be edited I hope anyway a lot of what is in this pile isn't stuff that I had necessarily bought recently or anything actually some of it is just vinyl haul stuff from my nard where interview because the interview not only was there a lot of stuff edited out but there were some records that he had bought and sent to me that he did not show inside the video one of which he didn't actually give to me he sort of kept it for himself there are some records in the interview where he'll show them to you but that'll end up taking them back hmm but he ended up showing me the 7-inch that was a hardcore straightedge punk band 7-inch but it actually featured Greg Anderson of son before he was in son in this straightedge hardcore band he's like did you know he was in a hardcore band I was like no I didn't know he was in a hardcore band oh my god I hope I get this but then I didn't end up getting it but there were a lot of cool things that I did end up getting like you guys may have already seen a vinyl copy of my favorite Dead Kennedys full-length freaking plastic surgery disasters signed by Jello Biafra to me by Afra fantastic this is an amazing punk album amazing if you're looking to get into hardcore punk with just some really great playing and interesting songwriting then look no further than this album and it's an alternative tentacles present yeah dating back to the 80s on this one nice nice heavy vinyl pressing it's all sweet and there's a cool little insert in here as well I believe it's always something you kind of expect from Dead Kennedys you know some cool collages and stuff going into their their artwork I mean you essentially have an entire booklet here of weird and newspaper collages and this always came with Dead Kennedys stuff they definitely had a certain aesthetic the way that they like to package World War 3 but they like to package their albums some very apocalyptic stuff but also you know kind of satirical for the mainstream culture let's see what else did Martha wear past my way he passed me a few records in relation to artists that I had featured in a mix that I made for NPR music cub and Bush tetras I made a mix for NPR music I think last year of nothing but female post-punk outfits and a few you know indie rock outfits in there as well and he passed me this Bush tetras compilation it looks like boom in the night original studio recordings from 1980 to 1983 I'm actually yet to put this on the platter he gave me a Gorgoroth record - I don't know if I I don't know if this ended up in the in the interview but he gave me this sort of mid era Gorgoroth record if you're looking to get in a black metal but you're looking for a black metal band that rocks more than they do you know kind of do the whole atmosphere at brooding really kind of long-winded thing then definitely get into Gorgoroth saying he passed me the other cup 7-inch over here to pep has a nice a couple of cool songs on MIT records which I'm pretty sure NAR doir a label that nard wires affiliated with of course he also passed me the instrumentals to the Connecticut's third unheard hip hop compilation which was pretty awesome that he that he threw my way I've given a listen to the CD it's it's okay it's an okay CD you know that's it's definitely more of a novelty item and you know unfortunately um no you know not not really any 808 on the on the compilation just more disco grooves with wrapping over them even though the compilation says that the songs reach into 1983 not really any sort of 808 or you know sort of a lecture or Afrika Bambaataa influence or anything on there unfortunately but I'm gonna have to give a listen to the instrumentals and just kind of see what kind of water they hold just on their own and let me see what else he also passed me this Roland Kirk early roots collection of tracks with a really nice sort of I don't want to say synopsis just really nice kind of a profile of Roland Kirk on the back and as far as the material the musical material on it it's pretty standard in terms of just sort of you know jazz music or just like quartet trio quintet jazz there's nothing terribly avant-garde or strange on this on this collection even though you know you do see him you know sort of freaking on the multiple reed instruments there there's nothing terribly strange or odd on this um on this recording in my opinion nothing on the level of like you know inflated tear or anything like that but still you know cool collection of songs heats kicking on don't mind that and he also passed me a copy of the evaporators rip but written a ripple rock which I said any interview I used to own a copy of it in high school and then I gave it up but then I regretted it which if you own a vinyl collection I mean it happens to every vinyl collector there's some records that you have I don't listen to it as much anymore and then you end up giving it up and then you realize you made a huge freaking mistake thankfully NAR toir was able to write this wrong and this is fresh off alternative Tentacles records there's the the emblem the infamous bat emblem with awesome hits you don't even need to hear these songs you just need to be hearing these song titles and there's feel like wow I hear those song titles I want to hear that song I want to hear get off the treadmill I want to hear I've got icicles on my testicles I want to hear is half empty holes which is a cool little ode to sort of coming up performing too you know literally half empty halls you're a punk band you're kind of DIY you're performing but you know nobody's there to actually see you perform cardboard brains I want to hear a song called shittin party okay these these are hits that hits that I grew up with as a kid and of course you know there's some parts on here like soup NAR barber Snoop Doggy Dogg there's a recording of Naru are kind of talking to snoop on there as well so do check out that record it's just a fun strange kind of record you know in the same way like Andrew wks I get wet is kind of a strut strange fun anomaly which has sort of wristed the test of time and has gained a new audience thanks to how eccentric the man who fronts the record is like Andrew W cage is this sort of this ubiquitous weird figure now that everybody just kind of like admires and because of that they've gone back and then sort of looked into his music and found that oh well this I get wet records crazy awesome the end some recent vinyl purchases since my last video but the S self titled Fleet Foxes which I was yet to purchase on vinyl if you guys remembered absolutely loved their helplessness blues record which sits proudly in my collection album of the year a little while ago but I enjoy the song title as well nice double LP thick Sub Pop vinyl pressing I really like the sleeves on this I don't know if you could see but it's sort of like a glossy finish on the sleeve and you can see the sub pops sort of you know put into the sleeve it's really nice because the Sub Pop is always nice with their packaging you can always draw in a nice package from Sub Pop thank yous credits all that other good stuff oh yeah Sub Pop does not slump when it comes to their vinyl packaging very simple straightforward vinyl packaging yeah this nations saving grace album cover for the Fall and a pretty thin yeah it's it's it's okay it's not the thickest vinyl pressing that you're gonna run actually it's very thin but uh but you know it sounds fine it sounds fine it's a it's not too tinny or anything like that it's a rough recording of course but that's just kind of the style the fall has they kind of just take this idea as Derek Higgins would say and they kind of blam it out and you know actually speaking of which Derek Higgins continues to be the nicest man in the world he sent me his latest release SONA spheres - which is kind of a collection of soundscapes from him and it is on colored vinyl like kind of greenish bluish nice I've given a listen to this stuff on his Van Camp while the songs aren't really long and I typically like my ambient music to be more kind of vast and maybe a little more formless he does he does tend to write his ambient or sort of sound scapes and in sort of a shorter fashion still the sounds that he comes up with are interesting they're sharp they're vivid they're colorful I mean you know I don't think this album art is hip it's not really in or anything like that in terms of just sort of a younger aesthetic or anything like that but it is as abstract as the music that you will hear on this record I've blogged about this collection of tracks on on the needle drop calm you can find us band camp over there Derek Derek Egan's SONA spheres - you can find this band camp on on my website and stream all the traction this thing over there like I said sharp vivid colorful soundscapes oh no I'm just gonna leave it at that that's pretty much my vinyl update for this month and love you Anthony Fantana records forever 
O0GbGa0vyHg,we view time MTV I'm busy my daddy by nature at brain oh hey behold one of the Bands that you're in he's Vivian girls uh-huh and that band is all girls yeah we're all girls and what the end attorneys the babies yes is that be able babies now they're coming via a big pink limousine okay they're in the limo looks beautiful don't do this no more it's a ten make beats meet you you want a clip no and now it's time for the NTU you're alert mie says that the Grammys ripped arrived listen you're just jealous because MTV likes me and you're just a new tool you've done everything really badly I'm the busy one now 
T1cPYaibBYM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd here to do a monthly segment that I always do and yet I almost forgot to do it this past month but someone reminded me to do it on Twitter better better better basically it's the start of April marches over so I'm going to talk about all of these songs and albums that pretty much please my ears the most from today back to the last time I made a video like this the new dope body 7-inch Saturday - nice awesome tracks on there a combo of just rock rock and roll psychedelic rock as well as some sludge metal - decent songs decent songs not the best I've heard from doe body but a tight little EP 7-inch out now on Drag City records next the new feller talk album mere a seamless blend of black metal hardcore punk maybe a little bit of rock and roll in the classic rock in there - these guys have a great sound they're working again production-wise with Curt blue of converge while a lot of what this band does is harsh a lot of the guitar leads the solos and the choruses it's just all so freakin catchy next the new drones album I see seaweed these guys are in Australian outfit started as a garage punk punk blues outfit but have kind of mellowed out since have sunk into more of a singer-songwriter style there's still intense but more emotionally if you're fans of people who have kind of a dark side like PJ Harvey or maybe a little bit of Nick Cave these guys are quite is tortured but for sure they appeal to some of the same emotions plus the songwriting on this thing is good and I love the way the band drags a lot of these songs out and makes them progressively more and more intense instrumental Ian vocally as the songs kind of carry on especially the last track which is one of my favourite closing tracks of the year the new shlomo EP laid out a really nice gloomy atmospheric collection of instrumentals that not only take a lot away from trap music but contemporary R&B as well for sure a short but interesting release and final a long but very interesting release the new Autechre album exei man this double album is just amazing amazing because Autechre i mean nobody is just treating and conjuring creative mind-bending where the hell did this come from sounds in the way the Autechre is yeah this album philosophically emotionally may not be anything incredibly different than what Autechre has done in recent years for sure this is a cold and methodical release but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot that sort of just drops my jaw and just sort of you know puts me in a state of awe as far as songs go the knife a tooth fur and I love this track looking forward to reviewing the band's new help you very soon Deer Hunter just dropped a new track to monomania they went back to their kind of lo-fi garage rock just really noisy and abrasive kind of sound catchy hook on this track and I love the noisy chaotic epic ending on this thing young fathers the guide I'm loving this track as well really looking forward to the band's next LP tape two and finally the two tracks that Vampire Weekend dropped over the past month after I got back from South by Southwest I believe amazing tracks loving these freakin tracks not only is step really a beautiful ballad loving the fact that it's a reference to an old souls of mischief song but Diane young is a hard-hitting pop barnburner and that's pretty much favorites for right now okay cool Anthony Fantana favorites music forever 
kCqxe3bhBqQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new black heart rebellion album har Nev oh these guys are a Belgian rock outfit as far as I can tell this is their sophomore full-length LP the thing is about forty minutes and these forty minutes are spread across eight different tracks and it's a pretty intriguing release with a combination of genres such as post rock psychedelic rock folk music maybe a little bit of post metal drone doom mmm I could definitely tell that these guys appreciate maybe a little bit of the Mogwai maybe a little bit of the swans and even though this band's stylistic genre influences are very apparent they don't always necessarily come together in in a really obvious way which is great like the song crawling and eating dust which starts off with just this dark sickening and eerie ominous drum circle there are these chilling chorus vocals that pop up over the drum circle and as the song progresses some droning guitar and bass comes in and it is heavy and resonant these guys are really great at using sound and texture to just create drama create darkness after this part in the song these spoken-word vocals come in but they've got this sort of just whisper quiet sort of sinister character to them this song and many others on here just get more and more intense as they go on the primal drone on this track eventually goes toward this huge sike rock climax wailing guitars heavy bass the vocals turn from whispering to just all-out aggression and they do all of us without losing the occult vibe that the song started off with like I said other tracks kind of work with this same sort of arc the same sort of progression but the band does it with different flavours of music like the song a NAR dot which I don't know if I'm pronouncing correctly but it too gets more in as it goes on but it kicks things off with sort of a 70s heavy metal style to it kind of like Black Sabbath when heavy metal still had a really prominent bluesy hardrock influence and even though they definitely go a little heavy metal on this track they still managed to make the song just very slow dramatic jeroni deadpan vocals on this thing pots and pans percussion bunched up with the drums to again give it that kind of prime evil vibe I love the passionate group vocals at the end of this track two moments like this really sort of stick with me even though these guys aren't exactly a course oriented band the production the experimentation the adventure the sounds they're all there the variety on this LP continues with tracks like gold and myrrh which opens up with these chords that feel as if they're a little inspired by Spanish guitar music maybe a little bit of flamenco the downside to this particular track though is that some of the noisy and psychedelic builds that the band goes on are a little more interesting than others this one particularly nothing really about it sticks out of me if anything it kind of reminds me of a cut from that new god speed album that came out last year and there are other tracks on here like abraham which are a great start to the album add a lot of color to this LP but they're a lot shorter than some of the other tracks on here and while it's not bad to have a shorter track on this album theoretically it's not like the band is able to kind of tie things up efficiently give some closure or write a song that feels concise within a three or four minute time span instead some of these relatively shorter songs can end up feeling like they could have gone somewhere as interesting as some of the other tracks still overall there's way more highlights on this album than does even though I wasn't completely in love with it maybe my favorite song the entire LP being animal esque which has a twisted song structure the guitars on this track just jangle epically and I love the the angry ass vocals on this song just how fierce they come across dust dust the explosive ending on this thing too is awesome this album and in this track in particular it's just monolithic it shoots four monolithic much of the time and I will say that it succeeds the black heart rebellion has a huge sound they definitely have a nice recording on this album and they know what to do with it instrumentally this album is so heavy and yet it can at times be sort of eerie or quaint like at the start of the last track which has some interesting banjo on it I do feel like the cell P could be a little bit more cohesive in terms of a narrative or a story or an arc it seems like every song on here is sort of its own little nook or cranny or niche instead of the entire album sort of having an interesting progression to it and even though I did end up with some tracks paling in comparison to others still this is a really solid set of tracks and I feel like this band is doing some really interesting stuff on this LP but they're just like this close to doing something whoa hopefully that ends up being the case on their next release I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it Blackheart rebellion forever 
nzqQJIk4TYo,marionette hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new marionettes marionettes LP hit the waves these guys are a Swedish pop and rock outfit this is their third full-length LP and on this release they're sticking with roughly the same sound that they've been purveyors of for a majority of their career let's just say the marionettes aren't exactly well known for their originality if you give a listen to this LP pretty much what you're going to get is 80s era dream and jangle pop with a hefty helping of synthesizers on the side a lot of danceable beats on this LP explosive hooks and very very emotive vocals from frontman Philip ekstrom who a lot of the time vocally is a dead ringer for the Cure's robert smith and though the cure is a huge influence on the marionettes music it's not really like the more post-punk e goth abrasive side of the band really sort of comes out in this record it's really more of a crossbreed of Robert Smith's vocals along with these sort of light papi catchy but sort of you know single tear streaming down my face vibe that you typically get from like a Smith's record so the marionettes have some really obvious influences but on every single one of their records they always manage to at least dish out a few infectiously awesome tracks now on this third album of theirs I can't exactly say they're doing much of anything new they pretty much come through with the same sound that they've always had maybe there's a little more synthesizers in the mix but still the marionettes can come off a little one-dimensional at times even though that's the case and they kind of drown in their influences a little bit I do think this record has the most consecutively catchy and sharp and well-written tracks that the Marianas have put together so far from the start of the first track on this thing it becomes very clear that the marionettes are not a very modern band there is a huge sense of nostalgia that just bashes me over the head as I listened through this record which maybe was not as strong in their previous stuff they really kind of ham it up on this new album especially with some of the synth tones like for example the song evil coast once the bouncy echo guitars and the epic floor tom drumming and the chili synthesizers come in on this track it's 80s 80s 80s 80s and why a lot of these tracks are very basic and sort of straight forward in terms of just kind of a verse chorus verse sort of thing they're all beautifully produced the colors are really heavenly their blissful they're pretty on the ears and those definitely the marionettes will appeal to people who loved not just the cure but some of the more mainstream acts in New Wave music as well like when they track hit the waves the title track on this LP comes through the song is incredibly upbeat I love the hook on this thing hit the way it's honestly one of the best and sexiest pop grooves I've heard on a verse this year and it just totally screams like toto to me I'm feeling totally toto on this track the song years also was kind of a slow burner has a sensual sexy groove to it and yeah even though Phillips vocals sound just like Robert Smith's he hooks me in with his freaking refrains stay away stay on this record these guys are so diehard passionate about trying to recapture this old-school 80s synth-pop production sound it almost feels as true to detail as like an aerial pink tune but in this case there's no tongue in no cheek not a single ounce of irony leaks into any one of these songs they're all very heartfelt they're all very sincere don't forget don't forget however I do kind of feel that this LP mmm falls apart at the tail end to an extent through a handful of tracks they're really atmospheric and slow moving closer is pretty on the ears but kind of in underwhelming climax and a few other tracks like unblessed and can't stop the aching are jangle pop tunes jangle rock tunes but the melodies that they use the guitar leads on these tracks are just a little too obvious not only do the marionettes feel like they're ripping off the sounds of other bands on these particular tracks but they almost feel like carbon copies of songs are in the genre as well plus there is the issue that it's been a while since the band has put out their last LP and they've only managed to drum up really nine new tracks overall I did like this LP it was a fun sweet catchy pop album with just a lot of infectious a lot of contagious choruses a lot of nice grooves great production however the marionettes continue to drown in their influences and don't work with them in a way that feels refreshing or all that constructive really and at this point the question kind of comes up if this is always going to be the case for the marionettes I feel in a strong six to a light seven on this LP if you're into pop music if you're in a dream pop jangle pop you want something concise straightforward it's just going to hit you and stick in your head and then leave then give the Salma listen ok ok love you Anthony Fantana marionettes forever you 
aspbCJ68zqY,Talia go creator whoa hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time we're reviewing the new Tyler the Creator album wolf Tyler the Creator wraps and makes beats hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tyler the creator album wolf tyler is a rapper producer member of the West Coast hip-hop outfit Odd Future this is his third full-length LP a highly anticipated release a follow-up to his 2011 album Goblin at this point due to the saturation of hype which came out before goblin and came after goblin as well I'm going to assume you don't really need a history lesson on this guy but if there's one thing that I can say in retrospect because it's been two years since the release of goblin it's The Odd Future has really kind of been an integral part in this rising demand for alternative personalities and messages in popular hip-hop music yes Odd Future is not the only face in alternative hip-hop and they're definitely not the first and they're nowhere near my favorite but they are a favorite for a lot of people out there and if you actually listen a little bit deeper into Tyler's music past some of the shock stuff past some of the faggot stuff past some of the rape stuff you do catch a lot of themes of psychosis insecurity self-hatred social awkwardness issues of racial and social identity these are things that made bastards such an intriguing album though it wasn't the best produced album or the best rapped album however when Tyler put out Goblin in 2011 it seemed that a lot of the shadowy secrets and a lot of the intimacy sort of floated away in exchange for just Tyler's fame he was deafened in a way on wolf we see Tyler kind of regaining focus reaching back and grabbing once again at that darkness that made bastard an interesting album and on top of it the production is more ambitious too now like bastard and like goblin there's kind of a theme there's a progression there's a narrative to wolf it involves things like a camp a bike girlfriend as well as conflicting science to Tyler's personality or characters that he's kind of conjuring up for this story like Sam as well as wolf and there are moments where Tyler seems to be kind of rapping just from the standpoint of himself not every track on this LP plays into the emotional theatre that Tyler has created it is definitely not the disciplined and direct concept album that is good kid maad city but that doesn't change the fact that this is a pretty personal and depressing album for me personally what has bothered me on some recent odd future releases like the Oh F tape and goblin there's just a lot of spots where Tyler sort of seems to squander his potential and just dicks around however on wolf it seems that he is trying to work up to a higher standard lyrically and instrumentally to I see kind of a progression from goblin to wolf that is a to unlike what Eminem did from The Slim Shady LP to the Marshall Mathers LP sure Tyler is nowhere near as skilled a rapper as Eminem is or at least what he was around the time that he came out with those two albums but Tyler benefits just as much as Eminem did from an outsider image and it seems that Tyler has like a love-hate relationship with this outsider image though he raps about it a lot it seems he embraces it on some tracks that makes him kind of an exciting dangerous character there are moments on this album where it feels like he would trade all of that in a heartbeat for a dad who loves him as well as some self-esteem or some genuine acceptance one of these several good things that Wolfe brings to the table is most definitely variety therefore one is a handful of hype tracks on this LP one of the first ones is the track jambo which has a pretty decent beat behind it tile decorator really shares up his production on this album I like the farty sense on this track as well as the click-clack beat the weird moaning female vocal it's a nutty instrumental and Tyler comes off nutty as well in the verses that he's thrown out there if those if there's one downside to a lot of the hype traxx on this LP it's that Tyler kind of finds himself rapping about the same stuff over and over and over like some kind of weird sexual excursion that he had while he was over in Europe his asthma his four storey house his mother other members of odd future and on top of it the roach that he ate in the Yonkers video which ironically on the song Colossus he raps about how he doesn't want to be affiliated with the roach anymore he's glad it worked he's tired of hearing about it it's over it's done with I didn't really care for the song parking lot either instrumentally and flow wise as well it's one of the few tracks on this album that felt really kind of half-assed the only more hype oriented tracks that I thought were either funny or really entertaining were for one trash Wang which is just kind of another toward the end of the album trap flavored Posse track a lot like what bitch suck dick was on goblin it's really offensive the flows are bad a lot of what's being rapped about is totally ridiculous over the top and I love the song rusty on this LP not only is the beat really hard-hitting and have a sharp boom-bap II set of drums but the sample on this thing is really sort of eerie and in RZA esque it's definitely some loot and worship on this thing and damo when he comes through on his verse with this track he sounds freaking hungry this is the hungriest I've ever heard this dude on a track and Tyler as well his verse is cutting to when it comes to his fans his critics and just the ridiculousness of the situation that he's in Fame wise which he also sort of makes fun of on the track down mou 23 like I mentioned in my review there are more highlights on this LP though more than I think what was on goblin like the song awkward where Tyler seems to kind of touch back on a few things he talked about in goblin like this girl who he seems to have this ongoing crush on whose name is his password and he seems to put himself in the situation where he locks lips with her but it's not really this kind of joyous celebratory oh my god I kissed this girl that I love instead it's awkward because where does he even go from here and I guess he sort of assumed that this was leading to something when in fact it wasn't the Bee is decent and while the piss shifted vocals just going down a few notches was a little off-putting at first the flow and the lyricism and the emotion are pretty much all there coming after this track the song answer is my favorite song on this album I think it's an amazing track it's the best track Tyler has done on this topic his frickin father who abandoned him who of course he raps about on bastard but nowhere near as intense is on this track where yeah Tyler hates the guy he lashes out at him in every way that he possibly can but at the end of every verse he comes the conclusion that if he calls him he hopes the answers the anger just the desperation on this track are so freakin thick and I love the jazzy quality of the instrumental coming after this the song I fucking hate you which is another favorite of mine on this I'll be surprisingly the song is about really kind of being in a relationship but this person that you're with is this person that simultaneously you love they make you happy but you hate them as well you hate what this relationship is doing to you it's confusing it's this new experience the track is filled with all these clunky since that Tyler typically puts into his songs which is just his style at this point it's something that yeah was on goblin as well but what I really didn't like about those beats wasn't necessarily the clunkiness but just how cheap and thin and just how messy some of the mixes were and stuff like that the Assembly of the clunky sense on I fucking hate you are great Tyler finds a way to make this weird awkward rudimentary and kind of ugly production style that he has and make it kind of epic and beautiful with the cold just very chilly since at the beginning of the song the very beautiful R&B flavored chorus vocals toward the end of the track the clunkiness of some of the sins just adds to the character of the song which is totally freakin schizo he feels like he's in love but he's also just ready to snap at the moment that this relationship crumbles and he finds this person that he's with with another guy and he becomes a stalker and just comes up on him with a bad attitude the song for ta is another solid track on this LP it's a critique of drug dealers tyler himself plays this person who deals drugs but the fact that what he's doing is destroying lives and destroying neighborhoods it kind of gets to him emotionally the closing track on this LP loan is a touching sad and heartfelt ode to the passing away of Tyler's grandmother he's got all these descriptions of being in the hospital dealing with this kind of pain and awkwardness in her final moments and I love the beat on this track which is really really jazzy but kind of has this elevator music quality as if it were being pumped out through speakers that were like in hospital ceilings or something like that in the hallway the song Colossus is essentially Tyler's version of the mmm song Stan he's dealing with just over excited fans who were obsessed over him maybe for all the wrong reasons and feel like they loved him when they really don't understand that much about him and some of the weirder experiments on this LP actually go over pretty well - like the song - male which has this weird clunky heavy world beat influence instrumental and this weird female vocal sample beat kind of reminds me of like what I would hear on an m.i.a album and Tyler lyrically delivery wise comes off as really brash offensive entertaining just colorful some of the other risks that Tyler takes don't go over so amazingly though like this on a tree home which has a pretty nice vocal contribution from Erykah Badu not one of her best but even though I like the jazzy sort of neo-soul vibe of this track I'm not really into some of the cornelius on this thing but I have to say maybe my least favorite part in this entire LP is the party's over campfire Beamer medley toward the middle of the album party isn't over and campfire just meander too much they sort of gets thrown in together to kind of add to this storyline that Tyler wasn't really riding all that hard up to this point anyway and instrumentally lyrically they're not that interesting Beamer is the best song out of the three and I feel like the first two songs wouldn't even be listened to if B her weren't thrown at the end of them but generally I don't even think Beamer is that good of a track the instrumental the tune the beat is okay but I think a lot of the trashy woman car comparison metaphors are well I said trashy overall I liked wolf honestly I thought it was a decent album though the highlights on this album are high it's kind of spotty too there are tracks on here that meander or just really kind of feel like filler and Tyler is clearly not interested at least at this point anyway and improving his technical abilities as a rapper because a lot of his flows on some of these tracks can be kind of awkward despite the fact that they may be heartfelt and very emotive the instrumentals are a definite improvement the feature list is pretty impressive and getting people like Erykah Badu and even Letitia Sater on your album is I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Tyler the Creator forever 
-PdB0GnBrtU,you see waves of blue hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new waves LP of afraid of heights you don't know how high I am up here you don't know I could be 4 stories up for all you see waves is the musical project of singer songwriter guitarist Nathan Williams and Nathan and this project blew up around the 2008-2009 time period when lo-fi Rock Garage and pop music was kind of in it's craze stage this LP featured a lot of garage rock and punk tunes that a very poppy personality to them but there were shrill blankets of distortion and over modulation covering almost every single track not to mention the pretty obnoxious vocal effects that Nathan would occasionally put on his voice on some of these songs I guess this point in time is not that long ago but it feels like it was so long ago especially when you sort of look at Nathan's musical evolution since this LP and the thing is the transition didn't really take that long to happen it was as early as 2009 that Nathan Williams was putting out tracks that were pretty well recorded with the one and only Zach Hill on drums and by the time 2010 came around Nathan dropped king of the beach which was essentially it sounded to me like a studio recorded album and I guess she could say relatively his songwriting was getting a little more ambitious now with this new LP Nathan's personality stays relatively the same pretty much everything you have heard up until this point it's not really a big surprise what is sort of the kicker here is the mix of influences because afraid of heights incorporates way more elements of grunge and alternative rock the production on this LP is way heavier the drums are punchy er the guitars and bass meld together in this really thick resonant way the entire makeup of this album sonically sounds scary alike to Nirvana nevermind truthfully which I guess is not all that surprising for a guy who wrote a song called I want to meet Dave Grohl and the album Nevermind has not just influenced this album sonically but from a songwriting standpoint as well the song dog on this LP there are moments especially in the acoustic guitars and the chord progression that sound eerily alike that of Polly and the explosion of slacker guitar riffs on the hooks of particular songs on this LP like that's on me sound very nevermind desk as well there is a very clear breadcrumb trail of influences throughout this LP like for example the verses on the track beat me up sound eerily alike that of where Eagles dare by The Misfits now even with this huge embrace of Nirvana's Nevermind waves still stays pretty true to its sound its personality its ethos with all of these the repetitive lyrics the simple vocal melodies as well though I guess if there's anything that is a change to this album narrative ly afraid of heights is actually way more in tune with Nathan's more emotional side his more depressed side which I actually kind of liked hearing on his previous full-length LP with tracks like take on the world where you had Nathan dissecting his musical abilities saying that he hates all of his writing and hates all of his music because it all sounds the same and that dissection continues on a much deeper level on this new LP with a track like demon to lean on and the title track on this LP which has severe feelings of loneliness coming through the hook moments of insecurity and self deprecation continue on other tracks on here like paranoia and I can't dream however with this slight change in Nathan's tune I still can't really say that he's matured all that well as a songwriter I have to still kind of agree with the statement he made about his writing sounding the same on the song take on the world and I guess a lot of the though Nathan's singing and his songwriting style does have a certain personality you know a wave song when you hear it this is the first LP I've heard where I really kind of feel like it's more of a crutch than a help to his cause because it's made so many of the songs on this help he just sound so homogeneous and what's weird is that Nathan seems to be very conscious of this weakness but he seems to embrace it as opposed to fix it and maybe that's because he loves his flaws in the way that he finds inspiration from them for songwriting material which is very clear from a lot of the subject matters on this LP however I don't really buy Nathan as a depressing singing songwriting sad-sack because while I'm sure that Nathan has legitimately sad feelings that do bother him I don't think you could argue that he conveys them all that well or all that poetically or passionately on a lot of these songs at least in a way where it makes the listener feel for him or even relate to him in a way none of you will ever understand me there are rarely any spots on this LP where I feel like Nathan says anything that's significantly deep or moving or even twisted even as Nathan is throwing out imagery of a gun to his head you know there are some things that I really liked about this LP overall the production is great the energy is there though this album is waves cleanest production yet it still rocks what ends up getting me down at the end of the day is the songwriting the lyrics the vocal melodies as well as just some of the hooks are so shallow and so Sammy Sammy that many of them are just completely unmemorable though not really terrible or offensive to the point where I want to turn off the album still I can't really say I disliked or hated this album it was just sort of a fun poppy rock record with a kind of heavy grunge sound I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it rotten here's another opinion hey when you get a review that other album word that you're going to review a review the other album everyone last you to review a review that other album huh yeah well that's not annoying waves afraid of heights forever [Music] [Music] 
E96SuuIWca4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd we're about to do an interview with buek and gace Aaron Sanchez and Aaron Dyer correct yes that's funny but that's the name that you had a question about and they just came out with my favorite albums of this year general dome so of course I wanted to get them in here and sort of talk with them over webcam and have you guys watch it we're going to be taking questions from you guys later in the interview so if you drop anything into the comment box I can read it and I can ask them if it is a good question and and yeah that's it so we're basically going to be talking mostly about the new record and just their musical approach in general and and that's all that's all okay so I guess basically uh my first thoughts on the album that I mean I really love the album and what I love so much about it is that while everything sounds so organic and acoustic and electric like everything seems so you know it feels performed by you guys and yet it's just so mechanical it's so industrial it just feels like you know I'm listening to a machine pump out all of these guitar sounds and rhythms and and effects as well you wanted to see my prosthetics how many how many would how many of your limbs are prosthetic just kidding and they're mechanized right yeah it's all robotic we're actually not human I guess that would explain it you know but it's like I just think um I don't know do you guys think the idea of machines inspires your music and in any way I guess well I mean this sort like you know I'm always feeling like I want the influence of electronic music in a way on on like organic music this is like a personal thing for me like you know well and we were talking about dance music before making the record a little bit and like having that kind of like feel in it so I don't know like I like I like I've always wanted to to make music with acoustic instruments that were inspired by more electronic and industrial music anyway so I don't know this is just a personal thing for me so maybe that's like coming into our well yeah I mean that that's I mean that's one of the questions that I kind of had for later it seems like your music is so inspired by electronic music or mechanized like electronic music in a way but you've gone about it you've gone about recreating that sensation in I mean maybe one of the most difficult ways possible you know not only through the way that you guys play but making your own instruments as well this variation of the ukulele and the bass guitar yeah yeah I mean I'm a huge fan of like bands like Autechre effects twin and stuff so like I and yeah somehow I want that infused in what we do but we're taking this completely strange approach to it talk a lot about Autechre and how they kind of developed their own software to just yeah that'll just like create software that makes the music and so we're kind of like trying to create our own sound world instruments kind of to to create something new not to dork out too much on recent stuff but if you guys heard the new Autechre lpx i I checked it out online yet it's it's okay I don't know it's it's kind of similar it's just kind of like in their vein oh it is it is but I mean the fact that it's two hours and the diversity of it all I mean it's just so vastly strange yes it's it's it's not even heard the whole thing I should check I don't think who does that yes and while I mean compare make it to our Buchan gase LP I mean you guys certainly conquer those sounds between the boat that'll be next okay well I guess the next thing I wanted to go on to the this mechanization of your music it seems like for me on this new LP it's been kind of increased I think because I mean even on your last full-length album with tracks like a medicine I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly I mean that to me seems like more of a smoother ballot where a lot of what's going on with this new album so staccato and some clunky I thought the other album was more clunky really yeah it was kind of I don't know it was more being kicked in the face consistently as opposed to this one I felt like is more um like you're kicked in the face and then kind of petted a little well this one has more consistency throughout a song like stay within a group for a while it's not real song whereas the last record it was like they had been whoo all those changes happening all the time schizophrenic if there was one thing that sticks out to me it said the the song stick out a little bit more you know in that they seemed a bit sweeter and catch your especially with Aaron's vocals you're talking about the first record the the newer record yeah I would say I mean yeah we'd focused on you know I mean we're even talking about like let's try to like I mean we're in love with pop music as well and like love like you know the accessibility of a really catchy melody you see you seem almost offended by that statement no I mean we were trying to infuse like that element of like let's make this really you know we wanted it to be accessible we realize that we're kind of cerebral mm-hmm and sometimes that's very difficult for people to get into it's not just like you put it in and you listen to it in the background and you kind of groove around like when you listen to the music or when I listened or wouldn't we writing the music it's hard for me to talk about our music as so I'm unbiased in the sewing of just a listener but anyways so when I imagine people listening to it I think that they want to focus on it I mean I would want them to I would need though you need to hold their hand a little bit and like I just leave them lead them somewhere in a easy way sometimes well that's what we're talking about being accessible that's that's why we're talking about being accessible but even still naturally our natural thing is to be more cerebral and to like just have fun with sounds and rhythms and textures and all of this stuff and and that can be a little difficult to just sit down and hang out with yeah because it's like the more complicated it is the more fun it is for us well I mean so the fact that you have a sophomore record or you know this this sophomore full-length and you kind of had a bigger audience this time around to put out the record for really kind of influenced the process because you were thinking about what people are gonna be like listening to this album and experiencing it I suppose I suppose it did have some influence on it but it's not like we would talk I have time and say let's make this song easy for us I mean for me it's I mean a little bit of that but I think mostly it's like at the end of the day I want to make a record that I enjoy listening to as well as I'm liking the last record I don't really listen to it you know it's it's it's like it's it's fun and it's cool and songs are cool and I appreciate how we made it but it's like not music that I would really listen to so I think you know keeping that in mind that was kind of our approach with this with general dumb and and and in in that frame of mind it's maybe a little more accessible you know or just maybe just kind of like making it easier to like get into this melody or this group mm-hmm yeah Aaron do you feel the same way I mean is it like is there kind of this what was this what was there this moment of separation where you said okay I mean obviously our music is really fun for us to make but we need to start making music that appeals to me a little bit more to listen to it as well I mean do you not return to the first record in the same way that Aaron does or I'm different than Aaron um good I'm not hoping for a different answer I think that he and I kind of have this well you know some are somehow able to balance each other off maybe but I think I for a long time have tended towards more catchy more like I don't know yeah but sometimes you want to do something completely out okay we both share that problem I'm I'm in another trainer's company well I mean to want to go on to lyrics which is something that I'm sure you could talk a little bit more about yeah I mean in a duo that seems so sound focused an instrument focused I mean how important are how important two leaders become especially on this LP where you know I hear you you guys are focusing a little bit more on accessibility and putting light I don't want to call them hooks necessarily but at least mantras you know especially on the the first track where you had that line about waving your hand and yet you know your hands are tied and that sort of gets repeated I mean you know a lot of the lyrics seem so esoteric kind of abstract but there are moments where they repeat and while maybe I'm not catching this really strong you know political or emotional message and a lot of the songs like you know lies like that must mean something in order for them to well I mean to go back to Houdini crush like I said you know the line about the hands being tied and yet you know you can't wave I'm saying you know does that line have some sort of significance beyond other lines on the album because it's repeated or um well okay so a lot of that how Aaron and I write it starts out as an improvisation and oftentimes in an improvisation will kind of like get find ourselves stuck on a loop of just like this something that feels really good and it'll end up developing into something like what that is which is exactly it's it that was an improvisation and the lyrics and everything somehow I spit it out and that's that's ended up kind of leading me to write the rest of the lyrics around it so that was that line you spit out in the improv in the improv yeah and it's this weirdness and sometimes like it's not actually words but it sounds like that or write something around the idea that was suggested in the improv yeah that becomes so that's like it so that's a particular spot you're happening you're creating something there yeah I don't know well I'm just trying to say that it's not necessarily it doesn't mean anything more I mean what what's of course people play choruses and they repeat them non-stop for sometimes it's like annoying sometimes I'm good repeat choruses that's the same thing maybe it's annoying I don't know in a sense you know I mean it's it seems it's it's great that you're able to come together with these I guess sort of attention-grabbing abstractions and you know it's through improv you know a lot of your words but I mean on this album in particular was was there where you improv something but then you went back and you actually looked at the line and you know actually reflected upon it as being supremely weird or maybe you know obviously you didn't intend anything because you've improved it but it sort of meant something to you afterwards after having written it or said it yet I mean it's a it's a song by song basis for that to be answered well there are a few songs where I went back or where the improved lyrics were something that I liked and then not something that someone else liked and therefore I had to rewrite them and I had to become more contrived and certain ideas were brought forth and I tried to put them out there and in a well-written way and then other there's another song where I'm not gonna name them because it's kind of like I don't really want to give anybody I don't want to I don't want to gave you something to expect you know right I mean so so another song where I don't like the lyrics at all I don't understand them I don't relate to them I don't know why I'm saying them but I'm really trying hard to if the I mean I personally find your vocals on this record and just in general to be very emotive and you know for a lot of your I mean is there some sort of emotional idea or feeling that you drum up in yourself in order to be able to perform a lot of what you're saying and singing well like the last song nobody I always play telling you talk like you you always say you have to like kind of emotionally prepare yourself a little bit yeah it's like I gotta put myself in the zone just to sing some of this stuff of course and it's it's I think that's a part of performing I think it's a part of us making something believable and and it is believable for me a lot of this stuff is very believable and very relatable um there's just a couple here and there that I'm just like why but whatever I'll still sing um you know one thing that I really liked about this record is that you guys layer so many sounds on top of one another with these two instruments that you've that are uniquely yours and you know you're able to do it with effects and just the instruments and your playing itself able to make so many different sounds so the point where you have so many harmonies or leads sort of on top of one another but it doesn't sound like one homogeneous thing and you know in order to get these unique and just diverse sounds with your instruments was this as a result of just sort of experimenting and you kind of struck gold or was there you know dating back to the to the previous album what was there like essentially a first draft of the buchen case like the are there like Bewkes and is there like a pile of failed versions and then you know these two versions that you now have or like the winning the winners yeah there's there's I mean technically the instruments like there's a dead one yeah I've like my instruments go through like ten or twelve iterations and yeah they've gone through many different like styles of like some are more acoustic sounding some of our instruments are more electric sounding and then we've just been experimenting with different pitch shifters and effects pedals trying to add these layers to our instruments yeah like like my instrument is so little and it started out as a toy you know and then and then modified it to be a six string small guitar and then I just wanted it to have some more balls so that some have happened and I understand on this new record it's a new view as well is that true what's that I went on this new record there's a new buek on the record yeah and well yeah what makes this one different from the from the previous record I mean it of towners the sound of it um well now it's a completely metal body which a friend of ours made and I I think before I was splitting a signal between a piezo contact mic and a pickup on the acoustic one so it was a wooden body with with a contact mic and a pickup for the strings and I was somehow balancing that out and it just had a lot of really nasty tones to it that that were sharp and just unpleasant to hear like all the time and then um so now I'm just using two pickups and I'm they're both equally going out to the effects pedals but it's it's not as I don't know hiccups are attached to the body so it's like picking up this like Christmas yeah kind of about it does but it's also really like it's really Basie and like distorted I mean we're caustic every like repast had like a whole different like arrangement of petals and instrument combination but kind of like this record is a similar setup new equipment but kind of like working in the same setup like we still have you know I'm still stringing my instrument in the same way she's still stringing you know we're still working within the same harmonic palette but it's just kind of like we've we've flushed it out I think the next stuff that we're gonna work on is gonna start changing that like changing the actual instrumentation below it more yeah and like figure out new ways to do percussion and like you know be able to create completely different sounds so you're like so so the next evolution of this project could possibly be like different variations of drums or like the invention of different kinds of drums yeah I'm not gonna say exactly but like yeah we're trying to figure stuff out like how can how can we do more being the two person man mm no I know do the same and not do loose and not do ya still be able to perform wherever you live though though there are loops sort of being used on this new record now and stuff you guys are trying to develop more ways to actually make it more live and in person and sort of like all done by hand yeah a drone right sort of yeah yeah we have like a couple 12 a pedal that will just like play but it's not a rhythmic yeah I know you guys recorded this record yourselves as well correct the new record I mean in terms of what we're hearing on the new album in terms of we're hearing on general dome how much of I guess or the magic of general dome is like in editing or post-production or anything like that or you guys pretty much able to drunk all these sounds through effects of just your instruments alone I mean is the recording pretty much just raw and straightforward and sort of untouched in a way it's more or less I mean the sounds are more I mean 90 percent of sounds are what we do live yeah so yeah so we tried to record as much of it live like we did the bass drum and this and all the string lights together yes and then we did the vocal later no you know there's like textual things embellishments embellishments but uh yeah and then like a bunch of time just mixing because we're just kind of for a weird band the record like it's like you know I mean I've produced other bands before like more traditional set up guitar bass drum kind of thing and like compared to that experience like working with bus is really weird because it's just like a weird like we're like we're all hiding them on low and very little made or something like that as far as well there's a lot of mid to now there's more mid is this kind of like getting the balance of the profession element and the strings and the vocals and trying to make it be as fat sounding as we want to be as kind of a challenge which is why we're thinking about working with some other people because it's it's really difficult to do all of that ourselves can I just say we say that we're thinking about working with other people but we haven't actually started even the process of conceptualizing who we might work with uh-huh just say I mean is there sort of a dream collaborator maybe the more we talk about it the more somebody's there is a dream collaborator for me okay so Chad Blake obviously has a shout out so I mean there's this temptation to to work with other people production-wise I mean is there any temptation work with other people sort of like musician wise or I don't know we've been toying with the idea that I think we need to figure out what the next iteration of the projects going to be like like how we're gonna be the next sounding stuff but I think we just need to record another record and just well we need to write some more music and see what happens but we're not you know I mean we're not yeah it's it's a possible I mean we started out as a three-piece actually we started as a drug we had a drummer so we're not totally opposed to that idea listen to that stuff inertia sleep man that was kind of boring but I mean what you just point out recording new music can we expect a new record sooner rather than later new material I hope so it we're a little slow just disease things that happen all the time like now we're gonna go on another tour and tours are nice and stuff but and they're kind of take you away from home for a while and then you get home then you have to readjust but we just finally got a practice phase that would be nice also we're gonna we're working on new ways of writing so yeah the the the old ways of writing for us which is through improv is concerning because we have to basically play for hours and listen through the stuff and like arrange it together and it's just kind of like I mean it's it's kind of it's probably what's dictated what our music sound like sounds like but and we're interested in experimenting with some new techniques that could be faster so I mean you have space for your hammering out songs but you guys are obviously in a different space right now sort of a workshop for him here where you're hammering out the hardware of what you work with yeah small shop cabin yeah this is my workshop he sleeps on the

yuMJBV-efV8,lappa lux that's all she hi everyone Anthony Fantan over here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new lappa Lux LP nostalgic lappa Lux is an electronic music producer based in the UK I first ran into his music last year through an EP that came out early in the year titled when you're gone came out on brain feeder records and this new full-length album of his which he has worked up the courage to assemble and release is also on brain feeder records now when you're gone compiled a bunch of different electronic music styles together current electronic music styles like wonky as well as future garage maybe a slight baby itty-bitty bit of R&B and stylistically it was just a little inconsistent kind of jumping around all over the place AZ and a handful of tracks on this EP I thought were produced maybe a little too densely to the point where nothing really stuck out in terms of a groove or a melody or really anything interesting because there are so many interesting things are just so many very good sounds all sort of buzzing at once I thought that this new album and when you're gone it's maybe not a night and day difference it was maybe more of like a night and Dawn difference the biggest change on this new collection of tracks lappa Lux organizes his sounds so much better on this LP resulting in most of these songs sounding much more well orchestrated there are clear grooves awesome synth variations that come through and translate very well and what's also awesome is that this album seems to kind of pile on even more genres of music and still manages to come through sounding pretty good not too disjoint it or anything like that because a good couple of tracks on this thing embrace a very awesome alternative R&B sound and the overall result on this record is just an album that sounds blissful psychedelic there is one though on this LP that caught me as being sort of lappa lux letting his maximal tendencies kind of get the best of him the song Kelly broke it catches my attention definitely with how dense it is but I'm still not sure what to make of the song really with all the pitch shifted vocals on this thing and the slow synth funk melodies it does feel oddly sexy but I still can't help but feel like I'm listening to some kind of vapor wave bastardization of the soul glow add jingle another track that kind of kicks off this LP a track that was dropped before this LP came out girl it kind of brings the title of this album home the Stahl chic it's definitely got an 80s vibe to it I felt almost a Peter Gabriel toto kind of thing coming from the synthesizers with the way that they were shaped in terms of a groove and just the tone of them the sound of them but still has a song the beat a progression the sequence it doesn't really hook me it doesn't really grab me honestly this song kind of had me not anticipating that much from this LP when I first heard it aside from a very pretty opener on this album a nostalgic is kind of off to a rocky start thankfully it gets pretty awesome pretty quick right after these songs the song one thing which has a vocal contribution from Jana Andrews is an awesome track and awesomely smooth and sensual psychedelic R&B flavored slow jam not only does he make space for her very beautiful and emotive voice on this song but he surrounds it in sounds that make it feel like it's from an entirely different solar system I actually think the aura the sonic aura this track rivals some moments on the one-and-only kozma grandma there's another R&B flavored track later on the LP with Carrie Latham on vocals and while it is not as Spacey or as I guess intergalactic it's a little more serene and subdued it's really kind of the same strengths but on an entirely different track and with some interesting future garage inspired vocal cuts sort of peppered throughout the song and yes on this album once again future garage music does show up as a prime influence but I feel like honest Shiekh lappa Lux does a better job of combining it with his sort of brain feeder records nature and style because on the song flower you get these burial s focal cuts and chops against this very thick weird bass heavy walk EB and the vocal melody on this thing is absolutely earner infectious and lappa looks pretty much trips through this album consistently with different variations of this wonky future garage combo along with some slower prettier vocal led jams but he brings a few more surprises toward the end of the LP the song walking worlds on this album is is easily just some synthesizer led art pop I love the electric piano on this track the way it skips along on the groove and the very shy vocals with the melody that they're singing that seems very lullaby esque there's also some vocals on the outro track on this thing as well which brings up another surprise with sort of an acoustic guitar right at the start of the song that sounds like it was recorded on like a tape recorder or something there's a bit of a tape hum and lap luck starts to chop up all of these chunks of the guitar playing and the the vocals whether it be during the take that I'm hearing or through some other take that was recorded later in this vocal recording with the guitar and he turns it into a beat itself and it's a fantastically cinematic closer overall I really liked this LP I thought it was easily and improvement past what lap looks did on when you're gone last year not only is it more consistent all the influences that he takes on are brought together in a more interesting and unique away most of the vocal led tracks on this album are fantastic really great intros and outros just a lot of highlights still there are a few issues on this thing with consistency coming together with tracks that actually feel like standouts instead of just filler I'm pretty much feeling a light - decent seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it nostalgic forever 
6KelOf9JfaY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busy piaced music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Cuellar Talk LP Mir which is the latest sophomore LP from a Norwegian metal outfit I reviewed him a while back on the channel back when I had the tree intros really getting nostalgic missing the tree I just got to do this fella talk yeah that might just be the way we do things from now on again this band's full-length debut LP came out in 2010 and at the time it turned a lot of heads in the metal world thanks to some pretty hefty endorsements from artists like Dave Grohl some fantastic production from converges Kurt blew some beautiful cover art from John Baisley of Baroness and of course touring with torch and converge helped along with some of their popularity in the States too but more than anything what grabbed attention for capella talk was their sound a combination of vocals that felt inspired by black metal as well as punk music the tremolo picked leads and the minor chords strummed quickly as well as blast beats totally came from the world of black metal and on top of that a ton of melody coming from the worlds of heavy metal as well as rock and roll not only was this LP awesome had a lot of detail and a lot of replay value but the enjoyment of it is so damn instantaneous it's infectious now the band is back again with this sophomore full-length mirror and they are catchy ER and more melodic than ever and I can understand them wanting to turn up the melody on this LP turn up the hooks because they certainly are what kind of separated them from a lot of other metal acts in 2010 and as a result I do think this album is maybe a little less extreme a little less pummeling and aggressive but it's not like the album goes so far into accessibility that it loses its punch even as the band lays some cleanly some vocals over some very just harsh black metal chords and the opening track here and on the song brain bren which was one of the lead singles from this LP and has an incredibly melodic chorus the production on this LP overall feels pretty much the same which isn't necessarily a bad thing on the last record and this record the guitars the drums the vocals all sound really muscular they're clean they're BBB beefy there's a lot of clarity there and what I find to be so awesome on this album is that the production complements all of the influences all the ingredients this LP so well of course the band is working with Kurt Balu again and he with the group makes sure that the black metal parts are are fast and pummeling that the guitar chords being strummed really faster sharp they make sure that the rock-and-roll and heavy metal riffs have a nice groove to them and that the rich and melodic solos and leads just shine out past the rest of the distortion and the overpowering drums nothing really gets lost in translation as the band speeds up to play something more in a hardcore punk vein and the acoustic guitar which the group uses a lot more on this album feels really warm and sticks out nicely so Feller talk on this new LP their style they're recording pretty much stays intact it's still really good but in terms of songwriting and performance I would say the band delivers once again impressively though some people can definitely say that this LP feels like a sequel to the debut there are some clear moments of ambition on this LP not only does it have a really big introduction a clearer and more interesting flow to the tracks some really long songs as well one that's almost nine minutes the opening track on this LP starts off with sort of an ominous drone that builds up the guitars are just rising and rising and rising in the band eventually breaks into this black metal stick and there are all these really righteous melodies attached to these black metal chords it feels so just uplifting in a way the second track on this LP to play places more major chord melodies against black metal chords and drums of course there are plenty of rock-and-roll riffs throughout this track and the very end of the song there's this awesome guitar flourish ending the track out that feels like I'm listening to the finish of some kind of Southern Fried rock-and-roll tune something like Creedence Clearwater Revival inspired in a way it's moments like this that make me feel like yeah the band really works with a combination of different things but they somehow do them all justice and bring them all together in a way that doesn't feel that corny maybe it might feel like a sort of a bastardization to a purist for any of these genres but the accurate melodic references and the playing definitely shows that valor talk has at least a passionate appreciation for a lot of the things that they're emulating now there are some moments on this LP like the track trip Han which honestly don't really bring that much novelty to the table and just kind of feel like I really heard this from cellar talk before and even though overall I do think valor talk stays in their comfort zone on this LP they still managed to bring just a little bit of extra variety like the tractor which in the middle of it all of these guitars fly in they have sort of a middle-eastern Egyptian vibe to them and go on a pretty awesome instrumental interlude right before the band kind of heads back into yet another black metal inspired verse now toward the end of this LP there's three tracks right next to each other and they are kind of the lengthy trifecta on this album all of the long songs just bunched together and they range from this six to almost nine minute range and these tracks on the album might actually be my favorite I'm not going to spoil every single detail in all of these songs but it's here that I really feel like feller talk proves that they're not just a one-trick pony in terms of writing a short song that just kind of hits you and runs and throws a few catchy hooks at you because a lot of these songs just build up epicly with black metal inspired interludes noisy solos quieter parts loud climaxes and all these tracks especially the longest of the three just stay engaging throughout the closing track on this LP is titled after the band it's a bit of an anthem and maybe the catchiest on the entire LP it really sort of brings all the elements to the table that define valor talk as a musical act it sort of has this edginess of hardcore punk and black metal but is just so rich with melody and an awesome hook that it feels like it's almost got an arena rock kind of vibe to it at this point in terms of the sound that the band has on this album Mir is not incredibly revolutionary but I got to say color talk did hell of a performance a hell of a recording some really good songwriting and they put together a really interesting arc for this album resulting in an album I think is maybe a little more cinematic for me personally this album is on par in nearly every way with the debut though I do think that some people may not necessarily jump on top of it as excitedly because at this point Fela talk is no longer a fresh face in music or the metal world in general I'm feeling a decent discriminate on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it Fowler talked Muir forever [Music] [Music] 
e_c7Fh4dL0c,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new bonobo LP the north borders bonobo is a uk-based electronic music producer who blew up a bit in 2010 thanks to his full-length album black sands which came after a pretty steady stream of full-length albums and EPS which reached back to the early 2000s and even though black sands was sort of the entry point for a lot of people to bonobos music bonobos style was pretty well established by that point bonobo typically puts out very subtle shellacked and groove based electronic music it's very beat heavy sometimes very downtempo and slightly hip-hop influenced and the progressions of the tracks that he creates tend to be a little more hypnotic than they are climactic now considering in 2010 that other popular electronic music albums were caribou swim as well as for tetes there is lovin you the climate the musical climate was definitely ripe for an album like black sands however I can't really say the black sands was resonating all that deeply for me on a personal level the downtempo and trick pop sounds that would pop up on this LP the micro house influences as well just very minimal simple and Airy spacious grooves that it was putting forward and the occasionally jazzy undertones of some of these songs to me the songs on this LP just felt very pretty very relaxing and that's all I can really say about them and maybe that's all that bonobo was really trying to go for however I can see very clearly that bonobo is getting a little more ambitious on this new album bonobos music on the North borders still feels very beat driven it's very serene it's very understated but the sounds definitely feel a little more vast the atmosphere is a little bit bigger and the vocal guest that he brings on to sing on a handful of the songs on this hour-long LP are a little more impressive in terms of performance and and name wise too because he does managed to nail a feature from the one and only Erykah Badu on this album as well as some lesser-known who give some very good contributions as well I have to say on this album bonobo continues to display the beauty that was always there in his music but it's turned up a little louder on the North borders a little to the point where it can occasionally become aunt inspiring like the opening track on this album which has a vocal contribution from grey Reverend who I had not heard of before this track and man am i sad about that that that because his voice sounds beautiful on this song he sings wonderfully or this very delicate instrumental which has this sort of rolling snare on the start of it and the way that it builds up it feels almost like a post rock song until the beat really kind of kicks in with this very low and subtle bass in a way this point in the song kind of feels like a drop but it's not drop into like oh let's rage it's more like let's ah the strange synthesizers the thumb piano the strings on this track it's all beautiful as far as the other vocal features on this LP go of course Erykah Badu's song is a complete standout her very sort of nasally odd vibrato voice is very calming and it's seductive on this track and slides into bonobos style just perfectly and this track is wonderfully colored with awesome strings some harp it's very much electronic music but on songs like this bonobo breaks that mechanical feel that typically comes with this genre and just lays on layer upon layer upon beautiful layer to the point where you're hearing something that sounds not electronic but very organic in my opinion bonobo really steps up his production game on this album when it comes to a song that features a guest vocalist even one of the tracks in the middle of this LP Towers which doesn't have the best vocal contribution on the entire LP still sounds beautiful because the vocal is complemented so well it's really just cradled lovingly in all of this awesome guitar these watery scents and again more ascending instrumentation which just makes me feel like I'm floating on a cloud however other tracks on here that don't feature vocals like m'kay and and Sapphire for example while they're not terrible songs they just kind of feel like passable tolerable future garage inspired productions that I would have in no way been able to guess where bonobos if my life depended on it even the song no you which has a slightly harder groove to it is kind of breezy and forgettable as well I know that bonobo doesn't want to make hard aggressive fast music that just hits the listener but I feel like there's a line separating subtle music and just forgettable music I think the only instrumental tracks on this LP that I really enjoyed were 4:1 Cirrus which I hope I'm pronouncing earlier it was the first song that was dropped before the release of this LP I love the way that bonobo uses space the thumb piano and this really undeniable groove on this track to make a song that is just hypnotic and the song don't wait has a sort of similar quality to it as well with some nicely placed vocal samples chopped and chopped and chopped in but I just feel like this level of detail doesn't show up everywhere clearly from listening to this album bonobo has very good taste in vocalist he has this ability to maybe expose some vocalists that can give great performances that maybe people wouldn't have heard of otherwise and when he works with some great vocalists there are some real flares of ambition and beauty on the north borders however many other tracks on here the instrumental tracks especially I can't really say there anything much more than just Pleasant and on top of that I just feel like there weren't enough to warrant an entire hour of music on this album but here's another opinion hey everyone you're number one calleman here capture Cheston here to say is sometimes Anthony doesn't know what he's doing you know here's the sang and maybe a nice sang but he's like yeah yeah when anthony hears sweetness sometimes he don't get it so that's all I gotta say that's it ooh if you do like your beats if you do like your electronic music a little quieter a little more subtle maybe you dig on producers such as nutria beasts as well as slum Oh bit of burial as well you may totally dig on this LP but just don't expect bonobo to be as gloomy or as experimental I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it bonobo the North borders forever [Music] you [Music] 
Q7UfcEtU8AM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new drones LP I see seaweed the drones are an Australian rock outfit they've been at it for well over ten years now and they have about ten studio and live albums under their belts to show for it as well as an Australian music prize which they won in 2005 thanks to one of their full lengths and this band's earliest material had a really rough and wild garage rock and blues punk sound but they eventually kind of mellowed out on later releases such as Gala mill even though the drones have shown some real progression over the course of their career they're not really in the same spot they used to be the roots of the band are still very much intact because that punk blues garage rock sound rings in really true on one track on here a moat you can stand in which is this four-minute barnburner manic vocals pounding piano chords the track is hard as nails it's like the amplifiers are on fire once they kind of get into this interlude I guess you could say it's a whole lot of noise really it's at points like this that the energy that this band displays as well as the just the very snide vocals the blaring guitars fans of other Aussie garage rock acts like eddy current suppression ring could totally get into what this album has to offer but the slower tracks on here that are a little more dismal with a lot of sullen vocals and very dark gloomy narratives people who are totally in the Nick Cave may be a little bit of PJ Harvey could enjoy this album as well most the other songs on this LP might not be as cutthroat but they kind of display their intensity in other ways through a lot of angry sad and sometimes hopeless feelings and to build on top of that the songs on this album which are very good are typically really expansive sitting within that six to nine minute mark and though I do think a lot of these tracks are interesting instrumentally throughout it's really the band's frontman Gareth lyddiard that keeps me sitting on the edge of my seat listening to the words he's saying and listening to his very emotive dramatic and sometimes over-the-top vocal delivery different tracks on this Opie have different feels to them like the opener on this album the title track I see seaweed which really to me kind of feels like this dark very eerie ominous start to the entire album it's like listening to a storyteller warn the listener warn the traveler that you're about to embark upon a very dark adventure very shy pianos and guitars make dramatic sounds behind Gareth's vocals just increasing the intensity and the tension of the story he's telling which has imagery of stepping into our swamp and the chorus on this track is just explosive it's bombs it's the storm that the verses were forecasting again the band has a real appreciation for instrumental dynamics huge spots small spots subtle intros giant climaxes it's to the point where shorter songs on this LP which were lead singles like how to see through fog while I did like this track is a hook to initially listen to this LP it just feels like a morsel compared to some of the other just long monolithic and intense songs on this album a track like this to me is a good tune but maybe not as explosive and is exciting as other songs on this album and emotionally and sonically they're spots on here like they'll kill you which are very explosive but the tune is just not there the vocals melodically meander in a way that is not memorable at all thankfully these two tracks are like the biggest missteps on the LP after these songs the track the gray leader drops this really heavily emotionally potent ballad in three things just feels so rickety they feel so noisy they feel like they're just barely being held together but things sort of clean up in a way after this instrumental interlude pops in quickly after the first third of the track it introduces this guitar riff which just explodes and soars over this very down in the dumps song and it feels in a way kind of Pink Floyd Ian and the end of the song with Gareth screaming these mantra-like lyrics nothing will ever change your mind he feels so hopeless at this point in the track especially with how he is freaking out vocally on the song the next track like a I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly but I think the song title is a reference to the Russian space dog and if it is the melody the opening guitar leads which are harmonized on the start of the track have kind of an Eastern Bloc flavor to them this song brings even more drama to the table and a good tune as well it kind of takes me back to that opening track on the album where you're getting this really snide vocal and the last track on this LP the nine-minute track is just a killer killer and sad depressing ballot and the perfect ending I actually think that's one of the more cinematic closing tracks I've heard this year it's kind of a piano led track and Gareth really lets his lyrics stand out on this song singing about how people don't really write letters anymore but my friend wrote something like a letter the other day and let me tell you what it said talking about how he saw it or read it in his inbox at 3 a.m. and believe me it's it's more depressing than what I'm making it out to be there's all this imagery of diving into an ocean I guess figuratively just bad dreams days just kind of passing you by losing one's aspirations there are these very pretty youthful female chorus vocals that pop in to kind of break the ice a little bit but then it's right back into the second verse which is even more intense and longer than the first there's the sentiment in the song of wanting to make the world a less painful place it's it's an intense track I keep using that word to describe songs on this LP maybe it's the word I say the most throughout this album but it's it's a well deserved word ordered while I don't think this album is is terribly innovative or original or breaking new ground or anything like that I feel like everything this album tried to do succeeded at it in in such a big way that it can't help but be you know sort of bowed to and in my opinion maybe Gareth isn't the most I guess sort of stand out totally pick him out of a lineup no matter what vocalists but this album throughout had very tight interesting instrumentation some nice interplay great recording heavy sounds and noises a lot of detail richness lushness sharpness memorable songs potent emotions and very good lyricism too when Gareth sort of steps up his game and tries to put out something a little more detailed I'm pretty much feeling a light too decent eight and if you've given this thing to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it Anthony Fantana the drones forever you 
POLivKAD5wg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ken Modell p in trench these guys are a winnipeg based canadian award-winning metal trio and this is their fifth full-length LP and on this new LP they continue to deliver this pretty diverse loud rock sound that has made them pretty popular up until this point and the band continues to make these subtle improvements and tweaks to their sound in their style as they release more and more albums now what may be the most obvious influence for Kent mode on this LP post-hardcore maybe a little bit of noise Rock thus our angular riffs the detailed and sort of technical drums the ferocity the Punk spirit of this album it definitely screams influences like Drive Like Jehu and unsane and the the latter of those two I would say have a pretty strong impression on Ken mode in terms of just the feedback coming from the guitar some of the stringy dissonant guitar leads and the vocals that front me a Jessie Mathewson displays on the south whether he's kind of doing this snarky very spoken word kind of thing now even though I do feel like head mode falls into the genres there are some groups in post hardcore noise rock that I wouldn't necessarily compare them to like piss jeans or the Jesus Lizard unlike them Ken mode does not pray at the altar of chaos and just uncontrolled noisiness I wouldn't say this album is so cleanly produced that it feels robotic or lifeless or anything like that but performing and executing on point being sort of technical being very proficient with their instruments seems to matter a lot to Ken mode and this sharp playing leads to a lot of focus in the very busy riffing or drum fills on this LP maybe a little more focused than I think some people may give when listening to this album because riffs like on the track secret vasectomy and in sort of a blur to the point where they're not incredibly memorable because of how fast and just viciously can mode is playing and all the syncopated drums just locking in step with the riffs can mode hammers tracks out like this like it's nothing however I wouldn't say that Ken mode is 100% relentless 100% of the time there are tracks on this LP that do come off as legitimately catchy like the opening track on this LP counterculture complex which has the sharp ass riff that opens the song up after a sort of viola freakout the guitar has an odd twang to it and man the verses are just pummeling on this track but once they break into the chorus it's like total night and day change nice contrast with all these sad sour depressing guitar chords it feels like getting the crap beaten out of me and then quickly falling into this downward spiral of depression as soon as the chorus pops in and when Ken mode isn't throw on a really catchy hook out there they're putting together a track that has a very sort of repetitive and earworm chorus with group vocals screaming out loudly toward the end of the track like the song or the other track yeah all right thanks very sick some really hard-hitting words from ken mode at this point on these songs but some of the other lyrics throughout the track before these spots can sort of read like angry message board posts written by somebody who has a thesaurus in hand as they're typing fiercely and all caps your insipid hopes and dreams will only serve as a catalyst to an ageless resurgence even tracks like promises of God can feel a little esoteric despite having some pretty straightforward language and a very clear theme to the words overall the lyrics on this LP didn't really move me or offend me all I can really say is that Ken mode plays so fast and so angrily that what the vocals are saying may be the last thing you hear Oh in on at the end of the day ken mode can be really cut through with their speed and they're relentless riffing but there are some points on this album where they sort of slow things down and bring a little diversity to however this is where things can get a little dicey the song the terror pulse is one of my favorite tracks on this LP and it's the only song on the album I would even label as maybe being possibly Jesus Lizard esque this track has a sludgy bassline a sort of mid pace to it all these dissonant sharp guitar freak-outs which are very methodically placed and proficiently played and Jesse rants over the riffs and early and manically and there's a really heavy ending to the song that I liked quite a bit however another track which marks the middle of the album Romeo Must never know this song in comparison with others on here is supremely quiet and the melodic character of the bass lines on the cell P really screams like tool to me like lateralis era tool the whispered vocals and the lyrics on this track didn't really do much of anything for me especially with where they were placed in the mix just so obscured and so underwhelming but the song does have a nice and heavy and tense build to it which really blows up toward the end of the track which I liked a lot but I have to say that the most disappointing track on the LP easily is the closer which is just this slow spacious desolate track in a way kind of reminds me of what Earth was doing on that hex LP they put out a little while back with all of these pianos delicately intertwining with them and I'm totally down with the style I'm totally down with what they're shooting for on this track but a lot of the improv that the piano and the guitars do on this song are so weak they in no way just to find the length of the track especially as these since or synthesized straightens come in later on the end of the song a lot of the melodies that are dancing over this guitar and piano are so undercooked and half-baked its kind of disappointing especially considering some of the strong angular and weird guitar leads that are peppered throughout this album all in all entrenched is is fast it's heavy its muscular for the most part it's pretty well written though it's not terribly original especially when compared to their previous LP s it is an interesting combination of influences and ideas a band that can definitely take the sounds of noise rock and post-hardcore and translate them in a way where the really resonate with a metal fan I liked entrenched quite a bit I'm peeling strong six to a light seven on it if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it the anthony Fantana ken mode forever 
ylHizJmmJM4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Justin Timberlake LP the 20/20 experience Justin Timberlake is a singer songwriter actor entertainer I haven't really been a fan of his my entire life but I guess you could say I grew up with his music in a sense like many people my age who were tons of songs that he was featured on singing through NSYNC which was a boyband that was really hot during the boyband Wars of the mid late 90s early 2000s in sync Backstreet Boys 98 degrees Justin Timberlake is pretty much the sole person out of that whole era of boyband music who was able to kind of make a worthwhile and relevant solo career in 2002 Justin came out with his pretty successful solo full-length debut but four years later he was able to build himself up as more than just a boyband veteran more a creative mind in modern pop music with the LP future sex love sounds which was a very modern record very poppy record a very cleanly produced record with huge singles such as sexy back and showcased a lot of influence coming from artists such as Michael Jackson and Prince it was a mainstream pop record that not only appealed to mainstream pop fans but sort of seemed to get the okay for music critics and music snobs as well and I think that was mostly because of the ambition that had displayed in comparison with other albums in its style all of the interludes the medleys of songs on this album the incredibly long relatively song lengths I wouldn't say the LP is all that deep or engaging in terms of subject matter or lyrical material but if Justin Timberlake's music sits within your usual musical stomping grounds I see no reason why this help he wouldn't sort of blow your mind in a sense because Justin does go into this full-length album and his new one with a bit of a complete vision looking at the album as a whole wanting to have a series of different songs of different styles different flavors that all sort of complement one another in a sense now for this third full-length album Justin comes back again to Virginia record producer Timbaland who has produced more tracks on more albums than a single person can even count and with Timbaland Justin again brings longer tracks some pretty diverse instrumentals and a little bit of a hip-hop flare here and there you've got soul on this LP you've got dance pop on this LP contemporary R&B and a few tracks that very clearly reference Justin's boy band background and I can't really say in three albums or even really since NSYNC Justin's strengths in music have have altered that much if there's anything that stands out on this LP is being a strong positive it's pretty much the hooks good or bad if you listen to this album enough or if at least you're paying attention to it the first time around it's running through the hooks are going to stick in your head and pretty consistently through this entire LP Justin sings in his angelic falsetto which is smoother than a baby's butt however I can't really say I'm all that sold on the maturity that I feel like most people are kind of tagging on to this album and you know he'll that this album itself implies on itself because honestly I just don't see the separator that most people do between NSYNC JT and 2020 experienced JT I mean sure what we're hearing on this album feels a little more glitzy and a little more glamorous but I feel like the curtain is lifted pretty quickly once we start the album off with the song push your love girl which is by all means a catchy song with some sweet vocals on it but the love drug metaphor thing is kind of old tired and it's not like Justin really brings a new angle to the concept and to hear him singing out for the end of the track like cocaine what feels like a red-carpet treatment continues with the next track suit and tie but the more I travel through this song the more I feel like instead I'm kind of you know driving through a drive-through instead and ordering off the dollar menu with I be on my suit and tie and you're dressed in that dress I like and another sort of sex drug metaphor thick that's why they call it a fatty again it just feels a smidge corny and I don't even want to get into jay-z's dumbed-down verse on this track honestly it doesn't even feel like he was trying to drum up a good flow on this song so not only are the lyrics and the topics on this LP kind of weak and don't even come at me with that thing like oh yeah it's pop music it's not supposed to be deep you know that's that's complete to me because there's tons of great pop music out there that makes a strong and urgent and awesome statement most notably some of Justin's influences I don't know beat it is a pretty significant track and I don't really think I need to go into all of the awesomely controversial imagery and statements that Prince put into his numerous albums so honestly I don't really think making pop music gives Justin an excuse for not singing about anything interesting or at least having some clever lyricism now the production on this LP doesn't really hold up when you give it some closer scrutiny either take the song suit-and-tie as an example again the song is loaded with all of this instrumentation that isn't even real either it's completely synthesized with these really shrill bad horns or you've got all these lazily chopped and looped harp samples dancing all around the track that really kind of give a harp sound but don't really feel like they're playing anything significantly interesting musically and one of the other leads singles on this thing mirrors I mean this to me is is just proof that there's very little separation between 20/20 experience JT and NSYNC JT because this song essentially sounds like an NSYNC song without every other member of NSYNC saying and this song and many others on here in terms of dynamic range of sound they're all mysteriously thin honestly there's not a lot of bass on this LP not a lot of kick from the drums and I would actually say that there are many on here that do not have baselines that are at least audible which is kind of surprising for a record with a dance-pop flavor where the basis is really what kind of gets people moving grooving it's what creates the physical experience with music it's what rumbles and your bones and and gets you mmm feeling the music for me a pop record with no bass has no case the lush production isn't here and it becomes even more apparent when justin comes forward and copycats Michael Jackson on the track let the groovin where we're getting this mishmash of a very joyous and fun and happy percussion I mean he might as well be screaming the same a madman who's not over it and the song because of the lack of bass fails to come through with just an infectious undeniable groove despite all of the sequence percussion just rattling away throughout the track the only semi natural feeling song in this entire album is the song that girl Justin's voice sounds really good on it soulful sounds like he's having a lot of fun with the track I like the melody and I feel like the song owes its melody a little bit more to just nostalgia than it does great writing but still the song goes over without a hitch Justin can be a good singer when he's not bogged down in cheesy hooks or bells and whistles like the closing track on this thing whose instrumental is incredibly simple with all of these ethereal sort of droney serene reversed pianos just sort of twinkling away there's some resonant bass tones coming through on the track that are pretty nice and justin sings over this instrumental beautifully with a lot of emotion i'm really feeling this tractive as one of the moments where the 20/20 experience actually came through with some very pretty clarity but for an album named the 20/20 experience there are just too many instrumentals on this thing to have a very sort of unclear murky quality to them like the song tunnel vision which has these very obnoxious female vocal samples dancing all around the track mucking up the rhythm kind of hacking away at it in this really awkward way to me it kind of felt like it was shooting for something that felt as if it were inspired by the combination of hip hop vocals and samples and baroque instrumentation from Lana Del Rey maybe even Death Grips in a sense not a direct influence but what they were doing with these repetitious vocals felt kind of Death Grips asked with how overbearing they were but at the end of the day it maybe sort of felt kind of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy inspired but nowhere near as well executed you didn't after listening to the cell P numerous times I just can't say that Justin Timberlake is a pop innovator or even a pop Prince this LP is just light music industry groomed entertainment however I mean that's what I feel Justin kind of set out to do that's all he really tries to do I don't think he builds his music up to be this highfalutin thing that even people who listen to music a bit deeper can enjoy justin is just making the music he wants to make as an entertainer he lacks pretension in my opinion it's critics in the music industry that sort of tag on this higher quality level implication that typically gets talked about when you're discussing a new Justin Timberlake album however I don't hear any of the qualities that would actually make the 20/20 experience that the sounds are lackluster they're average the lyrics when they're not ridiculous are just kind of not that clever and the songwriting is is hardly undeniable or revolutionary at its best it's enjoyable and as an added thing the 20/20 experience is hardly as eccentric or as interesting as the artists that influence it the most venturous thing this album has going for it are the song lengths and this is Justin's longest album yeah and I do see that he wants to do something maybe a little bit stronger like I said earlier than most people in his musical ranks however because of all of these other things being an issue for me to hear an 8-minute tune from Justin just does not feel that interesting plus most of the tracks on here follow the same structure when they go longer the regular normal verse chorus verse structure of the song sort of goes on for five minutes or so with an intro possibly especially on the track suit and tie and then the remaining two or three minutes is kind of this weird interlude or variation that sort of ends the out which may or may not be as interesting as the song you just heard prior to it over-over overall I just wasn't feeling this album honestly just kind of a light five to a decent five on on this thing but if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next for sure there were only a couple tracks on this LP that I disliked but most of the album just kind of breezed by me but here's another opinion hi everyone couch attested here and you heard opinion from Annie the internet music nerd but my opinion is that Anthony is a hater and he doesn't like good music PAP and he is bias guy with lots of he likes music loud and bad and not good to hear and when he hears good sweet music he thinks it's bad but it's really good how can you argue with that Anthony Fantana Justin Timberlake forever [Music] 
Z7K44xyMBKs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a thing that I kind of call a quickie segment where I talk about a lot of tracks a lot of albums that I haven't talked about recently that I want to talk about but let me tell you this quickie it's been a while since I've done a quickie since like you know got caught up with South by Southwest stuff and haven't done one since you know that was kind of barreling down on me so this quickie is going to be a long e so let's let's get straight down to business do this as quick as possible let's do Earl whoa new Earl track I actually liked this song more than chum and I'm actually pretty excited for Doris I'm not even lying not even lying to you I know everybody says oh Anthony Fantana hates a future better than but like I'm legitimately interested and what earl is going to do on this new LP because of what he did on Chum and because of what he did on this new track in my opinion not only is Earl a pretty decent rapper he's a decent rapper and I think that with these two tracks he has exemplified that he can choose good beats but what's even more exciting about these tracks and just the build up of this album is that I feel like Earl is just refreshingly no  he just wants to make good tracks he wants to write rhymes that he thinks are interesting he's not interested in the BS he's not interested in the drama he doesn't get bogged down in all the crap and all the just tacky subject matters that to me makes so many other odd future records boring as long as he heads down the road these two tracks that he's dropped so far from this new LP have been going down that I think Doris is going to be pretty solid sure his laid-back kind of monotone flow is not going to be for everybody that's kind of his style but I actually think he sounds pretty nice doing it next savages she will awesome female post-punk band from the UK they dropped a few tracks last year that I loved this new track of theirs is great as well maybe I'm not loving it as much as the previous material but it certainly lives up to it stylistically now the band has a new LP coming out in may on Matador Records keep an eye out for it I'm just loving how moody and dark and sort of depressive this track is give it a listen especially if you love the dude to Joy Division's okay all right next passages I have a driver open barroom this is a pretty weird black metal ambient dark ambient project this is a track from the project's new LP tour give it a listen it's long it is just pummeling it's really hypnotic as well it's a seductive track I love how not only business stick to that old black metal lo-fi sound but it manages to use just the lightness of the low five sound and the distortion of the lo-fi sound and repetition with the drums and the guitar so just make something that is mind-numbing and just sucks me into this really dark blizzardy world next teen Carolina awesome indie pop outfit bit of progressive synth flavor in there music but if post-punk flavor in their music they have a new EP on the way on carpark records this is the title track from it it's got a lot of flavor to it they played this song during their live set that I caught at the consequence of sound showcase which was really good like tearing in person like tearing it on this studio version of it so I'm looking forward to that EP next the knife have a new track out a tooth for and I and oh man it's bitchin I like it even more than the last track I like the more sort of acoustic natural sounding drums on this track I think the song is a little more straightforward a little less Avant and out there a little more sharp concise I don't want to say catchy but it really kind of got me into the groove of the song a little bit faster the previous track they dropped I was like what's going on what's going on what's going on what's going on this is weird what's going on where's this track you just got me seduced me right away I was like yes yes and all right next rusty has a new track out triads it is a burner so you know if you like nurse then give a listen to this track it's very colorful it's very flavorful though it does hit hard and it does have a lot of bass like you would expect from rusty he brings those very rich bright golden shiny synthesizers that made his glass swords album forgot the title for a second the glass swords album so good so enjoyable next young fathers they have a new LP coming out on the way on anti Cohn records their track that they dropped before it the guide it's good give it a lesson it's a little more of a ballad not so much straightforward throat cutting hip-hop like some other stuff from tape one that's more of a ballad like I said but it is sweet it is uh pretty emotive so give that a listen next we're gonna answer these guys are a dark Nordic full outfit and their new LP is out now that's what it looks like in this track down here answer is pretty awesome okay very deep very sort of jeroni very hypnotic though there is a bit of black metal flavor and that is not a surprise considering the bands that some of the members of this project have been in mmm few black metal bands sort of in the related artists under the belt I think people who don't like black metal can't enjoy this track because of how funky it is because of how just primeval it feels alright next Dillinger Escape Plan have a new track out called Prancer new LP on the way one of us is the killer now if you like just metal metalcore mixed with math rock I know that doesn't sound that good on paper sound a little gimmicky sounds like something I make you might make you want to throw up but this track is actually really good they're taking those metal elements they're taking those math elements and they're taking some really heavy hitting distortion on the guitars and just making something really abrasive I love the syncopation of the drums and the riffs and I love that these guys can really rock a freaking an odd freakin groove okay next blue Willa these guys are an experimental rock band from Italy combining elements of low fine music noise rock as well as folk music and you can string their whole album in full on the needle drop calm blue willa it's a pretty interesting listen have a pretty eccentric female singer fronting the band as well there's some definite personality there and finally for our last piece of the tracks segment Seguros has a new track out Brendan Starr now I'm going to pronounce it but a lot of people are hyping this track up not only because Seguros is coming out with a new LP in just about a year's time from their last full-length album which was pretty heavenly and I liked it quite a bit but this new track of theirs people are digging on this track and people are hyping this track because it is going in a darker direction sigur rós going in a dark direction and while maybe it's not the darkest thing I've ever heard maybe not as dark as some people are making it out to be because you don't see his vocals on the track you know really kind of keep it from going deep into the depths of hell while it is noisy and is a little tortured to kind of hear you'll see is cherub voice calling out over the song does give it kind of a heavenly element not necessarily a bad thing though it is a pretty interesting track and most definitely moodier and I think maybe a moodier record coming up soon this year might be a nice change of pace so yes I didn't dig on that track quite a bit all right let's get into the whole albums part of this thing Kavinsky outrun this guy is an electronic music producer specifically in the range of French house music and his early EPS which were pretty good struck around the time that this style of music was pretty popular thanks to people like justice as well as danger Sebastian but convinced keys approach to the style of music has a bit of an 80s chic on it especially when it comes to the synthesizers that he typically lays on his tracks a lot of the sense on this LP feel like they could have been lifted from an 80s slasher film or a sci-fi film but the thing is unfortunately Kavinsky is not as proficient a producer as some of these other artists that I just mentioned in terms of hard-hitting beats in terms of detail in my opinion and I just don't feel like this album struck while the iron was hot unfortunately an album like this should have been out at least three or four years ago and the problem is made worse by some really really weak vocal features on this thing - we grapping weak singing I'm just not feeling this LP worm Sona someone for you this is the new LP from a band that kind of rose like a phoenix out of the demise of the group bare wires which was a garage rock power pop outfit and warm soda is pretty much the same though I would say they boil things down a little bit further just to the whole power pop stick the songs on this LP are straightforward they're catchy they're ear were me I would say my one big issue with the album is that the production is not that diverse it's a little flat it's a little low fie and it tends to get kind of old by the end of this very short LP still there are some pop rock gems on this thing specifically the title track give it a listen Dan Friel total folklore you may know this guy as the ex frontman or is the dance altogether frontman parts and labor and it's a pretty oddly shaped album with a 13 minute long opener as well as a bunch of strange interludes peppered throughout the rest of the album and it's a group of electronics instrumentals which are incredibly abrasive distorted harsh on the ears but also kind of bright melodic and rich I do like the fact that Dan enjoys noise I do like that he is a knob twister he has an ear for sound but when it comes to melody and structuring a song I do tend to feel like his melodies are either feeling very much like something I would hear in parts and labor or are kind of like children's music inspired or something they feel very childish and not in like an insulting way more like in a way where he's coming from a play of pure innocence when he writes his melodies and I can't say that resonates with me particularly but I think it will with some people especially maybe people are huge into Dan Deacon or something like that if that does appeal to you the new active estimating as worthless EP circadian tremors these guys are in New York baroque pop and folk outfit very lazy vocals huge instrumentals lots of horns pan of strings I reviewed a full length of there's not too long ago a lot of their stuff reminds me of Moldy Peaches as well as Smaug there's some very earnest lyrics throughout this EP as well the only difference between this EP and their last full-length I would say is that the instrumentation is a little more lush a little more ambitious I would say overall the recording is a little more solid too however that's not necessarily a bad thing because for the active estimating as worthless to come out with a series of tracks that are pretty much in the same vein on an EP as the tracks from their last LP is pretty nice because the LP it's good the new Bilal LP a love surreal this guy is a singer-songwriter specifically a neo soul singer who has really colored some tracks that I love and projects that I love a lot he appears on clips hell hath no fury he's worked with common as well the roots too and I absolutely love his voice on that logo's LP that I talked up a little while back however this is the first time I'm really trying to get into his solo stuff and in listening to this new album I'm hearing this sort of future funk soul fusion that reminds me of people like Prince as well as Erykah Badu however I think when he's left up to his own devices just by himself especially when he goes into the sort of faux futuristic territory his melodies are a little uninvent rescind underwhelming his lyrics especially on tracks like West End girl are kind of cringe-worthy and while I do like this guy's voice I think it's best in kind of smaller doses because to hear him sort of multi-tracking his background vocals on top of his foreground vocals is really distracting and takes me out of the feel the song fortunately I'm just not feeling this one the new Derrick field for album ROG hoping pronouncing his name correctly this is his sophomore full-length LP I believe and he is an experimental music artist a Noise music artist and in comparison with other noise artists his music isn't incredibly harsh it's very spacious but also kind of claustrophobic and dry as well not a lot of effects on the noises and the strange sounds and vocals that he incorporates into his tracks it's all very straightforward it's all very in-your-face at time sort of overbearing and mind-numbing I feel like he has a really interesting year for sound but I would love to hear him just use effects more to kind of color things up a little bit because with how plain and sort of dry like I said some of the sounds he uses can be things can at times come off sort of Sammy Sammy with where they sit in the mix and how they feel but still if you're looking for something that is noisy and sort of methodical and then very sort of mmm cerebral give us a listen and the new Caleb Kish mixtape k+ this is her debut mixtape but I first heard of her on the internet album purple naked ladies via a vocal contribution which is a pretty awesome early appearance to have in the music industry and she has done it even bigger on her new tape over here with appearances from Earl Flatbush zombies production from some pretty big names as well however I wish Kish was as good at rapping singing and songwriting as she is networking because a lot of the songs on this LP do not stick I mean it's very pastel shallow hip-hop that has no real guts to it no real passion to it it just sort of seems like you know she's making music because she thinks it might be fun for right now if you've heard Kitty Pryde then you've basically heard every single thing that Kish has to offer on this tape but I would argue that Kitty Pryde is more interesting has more clever lyricism and is a little bit more bubbly and fun this instead is just really sort of fashionable and flat and and yeah that's that's it those are all the albums that I want to talk about in this segment thank you for watching Anthony Fantana quickies forever you 
X5KUrx-2Z9M,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comment thing haven't done one of these in a while asking what you guys think of hype you know buzz it's like when you go on the internet and you're looking for music and it seems like no matter where you turn people are talking about this artists doing this thing in this album and it's everywhere it's on TV it's on the it's on the radio it's on every single blog you visit I'm even talking about it maybe right now in the major musical media sharing internet age where we have things like Harlem shake and Yonkers and little B we have this ability to totally make something like I guess sort of an overnight sensation an artist can just be totally buzzed off of the heat of one single song or music video and I want to know if in your opinion this is a good or bad thing not only for the artists that is getting buzzed or getting hyped is it a good thing for music fans musical listeners the music listeners win out at the end of the day because this sort of seems to be a regularly recurring thing is this good for the music industry as a whole now in my opinion this kind of hype this kind of overnight sensation whether it be through sharing mp3's or whether it be through just views on YouTube something like that it does show to me that in a way people do have choice and the people do have power to kind of force the trends that resonate most with them as opposed to like a trend being handed down to us via a record label or something like that no matter how you feel about the buzz of artists like Kendrick Lamar or Odd Future for example they did kind of have a pretty naturally occurring fan base underneath them before they kind of rocketed into superstar television record label type Fame however as we all know deafening hype or you're just hearing an artist all the time everywhere they're collaborating with everyone featuring they're putting out records that are topping the charts it can kind of you know attract some haters but aside from that another issue is that we all know that for every one single Kendrick Lamar there are ten other artists that may get the same bump of hype that Kendrick did at the start but for some reason or another they totally get mulled over and we never hear from them again or we hear from them again and it just seems that this time around nobody really cares even artists that are more well-established and on major record labels and have an album release that comes out and maybe is successful or semi successful it's not like they're hyper their buzz is gonna last that long past the release of their album like take Justin Timberlake for example right now his LP is really really hot right now but think forward to next month or even the month after that people are gonna completely forget about it and think about buzzing over the AAS or Daft Punk who have a new LP coming out in May Kid Cudi as well and just any number of artists who seem to have some kind of crossover listener base with Justin it's just one hype cycle after another and it seems like right now in terms of the whole music industry that this is the most profitable model that we have going for us in the internet age with record sales following with piracy rising while I guess right now we do have more choice and more variety as listeners the thing is that a lot of record labels will totally jump down I mean really desperately pounce upon the hype of an artist without really considering things like talent or work ethic or stability within the music industry take an artist like Kreayshawn for example not only did it take her too long to come out with her new full-length after the buzz over her single goochy goochy but the thing is a lot of the hype wasn't necessarily translating into pure fandom which resulted in extremely lackluster sales of something about Cray when originally drop only selling several thousand copies you've got azealia banks as well who took much too long to come out with a full-length after - one - dropped plus some volatility with a lot of her twitter fights it really all kind of built up to getting dropped from her label and as much as I am a fan of these guys Death Grips as well knowing they're kind of angry noted sort of renegade style and how much their fan base sort of questioned them moving to Epic Records you know I think some people could see that there was a storm a-brewin with the whole NOLA Deep Web thing so is all this hype just blowing up artists we've never heard of before left and right really helping the listener is it exposing us to stuff that we would have never heard of otherwise exciting stuff or is it drowning out albums that are really more worthwhile and from the artists perspective are these hype cycles making careers or are they really breaking them because like I said earlier for every one artist that we can point at that has made a successful career out of their initial surge of hype there are many others who sort of seem to get bulldozed over and thrown under the bus because people don't really care about their next release or don't really care about their first release by the time their hot debut single is is no longer relevant or popular plus if you're an artist who gets a lot of hype in one of these hot new micro genres that people make a big deal over like chillwave or alternative R&B or which house to come out with a full-length a debut full-length that is just really popular but to want to change directions on your next album considering the fly-by-night fans that sometimes come with hype cycle some people might not be that receptive of your new direction and just want to kind of hear something that sounds like what initially got them hooked on your stuff so again hype is it good or bad is it good or bad for musicians is a good or bad for the industry is a good or bad for the listener and what separates an artist to successfully rides out their hype and make something long-term of it versus one that kind of crashes and burns or just fizzles out anthony Fantana hype forever 
1wcik0kXxng,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new David Bowie LP the next day oh hey David Bobby David Bowie is a songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer and this is his 24th studio album amazing fantastic and his first studio LP in ten years and when it comes to living rock stars there are a few who are as big and as relevant and as impactful as David Bowie the dude supported great musical acts produced a few awesome records and made plenty of classic albums himself I'm not gonna get too deep into this guy's trajectory his back story his back catalog because I just rather get into this new album because this new album is worth talking about in a recent video I talked a little bit about David Bowie's new track that he dropped before this album where are we now it kind of underwhelmed me was feeling a little met on the track and I made a comment on the song saying that yeah while it didn't move me I'm not really expecting an immensely amazing piece of music from David Bowie at this point in his career anyway he's pretty much come out with his amazing records already he's made his impact on music what does he really have to prove at this point this statement confused some people didn't really understand why I would feel that way but considering how tame I felt that this new track was it just didn't feel like to me that David Bowie was planning to over reach his abilities in any way on this new album truth be told the next day is actually a really pleasant surprise especially considering how underwhelming David Bowie's last full-length LP was musically and cover art fully now is the cover our there's a new album any better well I mean it is kind of lazy but mmm at least it's trying to make some kind of statement a statement that becomes a bit clearer once the album is listened to and maybe a few fantastically classic albums from David Bowie's catalog now what goes on with this new David Bowie LP contextually actually reminds me of an album from another alternative rock star Lou Reed the blue mask came out in 1982 and on the blue mask Lou Reed took a long hard look at some of his past albums that were great but he went about it in a way where he tried to recreate this magic in a more mature way without being as wild or was reckless or as I guess swanky as he typically was and there are references to this newfound maturity in the lyrics as well a musing about the dulling of his his wild side I feel like this issue is also kind of attacked and discuss on this new David Bowie LP particularly on the song the stars are out tonight although David Bowie seems to be singing more about this kind of complacency coming from being famous being set stars and celebrities who are sexless and uh neuron stantly being thirsted after by the public but themselves personally very broken up on the inside and dysfunctional and the music video itself for the song seems to portray this mundaneness that typically gets attached to everyday life so there is definitely a sharpness to some of the lyrical themes that are on songs on this LP the track where we now seems to have a bit of a personal sentimental feeling to it for David Bowie and on top of this there are other moments on this album that feel just like classic David Bowie glamorous poppy rock songs like Valentine's Day or you feel so lonely you could die which is an awesome ballad in three four the title track on the cell Pete has some really punchy heroes flavor drumming on it the song if you can see me showcases that are rock side of David Bowie that occasionally pops up and and shows that it's very much intact with some very fast-paced drums weird abstract vocals and some odd synthesizers bouncing all over the place over the years David Bowie has showcased a lot of different personas personalities and on this new LP he shows that there for the most part pretty alive and well there's a lot of evidence on this LP that David Bowie is still very much in tune with many of his best moments in his back catalogue and a lot of the time he does seem to channel that energy especially with awesomely spunky tracks like the title track and really emotive vocal deliveries on the stars are out tonight which is really one of the major moments on this album when it comes to age not really having an audible effect on David's voice but there are a lot of songs here on the cell P that I mean it kind of feels like time has not really been that big of a friend to David Bowie when it comes to his performance and artists like Doctor John comes off really freaking raspy and his recent stuff and Bobby Womack sounds fantastically emotive on on his new LP as well and Scott Walker completely whacked but amazing unfortunately in the case of David Bowie he no longer seems up for making those grand flamboyant over-the-top vocalizations that would typically make his song so emotive and powerful though I will say the really solid Tunes that are throughout this album they make his voice tolerable and at least the production is kind of a saving grace it gets the job done all the instrumentation the bass the guitar the drums the extra keyboards as well with the last track a bit of string work to it all sounds pretty nice the only downside about the production is that occasionally it feels a little tame and David's voice I mean it clearly tries to compensate for it at times by burying it a little bit if there's any other issue that I have with the production on this LP it's that at times it can have a little bit of an edge Liszt's adult contemporary feel to it very just mundane sounds coming from songs like where are we now as well as I'd rather be high those songs to me just have no guts whatsoever there are other tracks that are more interestingly colored instrumentally like dirty boys a song that in terms of a beat kind of lurches forward has these heavy chunky horns blaring and blurting throughout the track the only issue for me with this song and maybe a few others on here is that it ends a little abruptly and structure-wise it's it's kind of skeletal for a David Bowie song a lot of songs on here feel a little bare-bones actually not really reaching for some of the supreme lengths or the big climaxes that would typically be at the finish of an amazing David Bowie song if there's any other major issue that I have with this LP it's that there are a few what-the-fuck moments which you know is kind of a typical thing for some David Bowie albums and it's kind of hard for me to bury some of these moments into the back of my head considering that in comparison with other David Bowie LPS the next day isn't really incredibly cutting edge or graceful I'm talking about tracks like dancing out in space which in terms of subject matter and hook I'm just like huh and I have no clue what's going on with the background vocals on the track does the grass grow at least the LP ends pretty well with the track key which seems like this really dismal spacious new-age inspired epilogue to the entire LP the previous track really seems like more of a proper finisher for this LP whereas the song he seems to be this more abstract self analyzation for David Bowie this album could have been maybe a little bit better if some of the songs were longer and a little more fleshed out and if the production was just a little more creative outside of that I think we're dealing with a pretty good album here I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's about it David Bowie the next day forever [Music] 
plxG23-nifs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new strokes album comedown machine The Strokes are a New York indie rock and pop rock band whose full-length debut album is a perfect or a near-perfect album for very many people the band's debut LP is this is loaded with extremely concise catchy and sharp as hell rock tunes that stick into the back of your head with magic ear worm guitar leads great beats and of course Julian Casablancas hisses trade mark Kroon the band's sophomore full-length LP further solidified their place as a worthwhile act in modern rock but in my opinion things kind of went south around the time of their third full-length LP and unfortunately for others things when even further south when the band put out the album angles just a couple years ago which is kind of a polarizing LP for a few different reasons contextually because when the band reconvened kind of came back from their hiatus to start putting out music together again Julian Casablancas said in an interview with Brian missile on NBC News that pretty much the band got back together because of the money but the LP is also polarizing because on angles The Strokes started experimenting with their sound in a really big way they started using more synthesizers incorporating elements of New Wave music which were really huge players when Julian Casablancas came out with a solo full-length and just overall they were distancing themselves from that original sound that people kind of grew up loving from The Strokes I personally really liked the diversity the angles brought to the table and I was also hoping that that would be a really likable factor on this new LP as well especially considering how much of a surprise the track one way trigger was when originally came out not a perfectly executed song but the acoustic guitar and the really bouncy synthesizers as well and Julian Castle mrs. freakin falsetto vocals on that track a lot of people were comparing it to aha steak on me which I don't really see at all I mean I think the fact they have an explosive course that has a falsetto on it that's really the only thing that you know feels similar to me between those two tracks however that's not to say that The Strokes don't have really clear influences on this new LP on other tracks they most certainly do for one new wave is still a pretty big influence on many songs on comedown machine the song welcome to Japan has a really huge disco backbeat on the track the opening song on this LP tap out with the guitar Lee it's been an intended then it did then the guitars on this track are a dead ringer for at least a couple different Michael Jackson songs and on the song 50/50 The Strokes had never sounded so Punk if angles was a sign of The Strokes kind of letting go of their inhibitions which were penning them into their original style then come down machine is a sign of them dropping them almost completely I guess The Strokes kind of went into this LP with a problem and that problem is that they want a different sound they want a different style they just want to do something different in general but for me the issue as a listener is that I don't really feel like they're all that picky with their solutions on paper is the idea of incorporating a falsetto vocal on many of these tracks a bad thing know however is Julian Casablancas is falsetto all that well some most of the time no it's it's not Julian's falsetto is very very off on a lot of these tracks to the point where it sounds kind of ridiculous especially on the closing track where the band was definitely sort of going for this vintage sentimental jazz style ballad that is very very little joy like it's like I'm listening to the recreation of some kind of song that I would hear playing through some old tube radio something like that but in my opinion the song kind of gets lost in its own nostalgia it hears what it wants to copy but it's not listening to itself because if it was it would hear how much of a mockery it is and the other track that the jerks drop before the release of this LP all the time which in my opinion is really the only song on this album that sounds like a traditional strokes song it feels completely flat lifeless it's really the only stroke song that I've ever heard that I would label as being almost completely soulless there are some tracks on here that I do think are just generally enjoyable though they may take on a little bit of influence somewhere else but at their core they feel like just nice catchy stroke songs tracks like tap out happy ending partners in crime slow animals as well these tracks are proof that The Strokes are still writing competent catchy pop rock songs that in a way I can kind of in the back of my head hear them play these tracks and they're older more traditional style and what's even worse than these very surface level changes is that a lot of the alterations The Strokes make to their songs it's not like they come off as versatile enough to actually execute well what they're going for they haven't refined a lot of these songs enough to the point where they don't sound silly like on the track slow animals where Julian's background and foreground vocals intertwine with one another in a really just lazy bad way or all of the weird talking sort of welcome to Japan sort of narrating vocals on the track welcome to Japan it turns the song into a bigger cornball than it already is and the title track on here could have used a bit of refinement as well it would have been a beautiful beautiful ballad had the band cut it down from a minute length and really just made it a bit punchier and in terms of punch I mean Julian isn't really there either emotionally though his falsetto vocals are there it's not like he comes off as I guess sort of bold as he usually does on this LP in comparison with previous strokes releases he's much more shy understated which is an angle that works for a lot of artists on a lot of albums but I don't find it to be particularly effective on this one you know overall I think the songwriting on this LP is is okay I mean it's it's what you would expect from The Strokes the songs are decent and the production overall is really good - aside from some ill placed vote effects and some vocals that feel drown now from time to time the guitar sound great the drums are punchy and clear the synthesizer sounds stellar I love what is that that organ on the title track on this LP - with the arpeggios the instrumentation sounds great and maybe that's really the only true saving grace that come down machine has going for it but the thing is the band ends up stubbing their toe on all these changes they want to make and it's not that the band wants to change in general that makes comedown machine a kind of week album it's that it doesn't really feel like they care if any of these changes sound good honestly there are moments when I listen to this album especially with the vocals that I feel like The Strokes are just kind of screwing around a little bit I'm kind of feeling a strong for - a light five on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it The Strokes comedown machine forever

aEPCT7qnE04,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of a new little EP from the band dope body Saturday these guys are a Baltimore band their 2012 album natural history was easily my favorite loud rock album of last year came out on Drag City Records and now they're following that full-length up with a little 7-inch EP two tracks on it really more of a single but they're calling in DP or the two tracks on this EP are titled Leatherhead and youth relic are they gonna be on a new full-length LP are they just kind of a thing of their own I'm the good dude addicted to this bands combination of psychedelic rock sludge metal as well as rock and roll with this sort of party hard Andrew W K attitude but kind of with a caveman like edge its guttural it's heavy and that's pretty much the overall impression that I'm getting from these two new tracks as well if there's any huge difference that will be apparent to dope body fans and listeners from just putting these tracks on first thing it's that the recording quality is a little bit different it can feel a little shoddy with how the drums are kind of overtaking the guitars here and there the vocals are swallowed in the mess the haze of all the chaos of the instrumentation a wee bit and there's some ambient sound around the drumming as well it's like this track was recorded in a basement or something with only a few microphones on hand still despite the fact that this is not the best recording no body has ever worked with they still bring their a game in terms of ferocity and energy and just bringing that heaviness that is really trippy and kind of surreal in terms of strangely shaped guitar riffs and odd guitar tones as to be expected these two tracks feel like a really sweaty party this pumping into the air losing control and awesome guitar grooves except maybe with this recording it doesn't feel as powerful maybe slightly dulled a bit now in regards to the track leather head it's got kind of an obvious riff groove and chord progression on the song then that definitely kind of gets stale by the end of the song I thought it's not exactly the most unique of riffs but the band really kind of dances this groove out with these 16th notes on the hi hats on the drums some really hefty kicks if anything saves this track it's that the band brings an explosive psychedelic Cooke has a lot of energy a lot of guts to it that I love I actually ended up enjoying the song youth relic a little bit more I liked that the song built up to a huge climax at the end the guitar leads were a little more interesting kind of diddling away with this really quirky melody that made the song feel maybe a slight bit nutty the throbbing bass line on this track is awesome as well I just love how this band is just so massively just heavy metallic sludgy cock rock just kicking ass all over the place but it's so blatantly psychedelic and experimental too dope body just has this knack for bringing together elements of weirdness abstractions but also just visceral and as long as they have that and they keep bringing surprises and good songs to the table maybe the recording quality is it going to be the most important thing in the world I am pretty much feeling a decent too strong 7 on this little EP dug it quite a bit it's more of a fan pleaser in in my opinion it's really not gonna pull anybody that is unfamiliar with dope body to the table in the way that I think that some of their full lengths will that's pretty much how I feel about the CP what do you think about it did you love it hate it why what should i review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana dope body forever

THDwpjCNaSY,Hey it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music director and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion and yeah in this video to brand freaking new tracks from Vampire Weekend they're coming from the band's forthcoming LP third full-length LP modern vampires of the city the songs are titled step and Diane young dying young it's acute play on words this band dropped their first full-length LP in 2008 rubbed me the wrong way ever so slightly wasn't really into the way that they were mixing all these indie pop elements with African music and ska music a little bit of reggae as well it felt a little hokey but when they came out with the album contra in 2010 I totally did a 180 on how I felt about the band's music I felt like these elements coming from music from various parts of the world that they wanted to incorporate into their albums were executed so much more tastefully the production was a little more interesting more textured better drums better synthesizers the songwriting in my opinion became a little more eccentric I thought Vampire Weekend was blossoming into just this very bold pop act they were showing personality and a lot of songwriting strength and that made contra one of my favorite albums of 2010 so now of course I'm excited to hear this new LP of theirs coming out in just about three years later modern vampires of the city it's gonna be dropping this May and the two tracks they've come out with from this LP I'll start with the song dying young great track proof that Vampire Weekend if anything can write a pop song that is completely accessible its melodic its lush it's fun it's multi-textured but it's also just really energetic and intense it's accessible it's fun and it's bright but it's fierce as well I think another example of them succeeding with this kind of formula is with a track like cousins the hard ass drum beats on this track some of which feel like they're coming from a drum machine hit really hard have a sharp punch to them I'm loving the way that Ezra is just all over his vocal range on this track with these ridiculous chorus vocals babe but the ban kind of feels like in a way they're copying this old rhythm and blues band kind of sound but doing it in this very new modern just fun playful kind of way especially considering they're using all these weird pitch shift effects on the vocals which I guess in a sense they were using on contra through auto-tune which really did not agree with me all too well on the track that they used it on but I'm actually feeling like the way that they're executing some of these pitch shifts on this particular track it's just way more experimental it's weird it's a lot more I guess smile inducing it's kind of funny in a way but it makes the song no less catchy occasionally popping up some very refined synth arpeggios if anything Vampire Weekend is is really great at writing pop songs that sort of hint at this sense of upper crust hmm snootiness in a way where it feels like they're simultaneously embracing it celebrating it but kind of you know making a mockery of it too by making pop music they just change gears instrumentally so often throughout this track and just keep it so high energy throughout it's an awesome couple of minutes I really really love this track I love the blaring horns or synthesizer horns on this song it's just got a lot of flavor - it's got a lot of punch now the next track on here that I have to talk about in this video step it's the slower of the two songs it's the longer the two songs it's the sentimental and tear-jerking ballot the lyrics here especially play again with that kind of privileged upper-crust kind of background ezra with the lyrics that he's singing though throws in this colloquial terminology like you know you're stepping to my girl or I'm gonna front and name-dropping things like Berkeley and then communist reader and in the previous track that I was just talking about living like the Kennedy talking about that Kennedy kind of lifestyle the way the Vampire Weekend mashes speech and cultures together from different classes in America um there's a lot of people see it as kind of tacky or offensive or a little I guess lacking in self-awareness but I actually think it's the exact opposite I think they bring all these things together in such a way where it just all kind of seems silly sort of in the same way that all of these snooty privileged and kind of sheltered characters in the Wes Anderson movie can seem kind of silly with their various personal dilemmas and actually I would have to say that listening to the lyrics in this song kind of feels like I'm reading through the script of a Wes Anderson movie and even though that may be the case and I do sense a little bit of a tongue-in-cheek this - what Ezra is saying in this track it doesn't change the fact that I feel that this song is is very romantic it's very sentimental and pretty clever at a lot of points - I love the hook on this track where Ezra says the gloves are off and the wisdom teeth are out and the amazing library says stale conversation deserves but a bread knife it just makes me maybe Azra flats the whole snobbish set thing a little too hard at times on this track talking about punks not being dressed for the weather but I love how slow this song moves and how refined a lot of the Arrangements around this track feel with all these Pachelbel inspired arpeggios dancing all around the track I really admire Vampire Weekend for bringing together all these elements that people do not necessarily assume on paper will work and then actually you know mix them and stack them into a really well-crafted pop tune despite the fact that Vampire Weekend's influences continue to be very very very obvious I think they're growing to be an even bolder pop outfit with these two songs that they've just dropped from this forthcoming LP because I feel like these songs really sort of play off of a lot of elements that I loved on contra but has refined them into something that sounds even better hopefully every track follows the level of quality that I've heard on these two tracks I love this track as well honestly that's really all I have to say about these two new Vampire Weekend tracks if you've given them a listen what did you think did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next what are you thinking that this new Vampire Weekend LP will hold are you anticipating good things bad things let me know Anthony Fantana Vampire Weekend forever need a shave 
mHicFE6i0nE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ryan woman where I is a pop music duo who is responsible for a few of my favorite singles of 2012 and this is their debut full-length LP the two singles that drop before this LP open in the fall the songs that I love on this album that I heard before this album it seems rise pretty quick to place these songs right at the beginning of this new album and just follow it up with all this new material which I suppose sort of makes sense since these songs were the inception of rye in a sense but before these two songs existed rise two members were involved in other projects first Mike Melosh whose name I hope I'm pronouncing correctly is an electronic music producer he hails from Toronto he has a few albums under his belt who has an incredibly feminine voice and Robin iake is a singer and producer and they were both relatively under the radar until they came together with this project and songs like open we're getting a whole ton of buzz on the internet but what was interesting as they kind of put the name of the project and just the name ROI first before themselves and make no mistake rye has caught on because of the power of the songs that drop before this full-length album but still it definitely goes to show kind of the power of a fresh face musical elements of previous projects from Mike and Robin show up on this LP through electronic music soul music pop music as well but on here you're getting a much more refined take on these styles it's much more sophisticated there are moments that are very very baroque touched gently and lovingly with strings and horns there are moments where I'm hearing some jazzy woodwinds as well there are moments where it kind of reminds me of Jesse where a little bit or has a bit of that throwback flavor of the latest destroyer full-length and sort of gender bends in the way that perfume genius or today and the Johnsons sometimes do however in comparison to those two artists I will say that Riya is way more subtle way more soft just much more smooth and pleasant on the ears silky its buttery it's like fresh ice cream there is a certain kind of sexiness that right rise to push forward on on nearly every track here it's a youthful sexiness that is simultaneously unsure of itself at times feeling a little shy especially from the vocals it's basically the dorm room lovemaking soundtrack that will be pumped through many a laptop speaker for the duration of this year RIE is really good at conjuring sexy sensations but there are times when I feel like maybe they don't bring too much to the table other than that because when it comes to subject matter and sound and songwriting this LP can get a little Sammy Sammy and it's not necessarily because I feel like there's no talent here in this project I feel like there's an incredible amount of potential I just think that RIE can get a little lacks here and there on some of the songs because maybe the sensuality that they want to convey to their listeners come so easily there are some tracks where I sense some real ambition coming from this project like on the opening of the track open which ascends the album so high into the sky with horns and strings it's a beautiful introduction it's inspiring much more inspiring than some of these slightly lethargic dance grooves to come afterwards and the song the fall which I definitely think could have gotten away because it is such a good song could have gotten away with just putting the bass groove the drums and the piano out there and sticking with that instead RIE covers this song very sweetly wrapping it like a ribbon with strings and horns that pop up so subtly throughout the track it's beautiful now honestly these two tracks that start the album off are really as awesome as the album gets when it comes to this particular vibe I feel like there are a lot of songs that come afterwards that try to continue the same theme but to varying degrees of success like the song last dance which comes right after the song has all the synthesizer horns I think their synthesizer Lawrence they sound like it and in comparison to some of the horns that come on the previous tracks they feel so measly and when I have our voice on this track and others is interestingly androgynous you know definitely has a personality it has a sound and he is an able singer I mean he has no issue with pitch or anything like that his voice is pleasant but it's very rare that he actually pulls emotion from a place that feels really fiery or passionate the moment where you hear him saying make note to me that's like really about the fiery ISTE gets on the whole LP some of his vocalizations at the end of the track shed for blood which has this abrupt ending to it that I didn't really care for are nice but as some of the tracks on this help you get a little simpler get a little more stripped back instrumentally they're not as decked out in strings and horns no doesn't really fill in the gaps with any incredibly moving vocal performances he seems to be just as quiet sort of coloring things lightly just as if he were a piece of instrumentation in the background this doesn't lead to any terrible tracks on the LP but it just makes many of the songs here kind of agreeable breezy in one ear and out the other the only song that I really disliked was three days which had this synth groove to it and then them just not interesting enough to be replayed and replayed in the way that it was had a bit of blue-eyed soul to it a bit of disco to it the track I mean I actually prefer the beauty and the spaciousness of the song one of those summer days which heads away from the dance grooves it's just these lone guitar chords with just a little bit of sense dancing around in the background subtly and in comparison to some of the more sleek and sensual songs it's much sadder much more there's pretty on a track with this emotions and they've our very shy vocals go over so much better and my other favorite track on this LP has got to be the closer the title track which has these awesome progressive synth arpeggios all over the place it's like as inspiring as the opening track again it feels like I'm ascending but this time up into space the horns are stellar on this track - it's really wondrous ending it has the inspiring wonder that I wish was a little bit more consistent throughout this LP because I feel like I get hit in the beginning and I get hit again in the end and the whole trip in the middle is just not that memorable there is a lot of potential here this album is produced really well the singing is good the grooves are there but sometimes the songwriting and the vocal performances can be a little underwhelming I feel like Wray wants to appeal constantly to this very vague sense of steam eNOS it's like they want to get sexy without getting hot I'm really kind of feeling a light too decent six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it rye woman forever 
rCMg6TmRl4c,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and i've been awake for the past 24 hours gonna get to bed soon but i just want to put up this video really quick telling you guys about myself by southwest 2013 experience here it goes South by Southwest magic clip show magic I decided to pretty much ease myself in on my first night my Tuesday night with a DJ set from toki monsta which was actually fantastic really high energy just banger after banger after banger occasionally sliding in some familiar stuff i believe she played a little bit of tonight maybe some flying lotus but was mashing it up in some really interesting ways i mean not a single complaint with with how she performed shortly after that later in the night i was able to catch Marnie stern playing a little bit of new stuff on the other side of Austin and actually took my girlfriend and I a while to walk all the way over there it kind of ate into a majority of her set but the songs I was hearing really had a strong garage rock and psychedelic rock vibe to them I ended up going to the north door for my first time that week I would end up going there later but this time I was down there to catch Matthew Deere and Nicolas jar who both kind of had DJ sets awesome amazing sounds fades grooves it was just some some sexy moody dance vibes so that was pretty much my first entire day the next day I went down to the consequence of sound showcase at the parish a few bands I wanted to see this week were there one of which were white lung who played an extremely energetic badass just in-your-face punk rock set and after that we caught up with the band teen who were playing in the same venue but upstairs I was actually kind of on the fence with what I had heard on record from them aside from a few tracks which I really loved from the album they put out last year but in person they were really good just post-punk vibes coming from there acts as well as just progressive synth voice as well unfortunately my Wednesday night and my girlfriend's Wednesday night were cut short by giant splitting headaches and because of that I ended up missing out on guys like Kareem Riggins I was planning on trying to see in a cave later that day but chances are that show would have been so packed it would have been impossible but still he was on my list there were other people I wanted to see that night but anyway I guess it was sort of a blessing in disguise that I did catch up on my sleep because I ended up having to head down a little early for the showcase that terrorized and I put together over at the Museum of human achievement starting things off as the band creative adult group that I had never heard of before terrorized brought them to the table they had some really awesome post-hardcore noise rock influences in their music a strong Drive Like Jehu vibe for sure they were really just energetic and chaotic if you're into piss jeans as well look them up shortly after that came bad bad not freaking good people were piling in everybody was just watching them very intently as they started off kind of quietly very easily but eventually getting pretty intense throwing some more covers in there their Flying Lotus cover there tonight cover their infamous gucci mane cover which caused a big mosh pit which may have been started by these guys and not too long after i was introduced to the coat hangers who played a fantastic set awesome post-punk sound coming from this bin totally reminded me of groups like the raincoats or even the slits a little bit really awesome performance noisy hectic weird definitely look them up they have some new material on the way and after that came mr. lies reppin Connecticut on the bill mr. lies played and while I wasn't as impressed with his record when I heard it just by itself I really liked his live set because the sounds that he played the house inspired grooves that he was working with came off really lush really vibrant he just had a really great sound in person after that came open mike eagle who played a fantastic set on the stage really energetic really getting really grow growling sometimes and Milo actually performed a track with him and it was pretty triumphant you can see so with this picture and Milo himself performed a set which people were pretty excited about he was really interacting with the crowd getting in people's faces hugging a few people here and there his producer on one of the new EPS that he put out Reilly Lake was actually performing the instrumentals from that EP live in front of everybody Antoine came on not too long after that and man he just has this really dark Spacey approach to ninety style hip-hop that I liked a lot a lot of people are really just impressed with his vibe which is fantastic clipping performed its clipping and man they were freaking loud ear piercing the harsh noise that turns up in their music was tenfold in person to the point where was really testing the thresholds of a lot of people young fathers ended up coming on later there were one of the bands that ended up getting added late to the bill but still performed a fantastic set held nothing back tons of energy my girlfriend and I actually caught them at the north door before Matthew dear and Nicholas jar where they played a fantastic set there as well so it was just exciting to get them to play the showcase that terrorized and I were putting together as well they came all the way from Scotland plus they've got a new record on the way on anti con and they were playing a ton of material from it and it sounded fantastic in person I can't wait to hear what it sounds like on the freakin CD let's continue later that day I went down to the metal showcase over at the dirty dog I caught the band howl who had a really awesome mixture of not only death metal but thrash there were really heavy really loud new record on relapse records I believe and then I caught ken mode who were awesome in person man they were heavy the post-hardcore the noise rock just the unsane it was really fantastic in person and I'm really looking forward to reviewing their new LP after seeing this blazing live set now after that I ran up to to the north door a little later that night to catch this New York hip-hop Renaissance showcase that Action Bronson he had a really short set but performed well a lot of tracks from his rare chandeliers tape after that the underachievers played they said they had played almost five other shows prior to playing this one you could tell a little bit but still they got the crowd going and a lot of people showed up to see him but for me personally that night Joey badass Pro era CJ fly they really stole the whole show for me they were a fantastic headliner even though Joey badass had very clearly been losing his voice at the point I didn't even think it was him when I first heard him rapping but yes it turned out to be a very hoarse Joey badass my next day at South by Southwest was filled with a few of the bigger names at the festival there that week I tried to catch all J over at Waterloo Records but I only ended up just hearing their set on the other side of a fence unfortunately they're actually a few artists I caught like that Earl pissed jeans as well anyway one band that I did get to see in person but kind of far away was Vampire Weekend who had a very short kind of impromptu set on one of the upper floors of the convention building they did play a new song though at the very end of their set which was actually pretty good a lot of very lush piano chords on the hook from what I remember a really good track and later that day I ended up catching divine fits as well as Jim James over at the auditorium sure stage but really I was there to see Flaming Lips and what was even more fantastic about this set is that they played their new record the terror in full track for track and had kind of an all new stage show which involved a lot of weird colors and lasers and LED lights and this weird set of tubes hanging off of Wayne in the front with lightning kind of going down them and him holding a fake baby and it was kind of a strange experience actually too strange for some of the people in the crowd a lot of which were kind of piling out after the third song or so later that night I went over to Vice land and caught Danny Brown playing a set even though I caught this guy last year I had to see him again this year because last year there were technical difficulties the beats weren't working the back beats weren't there the instrumentals weren't there so to see him over some of his newer tracks as well like wit it was fantastic it was heavy it was loud and he played a little material from his new record as well that actually went over really awesome when his DJ was spinning that and with the exception of seeing a few bands at the deathmatch stage at the scoot in pretty much my entire day was spent my entire last day was spent at the 11-hundred warehouse I ended up in the afternoon catching Big Freedia didn't really play any new stuff but that's not the point when you see Big Freedia you're there to party and shake your booty obviously and then after that once the venue switched hands over to ray-ban and boiler-room who were putting on the show that I was really anticipating all week I ended up catching Mount kimby who played a pretty good set despite some technical difficulties some issues with the monitors not being able to hear what they were doing completely and of course the whole thing ended off very last show I saw before I came back to Connecticut Death Grips and the whole thing was crushing sonically and physically not only did they have these weird pill balloons that mimicked the pill logo that came on a sticker with their album the Money Store but flatlander was there who has been mysteriously missing and some of the Bands more recent live performances but Zach Hill obviously is not on stage and what the interesting thing was during their performances that Zach Hill was performing drums along with them live on skype so you were hearing Zach's drums as well as the samples and the beats that flatlander was pulling off and of course emcee ride right front and center getting in people's faces spraying beer everywhere was chaotic it was animalistic not only was it just pure insanity going on in front of my eyes but the sound system they had at the 11-hundred warehouse for this boiler room show was amazing the beats that Death Grips was playing it was just blasting in every single direction I don't know whether or not there were speaker systems set up all around the room or if it was just the layout the warehouse that was making it feel like the sound was literally everywhere I felt like I was in the middle of the Death Grips instrumentals in a nutshell that was my entire South by Southwest I want to thank the people at South by Southwest for you know doing doing the whole press accommodations thing that they've done with the needled rep every year allowing me to come down cover the festival to the best of my abilities I also want to thank the people that played the showcase that terrorized and I put together who I wasn't able to get on camera either they weren't able to perform due to some kind of you know crowd dwindling thing or backline issue or I was just kind of busy you know handling various things throughout the show I can get them on camera people like automata Gucci or C+ as well as weekend money hot sugar as well who did play an awesome set and do sensei and I also have to thank the people who were generous enough to want to sponsor the event lurk hard and official if you went to South by Southwest this this year this past week just recently who did you see who's your favorite act of the whole week what was your favorite event who did you talk to oh yeah in this past week I

04flJC_4pv8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the internet sleepiest music nerd and it's time for a sleepy little review of the new Autechre LP x i Autechre is an electronic music duo hailing from the UK who for decades have been creating everything from experimental techno to IDM glitch music and through the many full-length albums that shaun booth and Rob Brown have produced together over the years they have proven themselves to be extremely extremely creative and explorative personalities when it comes to the world of sound and sound manipulation and that applies both to percussion just the Tambor's the textures that these guys put together in their beats along with synthesizers which typically have a pretty phat analogue sound to them when Autechre is putting synth chords and melodies together and the way that these guys manipulate synthesizer sounds it's really somewhat of a lost art in my opinion something that was much more prevalent back in the 90s when a lot of people perceive Autechre to have been having their their musical heyday but what I feel that makes Autechre different than many other artists that are on a similar sonic journey is that their search for sounds their exploration for sounds tends to be extremely extremely methodical sort of like a chemist looking for the perfect amount of the right element to create the just right right right Chain Reaction for some kind of extremely complicated equation now the sounds and the textures that Autechre works with have evolved over the years sometimes deciding the overall path of entire full-length albums especially like a few of their most recent coarseness and oversteps both of which had a much more ambient and experimental feel to them in comparison to some of the more beat oriented work these two LPs also combine elements of glitch and IDM which typically show up in Autechre x' music but no matter how little or how greatly these guys change on a given full-length one thing kind of remains the same it remains constant and that is the emotional quality of their music rarely is aught ecers music very visceral or visceral in the way that we typically see visceral music it doesn't get your blood pumping it doesn't get you thrashing about like a punk song would or you know really hard hip-hop beat would or a metal song would or like a dubstep song or even a traditional techno song instead Autechre shoot for something that is much more cerebral much more thought-provoking something that is going to attract extremely analytical listeners like flies to a dead corpse and those extremely analytical listeners may be very pleased by the challenge that Autechre presents to them on this new LP which is two discs and two hours long I'm sure hardcore fans will completely soak this album up but Excise is not for your casual or maybe even first-time Autechre listener possibly for the most part Autechre is sticking to a lot of the same genre confines that people place them into the glitch the IDM the experimental or avant-garde techno a touch of ambient music - they constantly look for new and different sounds to engage the listener with on one track after another through this 17 song affair however there's not an immense amount of emotional variation throughout this LP there are some tracks that stand out past others in the fact that they may feel a little bit sweeter through some synthesizer chords others like the opener on here have a bit of a drum and bass influence I feel but the drums that would be no typically being a drum and bass song are replaced with noisy sharp glitches and Autechre presents slower moments as well like the clothes are on this album which feels like to an extent kind of a synth Odyssey still that doesn't stop this LP from kind of feeling like an overnight cram session and that's because even in its most upbeat and intense moments ex I really only kind of gets my head bobbing moderately the stimulation that the album brings to me is much more of a inside of my head my brain just really starts kind of firing off electricity in many different directions because of all the sounds that they hit me with and the array of sounds the Autechre bring to the table does make this LP pretty ambitious it's also ambitious from a length perspective although I think some people could charge this album is not really being that outside the box for Autechre in terms of just the way their music feels it's still very cold it's still very kind of scientific and because of that does become sort of difficult to say what is a highlight on this album and what is it there there are tracks on here like IR light which are 10 minutes a song that Autechre presents right at the second track of this LP and this song with a handful of others man these guys are presenting these 10 or 12 minute monoliths something that they kind of gravitated away from on some of their more recent releases and I'm actually happy to see them return to this style because they really know how to develop a track and make it interesting from beginning to end but still always kind of remaining very abstract and kind of chilly that's not to say that Autec errs music doesn't have humanity to it it most definitely does there are patterns that are pleasing and easy to get into there are clear chord progressions that do have sort of a logical progression to them however there are other tracks on here like prac F for example which when it comes to grooves or patterns or anything like that feel incredibly irregular the beat on this track feels like it almost skips a beat and the way it moves it's this track and maybe a few others like it on here where I feel like I'm hearing maybe three to four different elements of beat maybe a few different synthesizer phrases and it feels like the only thing they truly have in common is a tempo and that's about it and as I listen through to this LP again and again and again I sort of began to see a little bit more of a pattern between some of these tracks where maybe some of the synthesizer melodies or the beats backing the synthesizers seem a little bit random I guess another standout on here is the song tes X I which to me has kind of a tropical flavor to the synthesizers sort of reminding me of that loan album that I dug so much last year it's really kind of got this Caribbean feel to it but eventually the track gets kind of dark sort of murky submerging itself back into the ocean where it came truly where this album finds its magic is in the variety of sounds and flavors and speeds and intensities that it brings to the table like I already said I feel like I'm repeating myself again but I have to bring this point home that this is what makes this album appealing though on the whole it's not anything altogether new for Autechre it's still coming from that same emotional place where I feel like this album reaches a new maybe a subtly new and higher level of awesomeness is in just how freakin detailed it is because of how cold that this album can feel some people may sort of tune it out just in general because it doesn't really bring the attitudes or the emotions that people typically look for in music anger happiness sadness love maybe a little bit of lust this album has little to none of those things however that's not to say that it's not beautiful or inspiring or extremely proficient from a technical standpoint and well produced really it's it's all of those things I can't help but stand in awe of just its vastness of its expansiveness the amount of electronic nooks and crannies that have been placed throughout this LP can be listened to and observed for months upon months and still not be fully appreciated or understood and in my opinion that's actually a pretty fantastic feat it's like this never-ending puzzle it brings this constant sense of intrigue to the listener all of these things add up into what I feel has been one of the more unique experiences I've had with electronic music over the past half a year or so I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's about it pucker X I forever you 
Fm8qgVeig3g,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new men LP new moon the men are a New York band and this is their fourth full-length LP and over the course of their relatively short career up until this point they have showcased a serious neck for emulation and versatility meaning they know how to play a lot of different styles of music everything from noise rock to shoegaze to psych Rock garage rock as well maybe a little bit of post hardcore country the band is really difficult to place stylistically and I'm not sure if they want to be placed anywhere especially given the fact that their last full-length album was easily their most diverse so far but on top of that the men make another surprising change of pace on this new album as well the men actually kind of go country for a good portion of this new full-length LP there are numerous tracks that have harmonica maybe a little bit of piano of the honky-tonk inspired variety some guitar chord progressions that have a very very funky flavor to them however I wouldn't say the band gets too caught up and they're chameleons like nature to copy these different musical styles they're Punk garage and Lofa roots are still very apparent in their kind of rough playing that can be a little loose at times on tracks like without a face and the seeds the men definitely head out west but they don't forget to bring their New York attitude along the way the song without a face has this screaming harmonica playing against these guitar riffs as well as drum beats that just chug along quickly like a train and have some real tension and the song seeds with it's kind of strange imagery coming from the lyrics with these seeds of my mind and the vocals which are singing these lyrics in a sort of eccentric way it's one of the weirder tracks on this LP Plus on top of that the acoustic guitar playing in the background on this song is is really really loose adding to this kind of endearing sloppy quality that this track has however there are many other moments on this album where when the men go country it really comes off as like city slicker country about a city slickers you're gonna get city slicker country in the highest order like the opening track on here open the door door the playing on this song especially coming from the piano is so freakin timid I almost thought it was like kind of a joke song the singing on this LP actually turns really really sour on the track I saw her face which was a bit of a surprise because typically the men's vocals are are usually on point it's not like they're beautiful or gorgeous singers or anything like that I mean a lot of their vocals do have kind of a punk a garage aesthetic to them but when they're trying to sing clean like this sing maybe a ballad it's it's not really going over too well the singing is actually really weak on other moments here too like birds song and the playing the performance of the instruments on this track is especially freakin weak the way the piano and the harmonica open up this song it feels like I'm listening to just a really bad bar band play this horrific alt-country that slaps the genre of country in the face the band starts to pull some teenage heart strings circa 1958 with the song high and lonesome which is a cute little instrumental and then miraculously the men start to kick some ass they start whipping out that punk aggression with the track of the brass it's a track that in comparison almost every other song on here just makes the seiz'd run red with blood but honestly from a melodic standpoint it's it's really not much of a tune there's there's not really anything memorable about it but it has an attitude it has an aesthetic to it that the men pull off so much more convincingly than many of the country tracks on this LP the band's rough around the edges sound takes a sort of rock-and-roll twist with the song electric which dropped before this LP it was a good song when it dropped it's still a good track kind of like the song the brass the tune isn't really a standout catchy stick in the back of my head tune but the band has electricity to the way they play together when they go for a more aggressive rock sound after having reviewed three full-length albums from these guys it just feels like at this point that I'm destined to just get a mixed bag of tracks on every single new men album which wouldn't be a bad thing if all of them were as consistent as open your heart but especially on this new LP that doesn't seem to be the case it doesn't work in their favor for them to be embracing genres where they're not really that comfortable and can't perform to the extent that they should to make an entertaining song this shows up in most of the country flavor tunes on this album and the last track as well which is this just hard-hitting eight minute long psychedelic rock song with a garage Punk edge to it and while I do like the fact that the band wanted to go out and do a jam it just doesn't feel like they have the musical chops to make a song of this style that is this long engaging from front to back because a lot of the guitar phrasing gets kind of old after a while the drums feel just too static and the song itself becomes just a bit of a snoozer after several minutes with a guitar riff that just screams mc5 kick out the jams given the fact that I felt the album leave home that came out a few years ago was pretty good and that open your heart was a great improvement upon that and was more adventurous had better tunes on it I thought the men were ready with new moon to write a fantastic record I mean a tip-top record but in in my opinion it seems like their ambitions to create this musical group that is is hyper evolutionary changing in this a great way with every single release kind of caught up with them in a way because it backed them into a corner in which they weren't really able to live up to the genres they were trying to copy performance wise the plane wasn't there to back up these new sounds that they were shooting for and it just resulted in a very lackluster record in my opinion I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's a the men new moon forever 
aDn2lSqXhe4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for your review of the new Shlomo EP laid out schwa mo is an electronic music producer whose name completely confuses me and what confuses me even more is that I can't even really say that he has a set style because when I first heard of this dude's work back in 2011 up to today where he's had a pretty steady stream of releases he's embraced everything from glitch hop to ambient music maybe a touch of drone as well as future garage sawaki as well it's come to a point where I am very very impressed with this dude's versatility and if there is a constant thread running through much of his stuff it is a very deep appreciation for all sounds shadowy nocturnal with maybe just a touch of atmosphere his productions do have a tendency to be on the softer side as well now of course this new EP of his jumps on board with some newer musical trends but of course he twists them into the somewhat melancholy moody vast and open vibes that typically come from his music for example Shlomo kind of hops on the bandwagon with nuanced alternative R&B which is pretty hot right now with a guest vocal from how to dress well a guy who was really ahead of the curve when it comes to this whole alternative R&B thing the song is called don't say no it's gone semi viral on soundcloud where it has racked up tens of thousands of listens and it's for good reason because the collaboration goes off without a hitch it's like slo-mo and how to dress well though maybe someone wouldn't think off the top of their head to combine these two artists they both have an appreciation for mesosphere ik tracks texture also plays a really huge role in the releases of both of these artists and that is apparent on this new track as well right from the get-go with these very watery synth chords how to dress Wells vocals just flow on top of these chords they're sleek they're a motive their high pitch they're in this very very nice falsetto it feels way more OnPoint than some of the stuff I remember hearing from his last full-length LP I reviewed last year I just like the mid-range that his vocals come through with sometimes it's really really painful in a way not in a bad way in a mood in an emotional way but how to dress well can reach up into those very very high notes where his voice does tend to get kind of feathery now on top of this Shlomo takes what feels like chunks of improvisation x' from how to dress well as vocals and just turns out the distortion on them makes them really just kind of obscured and plays them against his voice throughout the track and it's to a really nice effect especially as Shlomo's synthesizers are swelling and getting heavier and really creating an ocean for how to dress well vocals to just swim through and what I love so much about this track is that Shlomo and how to dress well create for this song such a seamless seamless progression it just slowly gets more intense gets heavier gets deeper gets sadder and once the beat finally goes hard and kicks in all these traps style high hats are twittering away the final form the final groove of this song is a killer and makes this track a great opening track just to stand out in slum bows discography in general trap is another thing that plays a pretty significant role on the five tracks of this EP this is especially the case with the track later which is the first song that dropped from this new EP and maybe my favorite production on this EP one of my favorite productions of this year not only does Shlomo lay out a detailed trap beat on this thing with the high hats and the snares just clicking and clacking away but this beat is causing a ruckus against these scents that are so busy much busier than you would expect a trap instrumental to be the synth arpeggios and the synth leads it's all really epic and Shlomo complements these greatly produce since with this awesome awesome vocal sample and man he plays these vocal cuts like an instrument I love the melodies that they're singing I love the way that they're placed in the beat it's just so freakin drum marek I actually think this is sha Mo's most emotionally powerful song yet because as he introduces these vocals the beat gets heavier it's it's sort of a drop in a sense it actually hits me with this overwhelming sense of oh that's so pretty Shu Ouma with these vocal samples and the synths and the trap beat I mean creates a perfect rush now my issue with this EP is that I feel that shlomo surrounds these songs with a few lackluster ones as well I feel like there are some filler songs on here given that they are working with roughly the same recipe as later and don't say no but with less layers it's not like he switches gears or anything the gloomy flavor trap music is still there in a sense the production kind of reminds me of the things that happen at night that I review from my low earlier this year except maybe not quite as detailed or as layered the final track on this EP does make sure that things are leaving off strong out of hand is a solid freaking track and though it does have like I said some of the elements of the previous songs it does have way more layers and a much more interesting progression to it than some of the other tracks here it's not really so much the similarity that bugs me but the comparative amount of detail in one song versus another and I like the beats which around the middle of this track - which changes all the sounds into something much more murky much darker than what the first half of the song was it's a surprise and a really cool change of pace overall this is a very very enjoyable 25 minutes of music feeling a strong seven to a light eight listen why don't you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it schwa mo lead out forever 
mP7tl9-luZE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Steven Wilson LPD Raven who refused to sing Steven Wilson is a modern progressive rock figurehead multi-instrumentalist producer singer songwriter frontman of the infamous porcupine tree and over the years responsible for penning some of what people consider to be modern progressive rock classics mostly in the late to mid 90s and early 2000s since and I personally know a lot of people who who hold porcupine tree and Steven Wilson in very high regard very high artistic regard which is why I've always found it to kind of be a personal tragedy of mine that I've never really enjoyed his music no matter how much I listen to it no matter how much I revisit it and the thing is it's not that I don't appreciate the genres that he typically toys with I love progressive rock I love jazz rock I love the sound of a group of very talented proficient musicians pushing each other's limits performance wise that's why I listen to Frank Zappa as well as soft Machine and Mahavishnu Orchestra and specifically artists that mr. Wilson takes a ton of influence from like Pink Floyd as well as a little bit of rush some Jethro Tull and King Crimson as well ranks are very high in the league of influences Steven Wilson likes to wear on his sleeve he takes a ton of cues from these artists he essentially with these artists does his progressive rock homework he's memorizing he's cramming he is mastering the art of regurgitating the musical ideas that these artists perfected over their careers and taking influence from the artists that move you emotionally as a musician is something that pretty much everybody does to an extent but doing his homework is really all I personally feel Steven Wilson does especially on his most recent solo efforts grace for drowning and the Raven who refused to sing Steven Wilson seems to have made a career out of just being a student of prog and that's it none of his music to me personally showcases the turbulent tides of real life or personal experience pretty much everything Steven Wilson has put out on his most recent stuff to me is is just a product of studying just very close study of the art of old-school progressive rock and the music actually suffers because of it even though Steven Wilson is really great at creating this music to an extent it's not like somebody who's actually familiar with this era of music would mistake this new album for an authentically vintage piece of progressive rock the sounds throughout this LP in my opinion are actually really flat and kind of unimaginative there's not much in the way of interesting production on this LP the drums sound really flat really plastic they don't have a lot of body to them they feel as if they were recorded on a shoestring budget in a home studio and other elements in this LP like the faux mellotron sounds and the very pristine piano chords that sound like they're coming out of a synthesizer it's kind of like that fake cringe-worthy kind of piano sound as well as the very pristine shimmering guitars it all just to me says knock off knock off knock off not only do the sound say that but compositionally this album says that to me as well the bass lines as well as the drumbeats and fills are incredibly incredibly textbook on this LP and the vocals in my opinion consistently lack passion Steven Wilson has never really been one of my favourite rock vocalists and it's because his voice kind of hangs in this very high range but isn't particularly a motive or attention-grabbing in terms of inflection or just putting a powerful voice forward for the most part it feels like the vocals are there because they should be there according to the progressive rock blueprint that Wilson is working from whereas I feel he has the chops to make this an instrumental album if he wanted to or at least employ a vocalist who is better at singing than he is which with all of his musical connections I'm sure could have done you know honestly when it comes to emulating Stephen Wilson has a gift I'm not surprised he has fans he's really great at emulating he can play he can arrange according to these formulas that he has studied and memorized so well audibly aside from maybe some nitpicking that I have with some of the sounds not being lush enough or being interesting enough there's nothing technically wrong there's just a severe lack of adventure and and Soundcraft on this record that just hangs over every song in a really annoying way like the track watchmaker which actually was one of my favorite songs on here a very pretty acoustic ballad opens this song up but it just kind of feels like vocals by greg lake with lyrics by peterson filled with some acoustic guitar peji Austrade out of the robert fripp playbook and then a flute comes in which makes the song feel even more formulaic and really takes me out of the sweet tender moment that mr. Wilson is trying to make this song become I like the lyrics on this track quite a bit Stephen is telling a beautiful story that feels very aged archaic kind of romantic but the years of ice that have kind of built up over my heart when it comes to listening to stuff Stephen Wilson has made because of just the lack of surprises that comes with his music he syncopated drum hits and then the bass riffs on the opening track here right at the start of it which feels a little like rush inspired in a way maybe the bass is kind of repetitive not really altering as much as I would have liked it but at least the song hits a good groove and starts the album off at a modest pace and the song drive home the way the track starts off with these piano chords it's very atmospheric and these guitar solos just come in whaling soaring over all of this rock instrumentation it's really kind of floyd esque then a King Crimson desk acoustic guitar interlude comes in smattered with a little bit of horns it's very beautiful it's very detailed but I feel like I'm taken out of the moment right away because this acoustic guitar flies in that feels like it's arriving on a train schedule or something like that again a great idea a great idea that I feel has tested and proven to be great on other records for me personally it's it's hard to enjoy this LP because I feel like I catch Stephen Wilson with his hand in the cookie jar just too many times I would say the most modern thing about this LP that isn't so distracting with all these prog rock stereotypes is the title track which is actually a very pretty piano ballad I wish the sounds were more interesting like on many other tracks on here but Stephen Wilson's voice actually sounds pretty great on this song there's some symphonic instrumentation coming in as the song progresses it's a nice point on the album that actually moved me in a sense emotionally and though there are some good ideas on this LP like this and Stephen Wilson like I said is really great at recreating those classic and fantastic prog sounds there are some moments on here that I don't feel like a prog for father would have done or just maybe would have not done as chisa lee as Stephen Wilson has like the dududu ascending vocals on the track watchmaker toward the end of the song if you're into prog rock and you really just want to hear all the great albums that you've loved over the years rehashed into a new LP and just all the pieces you're already familiar with just placed in a different order in a different succession then raven may just entertain you unfortunately I'm not looking for that really so like I said again this album left me cold so I'm pretty much feeling as the strong forty with like five on this thing certainly it's not terrible it's not horrible like I said it's not like this album is offensive to the ears from a technical standpoint but from a point of emotion and inspiration there's really not much of anything here for me really so that's it if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next Stephen Wilson the Raven who refused to sing Anthony Pham tanno forever you you [Music] 
sVKjoQMZCfU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review of the new Tsar face LP czar face is a new collaborative project including hip hop veterans such as inspected deck of the wu-tang clan and 7l and esoteric and this LP and in this collaboration has gathered quite a bit of attention in the hip hop world at the start of this year although I'm not completely sure as to why that has been I mean I have enjoyed quite a bit of work from 7l and esoteric as well as inspected deck when they are involved in other projects such as the wu-tang clan and I think esoteric has made many many fantastic contributions to albums from groups such as the demigods as well as Jedi Mind Tricks these guys have always showcased a certain amount of energy and a certain amount of precision when it comes to being a part of a group being a part of a larger collective but when it comes to their solo stuff it just hasn't withstood the test of time in the way that the music that influences these guys has or at least an Inspector Dex case the music made by his other cohorts in the wu-tang clan his production hasn't really been that sharp lately and his latest full-length LP manifesto which came out in 2010 was easily as most lackluster yet and as far as 7l and esoteric go they have quite a few records under their belt - even though esoteric does have a voice that has presence and 7l puts together beats that do bring together those oldschool boom-bap grooves it's just nor near as fiery or as gritty as the New York hip hop records that they worshiped 7ln esoterics last full-length LP actually dropped the same year that inspected Dex last full-length LP did and both of them were relatively swept under the rug when it comes to East Coast hip-hop so I just don't see the reason to freak out just because they're collaborating and they have an album cover that looks like a comic book and they had this new name this new pseudonym and there's like an axe figure that's now in production because of this collaboration however this collaboration could be a cause for alarm because certainly 7l and esoteric and Inspectah deck have proven that they work better in a collaboration in a group in a collective and certainly as our face is that and actually that's that's kind of the case on this thing so our face is for the most part not really that bad of collaboration across the fourteen tracks on here I don't really think they put out a terrible song however even though 7l esoteric and inspect a deck do meld together well as a trio I don't really think they have sharpened their skills or their styles in any significant way on this new collaboration I just feel like they prevent one another from making terrible music because it's certainly not like the fire of the 90s gets sparked once again on this new collab because there are times on this new LP where the tracks do kind of feel like this exercise of boom bap hip hop not really this energetic blood pumping recreation of it which artists like progressive era are so easily able to drum up for some strange reason even though they didn't even grow up in that time of hip-hop stills our face is a pretty well crafted album it's just that sometimes it feels a little too reserved to be exciting and that's all the production on this LP overall is pretty sharp 7l pulls some really good grooves and drum breaks together especially on one of the opening tracks on this thing Arum out this drum break is gonna crack some freaking heads the murky bass line is really cool too in the air I'm out Aaron a vocal chance over the hook are pretty catchy as well while it can't kind of bug me at times that it's very apparent that I&S is not really that emcee that he used to be he's not really that dude that's going hard he doesn't really have that gruff voice that he used to have when he said I Messiah I set the microphone on fire he feels way more laid-back way more subtle and kind of understated at times on this LP in comparison with his older stuff however I feel like he puts a lot of the personal history that he has had in hip hop music into his lyrics he really peppers it throughout his lyrics in some pretty subtle ways that results in some really good wordplay at times however it's not like his flow comes off as detailed or as crazy on this track Arum out as esoterics does as soon as he flies in not only does his voice sound way louder because he's just trying to frickin body this bee but it feels like there's an extra helping of vocal effects maybe it's a chorus or something like that to make his voice stand out I'm just sort of wondering why inspect a dect and really get the same treatment maybe it was just some kind of personal preference or something like that but when inspected deck comes out to rap his voice feels way lower and way quieter in comparison to esoterics which really just comes out and grabs the listener by the throat on the same track esoterics flow is changing up one set of bars after another his random violent lyrical musings remind me a lot of the old-school routing sound which he is very clearly influenced by and comes off pretty sharp for the most part and his references are pretty nutty as well talking about people like - no at the end of a line he sounds way hungrier in comparison to inspect a deck and you know while I understand at this point inspected deck doesn't really have anything to prove to the hip-hop world because of everything he's given to it already up until this point it still doesn't make this a thrilling collaboration to listen to at times because of the the variations of energy between these two MCS I just kind of wish that inspector deck and esoteric had a middle point that they both kind of reached on this collaboration because at times esoteric is really sort of one freaking note when it comes to his aggression and his hard-ass voice still to continue with the production the weeping violin on the track cement three is really awesome the groove on that beat is solid as well it feels like a little bit of Rizal worship and there's a very obvious old dirty bastard sample on this track as well it could have been a little bit more surprising creative other than what they actually ended up doing with this hook the songs are Raphael he also has a weak hook as well which is just like this echoed vocal cut of za face face face face face face me it just feels so kind of mucky and not well placed against the beat which I actually do like a lot it feels sort of MF DOOM ish with all these samples coming from what feels like some kind of superhero soundtrack with of course the music that would play when the villain enters the scene all these villainous strings and horns and orchestrations it's very dark it's very dramatic and the song rock beast has this awesome awesome organ sample leading the way not exactly novel or imaginative or adventurous or anything like that but it gets a groove going gets the blood pumping another moment on this LP that actually kind of reminds me of MF DOOM is the song savagely attack which grabs this drum break and guitar sample that many of you may already remember famously from the mad villain instrumental cut sick fit except it's played at a higher speed on this particular track and another thing that kind of reminds me of MF to mull over this LP is just the villainous character that is our face tries to put together if I feel like Ghostface Killah and MF DOOM have already done this but they take these vocal snippets they take these sounds and they actually try to develop a character around them as our face I don't really think does that instead they sort of play out all of these vocal narrations without actually putting in the work to drum up this dark villainous character and build a storyline build the concept it's just sort of this loose blueprint of the concept that was hammered out by other people and it's just sort of being xeroxed on here but to kind of continue on this track savagely attack Inspectah deck does have lyrics on this song like the one line where he drops this basic-cable reference to live from the ER where the talk of the town without the pr i mean some witty stuff but once fils Killa comes in later on this track a lot like he says in the very lyrics of his verse he is absolutely ruthless not only with his lyrics saying that he's like this dude who comes in violently like he's on bath salts but he sounds way hungrier even hungrier and more aggressive than esoteric himself and he's got personality in being aggressive and being cut throat he actually sounds hungrier than much of anybody else on this entire album I think the only emcee that potentially steps to him when it comes to attention-grabbing energy on this thing is the verse that oh no drop time the song world war four kind of has this old-school fast-paced exploitation film soundtrack funk sample to it with this food kind of dancing on top of the bead that I like a lot however this track drives inspected deck and so2 spit at a much faster pace he doesn't really come off as intelligible as Esso when he's just trying to flow at this speed however I feel like this help he picks up a little bit more with the song poisonous thoughts which has one of the best beats I feel on this album and is a little bit more of RZA worship just a little guitar lead calling out in this cavernous way i NS and esoteric not only sound great on this spacious beat but there is a beat switch up later in the song that introduces mr. ex choir who actually has a pretty eccentric and and fun talking verse that I liked a lot however not every emcee on this LP kind of gets the red carpet rolled out for them like mr.  X choir did actually the issue for me is that many other MCS on this LP sound mix badly kind of drowned out sort of muddy with their vocals or maybe not even that enthusiastic with their verse when they come through especially Action Bronson as well as Cappadonna overall the production on this LP is pretty good the lyrics are pretty good the flows occasionally can be shaky and there's really not enough variety or original inspiration on this entire thing to make it feel as fresh as as some people are making it out to be unfortunately this album really does kind of bite off a little bit more than it can chew by throwing out all these vocal snippets and all these narrations which at the end of the day just come off as a gimmick because they don't really develop it into anything other than just sort of a distraction or a bumper between tracks feeling a decent two strong six on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's about it 7l esoteric inspected Dec czar faced forever 
eEs8FZxnq7U,hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for yet another quickie segment where I talk about a bunch of tracks a bunch of albums that I missed in full-length reviews but wanted to talk about kind of quickly in a very cursory manner this segment it actually took me a little while to do it so a lot of these albums are but I still wanted to talk about them so you know let's just kind of go one the Postal Service having to track out teasing toward the deluxe edition release of their fantastic in the electronic indie pop album give up the song is titled a tattered line of string and I don't like it at all it's too fast-paced the melody seems really kind of cursory and not that catchy or sweet or inspiring which is usually the case with Postal Service melodies it just seems like this piece of music that they had been holding on for quite a while and like I just said didn't make the cut I am happy that a lot of people because of all the hype are hearing this fantastic album that they would not have run across otherwise and that there are some live shows coming up but you know really I'm just going to cross my fingers even though I don't think it's going to happen I'm just going to cross my fingers for some new actual new material that sounds new not just a rehash of the old stuff or anything like that I would love to see the Postal Service phase two even if it's been you know pretty long time since we last heard from them full-length album style the OCS come out with a new track called Minotaur and actually loving what this band has been doing recently on their stuff they're not quite so I guess sort of brittle and distorted in lo-fi as they used to be especially with their last LP and this new track which has all these strings string sections on this song mixed together with their typical garage rock and Psyche rock sound with some pretty Saini kooky vocals it's it's a nice mix and a nice tune next Kurt Vile drops a nine-minute track with walking on a pretty day a fantastic teaser to his next LP and actually enjoyable than you would imagine Kurt Vile to be four nine minutes he made this song that feels kind of Neil Young inspired a fantastic and very blissful experience for the entirety of its length has a new single out called s ly D fantastic dance track sharp energy sharp momentum and next The Strokes have a new single out teasing toward their new full-length LP the single is called all the time and man was I disappointed with this song this song is completely soulless I actually thought the last track that they dropped from this new LP was pretty fun the guitars feel so lifeless and detail lists and Julian's vocals seem much less passionate than usual I'm hoping that not every track on this new LP is as flat as this one or else we're going to be in for a bumpy ride next rapper Antoine has a new mixtape out called dark denim it's a pretty Spacey cloud rap esque mixtape but the thing is unlike most rappers that kind of go down that style who maybe have kind of a blunted flow or kind of a swaggy flow Antoine has quite the beefy voice a lot of presence a lot of heaviness to his voice which definitely separates him for most people going for this more experimental instrumental style Brian Chippendale under the name black puffs one half of lightning bolt has a new track out called one thousand years really heavy really noisy really distorted this dudes next full-length LP should be a really ear piercing experience and Bona beau has a new track out featuring none other than Erykah Badu on vocals and his very nuanced electronic music beat production style melts together well with her very soulful vocals Giles Corey has a new EP out of fewer into his full-length debut this guy aka Dan Barrett Connecticut musician whose music I enjoy but now this new EP of his is filled with those acoustic singer/songwriter slow core songs a lot of sound manipulation and noise it's dark it's dismal it's depressing give it a listen and now we move on to albums Baptists bushcraft if you give this LP a listen you're basically getting some sludgy hardcore punk much of which has been coming out on Southern Lord Records recently of course this record is out on that label as well if you're familiar with bands like Black breath for example or nails you can pretty much already figure out what this album sounds like and unfortunately for me that was the biggest disappointment like considering what I know about this style of punk already I just feel like Baptist don't bring any personality or really any surprises to the table they have the heavy sound they had the momentum they have the performance they just don't stand out in the albums that really southern lord has kind of been saturating the internet with Matt mos the marriage of true minds Matt Moe's is an experimental electronic music duo have been doing this for a long time have quite a few albums under their belts actually have come out with one of my favorite albums of all time the LP supreme balloon which they dropped in 2008 one of my favorite synthesizer LED albums extremely colorful extremely creative textured and a real departure from what they typically do which is sample the oddest sounds that you will hear in music everything from weird noises and rocks and ice and sperm I've also heard as well as rhinoplasty and the fact that they had a hand in producing my favorite Bjork album Vespertine also had me very psyched for this new LP of theirs however I was disappointed in this LP in just how disjointed it was how underwhelming it was and just how eccentric it wasn't in comparison to some of their other LPS for example the opener which put me to sleep right away just feels like this very bland unimaginative piece of new jazz it just doesn't have that out there Flair that I typically look for from a Matt Moe song I can see that maybe they wanted to go a little more pretty a little more serene than they typically do on this track but it just didn't strike me as as beautiful as maybe they wanted it to be actually all this heavy instrumentation combined with the vocal samples the vocal narrations that are used on many tracks throughout this album it made me think of something that maybe the books would have done if they decided to make another fowling however I do love the track that comes in right after very large green triangles but after this track the duo starts throwing out all of these very underdeveloped motifs that don't really seem to go anywhere do much of anything then present an idea a really good idea but then they just sort of cut out and move on to the next thing the album for me actually didn't get interesting again until the final few tracks the last of which the closer actually kind of seems like Matt most trying to tribute the genre of black metal it doesn't seem ironic or jokey or anything like that it's it's a truly badass moment in the track and what they eventually shift it into because it's not black metal for the whole thing what they shift it into with all these synthesizers it gets more heavenly it gets prettier is pretty amazing if every track on this LP had the vision and the creativity and that sort of what the hell factor of the last song I just would have had my mind blown by this LP Biffy Clyro is a UK rock band who used to have a huge post-hardcore influence in their music but these days with their most recent LPS they've pretty much settled for some very average alternative rock and alternative pop but what truly just sinks down to the pit of my stomach on this LP are the achy-breaky lyrics that bring this extremely contrived sense of sadness really for me the lyrics on this LP should have stayed in the tear-stained diary that they were written in when these lyrics aren't making me cringe with with lines like you and me and a little cup of cyanide they're spelling out the very bad metaphors that they're singing as if the listener can't figure it out for him or herself a few songs on this LP do Rock and come off with a lot of energy like a girl in his cat but unfortunately much of the songs on this album just rubbed me the wrong way from the beginning of the CD to the end of it and then after I listened to it actually learn that this thing is in fact a double album and there was another CD of it I needed to listen to in order to do a full review but honestly after one CD I really did have enough a new frame Rabbid LP pedestrian verse in a nutshell this album is basically a snooty downtown bar that's very close to an Ivy League college campus the beer is overpriced there's all these old-timey pictures that are ironically placed onto the wall of like dudes with really big mustaches it just feels like a bland mixture of indie rock with Foulke kind of like Mumford & Sons in a way but way less layered passionate and convincing I feel like some people may not necessarily like that comparison because of how big Mumford and Sons are and just how I guess their music has this sense of epicness to it but I have to give it to Mumford because they have a sense of ambition that frightened rabbit truly truly lacks on this very so so plain-jane album black metal band a post metal band a post rock influenced rock band whose songs are pretty much instrumental if you're an artist like wolves in the throne room if you're into deafheaven if you're in a Krauss there are definitely elements of this album that you will like the drumming is pretty tight the guitar chords are nice as well they truly fit the blueprint of what you would expect from this stuff and the production is stellar as well good vast heavy atmosphere recording the issue for me is is that I mean for being an instrumental band they don't really bring much detail to the table it in a way kind of feels like they need a vocalist because they're writing these songs in such a way where it feels like they're making room for a vocalist for sure these guys know a great atmospheric black metal sound they could play they're just not writing these songs and viciously enough to really kind of make them stand out as an American black metal act as an instrumental metal act either mr. Lyons Mowgli this guy is an electronic music producer whose influences range from electronic music - instrumental hip hop a little bit of R&B - and this new LP of his feels like kind of a short collection of tracks that he feels are or maybe the best he's produced up until this point and there are some good cuts on here the dude has production chops when it comes to writing a track getting a good groove going I just feel like he needs to get his sound craft up there in order to make himself stand out give himself a style and I feel like he's really close to doing that next Joe Budden no love lost I mean really that title of this album sums up my feelings for this album because I'm not sure what I really expected from this LP after listening to the last slaughterhouse LP and Joe Budden pretty much does the same thing with this new LP he comes out with a cookie cutter pop rap album that anybody could have made he raps on the same kind of beats that everybody else is rapping on with the same kind of auto-tune hooks R&B hooks trap flavored instrumentals it's not entertaining it's not interesting it's not original he's just riding a wave that everybody else is trying to ride but everybody else is on the peak and the higher point of the wave he's really kind of in the middle or on the bottom right now he's just riding this sound that to me makes him sound boring and just like another face in mainstream hip-hop and that's it the new crow hung LP Manabu Lecter this dude is a California horrorcore emcee with a few classics in the genre under his belt a lot of his older stuff has that classic West Coast hip-hop sound but is way more eerie and bloody and horrific when it comes to lyrical content and as a producer and lyricist this dude has developed his style for years because certainly today he doesn't sound like that stuff anymore today his instrumental style is very very horror soundtrack bass with lots of horns and string samples in there just booming and hitting kind of adding those it just sounds like he's grabbing instrumental parts from those kind of shocking moments when something pops out at you in a slasher flick and as far as his rapping goes he's drifted away from that typical rapping on the tempo 16-bar straightforward kind of style these days he's rapping in a way where it feels like he's almost ranting or kind of narrating for sure he has a style it's going to appeal to some people but unfortunately not me honestly because I feel like his most recent stuff is very grotesque it's very bloody has a lot of cannibalism stuff like that and a lot of murder a lot of perverse details but the thing is when it comes to plot character development anything like that this new album and most of his recent stuff is kind of the equivalent to like a soft film or something like that there's a lot of brutality but not a lot of tension especially on an album this long with 20 or so tracks it just gets kind of old after a while because there's not really an arc he's just constantly hitting you again and again and again with all of this bloodshed the new esbit in the which LP this is basically an indie rock indie pop dream pop record female fronted it's their sophomore LP for sure it has better better production than their debut album but the thing is that the gritty more lo-fi sounds on that debut gave them a sort of dark kind of mystery to their music which this album severely severely lacks and because this album lacks that and has it's very pristine sound it's very pretty sound the group kind of reveals themselves to maybe not really have been that mysterious or that dark in the first place in fact the emotions the melodies and and the songs on this entire album are kind of mild the new Inc LP no world this is basically one more alternative atmospheric R&B project that you can throw on top of the heap of atmospheric alternative R&B projects because no world is not particularly good or novel for this more nuanced take on R&B music because the vocals the singing is is especially weak there's actually a consciousness of how bad the vocals are on this record from Inc because the vocals really kind of hang in this quiet very average pitch range and rarely ever try to climb out of it because the abilities these singing abilities just aren't there and because the singing abilities aren't there the passion isn't there and that also comes out in the instrumentals which are also very airy and light and bland and don't really have a lot of punch or a lot of color to them either and the new drawing Dee's record songs for imaginative people which is a pretty decent indie pop in indie rock LP darwin is pretty much sticking with the sound that helped get him to where he is today through fantastic singles like DNA and radar detector darwin definitely has a knack for writing some catchy hooks and has a lot of eccentric qualities coming out through his lyrics and especially his music videos i just feel like that eccentricity doesn't really spell itself out in a lot of the melodies that he plays or or just the songs that he writes either because it just to me feels like very straightforward indie rock indie pop music which is going to feel great for some people but i'm looking for something maybe just slightly more out there in terms of songwriting still when it comes to this style I do think Darwin has personality and I can't take that away from him even if for an entire LP his stuff does get a little old for me because it's not like he writes that many dynamics into his full-lengths and that's pretty much it for all the releases that I wanted to talk about in this video thank you for watching you're the best oh yeah yeah forever 
Z3IWmqIaFCI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it is the end of the frickin month februari is dead and in the ground so is the winter it's warming up a little bit that's good and it's basically time for a quick video talking about my favorite releases from this past month the last album that I reviewed and gave a very positive review to the new clipping LP mid-city these guys are in LA experimental hip hop trio combining poppier elements of hip hop in terms of just the flows and a lot of the hedonistic subject matters and and these are brought together with harsh ear piercing noise making it extremely gritty grimy disturbing and sick and sometimes the hedonism in sort of a death grip / weakened kind of way is twisted into this sort of self-hating kind of satirical / critical kind of way in the way that those themes usually turn up in hip hop music next the new ice age LP you're nothing these guys are a Danish punk hardcore punk noise rock post punk outfit is their sophomore LP follow-up to the LP new brigade in my opinion really kind of on par for the most part with that album with a few new ideas here and there a little bit of a cleaner more intelligible recording quality but still heavy still massive still extremely nihilistic and depressing after that the new Beach Fossils LP clashed the truth which is actually it's pretty much become my favorite album in that whole guitar-driven dream pop indie rock sound that a lot of bands have been going for ever since these guys came out with their full-length debut and yeah you know while I haven't really enjoyed a lot of albums in that style this one actually appealed to me because of the fact that there are melodies that really stick out there's a bit of variety among the tracks Beach Fossils has seen fit to use actually more than one guitar tone and the drumming is a lot more involved as well the band really kind of brought their hard rocking personality that always comes out live to their sophomore LP and because of that it just sounds so much better next the new My Bloody Valentine LP these guys came out with their first album in over 20 years and while it doesn't feel like an amazing holistic complete full-length album it is a really great collection of tracks and they have basically come back with this array of recordings that have come together over the years since the release of Lovelace and have in my opinion proven that they've still got it when it comes to combining noisiness with pure serenity and beauty it is so hazy it is so lush it's so layered and colorful with a few more experimental strange tracks toward the back end that also kind of you know make me scratch my head it's a good album and finally a New York rapper I'm kind of anticipating some some interesting things from cakes to killa with his new mixtape the eulogy it's a pretty short mixtape around 30 minutes but this guy's flow is fantastic he rides some of the most insane beats I've heard anybody rap on over the past year and his personality is really vibrant its sharp his punchlines are nasty and a lot of the homosexual imagery that goes into his words I'm sure we'll make some people squirm in their chairs who are homophobic which makes me laugh because I quite enjoy it alright a few my favorite traction this past year soap and skin has a fantastic new track out called sugar bread she's got new 7-inch for it and it's really orchestral it's intense it's a motive it's passionate I love it can't wait to hear what this Austrian singer/songwriter does next after that Baltimore band room runner they have a new LP on the way and the first track they dropped from it weird is heavy badass post-hardcore with an earworm guitar riff that I love next James Blake came out with retrograde fantastic return sophomore album on the way and a much more soul and R&B influenced track he's never really quite gone far into this territory with his previous stuff although it has been a very clear influence not this far I'm loving it I think the handclaps are great the hot synthesizers toward the end of the track are great and as usual his voice sounds really good and finally the grave babies track over an underground another favorite track of mine from this past month if you haven't caught my review of the Bands LP crusher I didn't exactly fall in love with it but I think it's a really good album these guys have a lot of potential when it comes to low fine though is rock noise pop post-punk shoegaze all that stuff and those are pretty much my favorite musical moments from this past month thanks for watching all the videos from this past month thank you for being a great audience thank you for commenting thank you for being cool and yeah I love you you're my favorite you're the best yeah 
3Ckbk-P7JxM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new darkthrone LP the underground resistance darkthrone is a metal duo who has had one of the most interesting trajectories of any group to really kind of come out of the Norwegian black metal scene in the 90s darkthrone was responsible for penning a few of black metals true classics and then later after that they progressed a little bit into death metal which they dabbled in for a very short period of time but then in the 2000s they eventually found the beauty in old-school heavy metal and crust punk combining those with their black metal sound for some pretty interesting full lengths which are decent metal releases but the people who wanted them to stick to their true blood black metal sound were understandably disappointed now not only did arc throw and bring to their music a change in musical style but it was kind of a change in character - because albums such as circle the wagons and dark Thrones and black flags are nowhere near as brooding there's not this pervasive sense of Darkness and demonic feelings or occult nests instead these more recent dark throne releases feel like testosterone fueled chest beating with vocals that reference the old school of metal but are maybe like a little kind of cartoony a little over the top and their guitar riffs and their drumbeats and their solos reference this era of metal - taking ideas from artists like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest and Motorhead as well as merciful fate and the underground resistance is yet another sequel in this saga but this time it's personal not really I just wanted to say that the band is actually sounding more old-school metal than ever on on this LP with their crust punk and their black metal influences kind of dissipating on these six tracks the introduction to the track dead early is old-school as hell it sounds like a combination of ac/dc and Motorhead with this bass drum and bass guitar kind of stomping a over and over and over on top of the speedy guitar riff and once the song gets going the vocals just croak I mean in this way that's kind of funny I know that the band must be conscious of what great metal vocals are I mean they've been in the metal scene for so frickin long and have had great fantastic black metal vocals on their earliest releases however I can't help but feel like the vocals they've been putting on their most recent releases especially this one are kind of satirical and in this specific case maybe a little bit of a mockery of the old school maybe not in a way where they're trying to directly insult and piss some people off but it doesn't really feel like dark throat is that into taking themselves too seriously which if your dark throne might be something they're kind of sick of at this point considering the very very serious black metal scene that they've been surrounded by for most of their musical career so the underground resistance is is definitely an LP that if you're gonna enjoy it requires an extra helping of context not only do you need to be familiar with what dark throne used to do musically but I feel like you need to also be aware of what old-school metal stereotypes are so you could kind of see and hear what exactly dark throne is playing off of taking inspiration from and ever-so-slightly parodying as far as the guitar riffs on this LP go throughout they are pretty predictable and familiar but solid and very well performed against the drums the guitar and the drums hit some pretty awesome metal grooves on one track after another the song dead early right at the start of this thing is very head bang worthy and the song Valkyrie is like a beautiful awesomely written metal ballad it feels snowy and the way the song paces along it feels like a trudge in foot deep snow it is epic there's some great guitar melodies on this one a bit of acoustic guitar at the intro and then after this track the band basically hammers out one heavy metal riff after another until they basically reach the 13 minute closing track leave no cross unturned which is a bit of speed metal worship that has this King Diamond like introduction leave no crosses and all of the really bad cartoony vocals from the past five tracks all kind of show up for this one group appearance sometimes singing all at once sometimes trading places throughout the track the band really yucks it up and I mean they have to be completely conscious of how bad the vocals sounds sometimes that falsetto that I just impersonate it a second ago that part on the song actually feels like it was a splice of two different vocal takes or something because they don't really transition in a way that feels smooth or even humanly possible and there are other very very audible vocal flubs all over this LP I mean the melodic vocals on Valkyrie are really flat and the song the ones you left behind the vocal harmonies the male vocal harmonies all over that track they are messy as hell I mean sloppy Slaven Lee the band seems to put so much effort into crafting some of these 4-minute songs with a lot of different riffs and segues and in parts and some great solos however the vocals are so terrible the closer is especially where things get kind of confusing because some of the worst vocal parts on this entire LP are there and yet it was no small undertaking for the band to craft this 13-minute monster that when it comes to the drums and the guitars is actually pretty engaging throughout the entire thing I mean it feels like they really wanted to pull off an authentic speed metal track with an antenna character to it for me the vocals on this LP are either the way they are because of two different things either Darkthrone doesn't give a about how they sound or they're intentionally bad in either way that's only going to attract a certain kind of metal listener overall in this LP the riffs are pretty good they're dusty but they're performed well the production is is pretty decent and stays true to that old-school metal sound but the cartoony vibes that I'm getting from the vocals are just too distracting when it comes to being kind of silly with your vocals I feel like at this point dark thorn has surpassed even a band like ghoul I do love that darkthrone wanted to put a fun metal album together I mean I do love fun metal music that's why I like thrash metal so much and the vocals on underground resistance definitely do give the band character where if they maybe played the vocals as straight as they do the drums and the guitars it might have just been a boring nondescript record that really kind of had nothing to report and this weird sort of funny crazy character does make the album fun for most of the tracks but by the time I get to the last song on here the 13 minute closer which is one of my favorite tracks on here it gets kind of old honestly I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and have a nice day Anthony Fantana Darkthrone forever [Music] you 
C6ptrREuJGA,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new Starfucker LP Miracle Mile ion Starfucker is a Portland synth pop outfit that I have been conscious of for quite a while they were actually one of the first groups I ever remember blogging about on like a consistent basis back when they were coming out with releases like Jupiter around 2009 the first impressions were good I mean it just pretty much felt like synthesizer led indie pop with very light male vocals kind of hitting a high pitch a lot of infectious grooves some disco influenced rhythms like on the tracks big toy and Biggie Smalls and actually a pretty good cover of girls just want to have fun the rest of the LP however didn't really stick with me and at the time I never really reviewed the album so I wasn't really forced to think of why the album didn't appeal to me all the way or or why it didn't you know really entertain me as much as I guess it should have star-fuckers next full-length release reptilians is another album that you know I kind of skipped in 2011 however I guess my reasons for doing so kind of became a little bit more clear after hearing another full-length LP from these guys though I do like the electronic indie pop sound that they shoot for the instrumentation that typically shows up in their tracks it feels so flat and kind of just borderline colorless these guys are incredibly just unimaginative when it comes to sound honestly the synthesizers sound like they're either coming from some kind of digital audio workstation preset or just like a relatively cheap synthesizer but on top of that the synthesizers they feel so untreated they feel to so land sort of run-of-the-mill the bass tone too just feels very very common the drums kind of feel the same way too they are there you can hear them you can hear pretty much detail in the fills and stuff like that but they are miles away from being sharp or resonant or beefy in the same way that you would hear on like any record that has come off of DFA records and the vocals that front all these tracks feel kind of like maybe they reach this high-pitched sort of MGMT kind of quality but they're way less memorable and and distinct I honestly feel like the band hasn't really crafted a sound that is faintly distinct across their four full-length albums and and the reason for that being is that they don't really try it's it's not really a focus it's not something that they even want to put effort into it seems just take a look at the album reptilians after which the band dropped a demos version of the album and it's it's kind of funny because when you listen to the demos version of the album songs like white is noon on the demos album the demos version of reptilians sound just is flat and unfinished and just normal regular plain sounding as the version that actually made it onto the LP same with Hungry Ghost and buried us alive sure the sounds and the instrumentation do come off as being slightly different but in terms of the heaviness of the sounds and the vibrance of the sounds especially the vibrance of the sounds the quality is the same and unfortunately Miracle Mile is pretty much the same in terms of sound quality for years the band has just rocked this sound that is not low Phi enough to be gritty or weird but it's not sharp or well recorded enough to be professional sounding or impressive as far as the opening track on this LP goes while I'm alive the guitar has this really bad direct in tone as if it's being directly plugged into a soundboard or a computer it just feels just bodyless in the falsetto vocals not only do they have this no personality to them but they sound like a Bee Gees inspired nightmare the song saysed the opening of this track has this kind of quaint crappy sounding like little baby keyboard throbbing away right at the start of the song which is kind of funny because most groups would throw that in and then sort of rush in a bunch of great sounding instrumentation to sort of contrast this very cheap synthesized sound coming out of the baby keyboard however the transition doesn't work because all the instrumentation that rushes in sounds like it comes out of a cheap keyboard too the vocals are typically mixed so badly you can't even really tell what they're saying when it sort of feels like they're so upfront that you be able to make them out and it's not like the vocals are singing anything that's just mind-blowing Lee emotive or genuine or anything like that they're just singing these basic forgettable indie 101 melodies that the band seems to have crafted up over these very plain drum beats and grooves that we all have heard rocked way harder by contemporaries like Hot Chip LCD soundsystem Cut Copy as well as m83 when it comes to the beats on this thing they just do not hit hard the most I could see this album inspiring is like some foot tapping and there are some softer moments on this LP some acoustic spots but there just is lacking in detail as the dance ear tracks and lacking in good sounds - like the track 9 equal H the autoharp that flies in on that track it's muddy as hell at least the vocals are a little more audible than they typically are but the melody is is just kind of you know cheap sounding I think the only track I came away from this LP actually thinking sounded halfway good was the song leave it all behind which has these blaring electro Keys pulsating away all over the song but honestly that's it I mean I just do not know where this band is coming from I mean obviously they must be passionate about what they do they come out one album after another maybe they're more passionate about performing or writing songs or something like that because it really seems like the sound of what they do is horrifyingly neglected and and continues to be with album to album with just no progression or evolution in how the band comes across sonically or how their instruments sound maybe there's a little bit more effects on albums like reptilians as well as this new one Miracle Mile but it all just kind of feels like a demo when the band I imagine isn't trying to make demos it really is difficult for me to focus on much of anything else that the band has going on this LP as well as their last LP because the sounds are just so deafeningly bland really I'm feeling a light too decent three on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it star Miracle Mile forever you 
-E3BVFqsD2s,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new crib grave babies album crusher great babies number one gosh I hope you're right these guys are a rock trio they have a few cassettes under their belt and now with this new LP they're having you know kind of their first widely available full-length album through the label hardly art you know the biggest label so far that they've been on and these songs on this pretty short LP it's around 30 minutes or so have a interesting collection of sounds influences ranging from noise rock and noise pop to low five music goth rock shoegaze post-punk the songs on here are pretty minimal in terms of instrumentation and and melody but they are freaking loud a lot of them are pretty mid-paced maybe they creep in a little slowly creepily enhancing that goth influence that goes on with a lot of songs here and the drums are especially simple on a lot of these tracks on tracks like over and underground they come off very very simple with just what sounds like a kick and a snare alternating but even though they are simple they are compressed to hell the gate gets futz with a little bit so there's just a really loud crack snap and boom - these drums a lot like something Jesus and Mary Chain would do now the guitar chords that are on this LP they're very simple they're very straightforward they're driving they have a tone that is just very metallic it's it's grating it's it's brutal on the years after a while actually the guitar tone is too sharp it's it's grinding and some of the songs on here feel like the band is is knowingly playing their guitars out of tune like the song slaughter as well as the song reading and and this out of tune feeling does give the songs you know sort of a unique quality I suppose sort of a noisy dissonant kind of wonky effect the bass is pretty muddy if in fact it is there and there are a lot of cents on some of these as well and the sense themselves as far as performance they are played kind of loosely sort of lazily a lot more than the drums and the guitars are however that's not really the case on the track no fear which has sort of a sharp catchy accessibility to it though it is loud and it is very hectic like many other songs on here and very gothy the synthesizers are awesome and it's got a really sweet kind of New Wave quality to it but when it comes to this band sound and just their overall style the cupid grace on top of the whole thing is the vocals the lead vocals they hardly sound human most of the time it's like they've been pitch shift to sound a little bit lower than they really are and there's some chorus effects on them possibly some kind of weird deep twisted effect on them to make them sound kind of haunting demonic on top of this with the loudness that the band puts on display it feels like even though I'm listening to this either digitally or on CD that I'm hearing it on some kind of weird warped cassette that's been sent to me from the Gothic rock underworld and because it sounds like maybe it was recorded to tape there's just a lot of bleed through going on with the instrumentation the vocals and the guitars they're really mixing together on a lot of these tracks and with the synths too if they're loud enough the noisy spots on this album really kind of condense and consolidate into this one mass of just right like on the track blood on the face which easily has one of the most ridiculous courses on this entire LP which is actually kind of an appeal that this album has to me I personally feel like the band kind of sucks up their dark side a little bit I'm not exactly sure how seriously they take it especially considering that they recently came out with an EP titled goth dammit and you know their name is grave babies and there's a weird interlude track on here where you do kind of have these burning guitar leads and over that you have this wee just what live in a world man just not have to ask anybody these stupid questions I don't really think these guys were obsessed with their goth cred and as a result actually think crusher is kind of a fun listen the song is overrun underground and no fear for example really shop tracks sharp tunes it's impressive to me that these guys can write tracks like this that are memorable from first listen and yet they're so blurry they're so noisy they're so obscured the song skulls is pretty memorable as well with it's driving guitars that are layered with really sort of distorted odds synthesizers and even though there are some pretty loosely tuned guitars on the track slaughter I find the vocals the the fact that they're softer and the vocal melody that they're singing to be kind of melancholy and sort of alluring in this really odd way and I love that sinister melody on the track Death March however there are tracks on here where I feel like grave babies try to sort of get by on their attitude as opposed to just writing a good tune like the song haunted which you know the very weak kind of Halloween synthesizers do not fix the lackluster vocal harmonies and the song count cuts pretty much feels like over an underground in terms of pace and in chord progression the last few tracks on this thing do bring some different ideas especially the last song which is just kind of slow and and spacious a lot more spacious than many other tracks on here but by this time with the vocals and the distortion and everything I am just burnt the out I really like the band's sound I like their energy I like a lot of their tracks I do like sort of the the faux kind of funny playful darkness I just feel like they could use a bit more diversity in terms of sound and just a few more solid tracks and maybe just sort of a new level of recording quality and you know we could have a really awesome next album from these guys I did like this LP a lot though I'm not really in love with it I do kind of find myself coming back to it again and again just kind of getting this sound and this weird vibe that I do get from their music that I like I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it great babies crusher forever 
UkJfb2np5JA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new clipping album mid-city could be could be being sounds good thank you for the support clipping is in LA hip hop trio and it's an interesting collection of dudes including Jonathan he is one half of the DIY electro pop duo Captain Ahab who actually had a pretty lengthy discography under their belts then there is William Hudson who also goes by the name rail and under this pseudonym he creates a lot of noisy strange ambient vast sound scapes that are pretty textured and then there is Davey Diggs who is the lead emcee in the group and together they make some really weird head-turning noise hop that will most definitely get a lot of comparisons to artists like Blacky as well as Death Grips now when I say that this group is noise hop or that they're making noise hop i frickin mean it because a lot of the beats a lot of the instrumentals on this new 14 track LP mixtape live up to the name clipping shots of harsh bone-crushing distortion glitches static their moments where stuff off of this LP reminds me of like MERS bounce as well as maybe some more recent stuff from Tim Hecker like on the track off of this LP guns up where you have these really kind of sad apocalyptic court speaking through all of this just it's it's abrasive and yet kind of minimal in a way - I'm yet to actually hear hip hop that feels this abrasive and yet this minimal because even though this LP is pretty noisy at times I don't find it to be incredibly dense or just really thick overbearing in the way that Death Grips can sometimes be or Blacky - I feel like mid-city most of the time works in a world of simplicity like the song mob to it where the instrumental is like this very very subtle spacious beat with gurgles of sub bass lots of clicks squelches screeches of tones that pop up occasionally but for the most part the most busy thing throughout the entire track is the wrapping is the flow and another track off of this LP loud does get louder it is pretty loud when these booming crashes of distortion fly-in but still it's not like they're that many sounds in the instrumental and it's not like they're happening all at once much of the time the beats are really skeletal they're not lush in any way even the song about that which pretty much has the I guess the most melodic and sweet chorus on this entire tape which has these synthesizers that fly and they have kind of an 80s sheen on them that track - like many others on here still feels like a hamburger that was left out - just burn to a crisp on a grill in the Summer Sun it's like a hockey puck or certainly the rhythm is there but it's not like you just want to Bob your head to a lot of these beats especially on tracks like 5 which you pretty much get this synthesized weird open soundscape which digs is kind of rapping against at a tempo that he seems to be kind of rocking on his own on the intro track digs does his fastest flow that you're gonna hear on the entire LP and it is fast I mean he is spitting fire on this track he has a nice articulate and just speedy flow when he wants to use it and his bars are kind of interrupted occasionally by these shocking noise blasts it's a standout on this record not just because of how great his flow is but because of how weird the song is structured another weird spot is the outro which is this 11 minute track which takes really the last two lyrics of the previous song get money and repeats them loops them over and over and over for the entire duration of this very long freakin song that kind of takes up a fifth of the entire mixtapes runtime that becomes no longer a phrase but just kind of this sound that just gets washed with effects and becomes pretty just psychedelic I think the only beats on this entire LP I didn't really care for our beats like on the track 5 which just seemed to meander with the synthesizers a lot of the improv that the sense we're playing I felt were kind of weak and amateurish and as far as the song mob to it goes that beat for me is just maybe too too sparse to kind of keep my interest however I feel like the the real weak point on this album consistently can kind of be digs when it comes to his lyrics he comes off hardened like he's got some killer be killed kind of survival of the fittest mentality and though like on the intro track he can throw out a very fast just merciless relentless flow oftentimes on this LP he doesn't really go down that road maybe because of the lack of a strong backbeat and a lot of these rhythms he tends to stick to some pretty basic straightforward head-bobbing flows that feel I don't know sometimes like swaggy still he comes through with some pretty dark and and and hearing messages like on the track bout that where he says LITTLEST pup figure II bigger enough to scrap for the meet with a riot in the street there's some gritty stuff on here but he'll also throw out these lines that I feel like are you know maybe a little too catchphrase like where he says swag on lock real gee I do feel like this makes the album kind of accessible I mean maybe it's really the most accessible thing about it but it does sometimes lead to some lyricism that I just don't care for I think is absolutely boring like if you know somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody say yeah but the hedonism that can typically come out in some of these songs especially at the start does get a bit darker as the album continues forward like on the song get it where Diggs is kind of describing this club like atmosphere with and asses and money but then he continues forward to say stuff like you know who's got kids at home don't say nothing and comment how the club itself smells like ass or the song  where he basically continues to sort of with his lyrics highlight and paint more pictures of very expensive things party atmospheres but the hook which sounds exactly like something the weekend would put out there with the vocals and with the synthesizers and what the murky bass it pretty much says yeah this all what you're hearing right now all these things we're describing it's  there are tracks like this one where Diggs flow hits a good groove it feels really rhythmic but there are others on here where the verse is especially on the track guns up where I mean it pretty much feels like he's delivering some spoken word the song story comes off or at least stone cold as well in terms of his flow and and the things he's saying - and the story that he's telling involves this car crash and this death and a police officer who's kind of shaken by having come across this accident he's also a recovering alcoholic conversation with a prostitute it's it's some pretty weird stuff it's a solid tape and has a variety of different tracks of different emotions accessibility 's and there are really only a few potholes on here where I typically feel like the lyrics could use maybe a bit more originality or a bit more darkness or a bit more experimentation or the instrumental the beat could just use a bit more color I'm feeling about eight on this thing I have been listening to it for the past few weeks I just keep finding myself coming back to it what did you think of this LP if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it clipping mid-city forever [Music] 
DyJKBHILnx8,hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review atoms for peace among this is the full-length debut LP of a band fronted by Thom Yorke sort of a recording project he has going on with Nigel Godrich who you also may know as the producer of Thom Yorke's debut solo LP the eraser and originally this group had been formed to perform material from that album a handful of years ago when Tom was touring behind it now even though Atoms for Peace is this new band it's this new album it's really not all that far off from other Thom Yorke related releases for one this album is very electronic and synthetically textured in a lot of the same ways that the eraser was and this LP has an extremely kind of rhythmic quality too with a lot of looped beats that pulse a mechanically but have a ton of detail and layers to them just like many tracks off of the King of Limbs and even though ADM's four-piece is supposed to be a band with billed musicians such as flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers on bass this does not feel like a live band and really any way shape or form the sounds on this LP feel so rigid robotic exact and meticulous to the point that there is no way whatsoever we are listening to live instrumentation which isn't really the worst thing in the world I guess what I'm getting at is that atoms for peace is basically just another Thom Yorke solo effort under a different flag now in a way in comparison to the eraser this LP is maybe even more meticulously planned out the eraser did have the very rigid and electronic beats that this album has but that LP also featured some guitar just waves of instrumentation kind of cascading over those beats whereas this new LP the sense the guitars they seem to sometimes be as looped or as rigid as the rhythms themselves a lot of these beats just kind of follow in lockstep with the guitars in the sense a lot like many spots from the of limbs that were just more beat oriented but I actually think that this new LP has a bit more punch it's got a bit more clarity it's got a bit more detail I think in a way I actually kind of wish that the King of Limbs sounded a bit more like amok because honestly a lot of the ballads and a lot of the softer spots off of that album since I have listened to it and have ever viewed it have actually kind of just lost their flavor for me a little and a lot of the more beat oriented tracks off of the LP feel so static to me it's like there's nothing in terms of a groove or a progression that moves me amok does bring a bit more progression and some really good ballads I think it may end up kind of getting swept under the rug a little bit though because it just kind of feels in a lot of ways like just typical Thom Yorke very icy very emotional his nasally wails are all over the place and underneath these vocals and just the balance themselves are these layered and throbbing rhythms that just go clickety clack clickety clack and aside from the vocals over these beats are all of these tones that are sweet their melancholy sometimes they're kind of glitchy this LP definitely does have a sound it has a vibe but still at the end of the day it ends up kind of feeling like a collection of tracks because there's not really a huge obvious arc or anything like that to the entire LP what this LP sounds like to me personally is just further tuning further alteration of the sound that Thom Yorke has been chasing after since the middle of the aughts and I actually think with with amok he's come closer than ever to perfecting it the song that opens up the selfie before your very eyes there's something about this beat that to me says gears it says switches says buttons but there's something about just Thom Yorke coming in and singing and I know his voice isn't for everybody but there's just something about his voice that that gives these songs just enough humanity to make them I guess bearable despite feelings so you know Bridgette and the song itself structure-wise is really linear there is kind of a swell toward the middle of the track that feels like a chorus with all these synthesizers all these random sound effects kind of bumping around everywhere but the rhythm pretty much stays exactly the same as it has been since it kind of kicked in toward the beginning of the track and that sort of seems to be a theme on numerous songs here Thom Yorke is trying to basically keep these grooves and keep these beats going and just maintain while changing things over in giving movement and giving progression to the song which is something Radiohead also did on the King of Limbs but there wasn't enough change detail or progress to keep the songs interesting to me the songs on this LP don't pop they don't really you know kind of give you a rush they don't shift gears excitedly when a course kind of comes in they are much more meditative they're kind of hypnotic in a way with how they just continue on and just change shades very slowly and subtly like the song unless which is really one of my favorite tracks on here it's got this you know a B C sort of structure with just one part moving into the next part moving into the next part and just not really looking back this long slowly builds into its groove these bad at-bats since pop in the rhythms eventually get beefier they get thicker bass eventually introduces itself along with these weird vocal samples of Tom's singing popping up all over the mix kind of encasing my head in the left and right channels with just weird whimpers and moans even lead tracks off of this LP like default that I reviewed earlier this year and enjoyed kind of follow that same pattern another track that dropped before this LP as well follows that pattern judge jury and executioner the acoustics stand out on this LP a song that I like a lot I feel like this track has one of the best beats on the entire LP with the reverb moans hanging in the background in this bassline that sounds like like you're kind of recording this throat humming sound and it's being looped and the basses kind of equalized very high on it so it's very resonant there are a lot of clicks in this rhythm and just oddly placed kick drums and I think the track is one of the prettier vocal melodies on the entire LP - my only issue with the song is that I wish it were longer it's one thing about this track and many other songs on here rarely does this album really kind of come out and grab me grab my attention or anything like that however I don't really think it's boring because I think the songs and I think the sounds are nice enough to the point where they actually lure me in but Thom Yorke is just really not at a point now where he's writing those rock songs those very emotive and and somewhat experimental art rock songs that people have loved from Radiohead for so long rather he's kind of taking his vocals and he's taking a lot of the same instrumentation and he's trying to make an electronic song a linearly structured electronic song he's trying to apply it all of these familiar elements to an electronic structure where you kind of take a groove you take an idea and basically for a handful of minutes you sort of not come up with these several different large lead contrasted parts in a single track really it's just one subtle change that comes on slowly another subtle change that comes on slowly if there's anything I really kind of dislike or I am sort of disappointed with in regards to this LP there are some nice synthesizers and vocals on this thing for sure that are treated and some just heavy wet effects just cavernous cascading vocals just layering on top of each other in a really nice way on some of these songs but the beats feel so freakin dry and flat sometimes it's like a burnt piece of Turkey between two pieces of toast the sounds can feel really kind of plain if you listen to this entire 40-minute LP from beginning to end sure it does have a style and it does have an approach but there could be a little bit more texture in some of these beats to make them a little bit more worth sinking your teeth into the sounds of the rhythms are just mysteriously mysteriously untreated like there was a severe lack of post-production in the making of these songs no doubt there are some cool songs and melodies on this LP especially nasty grooves like on the song stuck together pieces there's some detailed instrumentation and Thom Yorke has improved when it comes to taking this rock instrument and applying it to an electronic structure what this album really could have needed were maybe just some tracks of a different energy level a different flavor some different sounds and you know the the sonic experimentation that explorative edge that albums like a music and kid a have I'm actually feeling a strong six to a lay seven on this LP I enjoyed it quite a bit but if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and yeah that's it Anthony Fantana Atoms for Peace forever [Music] music 
qm-8S5MHxsI,"oh hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a vinyl update which is something I haven't done in about a month so it's time for another one and yeah here we go no buts about it doing this raw okay first record was actually passed to me by an online boutique independently owned records store as a gift the eclectic lack dick record store the official record store the eclectic society movement not only do they have new stuff on their reissues of old classics but a lot of turntable and vinyl related stuff as well they tossed me a brand-spankin'-new repressed copy of Miles Davis's bitches freakin brew which a lot of you may remember from my recent classic week's stint when I reviewed this amazing jazz fusion masterpiece which is not only a fantastic piece of music for the genre but amazingly pressed on 180 gram vinyl and a fantastic fantastic reporting that just stands the test of time in terms of just clarity and just pretty nuts I mean all of the extra instrumentation that Miles Davis brings onto this album with the way that everything is panned and recorded and mixed you really really feel and hear every detail though I have listened to the album for a long time digitally I'm yet to listen to it on this record I'm going to be spinning that soon very soon again thank you to eclectic I will be throwing a link to their store in the d box next I picked up a copy of flying lotuses freakin , grandma recently one of my favorite electronic music beat music instrumental hip hop records really cool packaging I mean I wish it was like matte finish suppose a glossy but I still love seeing the big details and everything and man I even listen to this record not non vinyl that I even listen to it all the way through in a while and after I spun this I was like man this record is hectic at some points with just you know some really interesting sense sounds but still my favorite tracks still kind of rank through clear and then still are my favorite it's like astral plane amazing song of this double LP here you know and it's it's a nice it's a nice pressing good job on warp on up pulling this package together this uh next 12 inches eyes may have seen kind of peeking out from over here like a creeper like the creeper that it is yes the first Tonetta compilation 777 if you don't know who to net it is just punch Tonetta into YouTube and you will be deeply deeply disturbed um yes you know pretty you knows nice little sleeve there interesting what they did there with the the face on the label I like the labeling and you know it's it's it's a nice thick pressing as well they did a great job on this package you know as you can see a lot of the songs if you could see the UH they're very short short tunes short weird outsider tunes and among my favorites on on this album you may already know because I reviewed this compilation you know a really big that's I think that's that's and I'm going to marry a prostitute that one too a lot of favorites on this record a lot of favorites it's a you know just feeds into a my six side my six sided gonna leave it at that alright next go mod go mad you know I reviewed this one recently as well as soon as I reviewed this record gave it a positive review I went over to band camp and I bought this vinyl straight from the band seemed like a good price they went all out on this packaging man they did a great job nice little rock area right there you know Carville kind of matte-finish not velocity or anything like that I like just like the rougher finish I like the rougher finish I got a nice little booklet to go along with this where they actually quoted Mitch Dubey over here like it at the very front which was was really kind of a friend of a friend of mine who passed away tragically killed in cold blood unfortunately but they had some acts credits over here the lyrics are in here I mean they pulled together a nice booklet on this thing it's nice big fat and huge and the other record itself is kind of this strangely interesting off-white kind of color and it's thick too it is thick there's a thick son of a gun if there's a one kind of issue I have with the packaging on the whole thing it's that it's all a little tight a little tight this record slips into the sleeve like when I try to pull it out as he goes there like it was like a pop all right this next record I actually bought for 10 bucks from my good friend Derek he he actually is not as hot on the evens as I am and you know I actually had this album on CD and then I gave it up for at some point for some reason maybe I just thought I wasn't as into them as I was but then when I reviewed their newest record I was like damn why did it give up that second LP that was actually you know pretty good that sophomore album was good yeah nice pressing here you know cool credits and everything few little cool pictures it's it's pretty bare spare straightforward packaging but uh gets the job done discord always prints good vinyl you can always trust discord to print a good vinyl got some Peter Gabriel so pick this up at a record show for a few bucks nothing too impressive in terms of the packaging but if you're looking to get into Peter Gabriel and you want to try one of his more accessible albums then look up so with Peter Gabriel has a such fantastic tracks as in your eyes which I'm sure a lot of people have heard of on the radio before countless times and also grabbed this Peter Gabriel record for a few bucks as well which also has shocked the monkey on it if you're kind of looking for a hit to reference pretty straightforward with the packaging as well still a good LP I want to get into his few earlier records prior to this one and moving along constellation actually passed me this record by surprise it wasn't expecting them to pass me a copy of this record typically when I get a promo from the label it's just they just pop me a digital promo um so you know it's and there are records that they send me that I like their records that they send me that I don't really care for you know it's it's it's whatever but this is the first time that they've actually and I just kind of like sent me vinyl and it's it's funny there have been plenty of cases like you know the columns that's an album for example where I've loved a record of theirs reviewed it and then just bought a straight four from them you know I would have been happy to buy this but um especially since the packaging is so good so I mean the two longest tracks off of this record when I reviewed it are on this one LP that comes with the album which we have showcased here and the other two drones on the album are actually on a separate seven-inch record some cool credits here godspeed always puts you know effort into their credits putting some you know weird you know esoteric things and references inside of here there's like you know kind of this instruction manual to listen to the album you know listen to side a of this and then side B of this and then go into the you know the the drone ear parts it's it's interesting someone told me there was some kind of who has a copy of this record told me that they have kind of a weird itching on the inner label or something here which which I'm not necessarily reading right now maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot but to continue on really cool booklet to go along with this thing another huge gigantic booklet which folds out even further than this it's it's big it's big guys oh and has all sorts of weird dark kind of disturbing pictures skeletons it looks like shots of film that are slowly warped by being stuck on front of the projector and kind of burned out which is something Godspeed were totally do all right well there you go that's the packaging for for that record the new Godspeed hope you don't bend ascend alright this next one actually comes from a YouTube cohort a record that I bought off of him a while ago when it was still on sale I don't believe he has any more copies this is a Derek Higgins Derek to the dude is is a cool YouTube personality he just kind of sifts through his record collection and shows people his records but he is a multi-instrumentalist and a music you know recording artist himself and has been in numerous groups over the years in the Omaha Nebraska area and this record of his I mean he put together a good pressing the guy has great taste and vinyl and you know if you watch his own videos where he's talking about the music that he makes I mean he looks at what he does so objectively to the point where you know he tells you and is very honest and straightforward about its flaws I mean you know if you're into New Age guitar music then this is definitely going to be up your alley he's very straightforward and honest and saying that yes he sings on the record and yes there are drum machines you know it there there are some electronic drums on this record he wishes there were more live drums he wishes his own vocals were better but like he's said before in videos regarding this record and just his own work in general the melodies are certainly there with the melodies on that album the scenes that melody comes up pretty easy to him at times so so an interesting release from from my good buddy Derek whose videos i watch on a regular basis next Noi Noi Noi Noi Noi Noi Davey annoy lp3 like rockin krautrock outfit white freakin pressing packaging is good as straightforward and sweet I'm loving it and the record itself while I don't perceive it to be as great as my favorite no record noise 75 this is still you know good I guess sort of repetitive and a rock record a psychedelic rock record you could really kind of get lost in not really the punk rock undertones of noise 75 but still then an interesting record and this record actually caught in Derek's videos and I actually saw a my local record store red scroll records had to freaking pick it up this is the single for subtracts hold on track and the pressing of the vinyl itself is great it's thick I love this freaking song there is a nice remix on the other half and what is so awesome about the front cover is a freaking hologram I don't know if you can really kind of see every sort of shift of the hologram on this record but it's a it's pretty freakin awesome I love it um interesting packaging for this thing and just a great song itself that deserves packaging like this and finally Ice Age you're nothing you guys remember my recent review of this you know that I have their debut LP stashed in my collection over here this one actually came with a a pretty big poster as well I guess because I ordered it early enough to have a poster and I get sort of a weird flag that kind of came with it pictures pictures lyrics lyrics guys are looking moody guys are looking Punk they're looking post punked you know nihilistic sad and nice pressing on the record nice and thick runs at 45 rpm just like the last LP it's good nice and noisy loud but the pressing itself is clear everything ring was true everything comes through real nice Matador did a good job on this good job of the guys in Matador all right that is all I'm going to update you on vinyl wise for this month thank you for watching you're a peach you're fantastic and I love you mwah mwah Anthony Fantana vinyl forever [Music] [Music] "
sQhnZeJ3_0g,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and this is a video where i'm basically going to be talking about my experience seeing the one and an only Jeff Mangum live he of course in recent years has kind of come out from the depths of I guess sort of the performing hiatus that he's put himself on to you know perform the classic works of Neutral Milk Hotel he's played in Connecticut one time previous to this I believe in the New Haven area last time but this most current time was in Hartford actually at the Great Hall in Union Station tall firs opened up after that was the music tapes featuring Julianne Koster fronting that band of course he was also in Neutral Milk Hotel when the band was active and writing material and then to finish things off Jeff came on I want to thank of course my buddy mark from manic productions who booked the show I've known this kid for a great deal of my life if you live in Connecticut or in the Connecticut area and you know you like seeing shows he books some good ones and on top of that I also want to thank all the people who I guess sort of are familiar with my show who said hi people were saying hello to me throughout the night asking questions and being nice and just generally being awesome I just want to thank everybody for communicating the the fact that they love the show also at this show was intern Chris a lot of you are familiar with intern Chris no intern Chris and love intern Chris he also has a description of the entire concert at his very own personal tumblr and he was much closer to the stage than me you jerk so you might also enjoy reading his experience of the whole thing in the link that I'm gonna throw in the description box so to start things off tall firs kind of opened up this you know this this trio set it was kind of a half set sort of cut down maybe not as entertaining or as detailed as it would have been because one half of their you know duo was their performance duo was not there some kind of family issue which we were being told and as a result the set was cut in half however that didn't make it any less intimate or the songs any less personal however there was you know kind of a roar going on in the back during this set and partially unfortunately during the music tape set as well like you know there was just kind of this I guess sort of bubbling anticipation to see Jeff and people were maybe getting a little restless maybe just kind of losing you know their attention span with these people who are performing in front of them I'm especially surprised that was the case in front of the music tapes not only because they had so much instrumentation when they came out but Julian Koster I mean is an essential part of what Neutral Milk Hotel was I mean the singing saw the bass the accordion the dude is a colorful playful personality has a real ear for melody and I mean you know to see his set being in a sense kind of ignored by some people who were far in back is just a little bit of a shame unfortunately I didn't really love I mean love love the band's last full-length LP which came out on merged not too long ago however I was catching that a lot of the songs from that album were being played in front of me and it just felt so much more I guess sort of alive wide and open and spacious in person I felt like the recording on the new record was kind of claustrophobic but to see this instrumentation in front of me the banjos which were being strummed as well as bowed the singing saw the drums the orchestral bells that were being hit with a hammer the horns too while it was really noisy it was just just joyously chaotic I would say and Julian's personality is just amazing when he's telling stories in between tracks and singing - I mean I didn't really love his singing voice on the music tapes new record but it just goes over so much better in person because he has this I guess sort of childlike innocence which definitely plays out not only in the the way the band's music sounds it has this kind of old-timey very romantic kind of feel to have melody wise but the things he was saying in between the songs and just things that the songs were about he just strikes me as this guy who's constantly filled with with wonderment about the world around him and you know I I find that to be a beautiful thing he was telling this insane story about this guy who sensed rhythm in in everything and this was some kind of strange sixth sense that he had since birth there was a portion in the set where the band played along with this giant seven-foot metronome prop which swung this arm around you know and this ridiculously offbeat fashion but it was still funny to kind of see this visual up there on stage and on top of that there was a singing television set that Julian kind of told this cute childhood story about how it used to sing him to sleep with this one single tone kind of humorous but when they actually you know turned the TV on there was some kind of face and a recording of him singing but with like some weird tremolo effect on it it just added to the the fun character of the set now after the music tapes were done they kind of just thanked us shuffled offstage some guitars were brought out next to a chair that was just sent the middle of the stage and eventually Jeff kind of you know took the stage once he came out and he just kind of sat down and mumbled something into the microphone nobody could really tell much of what he was saying and I kind of assumed that this would happen that he would be sort of you know reserved within himself and not really you know be bubbly and kind of popping out of people and be really loud and be really in your face or anything like that but as the set kind of went on he really kind of started to open up I'm not exactly sure if this is something that happens at every single show or if he felt like the reception that he was getting from the crowd was particularly warm that night but I can't imagine that what was happening there in Hartford wasn't all too alien to him I mean people were screaming ridiculous things like you know I love you Jeff you jet through the best this one guy was asking him if he could finish out his set and you know which of course made him laugh he was really quick to answer those silly questions that I'm sure he gets all the time like hey where's the new stuff what are you doing with your spare time man you seemed really humbled by the the people have just loved his music this passionately for this long but there was just kind of this hard to define magic that was there that that happens at any concert I'm sure when you have so many people in one area who just care about this one piece of music so deeply Jeff started off the set with two-headed boy he shifted right into two-headed boy part two which I mean personally are two of my favorite tracks off of in the aeroplane over the sea I was singing along I was freaked out to be there everybody seemed to be kind of silent though and I wasn't exactly sure as to why that was maybe everybody was stunned just to have Jeff in front of them they're playing these songs because I knew for a fact that I mean way more people and this had to know all the words then he went into a bit of older stuff with garden head and leave me alone when he played song against sex as well from the from the first full-length LP and then after this he went into the songs the king of Kara flowers parts 1 & 2 & 3 of course and before he went into these tracks he just urged for the crowd to sing along with him and it was just like night and day past that point because once he gave everybody the okay it kind of became sort of like a gospel kind of experience almost as if you know everybody was in this one area to sing hymnals people were just like closing their eyes throwing their heads up into the air screaming these lyrics at the top of their lungs there were moments like later in the set he was playing the track oh come Lee where he hits you know that that really high note that is I believe the highest or maybe you know the second highest on the entire LP and when he kind of you know builds up and of course most people's voices are cracking everybody's you know screaming and laughing and you know having a really great time and Jeff is just reacting to this and feeding off of this and you know it's making his playing more passionate he's putting more into his singing he's singing louder he's singing more fiercely I guess you could say after this Jeff went into a baby for pre which is another one of my favorite tracks from Neutral Milk Hotel another song from the debut and then he went right into Holland 1945 one of the more fast paced tracks on in the aeroplane over the sea and when when this song hit I thought that everybody you know once the king of Care flowers played that everybody had hit you know kind of a peak level of energy but once this song came on it seemed like everybody was freaking some people were you know just jumping up and down and screaming - - the reaction of just the opening guitar riffs people were screaming the one two one two three four loud blaring distorted instrumentation that pops in on that song once the drums and everything just kick in even though it wasn't there with Jeff with just how energetic the crowd was it almost felt like it was happening and in a sense it kind of was because people were mouthing out the horn parts to the songs after this part in the set and ghost actually was the final song that Jeff played by himself but everybody was just clapping and screaming and it wasn't too long maybe like not even a full minute before Jeff came right back out and was walking along with Julian which freaked out everybody even more to kind of see this you know one half Neutral Milk Hotel reunion was fantastic they played two tracks together one of them was engine of course the other was in the aeroplane over the sea and during these two tracks Julian was on singing saw which he played beautifully throughout the track he was you know playing a lot of weird sort of dissonant parts during some points in the song in the aeroplane over the sea adding a lot of character and to be there and finally you know be able to experience that music at least in a way in a live setting was surreal but yeah that's that's it if you've caught any of these Jeff Mangan performances that have been you know occurring recently if you were there at the Hartford Show what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why you know what did it mean to you what are these songs that Jeff was playing mean to you hearing these songs in person did it bring into a new level did it give them new meaning new character that's that's what I want to know and and thank you for watching again thanks to everybody who was at the show who watches the show and said hello whenever it happens is always a humbling thing to know just I guess sort of how much what I do means to some people who watch the show that's it Anthony Fantana Jeff Mangum forever [Music] 
_iB5t4yIrWk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd with rapper Milo doing our first super duper YouTube live streamed interview which is currently being recorded it will be up on the YouTube channel later I'm going to sort of you know take it down do an intro for and then you know put it back up so everybody can watch it um there will be a portion later in the interview where I will take questions from you guys so like a lot of you guys are watching this right now in this sort of YouTube boxes if this were a YouTube video that I pre-recorded but you can drop questions underneath later I will look at your comments I'll pick out a few questions and Milo will be happy to answer and then I picked out here you're free to do that earlier you made this super duper promise to me so yeah anything anybody asks me that's you know a good question even even the P P questions even creepy questions I mean I said a P plus just our three questions to which are creepy questions so I mean it's really it's really one of the same was I open if any of you are familiar with this man's music you know that he's not afraid to get personal to go to go forward um you just drop these two awesome EPS that I reviewed earlier this year love them very much things that happen to night things that happen today right now I'm being kind of carried through and promoted through hellfire Records you could check my reviews of those two EPs on the channel um you know of course I've been a fan of this guy's work since he put out the I wish my brother Rob were here mixtape and I think he's made a lot of I guess sort of a progression since then in his style and his music and then we're basically going to talk about sort of where he's at artistically these two new EPS what he's not kind of coming down the pipe in the future where he got that smashing shark tank top that he's wearing right now and and and that's about it you know that'll be the discussion and anything else that you guys want to talk about later alright so some questions I'm not going to come out grab you know move you you type real aggressively I like I can feel your muscles through the emails that you say I type them in all caps um um okay so so moving on I mean we're starting rather oh yeah when I listen to your tune EPS the very first thing that hit me that was like completely amazing to me is just how ambitious you got with the two EPs instrumentally why I thought the instrumentals on your debut tape are pretty cool and you know I always like bats you know which is why you know like this was so easy to enjoy the instrumentals off your Milo takes bats EP uh but you know what exactly causes you to go down this particular road with these with this collection of songs because I mean the 2 EPS that you dropped I mean the instrumentals are way more atmospheric I mean was it a case of you know just wanting to go that way did you just happen to meet up with the two producers that you know produce these EPS for you and that just happens to be their style um okay that's a great question fa thank you very excited to feature the UH analog tape dispenser is actually a huge huge fan of yours Justin and so he'd like because you said I was an OK rapper he um he sought me out on internet and was like you know I love needle drop he said you know can track or solicit your project and he sent me the instrumental that was post hot and I was like very first email like they like it was like hi I'm Justin here's a beat and like 90% of those emails or beats that you know aren't that great so I wrote to it immediately and sent it back and um there's like a very subtle hint of of like I don't know southern trap inflection in that instrumental for a bash or the fact a lot of the songs on that part of the yeah and that's exactly what happened that was the impetus for that we wanted to make like sad people trap music originally that using we call it prime meridian some something like that and then I finished the EP and I've been talking on Blake Gillespie so editor in Post magazine kind of is like a mentor in a lot of ways and um I save him the tape and he liked a lot but I was really scared that that sound would be too too radical shift like a paradigm shift if I can use the Canadian language there and um then like I just happen to meet this awesome producer from Wisconsin Riley Lake will Mitchell and um he and I just had like a total mind meld with philosophy and things that having that day was made like two weeks and pretty much the idea was to make an antithetical piece tonight but still um you know a lot of the same uh same things there the thing with will is like he's like a classically trained musician and he can put like violin and cello and like his sister plays violin like Yale and all this crazy shit so like his family is so musical and that's I think that's why those and that shows up in a lot of his be yeah you catch the strings in there and I'm imagining that pretty much all all of that is performed by him he's not granted yeah yeah it's insane and like we're working on a new record now which is a lot of sample stuff and I it's like it's really funny working with him because you can tell if he likes fucking with samples but he really really wants to be like me and like the ability to not do that as much as is interesting for him what's up so you ended up kind of working on these EP simultaneously like this wasn't just you know you work on one you worked on another you kind of like ran into these two producers around the same point you know right yeah um yeah yeah I was finishing up night when I started day came first and then day came I was at school and I mean I think honestly day is probably a little more introspective than that is for that reason because any time about school I always feel like a loser and that means I write songs when feeling like a loser I don't know well I mean it's uh I guess that's another interesting thing that we can kind of you know segue into I mean um as far as the the personality traits of these two EPs and just your music in general I mean is is there anything that besides being more interest that you think separates things that happen at night from things that happen today yeah there's a lot I mean how much philosophy you want to get into so many people you know that's another thing that we could talk about how many people do I put to sleep right now um uh yeah I mean one of the EPS day I I really wanted it to be very little philosophical at least explicitly philosophical content I wanted it to be more about poetry I've just gotten off tour with open mike eagle and he'd shown me this band King whistle and I'd never heard any music like that before which is like um you know this guy John s hall is just poet and he found that people didn't really like his problems when you read them alone so you like put a band together with just read poems over there reason and like yes he's insane poems like this one called the dishwasher and like Jesus was way cool that's like on the almond milk paradise like that random like what the fuck is he talking about in me being a song that's totally inspired by kings and so I wanted to do a lot more that kind of stuff where it seemed like nonsensical exploration of feeling through poem but um the night side was was infinitely more explicit philosophy in particular I'm a dualism and like this idea of like what's reality and mind-body problem and I just gotten done with a year of Latin so I was like man I have all this Latin what do I do with it so I was trying to find a way to work on this shit into music and not make it like too nerdy or too like I moved you tooted Percy oh and that was what I tried to do I mean I probably failed but well I mean you know that what's what I find to be interesting is the I mean you're I don't feel like your tracks come off as overly pretentious I mean especially a track like post hoc which definitely could come off as that way because of the hook and just the fact that you know I'm sure most people are going to have to Google what the hell that is in order to understand what look at what you know also I whoa what I'm saying is like you know but it but it's still sweet still accessible you can still get into it if you don't know about that stuff but what I guess I'm saying is still it plays a larger part in your music that it does for most rappers and and there are plenty of hip-hop artists that we could point to who are college-educated but when it comes to a personal story in their music that part really remains kind of unturned and unspoken about and it's just ever airlie discussing you know be like I'm sure you do things that are you know outside of college but it seems that much of what you do is influenced by the things that you learned there you know specifically philosophy well that's I mean that's because for me philosophy is you know there's asking these questions of like how can I be a better person or what does it mean to be good or what is beauty and I mean if I'm making music and obviously the music it's going to be an exploration of those themes and and I really just kind of consider the music I make to be an extension of the philosophy that I'm writing not so much that this philosophy is influencing music but literally like this music is just an extension of it where I get to play around with these ideas and a bit more of a free-form way like Gene Roddenberry the creator of Star Trek like he considered himself a philosopher and he thought Star Trek was like his opus all this kind of stuff and I mean I feel very similar to that you know like if I can make if I can make pieces of philosophy that you know Castle listen to at home and works to you and be interested in philosophy on some levels and I feels nice it is um you know another philosophical point to both of your EPS that seems to come up lyrically in at least a handful of songs um is the concept of objective truths there's even a weimer's like you know there's kind of like a head-butting between you and open mike eagle over over such a thing yeah that's awesome yeah oh well whatever I guess I want to ask is like after making these 2 EPS I mean do you feel any closer to you know to to obtaining you know any answers to your questions that kind of feel um yeah man I do I do feel closer to an objective truth I guess I don't know I feel like them I'm finally getting to the point where I can understand in this icon teen philosophy of working without regard to the consequence and like the action is where is where you manifest yourself and so like I've done a few interviews recently where people what are your goals it's like yeah I try not to even pay attention to stuff yeah as long as I'm able to create actively than that that the action is the goal um the thing with open mic those yeah he's a relativist big-time dude so he's always like well you know truth in this context know that cassia and I'm I don't know it's just like something in me I can't I don't know that feels wishy-washy I can't hang with that um but like I'm in an analytic right now reading all this Vidkun Stein and we had class on Thursday and his dude like dismantle soloff's ISM this idea that only I exist which was something that like scared me for the past three years and then to be in this class and had this dude dismantle it like I even tweeted I almost cried in classes most beautiful thing I've ever heard it's awesome I mean what what else about philosophy or other philosophical ideas you know I guess scare you uh what other philosophical ideas scare me okay solid system ethical relativism physicalism that's fuckin scary like people to think there's no mind like we're all just brains and fuckin neurons like yeah that's so depressing oh I see those are the big three to me okay and and I guess another philosophical thing that should be asked about before we before we move on is uh you know if you could put knew a few words you know why is Hegel so incomprehensible dude the phenomenology of the spirit oh my god I had to read that my freshman year and I just I've never been anything that made me feel like I didn't know what language I was speaking but you'll read that and have you ever had those those days where you have like a really thorough sleep and you wake up and maybe for about four to five seconds you forget how to talk you know talking about and you're in you're like in bed like and then you're like how do I talk and then you talk and you're like okay nevermind that's like what does to you in your reading my god boom how do I read what are these words um because he's making all sorts of crazy terms up and then they can't translate some of the German so you just be reading the sentence of the buh-buh-buh-buh-buh buhbuh buhbuh anyway what does that mean so yeah that's why well I mean you know uh Hangul could definitely be like that can't conduct calm could definitely need like that as well I mean you know what what T what what do you make something like you know coming together with this whole world idea that is so difficult in esoterica really only the person writing it can understand it I mean what what is so attractive to you about that or sort of what makes you gravitate toward that the awesome thing about that for me I just got show my girlfriend yeah it's really awesome um when you're sitting in like a class you're reading this book and you've read an idea that never ever would have come to like you you actually sit in all of an idea and you recognize that there's was someone out there who existed who is so much smarter than and had you know this like beautiful idea like the first time that I read Schopenhauer's idea I just sublime and like the sublime experience and when you you look at art and you actually cease to be your ego drops and you become one with your surrounding first time I read that it was like you know just blows you away or like the first time you read kambou and it talks about you know the only way that you and I can really truly like be bonded together is when we're rebelling against something formally that idea never would have come to me I say that's the that's the stuff that I love just recognizing how stupid I am that's what I like yeah um something you know to go back to poetry that influences you and the song specifically almond milk paradise which is one of my favorite songs on uh I'm one of the peanuts will be happy to get it and done it's something that you know is so awesome to me is the beginning that you said you know who's influenced you were influenced by someone else to do that but that's another characteristic that I caught your debut tape to you know kind of these as a spoken word and the thing is even when you're wrapping it kind of feels like you're still kind of blurring the lines between those two worlds like you're wrapping but you're not quite like you know it doesn't feel like you're spitting bars it really kind of feels like you're still just kind of talking and saying things that you would just want to say even if there wasn't a beat behind you right yeah that's that um I'd say that's a Foster Wallace enforcement like uh just this this idea that well why should I have to conform to the parameters of this song or to rap music in general and why not sort of bend this to my will and make it differently so I guess my lack of punchlines are like weird weird rhythms and writing to me is the same as like bored hey sir or David Foster Wallace using hell of footnotes you know I I guess the idea is like if I can make a flow that sort of interrupts even if it throws you off you're like why'd it was in there a punch line in there or something then you're probably quick to also think about whatever it was oh say I can come break you out of the monotony of just like you know that I wrote so hmm and I mean do you find they're just kind of wrapping in this way that is almost semi talking I mean it allows you to be maybe more sincere in what you're saying yeah I do and I mean like the big thing it's like I grew up in Maine and then I moved to Wisconsin and it's not like there's any kind of Reps in either of those two places so I didn't really have like there's no like big homey who like I went to every week or so it wasn't like ciphering every weekend and I heard that so it's a lot of like me watching the art of rhyme documentary or like you know me listening like bus driver records since I was 11 and being like okay that's how he raps like you know I'm writing down open mike eagle versus i was like 14 to see what like a good person look like Oh totally let me go over your neck dude you know um a lot of stuff so you know it's probably the flaws that come with being self self taught and isolated insular why what I think is interesting is that you know especially when it comes to genres like hip-hop you know it seems like where you're from and sort of what your background is is so so scrutinize you know and it has to be from a certain place and it has to be a certain thing you know you need to be from this place and Beyond the street and know these people and I produce with this guy right obviously you're coming from a place where or deepest connections that hip-hop have been through the internet you know you've been far removed from any kind of legitimate hip-hop scene and you know a lot of people who have kind of been in the same boat have you know been you know picked on or sort of labeled is not truly being hip-hop because they don't have that you know kind of closeness with a famous or popular hip-hop scene honey do you see you know a connection through hip-hop music as opposed to like you know outside your front door instead as being more inauthentic or something like that no not at all I mean most of the time when someone asks me where I'm from I really just want to say Internet cuz like I grew up on the internet on my forums video games so it feels naturally feel it makes sense honestly that all the shit would come through the internet cuz that's really where that's my neighborhood you know I mean and it makes a lot of sense I'd say the thing is that before this time it never could have happened you know like if I tried in like the early aughts or something like that to come up through the internet with rap obviously that wouldn't happen I was just lucky enough to be you know the zeitgeist at this time there are a lot of people who are blowing up 2d Internet you know and most of them seem to have a tinge of novelty or something like that to them and I'm just trying to make like weird rap folk hybrid songs I guess I know it works it makes sense to me it's really not to ramble on no rambling on is completely fine in this interview no here's the side rambling it's okay don't worry but um you know I want to bring up like a couple lyrics on cookie VPS that grab me in Saigon okay daddy let's go I guess you know but my dad does this to the altar it'll be like how that was actually that was actually one of my first questions okay you know the one of the lines that stuck out to me you know obviously you throw you know references and all sorts of weird things out there to kind of like throw listeners off but there are moments where you know you will put something out that is blatantly blatantly personal and it sort of seems to throw at least me off even more because it actually makes me think about you know like not just what you're saying but how it affects you personally and I mean one of those lines was that line is gonna scare my dad real bad good yeah I'm just like you know sitting there and imagining after I get that line like does your dad sift through all of your bars and like scrutinize your lyrics and he's like my mother what are you saying like this is me yo um my dad is like my biggest fan and as cool as hell cuz he's super supportive and he's like he's totally like yeah dude be a rapper like we're like my dad's into it and so he really did some music and he just listens to a lot like as a fan but then yeah like he'll be like young man also soon as lyric yeah it's terribly sad what's going on or like yeah me I'll be like like I don't I hope you tell me if if you started yeah hello hope you tell me if you're gonna drown the bathtub yeah like definitely I'll be like dad yeah yeah I'm not gonna kill my song and yeah so like I wrote that line and then literally it was like house you know calling through the bars house like that's would be so scared when you cancer so then I guess it's breaking down that fourth wall trying to figure out yeah what context is appropriate and constantly shifting that limbs alright um the next thing I want to say in a reaction to a line that you said is that I am pretty certain that I am NOT levar burton hmm no how can anyone be certain I'm certain oh yeah how how are you certain that you're not levar burton why i know for one uh if I were levar burton I mean I don't wear glasses I don't recall ever tweeting your lyrics on my Twitter account which he did well I mean that might be a different levar burton who says there can only be one LeVar Burton hahahaha deep philosophical queer here just like an abstract thought because you should love it if there were more than one LeVar Burton dude when he tweeted that I was so fun that was like two days after Sasha grad really expected immuno ejected someone failed the sasha grey tweeted you as well did the sasha grey tweet was insane that was me I didn't even catch that what was that oh you didn't get to dude Sasha great tweeted and posted on her Facebook the the two EPs and she loves her she's like hey pops not dead this is really go yes is the greatest so right now some here so right now some of your biggest fans are levar bird and sasha grey yeah I'll try to organize a party for all these people to hang out it how does this you know how does this feel going forward you know using this pattern that we do like that so far who else do you think would be good the photo this photo of the slushy girl he's my dad on Facebook he shared the link for Sasha's page and he's like such a great share or ease out thanks Sasha because this is super like cute dad Molokai Sartre was the best yeah look at him before is there um has there been a kitty pryde tweet yet because you should be like marking my references well I do with that line which I know you don't like was on his extra I thought was really clever because Kitty Pryde is one of the x-men so it was like me people people want me to either app about nerd shit or pop culture stuff and never anything other than those two things yeah and here was this in person who was pop culture to the you know popular rapper and then lose a comic book character yes I was like yo that's dope rhyme man I wrote it down like job bro is bars high and you ain't but okay not just the explanation of the explanation um another thing that I was like completely flabbergasted at the use of in these EPS what grabbed you to reference The Wallflowers one headlight okay um my man is I'm in class ha I like I remember when that song first came out and I was like doing son and that song was like number one on the radio for like so many weeks in a row and it was it was a hot jam did that all of a sudden and I never thought I would have an emotional connection to that song again and then all this I hope um that's the genius of will Mitchell like one day we're like almost done with the EP and he was just like he's a he Keys tends to be hyperbolic so he said me that he sent me this message at least five times now good like this is the best beat I've ever made and I'll be like okay send it through buddy so that's something that he'll say continuous every new beat that he sends he not every new baby like every three new beats the blue like I've never made a beat this great and they're like okay Doug that's here and that was one of them like it was it really was like the best beat he'd made up until that point like it was I hope oh and um I was not prepared for how good that bee was or how cool that idea was um I think working with will really make me step on my writing a lot and stop being like you know there are times where I just fallen on laziness or like you know oh you're some comfortable philosophical jabber store right now and like when you record the producer like we'll who's again like flipping wallflowers but playing it all himself and you know I'm doing this crazy stuff it was like obviously I couldn't just write a normal shitty sad boy verse on it um so I really like working with will cos he's a lot more talented than me and it makes me self-conscious that makes me work harder mm-hmm why is if there's anything that's like the current theme and a lot of your rhymes outside of you know the philosophy and other things it is self-consciousness yeah um I don't know our next Records there will be double self-consciousness aware of that I'm aware of myself oh no I just kidding maybe I'm not um yeah man we shall be more self-conscious I feel like the idea with that is um I'm trying I'm trying at least for my music to be what is it say try as I said like my musics a better person that I am which in his instance might be true I'll really know him as a person but um I think that's a good motto and especially in line with like the philosophical enquiries that go on and like I'm always trying to be aware of who I am and and I mean there's something really like relieving about writing songs almost is like you have some sort of quasi confessional and there's this moment of like you know I've probably done some terrible things but maybe if I can distill them into some song it helps you know a fifteen-year-old lonely kid get through his day in high school where everyone's asshole but maybe it'll even out or something like that I don't know this is a utilitarian argument I'm not a utilitarian just for the reference um like I guess there are moments were like you know the though he he what you're doing and certainly I agree with you to an extent that what you do is sort of outside of the bubble rack part I rap archetype um you know there are certainly things there like you know some of the jokes that you make and you know the the charisma that comes through that that comes with the genre usually you know takes a certain level of confidence and able to pull off and be sincere and all those other things but some of the things that you say can be sort of self-defeating in a way you know where it's like there there's one track in particular where I can't remember the track the name of it off the top of my head it tell me if I'm wrong is it one of the folks met the fuck metaphysics tracks where you're sort of like throwing all these things like you know I will vote for the wrong guy for the metaphysics yeah that mistake I'll make this other bad decision you know you're just sort of like despite the fact that you started' seem to be conscious of all this stuff and then you're you know kind of like a level-headed guy you're just sort of listing up all these bad things that you'll do isn't that the worst thing ever the like when do you not to be on some like corny philosophy major shit like I'm always aware of the bad things I'm doing in the night do them I like it's like why am I doing this is fucking awful and then I do it and I guess that's what that songs about it's like this future Rory who like isn't a vegetarian anymore and it's like all about money I mean like yeah voting for the wrong guy and all this stuff it was like maybe if I write this down it'll it'll serve as some sort of them Archimedean reference point that when I might you know 37 I'll hear this song Dec what am i become you know what I mean so that's really what it was more for anything else like a time capsule mm-hmm so I mean do you know do you see like you and in your rhymes and just sort of the things that you write becoming more sure of themselves into the future or do you see that like you know because it seems like in a sense that you're trying to be however it seems like the fact that you are is so much of an inspiration in terms of things to write about um yeah okay let's talk about this new let's talk about assembly music man this will be like the first time I really say that working on this mixtape called cavalcade and so our original production with my friend Ryder Lake and each um each song samples a different song by this band America which is my grandfather's favorite band and he's the reason I kind of got into me taking he's dying so I wanted to make him a record and I'm now dealt with death before you know I mean and I've done it in a very traditional way when Rob died I made a mixtape it was sad and I was sad and that's how I handled it and this time I'd be reading you know a lot more camu and now I have like you know an artillery of you know cool philosophical vocabulary where it's like the absurd is rebellion and all this kind of shit and so what I wanted to do with this record was basically make a really loud confident piece that's um about hope and rebellion and the absurd and it's called cavalcade because that's like the people who ride horses and parades and basically the idea is like this is death parade meets and yeah there's certainly um what you're talking about yeah the rhymes are especially on this record there are a lot more endemic to a degree there's a lot more they're louder there's you know there there's a sense of certainty there that is almost absolutely a front but it's kind of like what when does it become necessary to front you know like you can sort of submit to sadness or you can you can but no I'm gonna fuck you know what I'm fine today I'm gonna get out of bed and I'm gonna go to the arcade and have fun god damn it and that's kind of what the record is about was like that moment of saying fuck you to internment resignation so that's what I'm working on that that sounds like a fantastic projection um so you're still working with the same producer that you did on the on day yeah yeah LP yeah yeah um will Mitchell who goes by the producer named Riley Lake he's um the exact same age as me and we're both from Wisconsin and it's easy to work with the dude who's um also making music to escape schoolwork and surely the enemy and we just have a really good vibe and this is an idea that I've had for a long time and I've actually tried to make this record a few times before with other producers I just didn't like where it was going this is the first time where I've worked with someone who's just I mean there's no way to say you know like dude is like the young throat glass like he's a musical Jews and he's the only person I know who could do this project and like flip America and not making these super corny and stuff and it's it's exciting so yeah I'm working with Riley right guy why me with how with how well he is musically you say that's really sheer writing to another degree in the way that you write songs in general to another degree kind of a reference back to you know your earliest tape does working with Riley make you care about song structure no and that's what's really cool he's um again we have like the same philosophy so he's like this is a first time before it was like I don't care about song structure but I stole all these beats on internet that we have structure so this is like your first time we're like yeah Riley he'll make me beats that don't have any structure like TM he made me this one B it's in like three three four four and six six all at the same time and it was a light-hearted in Part B Part C part and it has like a ten BPM fucking tempo switch like it's just like this huge amorphous piece yeah dude no we're getting real weird it's about to turn very strange I mean it's it's a structure but it's not a traditional structure sound like a verse chorus verse thing right right right so okay so your point is the lack of structure right like ambitious with doing different kinds of yeah um because predictability in a song is a powerful tool but it's overused and it comes to the point where like you know I didn't know here's something that you said you said what did you say like I write choruses shitty or something like that and I'm really into this idea of trying to write good courses but then throwing them away so like writing it like on this new tape I have a really good course on this one song I'm not gonna tell you what it is or anything like that and like is dope and everyone I played it for they get stuck in the head look like oh good suck and I only say it like two bars and they're like you should repeat that much more but nah and that was the idea with post-hoc to like um the coda like my dad's like if you could get that in there and other times some house I know and that sort of demands this replay and like the lack of predictability demands that you spend more time with it that's I guess what we're trying to get and if um if you and Riley end up coming together on this new album writing the great rap song would you let us hear it no man I um no I couldn't I couldn't do it I couldn't mm-hmm uh-huh no I wrote this piece for postmodern culture about that I don't know man I feel that stems back to like um just us you know the song I wrote for Rob and like most days I wish I'd never put this on on the Internet relatives I'm bigging the sincerity and to a degree it seems like if you write music for other people a year then there's an element that's insincere weather and that's a song that I really like is it sincere because it's like you know you know there's going to be an audience for it yeah insincere yeah because to to get exactly what you're talking about there's an audience for it um you know it's not really for yourself I don't know it just seems that's that seemed like a moment between myself and my friend and I made it a moment between myself my friend and the whole widenar and sometimes I beat myself up over this so I learned my lesson if I wrote the greatest rap song I wouldn't let any of y'all motherfuckers here look if you brought the greatest raps I mean I mean it's the most sincere rap song and then putting it out there would make it less sincere well I guess that's a really good point to me the greatest rap song is sincere an element of sincerity is there and yeah therefore I couldn't I couldn't put that so maybe I've already written the greatest rap song you will never know cuz I only cheer okay dude I should that should be my new like violin like writer of the greatest rap song won't let you hear it like new me that's a shouldn't say that I've done that even though I am and then nobody can actually hear it or check it out dude that's what Soloff system is that's I mean you know you're not a person your mental constructive line you can never prove me wrong well there you go okay well I guess I can't prove you wrong but I guess that was really that was really my motive whenever know why it wasn't your motive to go monitor Hofstra and I didn't let you have that most I was like okay um that's pretty much all that I wanted to say want to do that's about it uh yeah that's it dude um what what what what that's it man that seems to be it it seems to be ah man that's all there is that's all there was yeah what you so cool to me I can't say that's all that I can't say that's all that there ever will be why you why are you so cool to me I'm no cooler than you then I would beat anybody else you're not special you're nice guy Mack like that you're good but you're like that no wait hold up before you go let's talk let's talk about South by Southwest at ease yeah you're we have to showcase going on and you're gonna perform you agree to perform Hey no no not shows said tattoos I was stopped by okay well first let's let's say that we do have a showcase coming up in South by Southwest and you're gonna play play it yeah I'm playing it with my rack dad mmm and and and we and and there might be we might have to do something over there oh dude that'd be cool although I can't get out my heart because I have muscles like you know what stupid I don't have any muscles and I'm not a single muscle in this body all right Doug he just said I French press you benchpress I do I do but hold me for philosophical purposes not for know do we ramble did I ramble too much of that flush three no you were good was it okay you're fine sometimes I didn't you like it and you know everyone goes to sleep is this is this a sincere moment that you're having right here are you conscious of the audience that's watching us right now I'm asking you I don't we can cut them on so you're having a sincere moment despite the audience they don't exist when there is no audio just writing out of your head isn't it easier when you're doing everything on the internet to pretend like it all doesn't exist yeah that's what's that's one of the cool things about the internet hmm okay just pretend it just asking um what did you ask me I forgot I asked you if we're gonna get tattoos the other Southwest us are we going to get South by Southwest tattoos if you can get somebody to come up with a badass design I might totally consider it as design No and I don't I mean we don't have to get matching ones we just get tattoos together and South by Southwest you you're taking it to a new level okay so we just get any tattoos together yeah at all you know you don't add that see you showed your cars now now we know you really like if you even think about getting a matching tattoo you like yeah there's some where brown guy Mel Internet makes weird music you gotta love that I thought that was just implied that's all uh okay also I almost wrote a song a Calvi but don't worry and he's long as the cows beaks I almost did I thought about it for set me down I downloaded listen um it's like hmm longest beat just longest title was that yeah thought about it that that was the beat yeah dude how was the one last thing barren now that was like some weird gritty ass New York boom bap hip hop I know that's the boy that's why I was like if you know why make a normal song if the shows would now be why not do something my never I think you should if you do that come up with another pseudonym like another character within yourself where where you're actually that guy that grew up in New York listening to hip hop you I keep having this idea I want to start a different project called danger dude danger dude yeah but it's a different thing I want to be like really cheesy R&B stuff but like the cover be like a crazy motocross scene it's a danger dude and then you like play the record that's just all really corny on these songs whatever this is all that would be in u.s. what does that face what is it you made this face it was it was it was a giggling case SI you giggle yeah I gave a little bit so what and I can giggle ball sent you giggle like like black dynamite or something a little bit sometimes okay right now I'm uh right now I'm trying to see if I can drum up some uh comments from people yeah did do it I mean that guy thing drinking the rest of this coffee let me see people using the bathroom behind me okay here we go let's see we have a few questions yes we do okay let's do it that's cool I'll pick out I'll pick a few questions from the prodigious this thing I guess some one person wants to know if you're ever going to be doing you know sort of like a North American or just sort of decent-sized tour in the future behind some of your stuff dude that's a really great question um yeah this summer is like the first time that I've ever had a real like I now have a real audience I'm on the label that's the bestest and yeah there's the infrastructure now to do something like that um so yeah I would like to this summer that's my goal okay and um this this album that you were talking about coming together this one person's kind of an axe asking about your 2013 plans and I guess what I'm wondering is is that album kind of in your plans for a release or is that something that's more 2014 mm that's a good question um I wanted to be out for summer I wanted to be free I wanted to be against it I don't know man I haven't had this discussion with the label at all I don't know what their plans are they could be like why the fuck is he saying all that on the internet um like what's that I guess but I don't think it would um breaking any non-disclosure agreements right now are you yeah dude I'm going to go no I'm not um I don't know man I want to be a free mixtape because got a million samples in it so I don't know how we do that anyway like clearing all of them yeah ya know so that's a good question 2013 what do I have I want to put out at least that tape and then um I don't know man honestly honestly I want too late it may be ready take some time and put together a real a real album album someone made this comment about things that have that day things that happen at night those like gimmicky fucking idea like put together real album or something like that and that's like um I mean there might be some validity that you know maybe maybe I do have to make the real full-length piece hmm well um get them into free music versus music that you actually pay for someone else is kind of asking here especially now that you're on a label you've got kind of like a label thing going on now the point at which people can buy things a day and things at night like on vinyl or something like that yeah um the label I did cassette and then the label is doing cassettes and then we talked a lot about vinyl and I think yeah it'll happen eventually it'll be probably on the internet for sale it'll be cool yeah okay cool I mean at least that's sort of it yeah no no no no doubt man um I really don't like CDs I think they're calling me outdated I mean I think any physical of music is outdated so why not do something that's obscenely outdated like vinyl or cassette why even try to pretend to be bothered with the CB okay um let me uh I'm going through the rest of you this bug your questions somebody said that we should just have sex already which is which is great yeah we should okay okay that's a different that's a different one came show yeah that's one that we would actually make people pay for right that'd be pretty good money probably good do you think of a good money let's tattoo money it could be another person wants to know if if at all you are a fan of of Death Grips if at all mi5 Death Grips um not to the degree that like real people are there a couple joints that I think are dope one of my homies Kurt would have a shout-out Kurt wooden um he's super new and so like I just love hearing his impression they're like me oh good British model door from school in like so just like scream that shit like randomly you look get off me Avery what do you do it sergeant I think I love the effect that it has on people more than I like listening to it yeah I think it grew I don't actively listen to them okay another person here is asking which which could be a good question I mean who is your favorite or I imagine it may be difficult to say a favorite maybe just sort of like a couple favorites and maybe people can start off with if they're not like familiar with the ship but you know who's your favorite philosopher Oh me yeah I love that question okay what are we talking about here let's talk contemporary philosophy that's that's really the only thing the question was just a sudra favorite philosopher alright you know makes me like you know a point of entry yeah yeah yeah yeah okay contemporary is this black dude from Harvard and Kwame Apia who's all about like cosmopolitanism of all time Arthur Schopenhauer you should you should check out as a piece called essays and aphorisms which is like sort of his he's like layman's entry point into his philosophy it's not technical at all he's got all sorts of like really clever one-liners in there that I steal and turning the rap songs um so that's a good okay and um you know something something that I definitely should have asked somebody else asks is there anybody else in the near future that people may know of in hip-hop that you may be collaborating with near future on a surprise I tweeted about this very dilemma I don't cuz I'm from the internet I don't know how to talk to these again I've got a nerd you know for my handi wanna be on a song with me you never I really want can I say it on here and then you can be like yo my lord no suit and then that's how we'll get the person to collaborate with me um okay no I held a hard one up a song i hella hard want brownsville uh ha ka and a hella hard on Jeremiah J on a song those are two dudes that I would really fucking love to write a song with and like the other day I was scheming them like how to I don't want it I got tried to tweet Jeremiah like hey do I really like your songs you know I'm about to break that open but yeah those are the two people I would like to work with okay well you know Jeremiah J I mean you know it doesn't seem like especially him I mean with his brain feeder affiliation and everything I mean I'm sure you could be get a hold of him possibly maybe I don't know me I just feel like a dink so I don't ever try there's um actually there's band out of Wisconsin Fox pho X and they're like lead singer singer harmonica Martin she is a really really great voice and I really wanted to be on the song man for a long time mm-hmm she's an outgoing in assertive person so she messaged me randomly so yeah that's a person that you'll probably hear on the song okay um one person wants to know why was Dragonball Z not worth watching before sell Kane Milo like judging I mean that's like you know was my man Township we hold these truths to be self-evident like the show just got better when selves on like everyone's power levels were ramped up the fighting was ramped up the storyline was fucking insane cell is where the shit gets good if you like fries that you're in l7 weenie okay well there you go there's the answer to the question and this other person asks something that we talked about kind of earlier not in the show amazing just some new people I walked in and haven't really kind of caught this but as one person wants to know Milo have you checked your privilege lately about check my privilege and check your privilege me that's such a great question yeah I'd shake I try to check my privilege all time obviously I'm inordinately rich I'm famous I'm very pretty I'm a very pretty man I'm healthy no seriously though I do I am aware of that and that's something that I worry about a lot um but at the same time I feel like I'm in a unique position to sort of I don't know sort of parade my privilege to degree I don't know how many other Brown did it's wrapped like this it should be more Brown rap in this way I'm not gonna make such an egotistical statement but yeah I mean uh do you think hip-hop is coming to a point where maybe it needs to be obsessed a little less with such a thing because I mean you know I feel like now especially I mean you have to be coming from at least some certain level of privilege in order for you to have the ability and the time and you know the resources to create music in general well I mean I think the question really should be like who in this country doesn't have a level of privilege that compared to someone around the world isn't astounding I mean um pretty much I mean there are people who live in other countries who are starving to the point where think about the concept of privileges is a luxury and another right that's exactly the point that's exactly a you got it on so I mean once you get in this question privilege it's again relative to like what um but do I think that the question is almost beside the point um I don't know yes no maybe I read this piece the other day in my school's newspaper where some kid was like if you don't like rap it's probably cuz you hate black people and I was like man that's still like that's still an argument you know like that's still Wow that's weird I don't know it feels like we need cultural moderators to sort of um uh sure along boring fucking polemical things like that yeah me like it that I that's boring we talked about that too much but we don't have cultural matter intersex would be a job for me I should do that okay well I mean I'll let you know if there's any a place to apply for such a thing if I you know if I see wanted ad on Craigslist cultural moderator needed I'll pass it your way good ladies and gentlemen my low reps very first cool interview dude on the needle drop dude awesome and thank you so much it was great to talk to you Cheech it thanks for coming on the show dude it was fun yeah for sure all right dude keep me in the loop anything use achill you're doing in the future and stay awesome okay you two forever forever 
p0-ZLyefddQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ice age LP yo nothing me no that that wasn't directed at you ice age is a Danish punk rock outfit this is their sophomore LP but not only are they a punk band but in their music they are brought together in this new LP and their debut LP elements of hardcore punk post-punk noise rock and tons of compression on the overall mix of these tracks giving the songs a very kind of heavy Bhoomi quality the band can be pretty Brutus but there are no strangers to detail when you kind of dig deeper beyond the fact that everything is so echoey so distorted so noisy because even though these guys are very loud in a sense they're kind of carrying a depressive torch for groups like Joy Division and other Danish post-punk acts as well like the sods and it's no surprise that these guys are fans as well of groups like death in June of black metal artists as well through these influences these guys take their hopelessness they take their anguish emotions and they get really aggressive with them the band is just as abrasive as they've always been but on this album you're getting a few dance beats there are some group vocals here and there singing low low low low the instrumentation and the production overall is a bit cleaner a little less lo-fi there are some new ideas but what originally has made the Bands music so appealing to some but I would say unappealing to most is still there to the point where there are some tracks on here where I really do kind of feel like there's nothing new to report like the song burning hand or the other track rasas haha to me these tracks are a little maybe middle of the road for Ice Age they're not particularly aggressive or fast or depressive or noisy or anything like that they are passable and they're fine and they feel like they fit within vans typical style but it's not like they do anything new to define it or experiment with it overall they kind of blend into the ferocity of this 28 minute blast that sneaks in just to tick longer than the debut LP aside from those two tracks for me personally there's not any really major downsides for me on this album outside of a very eerie well textured and well put together but kind of ill placed interlude right at the third track on the album which unfortunately kind of cuts off the momentum that the LP has going up to that point thanks to the first two tracks the opener of this album is the song ecstasy and when this song hits if you don't like it I would say just get the hell out and turn back because this song kind of highlights what turns a lot of people off when it comes to Ice Age they're playing can be really really loose and that seems to be the case as the band kind of breaks into this disco dance beat with these sixteenth notes on the high hat with this alternating bass drum in this snare and over this are these tremolo guitars and bass which are just being strung really quickly but not necessarily in tandem with the beat and you know perfect syncopation and it creates this really dense thick wall of guitar noise over this dance beat which I mean to me is wildly catchy and just sort of weird but you know could be kind of I guess needlessly noisy to other people after this the band kind of reveals this looseness to be kind of an act kind of a facade as they quickly shift away from these tremolo guitars to this very fast-paced you know sets Arista and Denon and they totally switch gears go much faster and when the hook breaks in they switch gears yet again and not only change the speed but kind of change the emotion too because it goes from this aggression and it goes from this passion to this you know dark sadness that you know it seems like the singer of the group can't even awake himself from brush up oh god no after this the pummeling and surprisingly clear track coalition comes in a track that I loved earlier this year talked about in a quickie video earlier this year and I was actually surprised to just hear how composed the band felt on this track but just as biting the song in Hayes has these treble e guitars kind of causing a ruckus and the right channel against this relentless punk groove that is enhanced by the band's very boomy sound I love the jumpy kind of erratic melody on the hook and the vocals on this track to me personally are fantastic yeah they're not amazing vocals in the traditional sense but they're so freakin angry their fiery yet apathetic it's like a pissed-off swan song for defeatism for me the biggest surprise on this entire LP is the song morals which actually to me kind of feels like a post-punk prom song and a bit of a piano ballad led by the band's lead singer the drums behind this track kind of hammer away on the snare militaristically and overall the track kind of seems to bring the band into this sort of downtrodden singer/songwriter like state where all I can kind of you know see is like this post-punk prom going on where everybody's sad and breaking up and the punches spike tell the girls mascaras smudged and there's a sense that I get from this song specifically from the lyrics of just kind of personal weakness which is a feeling I get throughout most of the Bands music this band is is far from projecting any kind of emotions or personalities that feel confident or even strong instead it's kind of self-loathing self-deceptive and gain some kind of catharsis and power and strength from that the strength to make the head bashing music that they create kind of like another lyric on this LP where I believe the singer says wounded hearts can fight but it all comes down the same which is I mean an extremely pessimistic state of mind after this track the extremely catchy song awake comes through which has a great guitar melody very lively vocals I would say it's really the most high-spirited song on the entire album and the closing track on this LP is is fantastic as well and has this mantra of you're nothing over the hook kind of you know reminding the listener of the Bands ethos as the album comes to a finish overall I love this LP I feel like it's pretty on par with everything that made the debut album fantastic with a little bit more diversity as a result maybe there were some missteps here and there especially with that interlude but still I thought it was a fantastic album and is definitely going to be on my favorites list toward the end this year I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this LP if you're in the market for some noisy punk music that nihilistic Elise Mears itself in distortion compression just sonic filth then get into this LP if you've given this LP a listen what do you think of it do you love it hated why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's it Anthony Fantana Ice Age forever you [Music] you 
tJqnPRuIdmQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album push the sky away Nick Cave is an Australian singer-songwriter and the London band that he currently leads is on its 15th studio LP laying another collection of songs on top of the group's ever-growing and impressively consistent discography the songs that Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds turn out tend to be kind of dark tortured or melancholy or have this element of stomach-churning viciousness to them and while there are other CD singer-songwriters that I do enjoy quite a bit like Tom Waits for example Nick Cave has always kind of reached down into that lower level just that next level of seediness between songs like Mickey Mouse and the goodbye man from the new Grindr man LP the birthday party's album's tracks like where the wild roses grow up jump the devil good son I constantly find myself asking when I listen to much of what is related to Nick Cave is Nick Cave deeply disturbed I know Nick Cave has had his more pg-13 moments over the years but I really do feel like that there are either parts of his brain that he has been cursed with all his life or maybe we all have those parts in our brains and most of us are just kind of afraid to explore them or think about them obviously Nick Cave is not dangerously insane because he's managed to hold together a music career that really any musician would be proud of plus he's covered an impressive group of genres over the years post-punk goth rock alternative rock baroque pop as well as Foulke Nick Cave and his band maybe went a little easier on the ears in the 2000s the darkness was still there they weren't as brash as they were with their earlier noisier post-punk stuff it was I guess in a sense tortured but a bit more mature however in years Nick Cape has been kind of getting back to his punk rock punk blues and garage rock roots not only with new Bad Seeds releases like dig Lazarus dig and abattoir blues but the recent formation of his band grinder man and even though it's really only been a couple years since we've heard from Nick Cave through grinder man it has been a while since we've heard from the Bad Seeds I mean really since about 2008 with dig Lazarus dig which is more than enough time for some kind of stylistic or emotional reinvention and before this LP even came out there was this sense for me anyway that this LP would be receding back to Nick caves more sort of melancholy side especially because of the cover which looks like some kind of awkward breakup going on in a French new-wave film and the few tracks that drop before this LP Jubilee Street which does have an intense ending but is nowhere near Nick caves most intense song and we know who you are which is really one of the more somber tracks I've heard Nick Cave put out in recent years so of course when I sat down to listen to the entire LP it was no surprise that push the sky away overall is a much moodier experience than most of Nick caves output almost as if it were conceived in this sort of depressive state fueled by a very sad personal experience and some of what happens on this LP does seem to kind of shake cave in a personal way which is something that for a Bad Seeds fan is somewhat of a rare treat because often Nick Cave is sort of playing this narrator character or a character within a story that he's penning for a song that he's singing you're not really getting a moment like off this LP finishing Jubilee Street where he kind of sings specifically about finishing the track and how the imagery the dream inspired imagery off of that song has this deep emotional significance to him that has him kind of distraught which I'm sure for some Bad Seeds fans is going to be extremely intriguing to kind of see him in in this emotional state for an entire albums length but for me personally I mean I really missed despite how many times I listened to this album I really missed the gusto the fire the looming gloom and doom that cave typically brings to a track with the exception of the track Jubilee Street I really did not get even a whiff of that character that has told so many twisted stories over the years and it's not really the sadness or the melancholy about this album that has me kind of you know wandering other places with in my head when I'm listening to this thing I mean it really kind of feels like in a way Nick Cave has shrunken into himself and and it's difficult for him to project the emotions that he is feeling with the power that he typically does and and while yeah this isn't the most musical part of the album you know we're not exactly getting down to instrumentation here we're talking about vocal delivery we're talking about personality but I personally feel that Nick caves music is nothing if not extremely personality driven and if the personality isn't there for me the magic isn't there and this magic only shows up occasionally mostly on the first half of the LP and the LP here is not very long it's just about 42 minutes but to me it feels much longer despite only having nine tracks and that's mostly because the songwriting on this LP isn't all that sharp or concise it's not all that ballad driven or anything like that with the exception of maybe a few songs the songs on this LP aren't compartmentalized or cutting like they are on albums like the Bauman's call or Henry's dream instead Nick Cave uses a songwriting a performing technique that he's been using on and off over the years very consistently on the grinder man LPS and recent output from the Bad Seeds where he basically grabs a groove he grabs a musical idea and it sort of gets you know jammed out repeated in a sense over and over and over as he kind of tells his tale and sings over it it's more of a linear way of songwriting it's a more linear way of song performing and this Niq is executed awesomely on Jubilee Street where the track just gets more and more intense as it goes along you get this sense that you're moving from point A to point B as the song finishes not only because Kate is telling this story with detailed lyrics but the instrumentation gets hotter it gets heavier strings sort of seep in however there are moments on this LP where I personally feel like cave really needed to I guess sort of edit himself and maybe you know bring some of these songs down boil them down into a sharper ballad like we get on the song we know who you are like on the song wide lovely eyes which just to me feels like this very tame almost adult contemporary piece of gospel inspired songwriting and a lot of the instrumentation on this track especially the guitar riff feels just robotically and kind of annoyingly looped behind everything sort of taking away the the flow and the intimacy out of this song and in others on here too like we real cool this is an issue that I had off a dig Lazarus dig too a lot of the instrumentation felt chopped it fell looped but I feel like what kind of made that album scrape by anyways is the fact that so many of the songs were just loud and in-your-face and energetic in my opinion it's not working so well here on these softer and slower tracks and the songs that don't really have any clear loops in them and kind of wander around a little bit more when it comes to what's being said and the instrumentation for example the song mermaid the atmosphere is really nice the instrumentation on this track swells really awesomely but in my opinion the story that Nick tells and the vocals he sings them with on this track are really unengaging and just don't do anything for me emotionally whatsoever it just doesn't come in and grab me or lure me in either again this is a point where Nick Cave seems kind of shrunken inside of himself and not really projecting much of anything other than some mumbles some kind of indulgences that don't really have any significance to me maybe to him overall to me the song was unmemorable kind of uneventful and borderline unbearable and when the song finishing Jubilee Street comes on it becomes very apparent to me that Nick Cave is not personally insane at all possibly because we're getting this very personal look at his feelings and I mean they actually come off pretty mundane with how he's delivering them how they're being performed in the sense through his vocals and his storytelling the group vocals and the keyboards on the hook are really nice but Nick caves lyrics and his storytelling they wander and meander more than the whittling banjo all over this track in terms of a tale and in terms of songwriting it's really a musical bridge to nowhere just kind of fading out into the the nothing that it conjured the closing track on here the title track is extremely lackluster as well with even more unengaging vocals from Nick Cave against these watery boring synthesizers that just don't do anything for me from beginning to end there was just not really much about this album that I found to be spectacular I wouldn't hold it up to anything from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds early stuff I wouldn't even hold it up to anything from their most recent two LPS while I'm still going to look forward to the next Bad Seeds LP this album just did not move me whatsoever I mean sure it didn't offend me or really have any terrible awful horrible songs on it but I mean when you pile all of these tracks on top of one another it just becomes this long very beige kind of experience that doesn't really you know do much emotionally lyrically musically it just kind of repeats repeats repeats mumbles I mean to me that's that's what pushed the sky I mean adds adds up to its again it's just my opinion but I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Nick Cave forever [Music] [Music] 
KbSMVxEPb-8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new beach fossils LP clash the truth this is the long awaited sophomore full-length LP from the new york band beach fossils whose self-titled debut pretty much got the ball rolling on a pretty big trend in underground indie rock and pop that's been just rolling and rolling and rolling over the past few years and that trend is just steady guitar-driven and echoey dream pop kind of like the light beach visiting pastel-colored cousin to the indie rock we once knew typically on the albums that have featured this style the vocals tend to be kind of apathetic the guitar tones are usually pretty stringy trevally with shimmering echoes on them maybe little bland and sound strum patterns drum patterns melody as well from the guitar and the vocals too they don't really tend to be that I guess sort of distinct or or flavorful when it comes to composition to me this sound has always been fine for a few songs or like a single but it all kind of tends to blend together in this really sort of unrewarding and kind of boring way when I listen to an entire album of it from beginning to end this has kind of been the tune that I've been singing whenever I've talked about a record in this style whether it be in a review or a y-you know review or a blogpost whatever and because of this sort of bias and this general uninterested music that has this sound in this style I wasn't anticipating expecting much from this new Beach fossils LP even though I did like the last EP that they put out which actually had wild nothing on it however I have to say with this new album I'm pleasantly surprised and not only because I think the band is writing better tunes the production is better on this LP but I just did not anticipate the kind of variety that Beach fossils would bring on clash the truth and the detail - I mean for one the vocals on this LP are way more audible than on any other previous efforts I mean they're they're no longer a prison to the reverb and the echo that they constantly use throughout every single song the melodies on this LP pop the playing and the instrumentation overall is just more energetic I've seen the band live a couple times they rock their songs out way harder in person than they are on record and I'm just feeling the interplay I'm feeling the momentum I'm feeling the grooves on this album there's actually more than one guitar tone on this album - there's thinner tones thicker ones some distortion here and there acoustic guitar and all of these additions are being brought into this new record while the band kind of still sticks to its signature sound the mood that this band usually brings to the table is still there the accessibility is still there simplicity is still a key feature to their sound what beach fossils does across this 35 minute record is not all that technical or flashy not profound not even I guess I would say novel at this point now that we have a bunch of albums popping up in this very same style every single year but on clash the truth Beach fossils does some embracing some soul searching of their influences and just end up with a more solid record because of it the introductory track on here is a bit of post-punk kind of Joy Division influence and has these very catchy chanted group vocals kind of a mantra it's a very lively start for this typically sleepy band and though the song is sure along with a lot of others on here Beach fossils kind of have this way of keeping their songs so stripped down yet so energetic that the brevity feels so complete anyway in the same way that a punk band like wire would the band kind of continues to put a defining characteristic on every single song on this LP like the track generational synthetic which has this galloping snare drum this descending vocal melody that's sticking in my head as well as some very melodic guitar phrasing or the chorus and the acoustic track on here that comes shortly after sleep apnea is a decent song as well it's a little short it's the one moment on this LP that I feel it could have been fleshed out more but I like the very sort of dreamy psychedelic textures that the band brings this track the song really feels tired in the way that a lack of sleep hood would make you feel but even songs on this LP that feel well within beach fossils comfort zone have this sort of new vibrance to them with just harder playing and some more detail like the song careless which has these burning guitar leads all over the place a danceable drumbeat all these sweet young male group vocals mmm the song is simultaneously sleepy intoxicating and poppy and exciting the tracks on this LP it's not like Beach fossils is pumping out these 15 minute epic progressive monsters but clash the truth features the band's most fleshed out material yet with melodies that actually stick out and are memorable and verses and courses that actually kind of feel like they're coming from different spots there's contrast there it just doesn't feel like this one endless sleepy tired boring blob of a song the band continues to put a distinct characteristic into every single song on this LP like the song burned you down which has this tick-tock tight dance beat the song birthday has some shark biting distortion on it but it washes over the whole track in this kind of My Bloody Valentine worship sort of way and the song in vertigo actually features Kasim Aquino from Blonde Redhead on vocals she slides into the song very nicely along with the male vocals that the band usually provides it's sweet to see them kind of tribute Blonde Redhead because they're no doubt an influence I love the stringy layers of guitar on the song caustic cross they're soft but they scream out confidently against these very fill filled drumbeats which hit me and remind me that man just overall the drumming on this LP is so much better there are a few drones on here a few interludes which are placed very nicely not taking away from the momentum of the album and the sounds that they actually bring forward our very pretty adding to the dreamy quality of the album this LP was put together really well Beach fossils actually conceived this album with just a grandeur point of view they weren't just trying to put together a bunch of singles that ended up sounding like crap when you put them together into an album overall the band sticks to its light and and youthful sound but feels mature and detailed enough to the point where you can actually take it seriously but not too seriously because really it's it's all about fun maybe you could make the argument that this LP is to say me say me for its own good I'm sure that there are going to be some people who are turned off a little bit by the band's constant constant dreamy sound but I still find this LP personally to be diverse enough to be enjoyed and a really interesting crossroads of things like indie rock shoegaze dream pop as well as punk rock the vocals could have been maybe a bit more distinct and that of course you know I would love to hear them lay on more melody in the future but there's not really any huge complaints from me honestly I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Beach fossils forever [Music] you 
Rv3qVx2fUCU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new portal LP portal is an australian death metal act they've been at it since the 90s and have a handful of albums under their belt to show for it over the years the group has had about a dozen different members many of them contributing and being members of other australian extreme music acts as well however along with groups like disembowelment as well as nei oblivious chorus destroyer 666 and bella core portal has kind of seen a rise to international metal fame they're really one of the bigger underground australian metal acts at the moment but still it's not like they're a major player in death metal in general and i would say mostly that is because of how dam impenetrable the band's music is they make easily some of the most chaotic and and dense death metal I've heard in a while though the group at times is labeled as being technical death metal I wouldn't say the playing that they showcase in their songs is overly flashy or anything like that for the most part what's going to stick out to you about portal is just how muddy thick and just blood caked their sound is which has been a pretty consistent quality of theirs over the years albums like 2009 swarf is is not too far off from the original blueprint of death metal the guitars are really grimy the drums are extremely heavy the death grouser in there as well the chromatic chord changes are in there too it's just that portal likes to I guess sort of cover their songs in a noticeably larger amount of filth rendering a lot of the details that they usually put into their tracks a little I guess inaudible because these guys do like to write a lot of different passages into a single track that could be around three to five minutes making it difficult to get a bird's-eye view of a song quickly or in a handful of listens the band likes to kind of bombard the listener not only sonically with all these just heavy distorted sounds but I guess sort of musically with just all of these different ideas making albums like swarf kind of disorienting at times but I just get this like stillness from the band's music that I would normally get from like an ambient music piece or a noise music piece they're not really interested in in rocking out when I listen to a portal track especially on this new LP I kind of feel like I'm being shoved into an Iron Maiden and the last thing I want to do is move they don't really hit grooves they don't have tension releasing cathartic riffs or anything like that they're actually much more interested in experimenting like the finishing track on hero Blonde which really kind of closes up shop with several minutes of just these tremolo guitars dueling with nothing else in the mix other than maybe a little bit of bass to kind of back them up and the introduction of the same song too has these sort of weird metallic whales going way way way sounds like some kind of weird chilling sound effect from a horror movie they don't really care as much about composing songs as they do just working with sounds noises and textures because a lot of the sounds on here between the guitars and just the heavy muddy muddy drums they're really brutal they're dismal they're depressing but when it comes to the opening guitar chords on this track oh blonde that I've been talking about and these tremolo melodies toward the end pretty much everything that the band has written is is a really standard death metal affair I mean disappointingly standard very average I actually think this album doesn't live up to the compositional standards of most genres much less death metal like I said the band tends to assemble all of these quick parts that they quickly switch out for other parts in a single track but I mean honestly it's not like any of these single parts in my opinion are worth really dragging out as long as the band actually does that's actually kind of a saving grace on this LP what makes some of the songs on here engaging not many tracks hit me as being that great compositionally except maybe the track or bow morphia where there was actually a Gothic quality to the guitar leads and especially the set of intervals that kind of hit in this long drawn-out chord that's very sweet kind of romantic in a sense tracks I liked throughout and I mean like not necessarily loved liked throughout our songs like the back wards in our or Jori Jori on the sounds are definitely there the production is definitely there like I said not too far off from a standard death metal fair but much noisier much just more hectic the band puts a lot of intensity and puts a lot of energy into their performance I mean they're really kind of playing their hearts out until they're just like bursting in their chests and the blood is spurting out everywhere I like the guitar freak-outs on the backwards I like the fact that these syncopated snare rolls come in and lock in with the guitars kind of reminds me of something liturgy would do because when you're actually able to breach through the noise and breach through the ugliness the details it kind of appears that they didn't put as much effort into that much more effort kind of went into this outer shell that makes it difficult to get into that boney skeletal center there's not much release to a lot of these songs there are a lot of parts but there's not much in terms of structure it's just tension tension tension tension it's a lot of noise but still I kind of end up waiting for something to happen I guess though I do like portal sounds vex void I just found to be kind of a unrewarding listen to an extent I mean it's really kind of like dragging your injured army buddy through ten miles of swamp just to have them die as soon as you get to shore honestly I guess I'm feeling a strong forward of a light five on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana portal forever [Music] [Music] 
VOBkVDol1zw,Hey it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and in this review we're going to be talking about the new Tyler the Creator single Damo twenty three three three three Tyler has now started his next album cycle with a brand new single for a new LP wolf that you should be dropping just at the start of April it's kind of interesting that there's less breathing room between this new single and album than his previous lead single and album and on top of that Tyler has talked about releasing this new LP wolf for a long time a lot of people actually assume that wolf would drop shortly after goblin came out it's been a while since Tyler's last album release but it's not like there's been any shortage of Odd Future related projects since then the internet hadn't album ello hype hadn't album & re-release of course Frank Ocean dropped his huge huge album on top of that we had the Oh F tape Earl had a new single I'm actually surprised that Tyler was dropping his new album before Earl is able to drop his of course we have loiter squad and the numerous numerous music videos that these guys have dropped collectively between all of their projects and speaking of music videos of course Tyler's dropped one along with this new track as well showing further that Odd Future more than most artists are heavily heavily dependent on what they're able to put out there visually they don't really write tracks that kind of stand on the merits of what they do lyrically or or sonically or musically or anything like that I mean sonically this track is pretty much the same as what we've been hearing you have all sorts of viral meme worthy chants of Gulf Lang Gulf Lang just like in the track yonkers instead of Tyler aiming his sights at a guy like Bruno Mars who makes pop music for young girls basically he aims at one direction as far as the production goes the drums are actually a bit heavier than I'm used to hearing in odd future be it's actually one of the better beats I've heard Tyler on he does not lie when he says in the lyrics that it sounds like there are midgets in your speakers because of how hard the beat is punching rhythmically but the synthesizer is littered on top of this beat sound like just generic average everyday synthesizers that sound like they come as presets in just about every digital audio workstation out there on the internet and the rhythmic pattern that's being played by the highest of the sense on this track has a rhythmic pattern that is really really similar to that of Rella I mean this track in general pretty much has the same groove as Rella and Tyler on this track has pretty much the same flow as the one he used on relah in a lot of ways this track is just a recycled Rella from the last odd future tape except reloj is actually kind of funny and fast paced it was a show of that very rare spark that you get when several odd future members come on a track and it just doesn't feel like boring Wang curry it actually comes together as being pretty hilarious and just sort of weird and zany most of the lyrics on this track pretty much consist of information that just about anybody could read on his Wikipedia page there's a reference to the roachie in the Yonkers video and how he got rich because of that there's a shout-out to Clancy of course odd futures manager as well as a myriad of other odd future members he references how he got his start with bastard of course he references his connection with pitchfork he references the people who put him down as racist or homophobic and how he reacted to that also referencing how most of his audience are crackers he's chilling with Justin Bieber he's got a TV show and I think the only line I giggled err was kind of you know floor by a little bit was alone with the broth the Rodney King swimming lessons that was something so yeah the lyrics are just kind of you know average surface stuff that just about anybody knows about Tyler already and his wordplay is child's play the song just doesn't entertain me I mean I'm not one to say that there's any one way to be great rapper or any one way to be successful as a rapper but damo 23 is just more proof that Odd Future fans are not looking for a lyricist and they're not looking for an artist who's going to prize them they're looking for a character who's going to come out do a silly dance make a funny face and just act over-the-top and then tell them a bunch of things that they already know and then they'll get all excited like it's something new when it's really just the same certainly Tyler has been living up to his full potential when it comes to just gathering the attention of the media as well as coming together with some really cool videos and just interesting aesthetics I mean Odd Future definitely has a personality they have a style and Tyler is just kind of you know riding this wave he's having fun he's making money that's what he wants to do and that's cool he's just kind of grabbing for a buck right now but he understands the situation that he's in if there's one thing that I feel like Tyler's haters don't give him enough credit for it's that he's really self-aware just take mine straight out of the song like crackers making my pockets fatter as well as still sounding like a newbie implying that he still sounds like he's a new rapper or that he's just starting and he's on his latest release and he's been rapping for so long Tyler could drop hundreds of lines like this and the fans would would still not get it there are moments in in Tyler songs where I feel like he challenges his listeners he challenges his fans the problem is is that they never ever ever challenge him instead of fans reacting to lines like this and expecting a little more of him into the future they all kind of get really hyped over all the frivolous kind of things he says I can guarantee you that way more Odd Future fans are reacting to the stupid shotgun one direction line as opposed to the crackers making my pockets fatter line which is a moment where Tyler is openly mocking the stupidity of the situation that he's in and of course he's going to take advantage of that stupidity I mean you know who wouldn't but the issue is that the fans don't see and as long as that's the case Tyler can keep on a track and people will continue eating it if you've given this track of listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantan Oh Damo 23 forever 
rqhDWs4-Pxc,Hey it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a track review where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic experimental music yada yada yada and this is a review for the bauer track harlem shake baauer is a new york electronic music producer and this track of his has been taking the internet by storm but not by itself of course I mean this track was actually dropped through the label Mad Decent last year spring of last year and the track slipped by even me because when I first heard of this guy it was through the collaboration he did with Just Blaze recently on the track hire which is an amazing freakin banger which a few videos ago I told you guys I said I feel like is banger of the year potential but of course I got that completely and utterly wrong because hire is not the banger of the year at all Harlem shake is the banger of the year except it came from last year making it the banger of last year this year we live at a very interesting time for music and this track is proof of it that you can release a song almost a year ago and then all of a sudden through no control of your own it just all of a sudden blows up overnight because there's some guy dancing to it with a group of friends and in weird costumes in a video which in turn causes a group of people in a dorm room to dance to it or a group of people in an office or a men's swimming team or the military the joke that people have attached to this song seems to have kind of transcended numerous walks of life in the internet generation but I feel like part of the reason that this joke has sort of become so universal as understood so universally is because the song the way it works in the way it appeals is so universal because Harlem shake is an electronic banger with bass heavy beats that hit hard hard in the errors now of course bangers come in different shapes and in size and and flavors and are produced by a variety of different artists some producers that are that are kind of hot for making really great bangers a rap music tonight or like that really awesome flostre Damas remix of the original don track from Major Lazer and all of these artists specifically take a lot of direction from trap rap the instrumentals from this Southern bread style of hip hop that is essentially an ode to America's drug dealers a style of music that's currently for fronted by artists like Gucci Mane as well as waka flocka flame of course this style of hip hop predates these two artists but these two artists are two of the larger names in this newer breed of southern trap style hip hop that has these heavy bass hits these just skittering snare drums rattling high hats and all of these sounds and ideas are featured in Bowers Harlem shake but they're all twisted and revamped and recontextualized until these sounds serve a completely different purpose because the track we're talking about here isn't exactly the dark gritty Southern Fried soundtrack to selling crack outside of a dilapidated house instead it's an all-out dance party where your energy matters way more than your moves so Bower just does a great job of just taking these pre-existing musical ideas and transforming them into something else to me that is what art is all about to an extent but the Internet has brought us into this age where that is kind of being hyper accelerated the way that we are able to take ideas from one musical culture and pepper them throughout pretty much every single other musical culture in 2010 waka flocka flame drops his breakout album flock of le which features track for track all of these trap style southern hip hop beats produced by lex luger from there it kind of spreads into every other facet of hip-hop culture with numerous MCS hopping on beats that have these skittering high hats other producers kind of taking out some of these ideas these busier snare drums these heavier bass hits again this hi-hat style into their production kind of adopting these sounds and even electronic music artists are starting to peek at some of the things they're hearing in these beats and DJs are playing these kinds of songs out too and here on this track we're hearing these trap style rhythms fused together with these wonky synthesizer grooves as well as a dubstep style build and drop and with these slight alterations that Bauer has made to these ideas he's turned this musical style into something that is just again so catchy and so instantly enjoyable you don't even really need to explain what makes it so goddamn enjoyable everything in this track is just engaging and blood pumping from the attention-grabbing vocal cut right at the start in Spanish that sounds like it's being screamed through a megaphone the rising handclaps and synthesizers that just make things feel more tense behind it there's all these synthesizers making a ruckus that kind of sound like a spaceship is getting ready to take off in a Sega Genesis game and Bauer just quickly delivers the drop and just cuts the listeners head off with force and this perfectly perfectly resonating punch of bass and synthesizers the snare drums and the hi-hat sore clickety clackety they're like the tiny little gears twittering along as they push and just sort of huff and puffing move the machinery that dishes out these heavy pummeling base hits that cause your hips to shake so hard they fly out of your body Bauer seems to kind of progress the track through different grooves ideas takes on the same theme that the song started off with which is really all I can ask for because the first idea that the song presents is a really great freaking idea and to hear a few more versions of it as it continues along is you know just pretty much more icing on the cake you know the song's not too busy it's not too flowery it's just strictly business hips shaking just business and honestly that's what I freaking love about it I love this track trap bangers for all it's all I got to say if you've given this track a listen I'm sure you have what do you think of it is it the perfect drop and you know what do you think of this electronic trap fusion that we've been seeing recently across the internet that's about it baauer Harlem shake forever 
yBGd3VCdqII,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's ATS is a nerd and it's time for a review group er the man who died in his boat I should be quieter here Gooper quiet music should be softer sorry grouper is the pseudonym for experimental and ambient music producer as well as multi-instrumentalist Liz Harris and she grabbed the full attention of the burgeoning music blogosphere in 2008 with the album dragging a dead deer up a hill which is a nasty awesome album title and at the time the album was a bit of a departure from her typically very ambient kind of droney style instead Liz was delivering these very kind of funky sort of meditative songs that had very spacious obscured vocals it was music that was very psychedelic very otherworldly very basic in sound melody and structure but still very heavy with feelings of loneliness and kind of desolation these are feelings that in my opinion Liz ended up capturing so much better on the very ambitious double album that she dropped a few years ago dream loss / alien observer which features much more material longer material sounds that are way more nocturnal shadowy varied roni synthesizer filled - and what I also loved about this double album is that I saw Liz playing with many more sounds and textures and kind of filtering them all through this low pass filter that made everything so muddy and yet a lot of the sounds on this LP had this kind of unmastered sharpness to them with an occasional wash of distortion or crackle which actually was nothing too distracting actually felt like a lot of the damaged sounds the damaged quality of many of the sounds on this double album brought a lot of character to these tracks and despite just being very simple from a musical and technical perspective the song was on this double album are just so friggin in pen Tribble AIA took a while to grow on me which is really why I did not do a full review of the double album in the year that it had dropped however this new collection of tracks from grouper comes from that much more accessible territory that draging did with acoustic guitar soft shy vocals with the occasional multi-tracked vocal harmony those psychedelic effects in a lot of ways this album is a return to all those things that made grouper a name in the first place things are still feeling pretty muddy pretty shadowy but maybe overall this LP is sonically a little clearer a little cleaner than dragging a dead deer I can't help but feel like maybe some people disagree with that and the thing is just in general groupers music is so freakin open to interpretation it's certainly not something that is easy to judge from an ambient perspective but it's not really easy to judge from a singer/songwriter perspective either because Liz isn't exactly penning tunes in the traditional fashion because I personally don't feel like you can really condense Liz Harris's appeal in a three to five minute song groupers music is really something I personally feel you need to have a certain kind of personality type for or you need to be in a certain kind of emotional state because to me it's music that is is really for people who need a little bit of emotional soothing because listening to a group or album for me is so much like going through a process or something like that there's no moment where I want to put a single group or song on because I'm in to really hearing that catchy melody or you know that really infectious hook which is why I think grouper really asks more of her audience than the most singer songwriters do you know singer songwriters and in the most sort of vague sense that I can possibly mean it it's always always taken in albums length of songs for groupers emotional magic to kind of work itself on me and that's no different for this album as well from the very sharp drone at the intro track to the very audible surprisingly audible song living room where you can actually make out a lot of Liz's vocals her lyrics which I match with a lot of beautiful guitar arpeggios which is why my first impression listening to this LP was you know it's sort of math kind of boring it's really there in the background but by the end of the whole experience I was like wow this is beautiful and when I started all over again what I originally thought was just kind of yeah was actually striking me as being pretty because while at first listen I could definitely make out everything that I'm hearing and what is being done it doesn't necessarily mean that it's impacting me emotionally as I was listening to this album again and again I found tracks like being her shadow the very droney track being her shadow to be very kind of touching and somber I like the very echo heavy track difference to which had all these layered vocals on it I think the only downside for me personally to the track is that the guitar chords had a really kind of farty quality to them they just didn't feel like they were being played well and it was just kind of this sharp noisy quality sort of just kind of killing that smoother more ethereal vibe and then there are songs like cloud in places and and cover the long way which feature guitar strumming patterns that don't really do all too much for me honestly and I don't feel like the vocal harmonies on the second of those two tracks are as well arranged as I typically hear from Grouper they don't feel like they're gliding together or working together or working in tandem they're sort of muddying each other up because they're not synced up or performed in a way where they can actually complement each other well the echoing Keys on the track vanishing point were pretty decent I liked the sound I liked the tone but I wish there was more of a I guess a song to it a structure direction I actually don't think this album gets really captivating again until it's its last few moments especially the song living room which is a gorgeous track and really one of the most beautiful I guess in the traditional sense songs that Grouper is written and I love the six-minute drone that comes in before that track too it's another stunning ethereal piece of music that Grouper has bestowed upon me you know overall again I will say I do feel like this new al is clearer but I'm not exactly sure if that's spelled out into kind of a success or an improvement because I feel like it's exposed some things like a lot of these guitars which don't seem to be getting performed or played as proficiently as what I've heard on dragging dead deer I actually wish the guitars were a little more obscured and maybe that a few more of these tracks were sort of more awash in keyboards on this new LP a lot of the instrumentation kind of seems to be strewn about these tracks kind of like the contents within the ownerless boat that kind of inspired this album in the first place still I didn't come away from this album being very very dissatisfied or unhappy one big plus is that for sure for sure without a doubt the emotions are still here that at least what I interpret to be kind of sadness desolation that sort of wandering lonely feeling that is usually so potent in groupers music whether it be the more acoustic stuff whether it be the more droney stuff that is still so heavy on this new album I just feel like you know the songs could have been sharper and and really that said when it comes to writing and performing - I'm feeling a strong 6 - a light 7 on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh grouper forever you you 
XiSU9xDyJc0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new pissed jeans album honey's pissed jeans is not only the most surefire way to put the brakes on a blind date where you're feeling uncomfortable they're also a rock band on their fourth full-length album the majority of this band's discography is on Sub Pop records including this new LP and when I typically listen to a piss jeans album whether it be their debut from 2005 shallow or hope for men or the album they dropped in 2009 king of jeans or this new album as well one single word comes to mind and that word is finesse and the reason that word comes to mind is because this band does not have a scratch of it I don't even know if they're interested in having any the band's singer just wails and gargles his lyrics kind of like a drunk guy being held down by three police officers outside of a trashy nightclub downtown on a Friday night most of the band's songs kind of run at this mid-paced kind of grungy kind of sludgy tempo that I don't know if they played any faster they might lose their composure the band's drumbeats are typically pretty simple a lot of the fills spacious but thunderous going off like gunshots and as far as the guitars go when they're playing chords they are just pumping them out with force but the guitars tend to flail wildly when it comes to solos and then leads it's just a range of different ideas from noise rock sludge metal and post-hardcore there are moments in this band's discography that reminds me of early work from The Melvins as well as flipper on Seine and when they get really chaotic and slow most definitely the Jesus Lizard it's no secret that the band has been sticking very passionately to this kind of one sound and style with very minor adjustments over the years however that doesn't keep honey's from feeling just as real as any of the other band's albums when it comes to that pissed-off feeling especially since on this new wreck they're still working with Alex Newport who helped them record their last album which did display a heavier side of the band a more direct and kind of cut through outside of the band now honey's like usual for pissed jeans is kind of a crossroads of of different loud rock ideas and because the band is able to embrace so many different ideas in loud rock in one record even though they're kind of staying within their comfort zones they're still able to kind of deliver a pretty versatile set of tracks like the track bathroom laughter which kind of kicks the album off which has this sort of Punk momentum to it it actually reminds me of one of the flawless from ceremony's previous album runner Park the song sick to be specific except much noisier much more chaotic it's really a kick-ass way to start off the album just like they kind of started off their last LP but it's really a night and day change when it comes to tempo and emotion as soon as they jump into the next track which is chained worker and the song kicks off with these blast beats but then quickly dives into these slow distorted bass riffs that just move like molasses and it almost in a way kind of becomes sort of droney kind of atmospheric the vocals are just shouting what what feels like something very rageful hateful there's some moments where it actually kind of reminds me of a birthday party except way less noisy and avant-garde but still enjoyable all the same though there are some moments where the vocals do kind of get laid out with effects that make this track feel at least a little bit psychedelic the band feeds into the next track with this pretty catchy riff but honestly there's not too much about this song other than the riff that really kind of sticks with me unfortunately the band doesn't hit me again with something that really kind of sticks in the back of my head until the track you're different in person which just has all these dissonant guitar chords flying at me from every direction when it comes to just very sour intervals and then note combinations this song has that down and when it comes to speed and just the vocals being so manic and so wild this song is just wallowing in its own emotional filth the song cafeteria food comes shortly after which I loved off of this LP it's a much slower track it's toned down when it comes to being noisy and intense but with the lyrics which kind of reference seeing this person with his stick figure family on his car sort of saying weird things about you know him making healthy choices with this cafeteria food being sung with these deadpan vocals it's just kind of an eerie set of images the narrator of the track maybe seems kind of disturbed and this song also kind of runs congruent with a lot of tracks that they've written over the years that sort of see this sickness and mundaneness and everyday mainstream you know kind of normal life after this the band just kind of continues its downward spiral into Slaven Leacock rock with a lot of noise and a lot of riffs and even though I like it especially the raw emotion especially with the energy honestly pissed jeans is just not going to translate for people who like their songs maybe a little bit more composed or you know maybe a little more methodical but really it's all kind of a matter of degree I mean I think there are people who are into hardcore punk but may not necessarily get into just how freewheeling pissed jeans can be on a track because really this LP and most of piss jeans discography is about letting go it's about getting loose and about kind of unleashing the Beast which can be really great for kind of conjuring this really strong and ferocious and uncompromising vibe but it doesn't necessarily always add up to a memorable musical moment the song health plan on the latter half of this LP is absolutely freaking hilarious not only because its riffs are so pounding but the lyrics are amazing with shouting out this mantra that you know you want to know my secret I stay away from doctors it's just driving it's it's tough and the song shortly after this which I believe is pronounced lubes loves Loubs it's kind of odd it drags on a little bit but the way the bass groove works and the and the drums are hitting at this very slow tempo and the way the guitar leads are kind of slithering their way into the track in between the base and the rhythms it kind of feels like a bluesy sort of vibe about as bluesy as kind of a noise rock track could be there are moments like the closer on this LP teenage adult that musically could be a little more distinct could use a little bit more maybe guitar leads or just melody or just a weirder riff or groove to kind of make it pop out there's just a few spots on this LP where I feel like maybe just a little bit more than attitude is needed to make the song I'm listening to great however I mean I still did not come away from this album unsatisfied I was very satisfied actually I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantan oh pissed jeans honeys forever 
IV0FxPl098Y,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new foals LP holy fire foals is a UK rock quintet whose third full-length album right here holy fire I have been maybe a little hesitant to review because of just my strong dislike for their last full-length album total life forever in my opinion foals used to be one of these young brash up-and-coming bands in indie rock that were just bursting with energy with all these dance punk beats and in math rock grooves and eccentric vocals they were just a fireball of energy especially with tracks like Casius and balloons which both had some awesome horn parts in them too I personally saw an incredible amount of potential in what the band was doing in their early stuff but you know maybe they didn't actually end up seeing it that way a lot like another English rock group block party it seemed like on their sophomore full-length foals was trying to do away with their original sound as quickly as possible however unlike block party I don't really think on their sophomore full-length LP foals tried to maintain their youthful energy it seemed to me that they were kind of in a rush to mature the beats were at times danceable but just not as hard not as Punk influenced for sure and it wasn't a total letdown I mean foals did supply some pretty good singles with tracks like this Orient as well as Miami but just that really colorful vibrant and and sort of rawness that the band had to their early stuff was just kind of sucked away and replaced with very glistening string kissed choruses with the occasional Radiohead style ambitious climax now unfortunately this new LP is not really that bold change in direction I was kind of crossing my fingers for it's not the return of that vibrant energy however again Foles does not leave me totally to hang out to dry they never really do there's always at least a handful of tracks that are great and maybe on this new album I actually think they have struck a somewhat better balance between their softer more mature side and that visceral energy that they're able to conjure as a rock band because there are some really good and lively tracks on here and some interesting moments where foals are trying to make some pretty strange chemical reactions between different musical flavors like the track inhaler which has these guitar chords that that just balance with echo rhythmically there's this pulsating drumbeat that kind of reminds me of a band like Maserati there's all these soaring falsetto vocals on the verses and then when the chorus bursts in with this heavy ass guitar riff it sounds like something Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine could read and I think the execution of kind of this new vibe that this riff brings goes over really smoothly the song my number is another favorite of mine on here the song really pops with a lot of catchy group vocals there's more bouncy guitars more dance beats it doesn't really go as hard on the chorus like inhaler does but it's a really just sweet danceable pop/rock single and to me this song is really where the band does very well for themselves in trying to find a balance between making a dance tune making a tune that you can move to making a tune that's visceral but also sounding maybe a little lighter a little more flowery a little sweeter you know it's dancey but it's not superfluous and it has some really nice little baby tiny funky shiny guitar leads to those actually appear on quite a few tracks here the song Providence is another favorite of mine on here to the end of this track is so heavy and noisy and thick and climactic I didn't know foals was still capable of creating a sound that was that noisy in that intense anymore and everything that comes before that point is fantastic as well just these hard ass drum beats these jutting distorted riffs it's so aggressive and yet so dancey there's some interesting interludes here with some atmospheric ethereal keyboards as well as vocals that feel like they have some like echo e-dub effects on them for me this track was like a near jaw-dropping moment but then there are other tracks on here kind of like the song bad habit where it'll start off with a really cool beat but it doesn't really get much more interesting past that the song progresses into this ultra smooth glistening dance pop rock tune that actually feels like maybe it would actually be a Coldplay song if not for all the Pali rhythms going on in the background and again like on the album total life forever folds just continue to abuse reverb to the point where it just sucks the meat it sucks the energy out of their instrumentation and when they explode on a chorus it just has no bite whatsoever kind of like many of the courses on that last Maccabees LP I kind of feel the same way about the song late night too which is a cool track has some Radiohead esque vocal melodies it's got a really dark vibe to a kind of nocturnal but again those dance beats really kind of keep foals from reaching as high emotionally as the song could potentially go these tracks that I sort of mentioned negatively so far are even really the worst moments to me they don't so much ruin the album to me these tracks are just ok they're tolerable there are just more unbearable moments than this in my opinion like the song milk and black spiders which on this track the mixing is terrible I don't even know how it ended up on this LP mix wise it sounds way different than any other song on the album the reverb just swallows up every single instrument on here and all I can hear just the bad strings tossed all over the track it sounds like a really lackluster live recording of somebody kind of holding a microphone way back like thousands of people are between them and the stage and they're kind of holding their iPhone in the air just taking a recording of the band performing and the preload on this thing the intro track the boring chord progression and the and the guitar leads and the heavy distorted riff that comes in after it just sounds like one big post-rock nightmare when I listen to total life forever I didn't like it I still don't like it but now I kind of feel like I I know what the band is going for foals intentions on holy fire are a little bit clearer and you know it would seem that they want to make dance music they want to make dance rock and dance pop but they want it to have this delicate subtle kind of Flowery aura about it the concept is great but I feel like the band is yet to find a way to combine these two elements without water in each of them down with the other the dance beats don't feel is hard they don't move me they don't feel as exciting and on the other end these flowery moments that they go for feel kind of bogged down feel boring they don't feel emotionally powerful because they're kind of locked into these dance grooves instead of flowing beautifully like something subtle should I feel like that's kind of made apparent especially on the last two tracks where the band seems to ditch the dance beats a little bit or mix them down so low that they don't even really play a huge part in the song and as a result you get a track like moon which is this really just soft spacious texture ballad that kind of sounds like it is really like cigarettes potential when it comes to the way that all of these sounds kind of wander through this very atmospheric mix with these lonely lonesome vocals calling out into the echo drenched night it's actually beautiful and a really good finisher to this album that was really kind of spotty for me all the way through though I have not enjoyed the past two foals albums the band has shown me again that they are still willing to experiment to tinker to adjust and just offer fans something new the next time around even if it is only you know slightly new envisioned but to me this album was new enough and and more likeable than the total life forever to be completely honest I'm feeling a decent 5 on on this record and um and yeah that's that's about it what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana folds forever [Music] [Music] 
VysUDwL62z4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Veronica falls album waiting for something to happen Veronica Falls is a nice little pop outfit from the UK their debut LP caught my attention back in 2011 despite the the band's style pretty breezy pretty light but I found Veronica Falls music to be more like a breeze in the midst of January with kind of a frosty bite to it just the perfect amount of reverb on the guitars that they were playing they had a nice 20 tone to them some very ambitious and chilly boy/girl vocal harmonies and on top of that just a touch of English Reservation plus I was impressed with the influences that these guys were able to pull together not only were there some sounds coming from that old jangle pop style maybe a little bit of old-school Indian garage rock but there were definitely some moments that reminded me of The Velvet Underground The Mamas and the Papas the songs on this LP were straightforward and featured a lot of earworm choruses and some of the tracks came off maybe a little sour kind of morbid like the song love in a graveyard or the track that found him there were tracks like beachy head as well which were pretty noisy kind of abrasive and even though I really liked what Veronica Falls had to offer on this new LP I wasn't really sure if these guys had the the will or the drive or the chops to progress what they were doing here further I guess what I ended up expecting with this new LP was just not that much change at all just another heap of tracks that were endearing but also kind of sour and dark at times too I'm not even really sure if I got that to me the very chilly and wintry feel of the debut album is gone the morbid feel of the debut album has kind of disappeared as well and the noisier and in stranger moments like bleachy II don't really seem to be on here as well I feel like Veronica Falls has kind of stripped away all of these elements that I feel I gave them character and have settled down a little bit into this kind of one modulus style that is pretty much some quaint polite indie rock and pop with youthful boy/girl vocal harmonies I'm not really trying to sell this record as a complete departure or anything like that though Veronica Falls still sounds like Veronica Falls I just feel like they've kind of pruned the tree a little bit and have tried to drum together a collection of songs that are just a bit more uniform I suppose and I could appreciate that a band would want to make an album that feels a little bit more focused but I don't really think Veronica Falls was all that adventurous to begin with I mean if anything was going to make their next LP exciting it should have been more adventure because there are moments on this LP where the lack of adventure sonically and and when it comes to songwriting too can get pretty disheartening like the songs teenage waiting for something to happen and everybody is changing where you have moments like what's your Excuse baby there's so many moments on this record where I kind of feel like Veronica Falls is recycling chord progressions and the melodies over them feel so similar that I feel like I could sing the melody from one song over another song the only difference between a lot of these tracks is that these chord progressions are kind of worked out in two different keys don't get me wrong I still like a lot of these tunes I feel like Veronica Falls still brings that really cool energy especially on a track like teenage there are just too many songs on this record to me that sort of mirror each other in ways that make me maybe slightly annoyed or just kind of bored however there are moments on this record where Veronica Falls does try to push themselves outside of their comfort zone a little bit and add some extra bits of personality but maybe with not as much success as on their debut like the song shooting star which is one of the most quiet moments on this entire LP it kind of romps around very softly very slowly but it feels kind of drab and boring to me on my heart beats that was one of the first big singles to drop from this new LP and one of my favorite moments on here the song really propels itself really pushes itself has a nice driving beat to it and the guitars just sound so big it's really one of the bigger tracks that Veronica Falls has ever put together sure some of the lyrics on this track of kind of corny about dreaming together and so on and so forth but that sweet sentiment is is still there and still feeling very sincere and still feeling very real and it kind of you know in my opinion gives the song a pass because I get kind of sucked into this very for me anyway very real emotion the song everybody is changing I love the sentiment to that track to which kind of seems to be talking about looking back on your past your youth even though the songwriting melody wise and chord wise is very basic it's very simple the message behind the song which is about just kind of accepting change in your personal life I mean it just it's kind of close to home for me not to say that a message necessarily makes a song but a band has to have a certain kind of personality and sincerity to make a message like this go over well and that's a kind of power that Veronica Falls has and the song falling out is one of the softer ones on here I think goes over really well and has some of the better lyrics on the entire LP talking about how every seed is a flower every seconds an hour it's songs like these that have some pretty good lyrics a fresher energy to them to actually feel new to me when it comes to Veronica Falls writing new new material in a lot of ways I kind of feel like this sophomore album is again a homogenized version of their debut LP and and I wished that on this album instead they spread out a little bit more and even though I am let down by the subtraction of variety slightly on this new album I do think Veronica Falls for the most part wrote some decent songs in their usual style again it's just straightforward lean clean jangle pop whose appeal is very apparent from first listen I'm feeling a strong six on this new LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Veronica Falls forever 
_QUU8l_bTgc,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick video talking about a bunch of musical things that happen this past week songs releases other stuff that I wanted to get to but but but but couldn't necessarily and yeah I just want to kind of talk about them all here right right here right now for one big song to come out this week new track from James freaking Blake titled retrograde when I first heard the track it was a radio rip that had kind of been floating around the internet and I mean I'm diggin it it is nicely produced it has some really loud handclaps on it and it goes down a surprisingly soulful and in kind of R&B style direction that I think is going to take a lot of fans by surprise for sure these styles of music played a big role in some of the songs on his full-length debut as well as the EP that he followed that up with but I mean they are just really really prevalent here although you know there are still a lot of James Blake qualities like the emotive English voice as well as the very hot sharp synthesizers that kind of lair themselves on top of one another toward the end of the track and bring it to a climax it's a real good song and make sure to check out this short little tiny baby youtube documentary called don't call it post-dubstep it's a part of this new hashtags music series where you kind of have these people diving into these new up-and-coming internet bred genres of music and kind of getting close and personal with the artists and asking them how they feel about kind of being you know within the confines of this new emerging style what exactly this style means and how they personally approach creating the music that they make it's it's actually pretty interesting they must really create a comfortable atmosphere with the people they get on camera because you know they dump a lot of dirt and next another track that I loved this week it is a track from the band grave babies that heavy metal LP dropping on hardly art very soon titled sure and the two songs that have come out so far from this album are no fear and over an underground I love over an underground which is a really awesome post-punk II track that is not only minimal with its drums its shoegazing with its guitars and has some really twisted lead vocals there are some twisted deep kind of demonic lead vocals all over this new album they're pretty unsettling and weird I'm not sure if they're naturally that way or if they're being fed through some kind of pitch shift or something like that either way they sound pretty odd and really attention-grabbing next if you're into something that is a little funky a little fast and alternative rock flavored Red Hot Chili Peppers have a new song out though Anthony Kiedis is vocal is is pretty good and I like fleas very busy bassline all over the track there's not too much more that I like about it I'm just kind of crossing my fingers and hoping that I like this next LP they're gonna drop more than their last album and if you're in the mood for some doom check out the band Maus and their new track horrible nights from their forthcoming LP horrible night it's very noisy it's long it is intense and as long as we're talking about some doom bong Ripper has a new split out with the band hey which is a group that most certainly lives up to their freakin name with their speed and pummeling intensity it's not really the most I guess sort of congruent split that he'll run across in terms of one band style and another band style but you know it's it's still pretty interesting to get two extreme acts on the same split give it a listen bond Ripper certainly has a really long no easy experimental track on this one next fat History Month with Bad History Month this is a new track from a band that's about to go out on a big tour with the group pile and they're actually not the same label as them exploding in sound which is a label has a really good knack for grabbing these indie rock groups that have an old-school indie rock flavor but simultaneously kind of have some element of Foulke in then maybe a little bit of singer/songwriter too and you know I'm really liking the groups that these guys kind of bring to the table hopefully they kind of grow with this sound I know this particular sound is really hot right now but at least it's being done very well by groups like Bad History Month and Pyle and also the clipping album mid-city these guys are a Los Angeles hip-hop outfit experimental hip hop noisy hip hop however it's not really noisy and aggressive in the same way that like Death Grips is or something like that it's actually pretty subtle pretty quiet a lot of very laid-back blunted kind of flows a lot like the guy blue you know the NMC like blue out compared their flows to his and the beats underneath these wraps textured very noisy very glitchy but quiet noisy you know what I mean there's a lot of strangeness there there's a lot of weird sounds but they're not abrasive and just really Latin in-your-face it kind of creates an interesting atmosphere to have something I guess sort of so rough but also kind of calming warming and also as long as we're talking about awesome instrumentals Lee Bannen has a new collection or tracks out called Caligula theme music this guy is another hip-hop producer and these beats that he has pulled together is his latest collection of beats and I think his best are ethereal they're atmospheric their trap flavor they have a lot of personality a few of them feature vocals but many of them do not need them and on our hip-hop producers train we go next to Korean brigands that has a track out called chopped worm which is a top of the song funky worm by the band Ohio players whose lead singer Sugarfoot recently passed away now he kind of takes the track and makes his own beat out of it while also kind of referencing and pointing to the history of the song and hip hop in general it has been sampled by many many many artists over the years including NWA and Kendrick Lamar on his latest album - now there's a bit more hip hop history relating to Kareem Riggins this past week he also did a video with yours truly talking about the final track on his new full-length LP alone together which is a J Dilla tribute this past week was J Dilla's birthday rest in peace Jade and it was actually a new jubie's birthday this past week as well rest in peace to him and next we go to little B with the pink flame mixtape I mean really at this point what can you even expect from little B this mixtape to me doesn't really stand out personality-wise against many of the others that he has put out because I mean he's still kind of on this bizarre tip there they're their songs on this tape like the track eat which had become really one of my favorite little B tracks ever and you know I'm just gonna keep listening to every single tape he drops I'm assuming he'll continue on his one tape a month you know regularity like you did last year but you know we'll see I'll just check him out as they come and sort of talk about them as they strike me next Colin Stetson has a new track out saxophone adventurer avant-gardist experimentalist he has a new LP on the way new history warfare vol 3 of course the successor to the previous two new history warfare volume albums and this new track of his high above a great green sea is actually nothing entirely new when it comes to his musical style you know just solo sax pieces recorded in interesting ways with all sorts of weird phantom noises coming out of the sax due to his continuous breathing technique but it still is a really good song and an exciting tease toward this new LP which I believe is gonna have a good handful of collaborations with Justin Vernon on and after that leave and everything everything the UK band everything everything has a new EP out this month on a record label run by Julian Casablancas of The Strokes it's the COFF COFF EP which is really the biggest track off of their latest LP mark which is out right now in the UK hopefully that album is coming out in the US later this year because from what I am hearing on this EP it could be really good at least in my opinion there's a lot of eccentric layered vocal harmonies on this thing some really strong drumbeats that kind of reminds me of battles occasionally and some really strange hooks interesting melodies it's it's an engaging collection of tracks on this new EP alright continuing actress Silver Cloud 12-inch this electronic music producer has put together three tracks that are as long and as just I guess sort of entrancing as music from his album splash but also simultaneously noisy and textured like what I've heard on our IP it's just not as layered in as detailed as I would like but but still I like this combination of elements coming from him on this 12-inch and finally four tracks Depeche Mode has a new single out titled heaven which is actually not that bad it's so you know a little glossy a little modern and and very sort of squeaky clean in terms of production but the melody ain't bad the hook ain't bad vocals are decent and I'm looking forward to their new LP and now we go to some albums and we're going to start with the new Kong LP soul creation these guys are do metal outfit their new LP has some really lengthy heavy tracks on it however in personally I was just not really enthralled with the vocals all that much and I thought that these very long songs these monolithic songs could have used just some more detail and just some more variation to kind of you know make the length that they last a bit more bearable I mean that's sort of a general issue for me throughout the entire album but you know if you're looking for something heavy if you're looking for something just pummeling overpowering then do check this out you know if you do like that sort of minimalism if you do like that repetition more than me then give this a try next Jim James regions of light and sound of God I mean Jim James you know him from My Morning Jacket My Morning Jacket frontman whose music I have reviewed on this channel and I enjoy their music as well but this album does not really go down that folky territory that one would expect from Jim James it's actually more of a neo psychedelia affair which isn't really a bad thing I mean what kind of disappoints me about this LP is that the sounds are just so lackluster and kind of plain and not really all that psychedelic or mind-bending at all and on top of that which kind of upsets me is that Jim's voice on this record does not really go over all that well there are a lot of points where I feel like he's either missing notes he's straight and he's just not really putting that power into his voice like you would normally hear on a My Morning Jacket record on the MMJ records his vocals usually sound fantastic I don't know if there were just kind of some weird strenuous conditions when it comes to the recording of this LP which kind of kept his vocal takes from being as great as they typically are but the singing was just not there on this LP next currency with new jet city spit a spin a man new orleans MC one i have reviewed on the channel before and have not really enjoyed his music in the past and though some people have approached me and said hey man this mixtape is gonna change your mind this mixtape is gonna change your perception about spit uh I still feel the same way it doesn't matter what kind of MC is he guess with what kind of beats you put this guy on his voice still sounds boring to me he still sounds just kind of plain unenthusiastic no energy no emotion I mean he just sounds really chill really laid back on this mixtape more baked than ever and is pretty much just sticking to the same kind of lyrical topics you know living in that life of luxury smoking a little pot hanging out with some girls cars money that jet life honestly I just don't see the appeal especially for a sober person I understand that there is a time and a place for music like currency it's just I'm not the kind of person who ever has that time or place you know come into contact with my everyday life next the band dark star news from nowhere this is a new LP out now on warp records and it's some very I guess sort of colorful and and vaguely poppy experimental electronic music depending on the track you're listening to it really kind of feels like Dark Star puts a serious emphasis of sound craft over song craft I really appreciate sound I like that these guys come together with some sounds that a lot of the time on this LP feel very bubbly bright sort of neon colored lush but at the same time kind of ethereal kind of spacious there are moments on this LP where I'm really kind of feeling something like from animal Collective sort of strawberry jam style or maybe a little bit of Radiohead - if in the future the songs have a bit more sharpness to them some more conciseness and the vocals especially have more energy then I can see these guys getting much bigger especially if they managed to stay on warp records but what I have heard on this album has not really stuck out to me unfortunately and finally the new push a t-tape wrath of cane push a tea southern emcee of course coming from clips then going solo getting signed to good music a lot of people love what he contributed to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy he had that fear of god tape which just kind of went over okay in my opinion I don't really feel like he was able to define himself all that well artistically on that tape a lot of people are all abuzz on that Drake track that he had dropped or that you know assuming it's it's a drink related track that he dropped all drama aside this tape is actually the first solo effort that I've heard from Pusha that I actually thought was pretty decent and you know it's it's a good teaser toward his full-length LP later this year which I am looking forward to thanks to this tape it's got a lot of sort of rich luxurious production that could have easily fit onto the cruel summer compilation that dropped last year it's got a lot of pianos a lot of horns a little bit of a trap style and a few moments especially the song that features young chop whose Chief Keef affiliated there's some auto-tune courses that kind of remind me of like a future track but the production isn't bad overall I especially like the beat on the track only you can tell it the high-pitched vocals on that thing fantastic the tape is short it's just about 30 minutes and like I said the beats are pretty good but as far as push at ease performance vocally you know lyrically it's just pretty decent it's it's okay a lot of the flows are pretty slow he doesn't really get up in your face or get all aggressive or anything like that he stays pretty chill pretty laid-back more like better than you really braggadocious and though he has these slower flows I don't necessarily fault him because he does come up with some funny punchlines some clever wordplay comparing a lot of these up-and-coming internet rappers with internet porn just because they're only downloaded nobody's buying the records or the other line where he says everybody is 80's and 90's inspired but nobody's 80's and 90's rhymin beyond all these teases and jabs at people who he perceives to be kind of competing with him is of course a lot of drug talk push it t if you're familiar with his music at all you know that he prides himself as being you know kind of a dealer before he got into the rap game I mean when it comes to cooking rock and pushing Keys I mean he is pretty much the guy asserting that story the hardest right now when it comes to you know having some serious spotlight in the rap game he just wants to convince everybody who's listening he's real he's real he's real his drug experience is real real real real real I mean you know it's it's it's a fine story I love albums that include this kind of talk whether they're real or not I mean whether you put your tea or your kind of like Ghostface Killah with fish-scale and you're kind of telling this story from you know add on perspective and you're dealing drugs and you know it's kind of like a Scarface sort of thing III think with a lot of the tracks on this tape Pusha T shows that he has more potential and has more personality than he did on fear of God and and I'm just gonna leave it at that I'm looking forward again to his forthcoming LP and we'll see if that appeals to me or not alright that's pretty much it for this quickie segment did you like any of these songs or albums that I talked about hate any of them and and why thank you for watching Anthony Fantana quickies forever 
slKvuSTIPCM,hi everyone Anthony fan tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick little video talking about what I did this this past Thursday February 7th at the Music Hall of Williamsburg what I did was I had attended a show I attended a live concert to see the band swarms as you guys know the band swans experimental rock outfit industrial post-rock drone noises pretty much every weird outside an underground style of rock music has been toyed with by this group and over the years have come up with fantastic freaking records and one of their latest is is really up there in the rankings with some of their best the seer so just the release of this new album alone that I think is really great you know had me psyched to see this new show I figured that you know when I go and see them in person it's not really going to be like a normal average rock show it's not really going to be like one of those shows where you know they come out and play the hits and you know everybody's rocking out and loulou definitely not anything like that I'm sure you can figure that yourself if you uh give a listen to the band's music and um you know for sure I guess I kind of got what I was expecting on and maybe a little bit more slightly I mean for sure swans is not a release was not had this particular show a very very visual band or a band that was uh really kind of obsessed with its showmanship I mean frontman michael gira for sure was the most active person when it came to kind of engaging the crowd and when he did that he was usually kind of maybe staring into them as he's singing lyrics I remember toward the beginning of the of the set he was trying to get people to sing along with some lyrics that he was saying I believe they were there were millions and millions of stars in Euros which as I was kind of looking back the crowd as he was kind of doing this and egging them on to join in they weren't really feeling it maybe they weren't into the lyrics or maybe they were just really not in the mood to kind of participate maybe instead they just wanted to kind of observe and just kind of see what swans had to offer live I don't know if that really kind of affected the way the swans wanted to play to the crowd that night but I still ended up enjoying what they had to offer now in terms of live instrumentation and set up you know michael gira was there vocals he had his guitars well to the right of him was bass guitar for string and another guitar rhythm guitar occasionally playing some leads as well and to his left double pedal steel and definitely the most aggressive you know I've seen pedal steel played in a live setting now the drums were kind of actually not all too visible maybe to people who are front and center at the stage but I'm sure to everybody else they were pretty obscured because michael gira and company had pretty much put all of their amps together into this you know sort of complete wall right in front of the drum set so you really couldn't see too much in terms of what the drums were bringing and to the right of the drummer and the group was someone playing you know kind of just miscellaneous percussion hammer dulcimer was in there which shows up on the seer as well I believe maybe a keyboard was somewhere in the mix there were some bells some extra cymbals a gong that I don't recall being played but I definitely remember seeing it there so definitely not the most fleshed out instrumental set up that swans has ever performed with live I'm sure and you know definitely not a setup that they could maybe recreate some of them or instrumentally complex songs you know at least not perfectly anyway they were able to recreate a lot of songs I've heard from them before that involves strings and stuff like that but they're just playing them with the guitars and you know just kind of you know giving it a different live I guess sort of a reinterpretation I guess you could say now you know as long as that word is out of the back egg I mean I think this entire show could be kind of summed up in that single word I mean while swans was playing tunes that were familiar especially to longtime Swans fans they really liked to revise these tracks live like I said they're not really all that I guess centered on being showman or anything like that or you know doing about your crazy visual stuff for the crowd like I said occasionally Michael juror would come off maybe a little manic a little out there something like that but for the most part they were just zoning in on their instruments and zoning into you know listening to one another just kind of you know making sure that everybody is kind of in lockstep instrumentally so these songs which for the most part being kind of revised being improvised in a way are going over smoothly I mean michael gira when he is not facing the crowd he's locked into what not only what he's doing but what everybody else is doing kind of leading the band making signals you know jumping up and down on stage as he thinks courts should be you know being struck downward everybody you know hitting it once telling people that you know it's in six one two three four five six it really all went off without a hitch from beginning to end when the band started with basically these really hard-hitting chords that they were just basically blasting blasting on they would just lay out of work let him ring out and levering out and kind of hammer out a different groove by the end of the I guess sort of death of this chord they were just kind of like let it you know call out and kind of get quiet then there'd be pure silence and then again a different chord roar and head back into it and while it definitely was not the loudest musical experience I've ever you know been privy to for sure it was one of the most abusive because you know the mere fact that this song and many other songs on here kind of had this quality where you're getting this very short moment of complete silence and then just getting blasted again with this loud pummeling aggressive sound just that you know that down here and then that just going from zero to 60 in a split second again and again and again and again it wears a one out mentally physically everything now the first recognizable track to me came right at the beginning of the set it was the song mother of the world which comes off the seer and actually think this live version of the track was was pretty awesome the drummer was really digging into the groove with the hi-hat playing extra little fills and sixteenth notes on the hi-hat in this beat that is in 3/4 and the way he was riding on the hi-hat in this track just made the song groove so much harder than it does on the record whereas on the record it feels so static because of the Danny Danny Danny Danny which you know feels really kind of unsettling you know hair-raising kind of strange but I mean live they were really just rocking on this riff and with so many other grooves throughout the set there was kind of like letting this play out over and over and over and over and kind of you know rising and falling in intensity and how they play it you know the bass player slowly changing what he plays against the riff maybe everybody else is kind of morphing what they do too you know the drummer in a lot of ways kind of changing what he does in terms of emphasizing different drum hits in the beat that he was playing and you know I'm not exactly sure who was taking cues from who at some points but I kind of feel like the band was sort of just taking this one idea and kind of doing this jam on it in a way to a point where it just felt so loud so repetitive so overbearing that it kind of became psychedelic there's a point in this song on the record the seer where you're hearing this complete stop and all you're hearing these these weird breaths the band doesn't even get to that point actually they kind of ride on this groove and they turn the song into a medley with another track called screen shot and that's another thing that was kind of a recurring theme in this set medleys swans was taking tracks that were you know familiar to fans and kind of just melding them with other ones because they're really kind of jamming on a bunch of ideas anyways why not just bring them all together into this one you know heavy pummeling mishmash of insanity after this they went into the back catalogue for the song coward which came off the LP holy money and you didn't even really need to be a hardcore Swans fan know that this song was coming from a totally different spot in their style because though the band was really rhythmic and jamming out riffs you know throughout the set so far this riff was just you know really coming from a much more industrial standpoint had way more gaps in spaces than any other riff on this entire set had a much more jagged kind of angular feel to a tone bowl there were times where there was so much space in between certain notes in these riffs I mean you're hearing silence in between some of these notes and you know some would scream something insane or obnoxious in these gaps of silence that were between these rifts but you know aside from that silliness I mean the fact that you're just getting pummeled and pummeled and pummeled I mean it's it was something else after this song the band got into some new material what she loves us which is actually pretty fantastic that they have been continuing to write songs in this outfit though of course you know there's no guarantee that it may actually end up sounding like this when we bring it into the studio and that's kind of the thing about this live performance if there's any kind of issue that I had with it it's that Swanston really pulled together many of the subtleties or the finite details that I have enjoyed on a lot of their later records you know past their sort of industrial period you know the the finer details from albums like soundtracks for the blind or the the finer details from an album like the seer you know you're not getting those pretty melodic I guess sort of subtleties or at least it didn't sound like that to me with just how loud everybody was playing I mean it seemed like to me the goal with all of these tracks was to just make them as abusive as humanly possible in this single performance now once the band had hit the seer and like I said later brought it into this medley I mean they've been playing for pretty freakin long the show ended up just being over two hours or so so I mean you know if there were any kind of issues with how michael gira wasn't really kind of getting a reaction from the crowd a huge reaction from the crowd singing along with the lyrics that he was you know putting out there right at the start of the show it certainly didn't play out in the length of the set now just like mother of the world the seer didn't turn out exactly how it did on the record either I mean those weird sort of background vocals as a taozi alle not see at all i mean none of that was on there you know I mean there was kind of a different vocal that Michael was singing over that track and a lot of the hammered dulcimer kind of got drowned out as the band got really heavy riding on the riff that kind of guides the song along until they hit that spot where you're getting that you know that that portion in the middle of the CR where you're just hard hitting banging chords that seemed to go on really forever and they really dragged it out in person I'm telling you and Michael was really kind of you know walking to stage Center and then jumping to stage right I believe and hitting down you know on the guitar strings of his guitar as he was jumping to the floor then he'd walked back to the center of the stage then jumping slam his guitar one more time along you know kind of in unison with everybody else on the stage and he was just repeating this motion over and over and over and it just really kind of got insane I mean it got kind of distracting visually to see him doing that again and again and again I really just kind of had to close my eyes and soak in you know just how loud and just how pummeling the sound was becoming in this live setting I mean that's when I really kind of enjoyed it now I mean the the track really kind of cooled down came to a droney halt Early's the medley came to a droning halt toward the end of it I mean after the show was over it was really kind of you know exciting and sort of a relief in a way I mean it had really sort of lulled me into this oh I just feel so beaten down with sound you know thankfully I had earplugs which I made out of Dunkin Donuts napkins because I forgot my earplugs at home but they worked and that's another thing if you go see swans or any extremely loud Banff infant wear earplugs don't destroy your hearing it's important but anyway overall you know just a in overall reaction or opinion of the show I mean I enjoyed myself I thought it was really good it was great to kind of see legends like swans in person kind of see them pull together a tight set you know like I said I haven't really experienced seeing them live other than this so you know I can't really say whether or not this was the loudest performance they've had the most detail but I know if there was one thing I would have liked to have heard more of you know those finite details that make records like the sea are so great didn't really come forward all too much I mean while I do love a loud pummeling you know kick your ass freaking show um I kind of feel like I would have enjoyed what was going on so much more if the volume was taken down a little bit and there was just more concentration I'm just kind of you know bringing together just more I guess subtleties and more layers as opposed to there's just one loud freaking barrage of guitars and bass and drums all kind of you know in lockstep trying to beat the crowd down as hard as it possibly can so if you were at this show what did you think of it did you enjoy it did you you know hate it why if you've seen the band live in other places how do these shows compare you know was this the best time the worst time you've seen swans and um and yeah that's pretty much it Anthony Fantana swans forever 
Ki_jLJWcCYI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here yeah intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the underachievers indigo ISM the underachievers are a New York hip hop duo affiliated with what is now being called the beast Coast movement and basically they're pretty much just a couple young MCS that embrace that old-school hardcore hip hop style that made hip hop such a powerhouse in the first place but have a kind of modern interpretation of it fresher style newer energy modern lyrics as well as instrumentals now as far as this beast Coast movement goes there are quite a few groups kind of thrown under this umbrella including artists like Pro era Flatbush zombies as well as collectives like ASAP rocky and kind of his ASAP mob which is kind of strange to me that you know that would be sort of this movement oriented around the East Coast especially since you know ASAP rocky for example has a lot of southern hip hop influences that don't really have much to do with the East Coast at all as well as cloud rap which I think we can all pretty much agree is kind of an Internet hip hop movement rap style hip hop when it comes to the flows of just those rattling high hats I mean that is kind of permeated every single hip-hop community out there today and of course that also applies to the underachievers too they have this style that is extremely extremely indebted to that you know hardcore hip-hop era from New York from the 90s but they proposed that their take and their interpretation is new take a look at the track new New York for example where they're repeating stuff like it's a New York thing it's a New York thing or that one line that gets dropped ain't been this good since like the 90s and all this is being said with a fiery guitar sample within a boom backbeat there's an awesome dramatic organ thrown into the mix too as well as a pretty hilarious Warrior's reference right at the beginning of the track the underachievers two members just have that aggressive competitive gritty street attitude with a lot of drug references to to pot LSD but on top that a surprisingly large amount of references to things like spirituality Souls God and dreams too as a different mental state and when the other achievers mention God it's not really from a religious standpoint there's actually a single track on this LP where they kind of seem to spit in the face of organized religion a little bit in favor of kind of putting forward this more abstract interpretation of what God is kind of referring to themselves and people in general as Indigo's and and supernatural reincarnation it's a - and a Kay put forward this ideology in numerous songs on here there are moments where they may come off a little hedonistic like herb shuttles or maybe kind of one-dimensional like the vaguely threatening Sun through the rain but this kind of new-age third eye talk really sort of leads the way on key tracks on here like revelations philanthropist $0.06 and the extremely hot Gold soul theory because Gold soul theory is really a song that kind of talks about the pain or the suffering that one can I guess sort of put themselves through through not understanding what is on their insides I guess sort of spiritually whether or not you really kind of believe in this metaphysical world that the underachievers paint with their lyrics and certainly I don't 100% their passion for a lot of what they're saying definitely is intriguing I mean there's a lot of mentions of gods demons pharaohs kings spiritual transformations higher consciousness he is the underachievers do a great job of taking that conscious message and idea and you know really kind of separating it from that sort of backpack scene that it used to be affiliated with maybe 10 or so years ago there's even a moment where that is referenced in the lyrics with one particular line like bet you didn't think a conscious dude can make it sound like this they really kind of line up their sites when it comes to production - indigo ISM has a lot of skeletal clean drum machine beats that sound very 808s the sound quality of these beats they're a little fat they're a little murky and a lot of these kind of simple straightforward beats that do sort of have a modern quality to them are matched up with these either synthesizers or samples that have kind of a pretty glistening quality to them and they really give the songs that the underachievers make sort of a mysterious quality like as if you're hearing some kind of hip-hop transmission beyond the spiritual plane it gives them some musical depth to go along with their spiritual depth it's just really kind of a perfect musical pairing the song of revelations has this beat that comes off really sorrowful really sad the song Sun through the rain I'm not really in love with the lyrics but I love the Spacey beat on that track and to me that song and herb shuttles as well kind of flirts with the idea of cloud wrap and sort of away with just a lot of ethereal qualities and then some heavy bass the song ta de Dee has some really awesome chilly vocal samples in there and the song Sixth Sense has what kind of sounds like this pan flute matched up with these keys that are really again sparkling shimmering so I really do have to give kudos to the producers on this mixtape as well while it's a - and a que do have a lot of personality and do have a somewhat strong narrative when it comes to this spiritual sort of angle the beats do make a lot of these tracks fantastic now overall if you give this hip-hop tape a listen I feel like you're really going to enjoy what you're hearing especially if you're an artist like absol ASAP Rocky Pro era of course maybe a little bit of schoolboy q when they really kind of go hard and pull out those faster flows they're just flares of inspiration and similarities with other hip-hop artists that have been hot recently I don't really have an issue with that because these guys definitely do a great job of separating themselves from a lot of other artists out there with what they say and with the instrumentals that they pick however there are moments where they do kind of lose flavor because of an instrumental that isn't that great a message that's really kind of off key or not that interesting like the track ta de D doesn't really say much to me at all other than this whole beast Coast beast Coast beast Coast thing and while you know it is a fun thing to assert it seems like they're the people who are asserting at the hardest and not really the other people that are being kind of thrown into this movement like I said again the song some through the rain doesn't really do much for me either lyrically and the song potion number 25 is kind of this loving tribute to LSD but the lyrics are extremely corny I'm just this guy with this spiritual healing drug and there are other songs on here like leopard Shepherd as well as land of Lords where the underachievers are riding kind of an old-school boom bap B that feels maybe a little too light and jazzy and it kind of breaks the feel of the album which can kind of be either very aggressive or very mysterious you know these are kind of instrumentals that I feel like guys like Pro era could have rocked way harder so yeah there is a good handful of just kind of boring and maybe unlikable tracks on this mixtape it's almost an hour and I do feel like there is you know a considerable amount of fat on this thing I do think that the underachievers have a style they do have you know a message it's just they don't really lay on it successfully throughout this entire mixtape and while I do like this mixtape a lot and I think that some of my favorite tracks on this mixtape are some of the best hip hop tracks of the year I just am NOT going to forget those songs that I don't like honestly which are mostly toward the back end of this thing I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana the underachievers forever [Music] [Music] 
oeisOVTBY8k,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled Adam green and binki Shapiro LP Adam and green and binki Shapiro are exactly who they say they are what one is a former member of the New York anti-folk outfit the Moldy Peaches and the other is currently a singer in the trio The Strokes related trio little joy whose self-titled LP was one of my favorite records of 2008 now one of the most charming aspects of this LP that I was excited for when I heard it was going to come out is pinky's voice her voice is so soft breezy emotive it's just like honey on the ears I think she would have such a larger audience if she were a part of just some kind of vocal pop record that came out in the 60s or something like that someone get this girl in a time machine please and Adam Green's voice does have its charms as well it's kind of deep its throaty he croons like an old soul but he's kind of got this modern cynical slacker attitude and he could be kind of lewd as well which does add to his personality which can be pretty funny sometimes however he's not really too much on the jokey side on this new album I feel if there is a downside to just his style in general it's that songs of his can tend to be kind of sloppy maybe feel a little rushed even though there is really a huge sense of comedy on this new album there certainly is charisma and indefinitely romance on this very duet loaded LP I actually think Adam kind of shows maybe a slight bit of maturity through working with an artist who emotionally is more on that sweet sentimental kind of romantic side of the emotional spectrum however I don't really find the end result on this LP to be all that mature or anything like that actually I would pretty much say that many of the songs on here pretty twee very cute very quaint and both of these artists have relied on that quality in the past to make songs work make them entertaining but man that that twee feel it's extremely strong here really to me to the point where the most obvious comparison to this album that I can make is like she and him and you know I'm not really a fan of the m-word zooey deschanel project to me it's really too clean it's too cutesy it's too wholesome which is why this LP does appeal to me more Adam and Becky though they do go down this cute road they do maintain a certain level of grit as they same holding one another's hands frolicking through a field of flowers in the sunset which is pretty much how the song just to make me feel good feels just as I suspected there is a good handful of the songs on this LP that do feel kind of short abrupt rushed it's kind of like taking part in a one-night stand where you're the person who didn't actually know this was going to be a one-night stand and then when the person is gone in the morning you're upset that it didn't blossom into a full-fledged relationship so while this album may not be loved the short amount of time that it sticks around is well worth it though it's just a bit of light entertainment with some basic but nostalgic instrumentation which sonically is a lot like that Adam green album minor love that dropped a few years back production-wise they're just a lot of similar qualities between that LP and this there are a few occasional flares of ambition on this album like the really awesome woodwinds on the very heavy closing track on here in three or the strings and the bells on the track if you want me which just gives the song this huge sense of drama Edmund Bink you really do a good job of pumping some of these songs up instrumentally there are some tunes here that are just nice fine refined pieces of baroque pop a little bit of Nancy Sinatra here and there but certainly eccentric and and strange enough to keep things from feeling like a ripoff or just redundant and certainly another thing that keeps this album from feeling that way is the chemistry that Adam and binky occasionally showcase together the song pity love is maybe my favorite song on here and it is really an awesome two and a song with it with Adam and Vicky singing in perfect harmony over these sweetly dark lyrics like I offer pity love's sometimes so strong that you fear me or the line mistake my pity love for the kind that needs you songs like this one go over really well however there are Tunes like the song pleasantries where Adam and and binky are kind of trading lines singing back and forth are coming off really really stiff in the process the vocal performances on this tractors don't feel as intimate as they do on others here I mean this song in comparison really is like listening to a very awkward school play sometimes Adam and binky are kind of better off just singing their own tunes like the song Casablanca where binky has a fantastic vocal part the haha background vocals are awesome the harpsichord is a very nice touch and there are lots of spots on here where greens singing leads singing solo goes over really well too however I think the lowest point on the LP is the very messy and and yeah yeah glockenspiel lead I never found which to me is just this junk pile of lo-fi instrumentation that just does not have the I guess sort of charm the other songs on here do overall I did like this album but not that much Adam and binky certainly do have some chemistry do have something to work toward in the future if they decide to collaborate again but there's just not that much length there's not that much detail and there's not that much intimacy to a good half of the songs on here which are still likable on some level but you know I just wish this album developed into more than just kind of a fleeting crush feeling a decent a strong six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Adam Green and binki Shapiro forever 
EEY6WYtxZFQ,[Music] hi everyone Anthony fan Tiano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an extremely anticipated review of the new My Bloody Valentine LP mb v play the beat man play the beat play that beat man why would you play I can't do the review if you don't play them with a list of my favourite albums of 2013 great features fantastic lyricism and stellar production that I have to give detox a strong beefy tip white 2 you got you got a review what you got a duel what were you doing a review of it's like my buddy's Valentine or something oh yeah that old chestnut My Bloody Valentine is an Irish rock band and really one of the leading figures in the genre known as shoegaze which I talked about at great length in a recent classics week when I decided to review my bloody Valentines seminal sophomore album Lovelace Lovelace and My Bloody Valentine in general may not exactly sound like the acid soaked 60s but the sonic experimentation and just the layers of haze on this record can certainly be traced back to there in the same way that the band style on Lovelace can be traced back to my bloody Valentines early releases because My Bloody Valentine certainly did have humbler beginnings on their earlier EPS which were a lot more lo-fi may be simpler post-punk year so when it comes to the sound of Lovelace My Bloody Valentine really built up to this album I mean they sort of walked up a series of musical steps to get here to this LP that very often people kind of put up on this pedestal far away from not only every other group in this genre of music but my bloody Valentines discography in general and that kind of blind love and obsession with an album can be kind of a blessing and a curse I mean for one it has made music fans 20 years after the release of Lovelace still interested in the idea of a new My Bloody Valentine out it's as if this 20-year gap in studio material has not affected the band's popularity whatsoever however this extreme love of Lovelace and this huge gap in studio releases can of course lead to some irrational expectations as well from music fans like for one a radical change in my Bloody Valentine sound may be an epic musical release that's going to blow people's minds even further than Lovelace did and the assumption that this album has to be amazing because every waking moment of the past 20 years has been spent working on this thing and I don't know I think when you actually think about the music that my bloody valentine time makes those expectations become kind of silly because I mean when you think about it is Lovelace really an epic album is it an album that's really trying to go out there and blow people's minds and thrill people and just get that adrenaline pumping in my opinion no I mean historically it is an epic and significant album but stylistically it's a very kind of droney album it's a very kind of sleepy album it's a very slow seductive intoxicating album and as far as radical changes go that's never really been my bloody Valentines mo either I mean like I said earlier they really kind of built up to the sound that they had in Lovelace from a kind of Gothic rock psychobilly post-punk sound in their earliest releases so My Bloody Valentine has never really been anything but slow and gradual when it comes to presenting the next chapter in their sound the band may have been recording on and off since the 90s there may have been inner band tensions rumors of writer's block and over an albums worth of material getting either thrown away or just forgotten I think music fans tend to take the story of a band's music and throw all this behind-the-scenes stuff in there all too often when I mean I don't feel like we do that in any other instance I mean for sure when we sit down and watch movie we don't think of what the director said or what drama was going on behind the cameras as we're watching it instead we suspend belief and just kind of enjoy the story for what it is that's being presented to us on the screen so right now there's just like all this space junk orbiting around this LP which I'm sure Kevin Shields and company are well aware of as well however the band basically concentrates instead on just what's next for My Bloody Valentine and kind of taking things from where they left off to be completely straight and honest about it mbv sounds pretty much just like what my Bloody Valentine was going for back in their heyday in the early 90s and I suspect that's the case because some of what is here on this album was conceived and maybe recorded during the 90s but that's not the case for every single song on here and I think it's even more impressive that my Bloody Valentine was able to take all this material from different points in the band's career and kind of pull it together in this seamlessly surreal haze that kind of tingles the ears with its sound play this LP is full of just surreal washes of jeroni thick guitars maybe a little bit thicker because of modern recording technology but these heavy dreamy guitars are obscuring just whisper quiet vocals murky bass and drums on a lot of tracks here especially on the opener she found now starts this album off is just being very mind-altering and fuzzy there are all these bright shimmering guitar chords that are just being thrown shattering and breaking into a million pieces against these thick walls of guitar buzz which is just another testament to how odd this Bands approach to mixing is and just kind of placing instruments in certain places there's just no group out there like My Bloody Valentine making shoegaze music just like this and what's weird is that loveless came out in 1991 I mean every group out there pretty much had the opportunity to make an album either in this style or try to improve upon what My Bloody Valentine was doing back in the day yet nobody's attempted that has really succeeded in my opinion there have certainly been offshoots there have been groups that have taken extreme inspiration from what my Bloody Valentine has done over the years applied it to what they do and have come out with great fantastic seminal music in their own right but still My Bloody Valentine and I feel like this album proves it is still the band when it comes to having that simultaneous sense of noise and beauty a lot of the melodies a lot of the vocals on this LP they're sweet they're cute they're saccharine they're just like they're airy they're very pretty but they're just thrown into this blender of nastiness and war and though again that may not necessarily be a formula that appeals to a lot of people because essentially you're hearing the song behind all of these noisier elements all these effects I mean it's really these effects that kind of make the album appealing because it's so weird it just kind of buries itself in my head in the right way to the point where it kind of shakes things around stirs my mind changes my perception of sound and puts me in a trance now the next two tracks on this LP get a little bit heavier the album kind of eases the listener into the sense of intensity rather than kind of hitting them with the track like only shallow like the Bandit on level as years ago right from the get-go the album kind of reaches this peak in its first third or so with the song who sees you which has these dizzying hums of overblown fuzzy guitars as I listen to the song and it's just kind of got this sweet pop sensibility but it's monolithically just sort of trudging forward the way that it's it sort of puts me in this mind-numbing mental state where I feel like I'm just kind of ready to blissfully drool on myself however the band kind of breaks this fuzzy streak with the song and is this yes which is kind of an ambient stop along the way it's this very still little keyboard piece that is one of the longer songs on here reaching six minutes and just kind of quietly hums at a very high pitch bleeps and bloops belinda butchers vocals and they're kind of floating around in the mix the song does kind of have its own tone to it it's light it's not as heavy as many of the other songs on here but I wish it didn't I don't know just have this sense of dragging on meandering there are definitely layers to this track but I wish the layers were altered a little bit more manipulated they feel so clear so pristine maybe just a little too sanitary for what I would expect from My Bloody Valentine song and as long as we're talking about clear sounds on this LP the song knew you also kind of heads down that road this is one of the clearer friendlier tracks I've heard My Bloody Valentine put together it's got this kind of straightforward 60s psych pop groove to it with this nice vintage bass line kind of hip shaking drum beat tremolo guitars whisper quiet vocals I just kind of wish the song sort of went a little further past this one groove that it seems to present for the entire thing the change in groove or speed or intensity would have been nice because the song does not really sound play in the same way that many other tracks on here do these two tracks for me are really the only deviations clarity wise from the rest of this LP after the song My Bloody Valentine heads back down into the sweet sonic muck with the song if I am which has this beautiful vocal melody weird wah-wah guitar squawking against another dense layer of fuzz and the way that this Waga Tarr moves is kind of like hearing waves of fuzz underneath waves of fuzz underneath waves of fuzz following after that in another way is really the hardest rocking song on here the blaring guitars right at the start of this track that just featured loads and loads of feedback are sharp and just ear piercing and as the song moves forward it just gets heavier hardier really one of the harder rocking tracks that this band is put together since some of their earlier EPS however after this the album doesn't really present any interesting finishes or any closure or anything like that I mean My Bloody Valentine presents themselves as being more experimentalists than they are you know traditional album structures or anything like that the song nothing is is a kind of interesting experiment with this drumbeat that continuously just gets louder and louder and louder with noisy guitars and after that the closing track which I do like however not really as a finisher it's titled wonder - it's maybe one of the most heavily treated tracks on this entire LP one of the thickest tracks on here and kind of makes me wonder why other songs didn't kind of see this layer upon layer upon layer upon layer of treatment you kind of get of course these thick guitars and underneath this is this very very obscure drum beat that seems to get busier and busier and busier as the song moves on kind of as if it was a jazz fusion drum beat or like a drum and bass drum B or something like that and the way the vocal melody is moving on this track especially underneath all of these effects it kind of sounds like something panda bear would sing it's a strange track that in a way feels sort of akin to something Animal Collective would do however it could have been written potentially before Animal Collective even existed overall with this new LP my Bloody Valentine just pretty much gives you what I guess you would expect no epic overreaching of what the band has done on loveless just another collection of experiments in this shoegaze style which I think the band has kind of proven themselves to be still in the top-ranking of however you know shoegaze is kind of this micro genre which there's not a ton of competition in I'm not saying it's easy to do what my Bloody Valentine is doing I mean certainly it's difficult for any band to maintain the amount of popularity that they have over the years despite the small amount of releases however if anybody is going to come through with a pretty good or great shoegaze album I mean who else is going to do it but one of the originators of the genre I think my only real disappointments with this LP is I just wish you were a bit longer even though this thing does still kind of sit in the same time range as loveless I think some of the songs on here were kind of cut short not all that well developed or kind of felt like experiments that really didn't go much of anywhere that's only a handful of tracks though I think my only other disappointment was that with the vocals they feel a lot less I guess sweet youthful and and tweet inspired than what I remember from the band's previous stuff yes I know vocals have never really been the focal point of my ability Valentine's music and maybe that's why I'm not really that upset by the change on this album because the sounds are still here the studio work is still here just that weird experimentation that sonic seduction is still here and because of that I did enjoy this LP quite a bit I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana MBV forever [Music] 
1WnqvDivfDg,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here it's time for a review yeah on the modal Orchestra to unknown Mortal orchestra is a low fee psychedelic pop and rock outfit whose debut LP was reviewed here a few years ago I was pretty on the fence with it I wasn't as hot on it as other people for a number of reasons there were a lot of tracks on there that felt just shockingly short kind of underdeveloped a very sort of flat lo-fi production that didn't have a lot of detail or character to it really kind of got old by the end of the album which overall was pretty short of breath just like the songs on it however there were things to this band style in their sound that I liked a lot like they're very kind of beefy funky and sometimes hip-hop influenced I thought drum beats as well as some pretty flashy guitar playing - those two things came together really well on the track funny friends and the band had a great single with the track how can you love me - so there definitely was this glimmer of light and talent add me crossing my fingers that I would enjoy this new LP more and I'm actually happy to say that I do feel that this LP for unknown mortal Orchestra shows improvement their ambition shows on this album it's a longer record longer tracks they stick mostly to their - they're still there lo-fi sound but bring a more diverse palette of psychedelic flavors and sounds I guess the most obvious downside on some of these tracks though is that the mix and the recording can be off maybe the loaf I thing isn't isn't their best friend sometimes because there are some tracks here where the drums feel almost non-existent with how much they're turned down maybe they were recorded in sort of a strange way maybe just with one microphone I mean really that's how it feels like with how below they are the guitars and the bass which really kind of makes me miss how beefed-up they were on some tracks from the debut they sometimes brought a very funky character to their debut LP that I liked a lot unknown Mortal orchestra still manages to bring more for the listener on this LP though more sound more melody more personality it's a bit of a change in character that might not appeal to hardcore fans of the debut LP because while that album does have psychedelic characteristics there's also kind of a cute quaintness to it sort of a bubblegum flavor on a lot of spots with number two instead things are not feeling as sugary they're not feeling as bubblegum they're feeling kind of mature sort of soulful especially in the vocals mainly on tracks like the seven-minute song monkey which is really kind of slow-moving chilled out it might be my favorite song on here I mean it really feels like this vintage blend of psychedelic rock and funk sort of strange but undeniable with its grooves and sort of a new thing for me on here as well as there's a very prevalent Beatles influence on a few moments here especially the opening track on this album which I didn't feel was as strong on the debut not so strong that it would sort of bang me over the head as being Beatles Beatles Beatles the cadence and just the resonance of the vocal harmonies and just the quality of the vocal recording with the microphones that are being used and the way that the vocals are equalized I mean all these things just say Beatles to me on this opening track and these vocals are clashed with some beautiful just almost breathtaking guitar work the track has a great start it has a great middle but then it starts to sort of flounder at the end kind of fading out for quite a long time and I guess from the man during in the process again the band kind of presents material that feels kind of unfinished or just material that feels like the end wasn't really thought of or cared about I kind of feel the same way about the track so good at being in trouble which again has a great start but sort of ends up meandering around the middle because there are a lot of Peaks or anything in the song it's very chilled out and then it just so nonchalantly ends but despite some abruptness I'm still finding some beauty in these tracks the song swim and sleep like a shark has this kind of spectral vocal to it that has this sort of a throaty whisper quality to it that's kind of haunting and the guitar chords and the arpeggios on this track are just played and executed this really whimsical way I mean just flawless the way that they're sort of dancing so nimbly across this very tick-tock drum b is wonderful the song one at a time is another short track it's really well executed fun squawking guitar chords shots of horns really bright really flamboyant the most bombastic song in the entire LP I think but again the song kind of ends abruptly I guess I just can't understand why they take tracks like this and make them so short and yet drag out songs like the opposite of afternoon which I mean it's got some nice playing in it but the way the band is performing the song it feels like they're trying not to wake the neighbors or something songs like this really kind of make me feel like the band brought back that sort of refreshing first-timer attitude that they had on their debut you know I feel like this LP overall is interesting I can put it on and be engaged throughout the entire thing there's some very impressive playing occasionally it's beautiful but rarely is it exciting I guess one of the few moments where I feel like that happens is the song faded in the morning it just has this mean psychedelic rock groove to it and when the vocals pop in they are sung in falsetto and it's really fiery passionate falsetto and I love the way the guitar sort of just follows what the vocal is doing melodically so technically in the background it's just this extra layer of just impressive playing that the band always brings to a track most of the songs on here are really really good but put them together into this one full-length album and I kind of feel like I'm taking this ride where there's just not a lot of scenery just a whole lot of fields because there are a lot of emotional highs or lows and the ones that are there are kind of short still I ended up liking this album a lot I found it to be way more impressive than their debut I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh unknown Mortal orchestra forever 
Fcw5GlQwoXE,Anthony Fantana Internet's busiest music here but the needled rep hi everyone it's time for a review thanks for watching Dumbo gets mad quantum leap Dumbo gets mad is a psychedelic pop project that originates from Italy you may remember from a few years ago through the album elephants at the door not only were there some really awesome influences coming from what fell like schmaltzy corny organ pop music as well as gorillas Flaming Lips psychedelic rock garage rock dance music - because there's some awesome hip shaking beats on this album and I like that even though this album could also be very dense and overwhelming sonically it never really quite lost view of its pop sensibility now this is Dumbo gets Mads sophomore full-length LP quantum leap and of course because I liked the debut so much and was so impressed with how awesome it was that or at least the project was right out of the gate I mean I guess I expected a lot from this I mean I guess in a way I was looking for a more consistent full-length LP one that was showcasing some better production maybe a more potent style maybe Dumbo gets mad could develop I guess sort of way to make itself as a psychedelic project stick out past the ranks of other psychedelic music projects out there right now for psychedelic music Dumbo gets mad is extremely playful and at times I would say on this LP even bordering on absurd with all sorts of zany crazy falsetto vocals that that don't really feel like they're worried about how they sound execution-wise at all just sort of getting this crazy vibe coming from them seems to be the most important thing at times the instrumentation feels a little goofy slap bass lines multi organ sounds and a lot of the drum breaks and sequences on this LP are extremely extremely funky I would say even funkier than the last album I mean if you loved a lot of the on the tracks from elephants at the door quantum leap definitely brings that attitude even more like the song American day which to me has one of the better courses on this entire LP with American day just like any other one it's it's a catchy hook the song also has this awesome bass part where kind of feels like it's in this constant state of soloing and I love the ascending climax at the end of the track it's a big finish but the vocals that are kind of swirling just I guess sort of swimming backstroking through all of this atmosphere are just in my opinion kind of ridiculous they sound obscured as if they were I guess sort of meant to be hidden because they're not all that well performed which I guess I can understand because vocals have never really been the strongest weapon in DUMBO get smads arsenal but I still like the sounds on that track but I love the sounds on the track South Africa even more there's a really boomy drum break that kicks this song off there's a harp at the beginning a jazz flute like some of the great moments from Dumbo gets Mads debut LP this song just feels like swimming thousands of leagues underwater in a sea of Hawaiian Punch the project gets a little more diverse with tracks like Indian food which has this sweet sharp Indian melody coming through on what feels like I don't know like a fiddle or like some kind of reed instrument though that's really the only Indian thing about the entire track there's this awesomely soulful vocal that kind of leads the song way more soulful that I'm usually used to hearing from Dumbo gets mad of course a really awesome funky drum break is paired with this track the diversity continues with the track male ducat oh hope I'm pronouncing that correctly it's a bit of Spanish guitar with bongos vibraphone it's really one of the most instrumentally striking moments that Dumbo gets mad has pulled together on this entire LP it's so beautiful I wonder why there aren't more moments like this on the entire album because so many of the tracks on here just come together in such a cacophonous way that I guess it sort of feels a little bland or uneventful after a while because Dumbo gets mad isn't a full band and is really just kind of a studio project a lot of these jams that the song was venture on kind of lose their momentum and lose their flavor after a while because you're not really hearing this you know live instrumentation interaction or anything like that it just kind of feels like maybe a slightly missed opportunity for Dumbo gets mad to have all these tracks that kind of lose their flavor after a little while when there's this one song on here under the two-minute mark that is so impressive and shows this extreme knack for being able to orchestrate orchestration isn't really the goal on a lot of these tracks I guess Dumbo gets mad is kind of content to maybe just kind of throw those guitars and cents out there along with a drum break and just kind of let the chips fall where they may with a little bit of experimentation here and there like on the track Tahiti hungry jungle which has you know rapping on it due to the fact that it is in Azealia Banks medley and the rapping is you know a little weak a bit ridiculous at times though it does kind of work there is this very like the title would suggest jungle esque garage rock rapping beat in the background kind of giving things that Amazonian feel but the song is kind of back ended with this really sort of weak messy guitar solo that does nothing for me the song Bom Bom has this awesomely kind of Japanese pop sort of feel to it mixed together with Dumbo gets Matt's typical watery psychedelic poppy sound that is is actually really pleasing to the ear the song cougar is one of the zaniest on here and has this weird slap bass line really sharp guitars it's not really my favorite track out here because it meanders like a lot of others on here and has goofy vocals but strangely enough it kind of reminds me of like this stylistic crossroads of the b-52s female post-punk outfits like delta v but then on top of that there's all sorts of weird chipmunk vocals in there along with Dumbo gets mad as usual psychedelic pop stylings like that song Dumbo gets mad does a really great job of pulling together a sound pulling together a vibe but the songwriting is maybe a little too repetitive or basic or maybe the chorus and the don't really have that much of a difference between one another and it kind of makes me feel a little let down in a way songs like before kiddos death which has a strong sort of surf rock vibe to it or the house of love or the closing track down here punch and T unfortunately I was really just kind of feeling like this album was a mixed bag for me there were a handful of tracks on here that I thought were fantastic a few others that I felt like kind of fell into place with something very kind of comfortable and and safe for Dumbo gets mad and then there are songs where Dumbo gets mad takes some real risks tries to experiment but it just doesn't end up appealing to me because it seems so I guess weakly executed that it just makes me cringe a little bit I don't necessarily feel disheartened because I feel like Dumbo gets mad certainly put it all into this album and made the sincere effort to diversify the sound of this project has going which so many artists to have a successful debut album kind of forget to do I'm feeling a light six to a decent I'm feeling a light decent six on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Dumbo gets mad forever 
NczoVKmb1xs,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd I mean who else would it be and it's time for a review of the new cakes the killa tape the eulogy cakes the killa is an up-and-coming New York emcee and this is his latest project the eulogy and this project is really the first time I'm hearing of him however he is a part of a growing trend in underground hip-hop that you may already be familiar with when it comes to popular music hip-hop is one of the younger genres out there and I feel like right now we're living in a time where we are seeing the movement of the fruits of the genres maturation mature maturity growing maturity because as a culture hip-hop is well into its 30s at this point we're seeing a much more diverse and prolific underground just burgeoning with creativity and open to a load of different musical ideas and philosophical ones as well and lifestyle choices too because one of the biggest lines crossed in this style of music in the past year has been kind of the acceptance of homosexuality of bisexuality by fans and listeners alike through artists like Frank Ocean ASAP rocky recently Jadakiss and because of that tolerance hip-hop is now kind of making room for this new lane of homosexual bisexual and transgendered emcees who are now making a lot of noise like the very flamboyant leaf who right now I believe is on his second full-length mixtape and Nicki Blanco - who tags this really kind of odd and dark image to his transgendered lifestyle I see these guys are making a name for themselves out there they're pushing themselves but the thing is I'm not really all that enthralled with either of them lyric at the moment or even really what their flows are just the sound of their voices in general which is kind of why I feel relieved to be like hey check out cakes the killa this dudes lyrics are loaded with references to his sexual preferences but it's hardly distracting because he doesn't really shut his image in your face through music videos or just an oversaturation of photographs maybe not yet anyway but what really stands out about this guy something that is going to catch even traditional hip-hop heads ears is the fact this dude has a super-fast and sweet flow he's got wordplay he's clever he's got personality he's hilarious as well and I feel like his words come out so clear because of this sort of flamboyant twang he has in his voice and how high-pitched his voice comes off when he's rapping and though there was a lot of homosexual imagery in his music which I'm sure people you know associate with being effeminate in yada yada yada he's not afraid to get aggressive either they're actually times when I feel like his flow just the sound of his voice sort of reminds me of like black Gambino but without all the emotional baggage completely lacking and self-awareness that gives me a migraine not only are this dude's line sticking in the back of my head because they're well delivered vocally but they're just clever and they present his I guess sexuality in this way that is both at the same time hyper sexual and badass like spit that to turn a homophobe into a hypocrite in my DMS trying to rendezvous trying to find out if what you heard about cakes is true you've kind of got this traditional 90s New York just aggressive in-your-face insulting attitude with a lot of cartoony violence matched up against all of this homosexual imagery of charging and dude double because he thinks he's going to get sex for free or getting finger-banged or wanting to sleep with somebody else's boyfriend as if this dude was not flamboyant and in-your-face enough he rides these intensely busy instrumentals which all together have this very I guess sort of cohesive consistent quality about them that is just so dense with rattling fast rhythmic sounds I mean a lot of these beats fall under the category of Juke as well as footwork stuff so you're getting just these just busy busy snares rims high hats there's a bit of trap as well instrumentally this is definitely not a tape just any mere amateur could hop on and just start wrapping over the track keep a coochie one of my favourite tracks on here has an awesome footwork rhythm to it it's got a bit of a jazz sample sampling what feels like to be a much older piece of jazz like maybe a piece of big-band that could have come off of 78 it's got snappy high hats jittery clicks again it's just heavy its dense its thick this long break them off is a bit of more footwork with choppy choppy choppy snare drums and just bass hits that rattle Rumble just shape the earth the good book has these weird vocal samples and there is this awesomely hilarious Frank Ocean reference toward the back of the song but what I think may annoy some people on this track is there some really weird chorus vocal effects on this track that feel like I don't know kind of dissonant chipmunk tab it these same effects are very very in-your-face on the track your boyfriend which this to me was maybe the least likeable track on the album just because of these vocal effects like how in your face they are just how kind of obnoxious they are there are other very animated battle cries that that kind of get the same repetitious stream into them like give the witness could be in the wet that's get dig it dig deep like I said a lot of weird stuff going on with just how intense these beats are all the vocal effects it's just a lot to take in it's it's very just in-your-face however cakes kind of finds themself very comfortable as well on the closing track on here which is a bit of very clear straightforward and catchy boom bap it's a bit of a break at the end but still I was actually really impressed with this dudes lyrical abilities especially is flow and personality and the fact that he has done so well in this very short project choosing some beats that match his personality in in such a great way to the point where he really really builds a strong potent flavor and kind of unique flavor for themselves and your thought is it the eulogy is an extremely energetic tape it's a catchy tape it's a bit one-dimensional because I feel like keiki come through with I guess sort of a battle anthem on this tape you're not really getting a lot of slower personal moments or anything like that for the most part you're you're just getting again this battle cry this kind of signal this alarm I'm here take a listen herbs it just kind of hits you hard and just runs right out I'm feeling a light decent eight on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh cakes the killa forever [Music] [Music] 
S8WH_9n6x9w,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tegan and Sara LP heartthrob Tegan and Sara is a twin musical duo who for album after album have been working with this kind of straightforward acoustic and indie rock sound that on some releases feels maybe a little kind of primped clean meticulously produced sort of a poppier progression pass what artists like Ani DiFranco we're doing back in the 90s over the years when I've listened to them I've also been reminded of artists like metric as well people are kind of on that poppier more accessible side of the indie rock spectrum however that's not to say the Tegan and Sara have no grit or no personality or anything like that the 2002 LP did sort of have this straightforward 90s acoustic rock sound to it that was really radio ready but still Tegan and Sara's voices came off unique enough to kind of give them I guess sort of a memorable edge plus their lyrics is well helped in that department with a lot of personal stories about love or relationships but they would also kind of turn around and prove themselves to be sort of self aware sometimes cynical too I'm much more of a fan of what they were able to do slightly later in their career with the instrumentally ambitious the con in 2007 where they were really kind of feeling a bit more mature much more out there to me with that added instrumentation the strings the piano the weirder vocal approaches and just I guess sort of the aggression anger the passion that they had singing in some of these songs it really kind of got rid of the deafening simplicity that some of their older work had to it that made some of their songs feel kind of trashy maybe a bit too commercial but you know maybe commercial is where Tegan and Sara kind of find themselves to be most comfortable because they certainly kind of headed back in that direction a little bit more with the sainthood album in 2009 which to me had some New Wave influences in the way some of the songs were produced in some of the danceable beats but they were still able to kind of keep that personality in that edge that fans had expected up until that point love love them or hate them I feel like Tegan and Sara have been one of the better groups out there to sort of maintain a really strong strong accessible pop sensibility but still have you know defining characteristics that when you hear a Tegan and Sara song you don't mistake it to be anyone else but heartthrob Tegan and Sara really kind of just burnt down everything that they've built their music on for the past decade and rebuilt it with glassy productions Sanitary vocals glistening electronics top 40 dance beats and it's not just for a couple songs either it's for the duration of the entire album and you know what maybe Tegan and Sara are due for a change of pace or due for a stylistic shift I'm absolutely sure that they're well deserved diehard fan base will follow them down this road and maybe say something to the note of that Tegan and Sara take top 40 pop and sort of make it theirs and redefine themselves with it and you know actually make it worth listening to but I mean I'm not sure if I feel that way personally if synth pop and electro pop are the genres that Tegan and Sara are wrestling with on this LP that they are down for the three-count because the sound of the music that they're working with really kind of got the better of them not only to Tegan and Sara not sound like themselves anymore they don't really sound like anything in particular they just sound like everyone else who's on a major label and making dance pop at this point I can't even tell the difference between their voices on this album I mean that's how drained of humanity this LP is Tegan and Sara still do have a knack for writing hooks in this new stylistic transition the chorus is all over the selfie just bursts with catchy melodies in color but as far as lyrics go with songs like they're full goodbye goodbye or alawi yeah I kind of feel like Tegan and Sara maybe more than usual all are working straight out of the lyrical cliche handbook the only song that really kind of stuck out to me lyrically topically and not even for a good reason is how come you don't want me which is one of the most desperate songs I've ever heard them put together I mean emotionally makes Taylor Swift seem like she's a confident sensible lover with no real emotional baggage plus the musical ideas on this LP don't really offer up that much substance either just the corny cliched opening piano on the song I was a fool or just like the 80s new wave pop rock groove on the verses of the track I'm not your hero the instrumental to the track drove me wild feels like it could have featured either Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus and nobody would have known the difference and the track now I'm all messed up kind of gives me a little break at the beginning with I guess just a lot of space and a lot of atmosphere around these pano chords with Tegan and Sara's vocals it actually kind of feels like maybe it could be a piano ballad but then this very jittery beat comes in it feels like it's one drop away from a dubstep remix sometimes it's almost like this high-gloss finish and this really just expensive production makes Tegan and Sara kind of lazy or just kind of feel like they can kind of sit back on it and not really do anything interesting instrumentally I mean the opening guitar melody on the track I couldn't be your friend easily the worst presentation of an opening melody I've heard on a Tegan and Sara song for me honestly this LP really has very little redeeming value I feel like Tegan and Sara have lost their flavor they've lost their style on this LP I am not afraid to say that I feel personally this is Tegan and Sara's worst album at least with their older releases you could put them a step above what was happening on the radio or a step above your average MySpace artist but now I feel like they are what is on the radio I mean back in the day we had the business of art and I feel like on this new LP we're essentially getting the art of business or art as a result of business I'm feeling a strong three on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantan Oh Tegan and Sara forever [Music] you 
cPficHCo_Us,it's just a godspeed kind of day hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd time for a video where we talk about stuff question/comment thing let me preface this video by saying that I feel incredibly fortunate and lucky to be kind of running a YouTube channel where I'm able to talk about music on a regular basis and people who love music are extremely just emotionally affected by music who music just plays a huge role in their lives people like that care I feel very lucky to be in that position but I feel like part of the reason I am here is because I just maybe sort of sometimes have strong opinions and I tend to stick by them but you know that doesn't mean other opinions are not valid or that I don't like listening to other opinions or sort of taking them into consideration because sometimes they either change the way that I think or maybe you know just sort of give me a new perception and I actually like people saying kind of react my reviews even if it is in a negative way because I feel like that sort of I don't know maybe in a way helps me make them better now recently I did kind of have a few reviews that sort of were humming the same tune I guess it can kind of be summed up in my recent review of the new local natives record where you kind of have a group that in my opinion is maybe a little derivative maybe kind of generic sort of lacking in its own spin on the sounds that sort of I guess influence it and of course some people reacted to that negatively those reactions got me thinking and got me wondering I mean what exactly is derivative music what exactly is generic music how do you really know something to be generic and is being generic necessarily a terrible thing can an artist make a generic album or kind of I guess sort of have a lack of an original sound and still that album be fantastic a while ago I did a video on originality where I kind of came to the conclusion that nothing really is 100% original nearly every artist in numerous mediums or styles of art can pretty much be traced back to other artists everybody is borrowing ideas in some way shape or form but I don't think something being original and something being derivative or generic I don't think these terms or at least the way that you know we use them to talk about music I don't think it's all as black and white as it may seem on the surface really I kind of see I guess originality and a lack of originality as kind of a grayscale I mean you can have certain levels of originality I feel like I can only handle a certain level of familiarity before I just kind of find myself tuning out or getting bored or just generally feeling like I don't really care because I've kind of heard this before and the only way I kind of feel like I avoid that emotion as if I feel like I've heard this before but now in this instance it's better or maybe there's kind of a like I said earlier a different spin a different personality they write unique songs but still kind of in this same style there are quite a few artists that I have reviewed recently who have influences that are very very obvious some of them more contemporary than others but still I manage to love their music because I personally feel that their spin on their influences is unique or original enough to the point where it keeps me interested tame impala I am am I Who am I oxygen Action Bronson the tallest man on earth and even though I really love them I could completely understand how someone would come across their work and find it really generic and derivative and maybe boring because of that I mean I see that there is you know kind of two sides to this fence but there isn't really like you know this conclusive way to kind of say whether or not an album is generic or an album is derivative what's generic tit it depends so much on your life experience just how old you are how long you've been listening to music how many different albums you've listened to how many genres you've listened to which artists and what genres you've listened to first but I guess really what I'm and what I want to ask is what is generic to you what makes something I guess sort of commonplace in your eyes what albums in your opinion are generic how do you know a generic album when you hear it do you ever I guess sort of listen to an artist and maybe you've thought they were generic but you ended up enjoying their music anyway let me know Anthony Fantan Oh derivative forever [Music] uh no honey that's just the world warming over because we have climate change 
wD6ZuUJCtHM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana no here it's time for one of our weekly quicky segments where we just talk about a bunch of recently released releases and and and songs kind of like a little musical weekly roundup powwow happy times so let's just kind of run through this gauntlet of tracks and then all of you can go outside and play iron and wine has recently dropped a brand new track link in the description box to give that a listen of course new LP on the way to follow that as well as ways who has a new track out titled demon to lean on which released this past week which kind of forecasts a slightly kind of grungy ER sound for the project which might be something that I would be interested in hearing on this new LP beyond that the experimental rock metal post hardcore outfit whatever you want to call them Ken mode has a brand new track that they have dropped from their forthcoming LP that is extremely intense just like the last one they put out and surfer blood has a new track called weird shapes which I actually didn't really care for all that much honestly it just felt you know maybe a little uneventful for me but they have a new album on the way as well nails has put out a new track called gods cold hands and oh my god yeah this band is so scary loud and and then scary fast it's like a nightmare it is a grind core power violence hardcore punk sludge everything extreme all at once nightmare it's made me so psyched to hear this band's new LP next Dumbo gets mad has a new track out titled American day weird psychedelic papi just like many songs to come out prior to the project's new LP quantum leap Italian psychedelic pop project you guys may remember from a few years ago with the album elephants at the door this new LP is releasing toward the beginning of February looking forward to reviewing it soon The Flaming Lips also have a new track out titled blows up today which is actually going to be featured in a car commercial during the Super Bowl I'm actually think it's a pretty awesome track loved it while it's not incredibly I guess sort of dense or challenging lyrically it does have a lot of fun bright intense and and kind of weird noisy psychedelic sounds I am just completely head over heels for with the lyrics that The Flaming Lips have on this track I would actually call this on like blissful joyous stupidity nerves jr. has a new track out which is a bit of an eerie indie pop number that I like quite a bit and make sure if you're a hip hop fan to check out the black jungle radio LP from the black jungle squad project which is a bit of a kind of understated weirdly produced hip hop project which seems to be kind of spearheaded by Jeremiah J and has a lot of just personality to it next the new knife track yes the knife full-length track dropped this past week full of fire and I am enjoying it quite a bit a lot of people have been asking me what I think about it I think it actually forecasts a pretty weird and maybe a slightly avant album again from the knife maybe not quite as strange as their experimental opera that they came out with on the LP tomorrow in a year but still kind of weird with just how I just sort of constant this track is with its beat but how they sort of shower this rhythm and just this groove and all sorts of weird vocal sounds and noises and abstract lyrics we're definitely not looking at maybe a really poppy knife this time around and I like that they're you know maybe kind of coming forward with that on this first track next Bona beau has a new track out serious I believe it's titled either way if you're looking for some kind of spacious atmospheric interestingly textured with some metallic sounds electronic music then definitely check this track out because it is an awesome tease tour this guy's next release and do check out his album black sands is is last full-length LP if you're yet to hear it Zeds Dead has new collection of dance music tracks of different varieties in this Hot Sauce EP that is out now on Mad Decent really enjoyable also make sure to check out this sort of low five singer-songwriter project with a touch of shoegaze in the mix title of torez tourist that wraps up your tracks and miscellaneous releases that I have not touched down on in a video from this past week and now we go to albums new ex-cops LP true hallucinations no matter how many times I visited and revisited this album I just could not shake the notion could not shake the idea that this is just kind of an average bland jangle pop Django Rock album that doesn't really have a strong personality to it it is sweet it is pleasant but you know I I don't mistake those things for you know fantastic and amazing I mean I think honestly in my opinion at best this album is just kind of likable it's passable yes right now there is an official tribute album to my bloody Valentine's loveless titled yellow loveless which only features Japanese bands and artists I believe and it's kind of you know all been sparked by the prospect of a new My Bloody Valentine album later this year fingers crossed the album features people like shown in knife Boris and many many more and even though there are artists on here that I know I like others that I am interested in getting into because of their affiliation with this album I'm still not usually a huge tribute album person because usually of how all over the place they tend to be quality wise but there are some very impressive sounds coming from some of the groups on this album who do choose to go down that more shoegaze ear out of course there are others who kind of take their covers from this album and go in a completely different direction like shown a knife that pulls together what kind of sounds like a vocal poppy group style maybe a bit of psychedelic pop in there too type track that is very upbeat sugary and actually kind of funny considering where it came from with the original so there are some really imaginative revisions on on this collection of tracks and some dubstep just going to leave it at that the new high highs full-length open season this is basically a drink pop LP with a few folk inspired rest stops along the way and what's kind of making me talk about this LP even though I didn't really care for many of the dream pop tracks at all they didn't really have a strong flavor for me those full tracks especially the title song on this LP are actually really nice filled with some detail and kind of enchanting intoxicating I do like the way that these guys combined dream pop with Fulk I would be interested in kind of hearing them go further down this road in the future hey the divinity of purpose you know Connecticut metalcore outfit how could I not talk about these guys it's a Hatebreed album that sounds like a hate breed album yeah chugga-chugga riffs breakdowns Jeremy just as screaming his brains out about having heart if that mixture of things interests you then you know yeah sure get into it but I think even maybe hardcore fans of Hatebreed might be a little disappointed by this album's complete lack of surprises Voivod target earth these guys are a classic thrash metal outfit kind of sci-fi themed and inspired they're really one of the more notable groups in this genre putting out albums since the early 80s but by the late 80s were taking a way more kind of progressive and technical approach to this style Plus on top of that there are a huge influence on one of my favorite thrash bands of all time vector I think it's really admirable that the band has maintained this constant stream of releases ever since they started with really only kind of a handful of lineup changes but still I only ended up really sort of only tolerating this album I thought a lot of the guitar riffs and passages that these songs move through because there are a lot of sections to some of these songs don't really string or come together all that well there's not a lot of tension building in these tracks it sort of seems like I don't know they sort of wail away without any real kind of rises or Falls or anything like that maybe it's the production's fault because everything feels maybe sort of as if it's making noise and kind of existing at the same tempo but not really all that tight or anything like that especially the vocals which do tend to be kind of loose maybe a bit amateurish kind of all over the place easily the most lackluster thing on all these tracks the sound of the bass the drums and the guitars it's all just really kind of brittle and just not that nice on the ears the drum mix is actually shockingly low as well I mean though I don't really like a lot of newer thrash metal groups kind of taking on that slicker production that makes them sound really kind of neutered and just sucked of life I mean this too seems kind of lifeless as well because of just not that much pump in in the sound of the recording rainbow LP yeah right formerly known as Reading Rainbow these guys were you know pretty much an indie pop and indie rock group without a lot of unique characteristics to note but on this new LP they actually went further into a shoegaze sound which I mean actually was pretty interesting because they're pretty good at manipulating some weird strange guitar noises even though there is a clear my Bloody Valentine influence coming through when they go down this road and how could there not be it's still just awesomely noisy blissful and and kind of catchy the intro track is great the track pink rough is great the song drift away which is the the lead single off of this LP has a really nice catchy chorus soaring vocals kind of a slow pace it sounds like a combination of not only my bloody valentine but Veronica Falls as well but as the album presses on these guys start bringing back those indie rock indie pop and maybe slightly kind of garage of your tunes that to me didn't really have any flavor when they used to play them on their older albums they just don't really have the sounds that interest me the hooks and and the vocals feel a little less inspired as well just a lot of nondescript tracks toward the end and just the middle of this album as the band sort of sheds this shoegaze vibe that they've started the album off with hopefully this name change and this slight change in sound is a forecast for future stuff because considering how good the shoegazing songs were on this LP I would love to hear them move further down this road and that's about it for releases and songs that I didn't get to mention this past week but I wanted to talk a little bit about what do you think of any of them do you hate all of them do you love all of them maybe some of them have for them to them one of them let me know Anthony Fantana quickies forever 
UQ6i6uF3EQU,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the internet prettiest music nerd and it's time for a quick little video talking about my favorite releases and songs from this past month January because January is freaking over and yeah I actually think so far 2012 is is not as hot as 2013 in terms of just the first month because I mean I got some records that I mean I really love this month I mean let's let's count them off first the new buek and gase CD general dome a really kind of fun noisy kind of industrial kind of funky kind of indie rock it's just a crossroads of a bajillion million different things and I mean I I love it for that plus the weird guitar tones and and how the songs are maybe a little bit more straight forward on this sophomore release makes this album a bit sweeter a bit catchy er stronger vocal melodies to me some interesting guitar leads as well and just I guess kind of a quirky aura to the sound of this duo's music because they have kind of made and then perform with their own DIY instruments next the new kamagra CD album LP self-titled this is not the band's first record though still it is a self-titled record and it is one of the better screamo records I've heard as of late definitely a bit more melodic a bit catchy or a bit more anthem like than screamo typically tends to be a pretty extreme genre yes it does have those elements especially these screaming vocals that make screamo such an alienating genre I don't expect everybody to like it but if you do find yourself interested in this genre or you know you're already a fan this is definitely a record to check out foxy jeans we are the 21st century ambassadors of peace and magic this is an album that is feeling a lot of glam rock vibes a lot of Psych rock vibes a lot of just old-school classic rock and rock and roll vibes they play these genres not with the the kind of attitude that one would usually assume a nostalgic kind of throwback group would it's not like there's kind of this hero worship on this record I feel I actually think this album had a lot of points is kind of silly and freewheeling and noisy and a little loose and kind of tongue-in-cheek while at first I kind of miss the chaos of their last album they still kind of maintained a lot of personality and attitude yeah it's not incredibly original but I do like the spans personality and I think the song that they're playing are pretty catchy another group that is kind of a throwback the new Pro era mixtape peep the up Pro clips so it's a really nice hiphop mixtape a lot of tracks a lot of good tracks just an old boom bap sound a lot of cunning lyricism yeah for sure it is steeped in the old school of hip hop but I like the fact that this album just does that so freakin well I mean like I say in the review hip hop has kind of come to a point where it is old enough for it to kind of reflect upon its past and this mixtape is is definitely an exercise in that and another favorite release of this monthly - EP combo of mile of things that happen at night things that happen a day definitely in the running for the best EPS of this year for sure some fantastic hip hop EPS I love that this dude bounce back from his last project really kind of hopped on some different instrumentals this time around but still stayed kind of weird abstract personal and that's about it for major releases in terms of songs definitely my favorite tracks of this month were automata go cheese meow neon-colored dancey super nintendo games it's it's just got everything and beyond that the new factory floor single fall back really weird post punky electronic again danceable as well and i think my next favorite track for this past month favorite favorite because there have been others is the Just Blaze and and our collaboration hire I've been kind of you know pushing this track out there a lot of people just tell me it reminds me of tonight it sounds like tonight yeah I understand that and and yeah it does kind of have a weird kind of tonight banger quality but I don't think that this is necessarily just cheap tonight or knockoff tonight because of that I just think this track is just really colorful it's fun it's loud it's hard it's just got you know all those fun banger qualities that I look for and is just incredibly I guess sort of exciting without builds and it falls just so many peaks and valleys it's in a constant state of that and is you know really fun because of it just bang bang bang those are pretty much my favorite musical moments of this past month I'm looking forward to many more in February and looking forward to making more videos for you as well you're the best anthony Fantana favorite albums of the month forever Noorie dance oh I got a river we need to be oh thanks actually kiss 
zxbcZUAP1nc,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review tomahawk Oddfellows tomahawk is an experimental and alternative rock band this is their new full-length LP and the band started as a collaborative effort between Dwayne Denison of the band the Jesus lizard and fantastic multi-talented vocalist my pen vocal phenom really as well as Trevor Dunn who has also worked with Mike Patton and groups such as mr. bungle and who some of you may remember as playing upright bass on quite a few tracks off that new Melvin's album and something I didn't even realize until this review because I'm a complete fool it is actually that this band features the drummer from helmet and battles so I mean because of all this experience and all the numerous groups that all of these people have taken part in over the years I mean this is just not tomahawks 4th full-length album but really a group of guys with just years and years and years of rock and experimental rock experience coming together to create a full-length LP between these four guys there are just too many different bands and projects to count and some of them completely different than others I mean dudes like Mike Patton versatility is pretty much their calling card not to mention the fact that this band's last LP had some really strong Native American music influences however on this new LP tomahawk seems to kind of abandon what they did on the LP anonymous they go back to their experimental and alternative rock ways but maybe with a slightly catchy or edge on some tracks I mean so catchy and straightforward I actually kind of feel like I'm listening to what potentially could have been a Faith No More single back in the day mainly with tracks such as stone letter but of course that is just kind of one side of this new album being a Patton fronted project it should be assumed that this record overall is is pretty versatile and jumps all over the place stylistically and emotionally all over this LP there are different singing styles levels of weirdness songwriting approaches as if the album title were like a reference to what these 13 songs feel like as a group but odd fellow still is not really the weirdest album that you're ever going to run across I mean even at weirdest tomahawk is able to kind of keep all of the tracks on this album around the two to four minute mark now even though alternative rock is not the most shocking adventurous or exciting of genres I feel like tomahawk makes a pretty convincing argument for the exact opposite they are able to sort of adventure outside of the box on a lot of tracks here but still stick to alternative rocks modern catchy hooks and riffs the opening track on here Odd Fellows has this 7/8 timing on the verse with this really awesome kind of heavy weird just odd guitar riff that is sort of iced with these really spooky grimy vocals from Mike Patton but once the band kicks into the chorus the vocals start kind of soaring this very close harmony that I think an Allison chains fan would really appreciate the tracks tone letter is kind of like a slightly sped up piece of arena rock without this really huge sense of grandiosity but still very melodic I could see members of the band back-to-back singing into the microphone and unison on this one but Mike Patton brings that weirdness and by having kind of this strange raspy 'no stew his voice over the verses it's a nice contrast the song southpaw goes down the same Road but maybe is a little bit on the corny er side especially with the lyrics and is kind of my least favorite track on this LP as a result the song IOU quietly builds in intensity and in harmony with these really awesome guitar leads the song itself feels you know sort of strange tortured but the atmosphere the reverb thrown on this track sort of brings it to a another level of cavernous sadness the song a thousand eyes comes on slow as well and it just sort of you know hit me especially on this song sometimes tomahawk is just really really great at sort of building that intensity in in a slower moment I love the pace that these guys are able to work at but still kind of keep the track engaging and of course their spots on this LP where Mike Patton kind of steals the show like on the song white hats black hats where his just gravelly voice which he kind of pulls out specifically for this track and maybe another one on here too sounds maniacal and and in a way kind of cartoony but sort of villainous as well but as far as just major downsides overall for this LP I think this album after numerous listens kind of exposed itself to me to be incredibly incredibly front-loaded I mean really in my opinion the most exciting tracks and pretty much all the new ground I guess for tomahawk is broken on the first half of the album on the other half the album you have songs that are either maybe a bit shorter kind of rehashing ideas that were earlier on the album or in some cases featured in other projects that these band members are in in my opinion these song baby let's play is just I mean really underwhelming the way that it just me Anders I mean really it's kind of like staring at dust flow through this beam of sunlight coming down from the window you notice it and it's kind of you know beautiful the way things kind of hang in the balance and that beam of light but still it gets kind of you know after a while and the closing track on here is this kind of weird blend of hard rock and and surf rock with vocals from Mike Patton really this is the only part in the entire album where I actually find his singing to be sort of borderline obnoxious I mean it feels kind of tagged on to the end of the LP because it doesn't really feel like it would flow into any other song here Odd Fellows is definitely one of Tomahawks more diverse efforts but they're just some songs on here that don't reach that experimental or adventurous level that I've always heard from these guys I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this album if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana tomahawk forever 
fS-cFt887Po,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled California x record these guys are Massachusetts trio this is their debut album and on this LP they are laying the foundation for what I hope is a very loud and catchy rock and roll career these guys are an alternative rock and an indie rock band with an overall just kind of fuzzy sound in the production buzzsaw guitars and thick base hard heavy freakin drums and just like a whole lot of attitude punk garage garage punk and maybe just like a little bit of shoegaze and noise rock wiggle their way into many tracks on this LP kind of like the band's the men as well as the van yuck these guys kind of create this Frankenstein monster of an album that's kind of an amalgamation of all these groups that they really really love from the late 80s to mid 90s groups like dinosaur jr. Sonic Youth but I think some more modern comparisons that may sit well with people are guys like Jay Reatard for example and there are moments where songs on this help you really really kind of feel like I'm listening to waves but way way way less obnoxious it is kind of noisy and distorted it does have kind of a strong indie rock vibe even when they go on a longer journey here with a song with some sort of stoner rock s kriffing and there's actually quite a bit of heaviness just like this overbearing quality to the guitars that I love a lot I mean this album just pummels you with these guitars like I said I mean it does kind of feel like stoner rock but with a sort of punk bluntness to it no pun intended there however if you are looking for something bold experimental or challenging you might just want to look elsewhere I mean pretty much everything on this LP is just no  the song spirit world has this swinging rock and roll riff that sounds like something Chuck Berry would have played back in the day it's clashed with these blaring fiery guitar leads that sound like they're being data this tube amplifier turned all the way up it's got a lot of energy to it but just the lack of adventure on so many of these tracks in terms of the chord progressions and just the riffs that the guitars are playing it does kind of lead to a somewhat lackluster album because there aren't really any surprises there isn't really much I can say that the band is doing that is sort of distinct to this record for example the songs pond raw and mummy I mean the riffs and corporations on those tracks I mean I just kind of feel like they're sort of a dime a dozen with the riffs on this LP there's a lot of major second intervals a lot of syncopated guitar and drum hits that segue one section of the song to another and and for sure the band's guitar leads I mean they scream out like they're the most significant thing going on in music right now so the energy and the desire are there to the point where you know California X is is pretty I guess you could say convincing it's just stuff like the lack of adventure with the writing or even the vocals too which do very very little to kind of pull this album out of this somewhat generic slump or like a commonplace funk sort of like that Mets album that I dug last year this album sort of feels held back by the fact that the vocals aren't really stepping up they're not really coming forward and either delivering a voice that is memorable or somewhat interesting but they're not really saying much in terms of I guess sort of gripping or catchy lyrics either they just sort of hang awkwardly in the back of all the instrumentation as if they're like afraid to ruin the vibe of what California X is trying to do guitar wise anyway you know if the songs had a little more detail to them in terms of structure some more adventurous vocals less sort of melodic or riff cliches I mean this could be a really great album because the production is there the performance and the playing is there certainly California ex seems focused when it comes to just making a really freakin hard hitting rock album it just sort of needs that spice to kind of give it some replay value and just kind of give it some some nooks and crannies to dive into to really kind of bring it to the next level in my opinion feelin aight decent too strong six on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantan Oh California x forever 
uLVuvJY_AkY,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantan Fantana here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest of rock pop electronic and experimental music and yeah that's about it today on track reviews we're going to be talking about a brand new single from The Strokes the strips The Strokes the strips The Strokes sure The Strokes the famed pop rock and alternative rock band The Strokes are back with a brand freaking new single titled one way trigger and this track is going to be on a new full-length album which currently at this moment is untitled but a lot of the material on this LP maybe this song as well was developed around the time the band was writing stuff for the album angles which they dropped in 2011 or just developed in post-production of angles I don't want to say the word leftovers or anything like that because I feel like that implies that you're just getting tracks that weren't good enough to be on angles I don't really think The Strokes or any interviews they've done are trying to imply that but certainly this track for sure feels like it was kind of coming from that same frame of mind the band was writing angles in which may or may not please some fans either way the band seems to be gearing up to put out this new full-length LP they're putting that short little hiatus they had the band on for a handful of years far far into the past and you know I personally am looking forward to it though angles did get some mixed reactions from longtime Strokes listeners I thought it was decent though I didn't love this LP I liked the diversity on this album I liked that the band was taking some risks I liked that they tried to apply some different moods some synthesizers as well they weren't just trying to go down that swanky pop rock Avenue that they've been really successful traveling down ever since the band's third LP first impressions of Earth I feel like they've been kind of looking for a new groove to settle into weather though though they were trying some new things taking some risks with the very distorted and riff Laden single juice box which honestly did not sit well with me I mean it really kind of ranks up there with some of my least favorite stroke songs so the band has definitely let me down before with a new single but I was still looking forward to getting into this track and I guess I was overall pleased with what I heard now the track one way trigger as soon as I put it on I mean my jaw freakin dropped for a second and not just because of the emphasis on synthesizers that I found on the album angles or even like Julian Casablancas solo work or freaked a lot of listeners out is that we are hearing Julian sing in falsetto on this track it's not just straight falsetto for the entire song though it's not like this track is an entire departure from the musical and stylistic elements that these strokes usually bring to a track you've got lots of very busy tight punchy drums lot lot lot locked into an upbeat lean pop rock groove some tone down guitars some driving bass and the sequence keyboard melody that you know it's it's got a really kind of bing-bing-bing-bing quality to the sound of the tones it's pretty much like that old Strokes swagger and momentum complete with an Albert Hammond Jr guitar solo it's simple its harmonized it's very bright all these other elements are great I still do feel like this falsetto that Julian is singing in is going to be the line in the sand that some strokes fans will not cross it's technically not Julian Casablancas best vocal cut that I've ever heard on one of his songs I mean I feel like even someone who likes this track and admit that the mix on his vocal is really not that good it's buried underneath one thing after another in this song on top of that Julian seems to be mumbling a lot of the things he's saying and what is kind of being sung about isn't all too clear and in addition to all of those there's kind of this weird subtle chorus effect on his voice boy that feels like it's distracting more than it's enhancing with his vocals and you know I will admit when he hits those highs when he is sad kind of like soaring over everything melodically it does sound a little little ridiculous I mean there's definitely some fine-tuning to be done if fall said it was going to continue to be you know a recurring character and strokes musical Arsenal however I still did end up digging the track the tune is really catchy I still love the instrumentation I love The Strokes tight freaking sound and I mean to me especially with the falsetto this track kind of feels like something like I don't know like a band basically kind of letting go of their inhibitions and their elements especially in this vocal that can remind me of something Beck would do and I love the synthesizers too I mean I would much rather The Strokes go down possibly a more synthesized route than some of the more distorted songs that I heard on first impressions of earth which still continues to be like my least favorite Strokes album it was a fun little experiment I'm still looking forward to what The Strokes are doing on this new full-length LP I don't think it's the horrifying piece of garbage that some people are making it out to be yeah you may not want to listen to Julian Casablancas sing in falsetto and I completely understand that but uh still I thought it was a decent track I was a completely offended by it or anything like that if you've given this new single a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is about Anthony Fantana The Strokes one way trigger forever 
TJbUkULlkMk,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review local natives hummingbird local natives is a Silver Lake band and this is their sophomore full-length LP and help them that I was maybe a little apprehensive to get into because of just how lukewarm I was on their debut full-length a few years ago which did definitely definitely feel like a debut album in the sense that you have a group of guys who have created a band that feels so steeped in its influences that it's really difficult to separate the group themselves from what music inspires them because no matter how many times I really gave a listen to gorilla Manor I couldn't really figure out what this band was about outside of the artists that they kind of channels so well through their tracks their moments and local natives music where you might catch a bit of the eccentricity of Talking Heads a lot of moments where you hear the vocal harmonies of a group like Fleet Foxes sometimes the vocal harmonies and the experimental folk tendencies of a group like grizzly bear pop up as well and sometimes local natives are able to effectively channel the ambitious baroque instrumentation of Arcade Fire too but outside of a few blog Abel singles from gorilla Manor like the song Sun hands nothing really about that album stuck with me through 2010 and 2011 however for a lot of people local natives have resonated and that's not really that big of a surprise because the music that they're inspired by the artists they're inspired by have made some of the most popular indie rock folk and pop of the past ten years and when music fans typically come across an artist that they love and maybe they haven't really gotten their fill they seek out more music that sounds like that through either the genres that that music is boxed into or just similar sounding artists I'm not saying the local natives is necessarily riding the coattails of any one group but for sure they did not invent the sounds that they are toying with I mean they're more of a product of the environment that they're thriving in musically and I guess the twist that they put on a lot the artists that inspire them is that the music in terms of its appeal and its its beauty is pretty obvious right from the get-go especially on this new sophomore release that has a much slicker production value especially on tracks where you're getting a lot of atmospheric instrumentation and a little Radiohead esque falsetto singing - I guess what I'm getting at is that no matter how many times I listen back to local natives their music just does not not not move me clearly the band has a lot of musical talent whether it comes to technical ability or writing because they're able to copycat this close these great contemporary artists I just for the life of me cannot shake this very overwhelming sense of just lack of imagination an album that's unmemorable an album that's just uninvent Eurus I don't question the band's passion for the blueprint that they're working from but for me just the lack of surprises on this LP is depressing really for me style and sound and production as it impacts those other two things are my biggest issues on this album like the band's last LP either a few catchy standouts I suppose the instrumentation is fine the vocal harmonies are nice it just all kind of wears me down as I travel through the entire LP because I mean there's just really nothing I guess sort of unique to the band on this LP and in my opinion I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it thanks for watching Anthony Fantan au local natives forever you 
tX3BRjKWK8Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantino the the here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for one of these videos where I talk about a bunch of songs albums musical events things like that that have occurred over the past week that I haven't exactly gotten a chance to talk about at great length so let's just get straight into it with some songs and other miscellaneous things ice age ecstasy the Danish post-punk noise rock outfit with a new album on the way titled your nothing have a new song slash music video out it's chaotic way more chaotic than the song coalition that they've dropped recently that I loved and I'm just loving the intensity behind this track I caught the band live last night and it was just really loose noisy just again chaotic and I like to say it was like violent apathy experimental and psychedelic folk outfit Akron family has a new track called no run no room with a new album called sub verse on the way the track is really layered thick heavy as I already said psychedelic definitely check it out a lot of different parts to this song it's a nice little I guess sort of journey Boudica enjoy Orbison having new track out called n fade there is a compilation album coming on the way with that track being included on it and a bunch of other songs that they have collaborated on recently as well for sure there's gonna be some interestingly produced house tech house micro house all over this thing Pete Swanson has a new track out called life ends at 30 is gonna have a new record coming out on software slash Mexicans summer and what I have heard from him before is kind of blended together the worlds of techno noise drone although it hasn't really been I guess sort of all that amazing or impressive to me although this track though it does go down that same road it did really kind of resonate with me a lot more than stuff I've heard from him in the past it's an interesting song tomahawk has a new record on the way coming out like next week I think just the start of next week and there's a song out front called Oddfellows certainly lives up to the title the band ghost Swedish metal outfit ghost has a new song out right now which is an Abba cover of the song I'm a marionette not really one of their most popular songs with silat decent cover they really kind of make it much darker much moodier and of all people Dave Grohl guest produces it and plays drums on it so I mean what's not to like the band of Bissel death metal band of Bissell has a new LP out stream in full if you like your death metal extremely sort of I guess reverb caked then this will for sure resonate with you and on top of that gold panda has a new EP out called the trust EP he really goes down like a micro house direction on this collection of tracks this very short collection of tracks much darker moodier more ambient more atmospheric spacious and overall just weirder I mean he has that kind of like monochrome quality to it that I kind of find it like nicolas jars music i mean definitely not as bouncy or as colorful as a lot of stuff that I heard on his last full length also Marnie Stern has a new track out called East Side Glory new album on the way through kill rock stars I love this freaking track and past that just ablaze and Bauer have a new collaborative track out called higher it is an absolute banger maybe sort of like banger of the year potential in my opinion and from what I understand this track is going to be included on a new EP that Just Blaze has coming on the way later this year Rocky's sound species at war this ultra technical and mechanical grindcore outfit has a new EP out it is a little more grimy and just distorted than what I heard on their last full-length album and while that does make it have more I guess I guess sort of a more human quality to it it feels a little bit more I guess sort of living breathing it doesn't feel like I'm just hearing a machine it's still kind of a little too rigid for me but I think a lot of people get a lot out of how maniacally tight and relentless that this short collection of tracks is new order lost sirens I mean I think it's no secret at this point that this new album is just kind of like a bunch of extra cuts off of new orders last major album waiting for the sirens call and I mean what can you really expect at this point from a collection of songs coming from that kind of background I mean there are some good cuts on here for sure like the opening track which are really melodic really sweet but then right after that with the second song sugarcane I mean the hook on there especially is just so sweetly saccharine and just kind of annoyingly mindless you know honestly I thought the collection of tracks was likeable but I tribute that mostly to the fact that I personally will admit that I am a new order fan I will most likely like much of what they do they're one of the few groups that I can just sort of point out and say I'm a fan of them not just of their music not just of their albums but just sort of what they did in music and where they came from as well with Joy Division I was actually pleasantly surprised by how good a lot of the production was on this album yeah it's simple it's plain but I still feel like new order presents definitely an appreciation for sound still at this point but I do think this album kind of confirms that after so long and we're just kind of getting like these warmed over leftovers that maybe noir doesn't really maybe have any kind of radical artistic statements left in them at this point which is fine you know I mean they've made their great fantastic records I mean that's in the past they've sort of made their mark on music I'm not really expecting a whole ton from new order at this point Oliver mechanical EP this new EP on fool's gold records it's just a short collection of tracks French house electro house very obvious influences from the Deaf punk and justice variety but still extremely catchy and captivating beats nice build ups or tracks for bucks you can't really go wrong that religion TrueNorth these guys are a California skate punk and just punk-rock outfit and honestly I've never really been that big of a fan of them and and that's just been the case for me with most clean voiced punk bands from the late 80s early 90s as far as punk goes bad religion has just always been way too poppy for me too sweet for me and so I mean it's really no surprise that on this new LP it's pretty much everything that I've always never liked about Bad Religion but now at this point just a little more aged but you know I do give them credit for even at this number of albums and this number of years they're still staying pretty true to their sound I'm sure fans will dig that but in my opinion on this LP I mean it's just weak hooks it's a very weak kind of cleaner studio energy it's weak vocals I mean to me Bad Religion kind of presents like the energy of like a local bar band or something like that on this LP especially like on the track hello cruel world which is is almost just like an alternative rock tune I mean this album to me is just the epitome of just underwhelming punk rock shougo InFocus this is a new kind of pop album from an up-and-coming Japanese singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist I guess from this album kind of a producer and this thing is just amazingly colorful it's light its layered bedroom pop with way more ambition than bedroom pop usually presents I mean actually so much ambition it's it's almost like a travesty that this dude kind of records under the conditions that he does because it does not feel like or sound like he put this together and sort of like a pristine high-quality studio or anything like that because you know considering how low Phi it is and just sort of how DIY it feels it's incredibly incredibly just dense I think to the point where the technical aspects of the recording of this album kind of holds it back I mean if this dude were in a studio with the right producer I think musically he would be absolutely dangerous I think what this album does with so little is fantastic but it still ends up feeling like you know sort of ambivalent to me I still end up feeling on the just because I feel like it could be so much better if just the sound were more awesome most definitely look out for this guy I think this guy is a ton of potential if you were to get a recording setup or something that was definitely a little bit more expensive than what he's working with now he could do some real damage père ubu lady from Shanghai classic post-punk outfit right here some great fantastic records under their belt but this new album to me just really kind of felt like a mixed bag of quality and sound but still all of the weird eccentricity you would expect from para whoo boo to me overall this LP kind of feels like when I'm listening to a Mission of Burma album in a sense like all the weirdness and all the character and all the personality is still there they have not let go of that for a second but it still feels like there's something missing there whether it's the sound or whether it's the songwriting I mean the weirdness is still there which kind of keeps me hooked in and listening to see if I'll find something that I really had them kind of loving but it just does not occur the joy formidable the joy for mid-table Wolf's law I mean this album is pretty much just like standard indie rock flowery blossoming pop hooks with sort of slightly kind of a shoegaze direction coming from the explosive courses which are typically layered with lots of not weird but definitely guitar sounds I feel like shoegaze and especially Noise Pop kind of come with an element of experimentation or adventure as far as that goes the joy formidable does not bring that at all I mean I feel like what experimentation they do have on this album and all their albums really is just very light very kind of cursory they've always been a band that has favored poppy accessibility over just sort of straightforward weird adventure I feel like they continue with that pattern on this new LP I would actually say on this album especially those elements of Noise Pop and shoegaze are very very faint very faint to the point where they're nearly non-existent at some points I mean on this thing you're getting some strong drums straightforward guitar riffing and chords female vocals a bit of sound craft it's really just honestly not retching my personal itches and that's it and the new widow's peak album Almanac I mean this is dreamy captured tracks records flavored indie rock right here with maybe a little bit of a full element female vocals it's fine for sure melodies are there these guys do have a dreamy sound that a lot of people love that appeals to a lot of people but for me typically this kind of stuff is just not lively enough to kind of keep me interested to keep me engaged not lively enough not dense enough not active enough I guess you could say but still if you're looking for that kind of sound check this out and the new Maserati LP Maserati 7 VII again on this LP with Maserati you're getting tight instrumental rock grooves with sort of a tangerine dream appreciation right there hanging in the background lots of keys effects guitars a little bit of vocoder too on one track and the band has admirably bounced back from the untimely death of their drummer Jerry you know who unfortunately passed but you know like I said admirably and surprisingly they've been able to kind of keep this hard driving very groove oriented rock sound with a new drummer bringing all those aspects that people have come to love in their music but not really kind of overreaching them or anything like that I feel like they do attempt that with some longer material on this LP but still it just feels like two in lockstep with everything else that they've done to really kind of keep me interested for the duration of a whole album or just you know making me feel like there's something to report in a full-length review and finally the Casey Veggies album life changes this dude is a California rapper this is his latest mixtape I first heard of this guy who the full-length sleeping in class as well as his appearance on taya the creators bastard and everything I've heard from this dude so far has just made me feel like he's kind of like an average rapper and this LP or this mixtape rather this new mixtape makes me feel the same exact way I mean there's just really no change and technical ability or message or I guess just sort of artistic growth from Casey Veggies on this new thing I mean for sure he is smooth you know he definitely puts together some Pleasant sweet kind of I guess in a way sort of friendly modern and contemporary hip hop instrumentals but there's nothing about the way he raps or the sound of his voice that comes out and grabs me that makes me want to pay attention to anything he's saying and when I do pay attention to what he's saying as far as messages go he doesn't really say anything that really interests me or anything that is radical or funny or all that clever or insightful or anything like that I mean he just is kind of like a bare-bones just kind of saying what is kind of in vogue right now rapper without any real kind of definition or personality or anything kind of developed or made up to separate himself from the mess of other datpiff rappers out there right now kind of uploading mixtapes onto the internet for sure this mixtape is likable it's passable but it's in no way bold or memorable or anything like that in my opinion I do think Casey Veggies has potential he's got flow he has in here for you know what new instrumentals are and what's popular and stuff like that but I don't really feel like he is concentrated enough on hammering out his own kind of narrative or anything like that especially with tracks they have such mindless pointless choruses like she's in my car so yeah that's that's how I feel about all those things thank you for watching Anthony Fantana quickies reviews forever 
Ae_FCKsjPzQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and for many many times many many many videos this is going to be raw no editing here for many videos I would come to you guys and sit in front my record collection and just say hey I got this record here I got this record hey I got this record two heats kicking on and you know that was all well and good but there came a time at which I reached I guess sort of the end of my record collection and I could no longer go through my record collection in alphabetical order but of course over the course of doing these videos I bought new records and you know I I'm sure from here on out I will continue to buy records I mean that's kind of the point of having a record collection right I mean you add to it I guess so basically what I'll be doing you know occasionally is kind of just talking about either recent finds or things that I picked up and add it to my collection or just records that have somehow made it into my collection and yeah that'll that'll be about it and also Mike C town I see you I see you're doing vinyl videos I see it I see it and good job I mean you know it looks fun I mean I totally

bought me this record very nice of him to do so it's a great pressing and you know not really too much to say in terms of packaging I mean you know that a that post-punk sound it sounds great on record and this a little bit of Albemarle here sort of giving you a you know a bit of a background in terms of a personnel and you know a very young man tied up here and sort of you know looks kind of kinky we're gonna move away just in case anyone's uncomfortable all right let's uh let's continue up a bit double LP here of a tribe called quest's the low-end theory if you're a hip-hop fan and you haven't even heard this record man man where are you man where are you but anyway classic thought-provoking awesomely produced New York hip hop from back in the day great fantastic it's a reissue but

extra copy sent me it uh he sent me this copy yeah the covers a little beat up but the records play fantastically and you know if you're looking for some minimal electronic music that sort of pulsates and progresses interestingly and is very engaging you know mentally stimulating then for sure get into this record I mean you know for those of you who loved our IP but didn't exactly maybe check this album at or something like that you know I do like the lengths at which the songs play on this record I do like the time that actress gives these tracks to kind of progress I do enjoy the sound craft on our IP you know Soundcraft on that record is just as great if maybe not a little more experimental than on actress but I still prefer you know the length and just kind of how I can get lost easily in in the songs on on splash if you know that I pronounced it alright next record anthrax among the living a great fresh metal record if you're looking to get in the thrash metal this particular anthrax release is definitely not a bad place to start I mean great riffs catchy as hell and great sound great freaking mix on this record I mean right from the first track the guitar chords are heavy

just got that freaking bad bad not good record I'm excited to play that to listen to that next something that somebody pointed out saying anthem and I remember this record from your record collection videos well that's true because I bought this after I started my record collection videos I've had this album digital for a long time and have always loved it and enjoyed it and you know of course when I ran across it in the record store I just had to be like oh hey battles mirror fantastic freakin record if you know you love just really intensely played instrumental rock but of course you know with the band's former vocalist still being a member of the group on this album of course you know it's not completely instrumental unlike many tracks on gloss drop are but still you know still for the the keyboards the guitars the drums just the jamming the energy that battles pulls together when they play is alive and awesome on this record as it is on gloss drop but I love the packaging on this thing and I love how just consistent it is with just sort of the style that they pulled together with the packaging on lost drop I mean the yellow the yellow I mean the records are black but you know still the awesome insert that it comes with you know to sort of a bigger feature of the of the album art you know just the the sticking with one color and kind of like you know following through with that I love that you know it's yellow on the inside of the the sleeve as well nice nice and congruent you know it's a maybe battles has kind of like an OCD sort of quality to to their record packaging that uh that you know I do not fault them for I I celebrate it I celebrate it and I appreciate it because it makes owning collecting pretty sweet all right let's continue a reissue of black flags my war nothing really amazing about the packaging or anything but my fear black flag album you know one of their more adventurous albums in my opinion and you know it has some of my favorite tracks on here including my war you know if you're looking for some 80s hardcore punk you know I like this record for its diversity you know had so much more diversity than a damaged which which is a fine record I just prefer my war that's all and let's continue black moon if you're looking for more classic 90s New York hip hop this is another record to listen to for sure look up this album into the stage if you're just looking for some hard-hitting rhymes with some cunning linguistics then look up this album make money make money money make money money I'm sure a lot of you have heard that song before alright Black Moon enter the stage alright continuing a Danny Brown picture disc the oak oh no timer done we're going to continue we're gonna we're gonna we're continue we're going to finish this off oh no not dropping Danny Brown the OD EP featuring such track says win it shouldn't have baseline tracks that were featured on the I believe the iTunes reissue of xxx and the instrumental versions of these tracks as well a neat little picture disc a little picture disc alright which I also mentioned in my favorite EPS of 2012 list alright I remember I picked this up at a recent record show for a few bucks Kate Bush hounds of love fantastic record fantastic art pop record if you're looking to get into Kate Bush a lot of accessible awesome songs on this album that are you know not only easy to get into but just you know all around enjoyable and that with a really nice 80s chic to them so Kate Bush hounds of love not a rarity but a goodie but I will say that this this next one may be sort of a rarity they become one the good people at yours truly and Adidas who pulled together some of those I guess songs from scratch sessions this past year with artists like Danny Brown and Joey badass have thrown together a recent seven-inch which they sent to some people for free including me um you know with really you know no warning whatsoever you know I didn't know they were going to be sending me this they just sort of sent me this is sort of a according to the card that was sent with it just sort of as a pre Shi ation for supporting the project posting the videos and you know just enjoying the songs that were released and on the 7-inch that they put out side one the Danny Brown and Arab music track molly ringwald and on the other side Joey badass daily routine I'm not 100% sure if this is or is ever going to be available for sale online I've seen some copies available on Joey badasses site but I'm not sure if it's going to be more widely available than that but they put together a really nice vinyl package on this um I'm like afraid to play this because they did such a damn good job with it but yeah everything from the cover detail to the sleeve with the message on it it's really nice I mean they pull together a great thing I you know thank them highly for for pulling this together alright that's it that is a this vinyl update for now there will be more records to come when more records come into my collection which there are some more in there now but you know we'll talk about that at another time and date and that's it thanks for watching Anthony Fantino vinyl [Music] [Music] 
5WPD-GvKG3w,hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review yeah Buchan case general dome you can gaze is a musical duo from New York I believe this is their second full-length LP and I will most sure for certainly definitely yeah be the first to admit that for quite a while I mean I guess since their debut LP I've always kind of dismissed this project not publicly but you know sort of personally thinking that maybe they were a little too enthralled with their homemade instruments to the point where they would name their musical project after them that sort of thing just kind of screams the word gimmick to me and despite the fact that they may have been able to conjure some semi unique sounds with the instruments that they made you know ultimately the question comes up is there as much attention being paid toward the music and the songwriting that was my perception that was sort of my attitude toward their first album but I gave this new LP of there's an honest-to-god shot and was pleasantly surprised because I think what I ended up finding on this LP was a lot of improvement and just a lot of appeal for one the production the sound the overall sound recording on this LP is is loads better no longer does buchen case sound I guess as tattered and sort of worn as their homemade setup is kind of strung together with maybe a little bit of tape some screws and some daisy-chained effects pedals and what's kind of come through in the process of maybe me giving them a better try and just hearing a better recording is that these guys have essentially kind of revealed themselves as being a pretty unique and interesting noise pop project they just have this really strong sense of eccentricity a penchant for kind of very strange angular melodies a lot like Deerhoof maybe not in the same exact way but the way that they write melodies the way they just come out so sharp there are also moments where just the tone and the dissonance and just the strain the chaos kind of reminds me of like Mika Chu in the shapes without the British swagger or sort of post-punk influence and there are other moments on here where I'm sort of feeling a really strong Dirty Projectors kind of vibe coming especially from the guitar riffs and and lines and melodies there isn't really kind of that virtuous flash from the playing that you would usually get on a Dirty Projectors record but the melodies and just the writing on on this album are no less dizzying and and maze-like buchen cases kind of idiosyncratic approach toward writing melodies and and structuring songs with kind of one phase after another but yet it all kind of comes together in verses and choruses is so damn impenetrable and yet it's so kind of odd and and just sharp sounding overall that I can't help but pay attention to it it is attention demanding beside for maybe like the soft interlude in the middle of contortion and training very little about this LP actually comes off as being smooth one track after another you're getting all these staccato guitar riffs and and leads that sort of hammer away mechanically right underneath Aaron dyers I'll use this word again very sharp sharp feminine voice it's got a nice twang to it I guess not a southern twang but it's like you know got a really kind of it just kind of hangs in this certain pitch range that again a lot like the guitars is just kind of sitting in this register where you can't help but pay attention to it it is like onion freakin normal enig normal which may be annoying to some people especially if they're kind of maybe looking for music that will help them chill out relax this is very much not in that mood to me this new buchen gas LP instead is is more like an imaginative crossroad between sort of like the hard-hitting and just straight rigid sounds of industrial combined with just stomping hollering hootenanny party attitude especially on the track pickup which has all these kind of thumping drums on it a lot of dissonant background guitar plays some Basie and patient guitarrists which are just kind of laying a nice solid rhythmic foundation des have a very kind of grinding just sandpaper rough quality to them you can gaze definitely conjure up a very dense array of sounds for just two people with you know some homemade instruments the title track on this thing is just guitar noises upon guitar noises with ass down on the riff and over that are all these weird leads and just kind of freak outs and when they kind of kick in with these thick scrum cords that are just so freakin dissonant on top of this it's like this downward spiral into just sour tones there are these swaths of just chromatically ascending guitar leaves on the track twisting the lasso of truth which totally earns its freakin title and it just feels like this insanely maniacal take on like circus music however my one issue with the track is that it doesn't really develop past the climax of this one really good musical idea that it presents and there are a few other tracks on here like the closing track two that do kind of feel like that like buchen gates are more interested in kind of doing this weird experiment than they are actually kind of crafting song but most of the time on this album in their own weird little way buchen gates are bringing some catchy melodic weirdly melodic verse chorus verse tracks that kind of sound like an old airplane engine on its last leg topped with guitar leads they're just kind of burn their way into my eardrums mainly on the track hard times now there is a nice sense of variety among these tracks they don't really get that kind of album arc or just sort of an obvious progression or anything like that especially with two strangely placed interlude tracks but like I said there are differences and I guess sort of feel among these songs there are slower tracks faster tracks denser tracks more sparse tracks louder softer but nothing on here purely comes off is sweet straightforward or basic which is you know also praise but I guess kind of warning as well for those who may be looking for that kind of thing because as fun as this album is to listen to for me I will admit that to an extent it does sound kind of say me say me with the errands kind of relying on you know their same instruments over and over I mean rarely do they kind of break out of the I guess sort of ritual of relying on their buek and gates to make these songs kind of work but you know I guess you would figure considering in the name of the group there are moments where keyboards kind of come in maybe a few gentler guitar tones there's even a spot on here that really sticks out because it's got auto-tune on it but you know it's not really in the way you usually kind of see auto-tune getting used these guys take an eccentric approach toward executing with that just like they do the guitar and bass so even though this album is a little bit of a gauntlet at a kind of short 42 minutes I did love listening to it it is just an odd gift it's a fun puzzle it's catchy yet challenging it's a friendly conundrum it is a joyous racket I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this album if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Buchan case forever 
CYCHwDRCm2I,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd looking a little crazy and it's time for a review the new self-titled LP from c'mon c'mon c'mon these guys are a Bay Area punk band that has been at it for about ten years at this point and they've got a load of LPS as well as some EPS and splits to show for it and the band's progression over the years hasn't really been a radical one or anything like that they pretty much this whole time have been fine tuning their vibrant combination of hardcore punk and screamo with a bit of an eccentric flair coming from their melodies and their background vocals which at times can be kind of circle takes the square inspired and typically the band writes a decent amount of detail into their short overly emotional and kind of aggressive rock songs which I'm surprised hasn't really earned them more praise than they currently have over the course of their career in a way I'm not surprised because for a lot of screamo fans the genres heyday is kind of long gone at this point with bands like page 99 and envy and circle takes the square and gospel not really putting out genre-defining material anymore and screamo isn't exactly a genre that's been known for its innovation I mean it's it's pretty set in terms of stylistic elements mostly because of how extreme the genre tends to be still despite all of that baggage kumara actually presents a nice set of hooky melodic punk tunes that feature a lot of keys and fiery guitar leads a bit of piano and a little brass too I actually think that on this LP there may be just enough elements of harmony and melody to the point where this album could crossover with people who aren't necessarily fans of screamo music because there is a strong element of balladry on this new self-titled LP that wasn't exactly as present on the band's previous material it's like the band was able to bring their usual amount of ferocity to this album but they still ended up bringing a bunch of tracks that sound like they could have been hammered out on an acoustic guitar and then brought to the studio so since it's or at least you know kind of turned into acoustic songs and it's not like the concept or the idea of the song would be lost in the process but as far as stylistic elements that's pretty much this album in a nutshell as far as bands that this kind of reminds me of I mean just the punk anger yet the melody and the extreme vocals of this album really kind of reminds me of strangely enough of being like growler Talk of course there are a lot of recent albums on Death Wish records that have a strong post hardcore screamo vibe that are totally walking down the same path as this new LP and I wouldn't be surprised at all if these guys took maybe a little bit of influence from like early against me records in the process of writing this LP before I get into what I love about this album too deep I guess what I'll say my main issue is a lot of these more melodic elements that the band is bringing into these songs it's it's very clear that this is sort of a new aspect to their music or a newer aspect a still-developing aspect their songs out here they have about like quality but sometimes get cut a little short maybe it's because the band is kind of you know ending things due to their Punk brevity that may be the case but I still end up kind of thirsting for more tracks like the moon which just has this rowdy infectious Fulk punk inspired energy to it that feels like the the sweat and the energy of a thousand basement shows or it could have felt that way before it kind of ended up ducking out and just not really developing past a verse and a chorus and it just ends up kind of feeling like maybe one basement show with a semi awkward cliffhanger the song dragged blood brings a hornet to the mix but it just kind of lazily hangs or these distorted guitar chords and the verses like a really unwanted smog cloud it just plays like this kind of boring ascending and descending melody that only consists of a handful of notes and it's really not that fiery or passionate in terms of performance it doesn't really add any real drama to the track - like the end of the song really and there are a few other spots on this LP where keyboards are just kind of applied very weakly as well even though I do have some issues with several songs on here they don't exactly ruin the tracks for me just maybe make them slightly underwhelming because even outside of this extra instrumentation the guitars the vocals the drums I mean all of that is really well performed energetic just enthralling there may be some downs on this LP but when the band hits the mark on this freaking album they hit it like I don't know a monster truck a monster truck host a monster truck the single on this LP coldrain with its syncopated guitar and drum hits as well as its guitar leads is really anthemic and between the bass the guitars the drums the vocals when all of them come together and like lock into a riff and a groove there's just so much power and energy and thrust thrust thrust thrust I mean that's that's yeah that's a nice thing this album has going for it that's also but what I love about the track must be nice the song starts off with these clean deeper vocals which are okay but a really awesome contrast to the screams that are you know most prominent throughout this entire LP and when the electric guitars and the beast finally kick in with full force and volume the song just speeds off just grabbing me and pulling me along with it and the quickly downstroke guitar chords I mean this track is sort of like a pop punk song on screamo steroids I love the song king worm with this really kind of funky upstroke guitar groove and the way that the organ is is applied in this track really adds a nice touch too and the untitled instrumental track which is pretty uplifting is a nice song in here as well it really kind of develops blossoms really nicely and shows that the band can write a really layered track that is just way more engaging musically melodically than some of the shorter and more aggressive and leaner songs on here overall there's a lot more that I on this LP that I find underwhelming like I said some of the extra instrumentation does feel more ornamental than it does I guess feel like a vital part of what these songs are doing and on top of that I will say that coma Bros is most definitely not reinventing the wheel when it comes to screamo or anything like that these guys definitely make up for that with just straightforward great catchy instantaneously memorable songs that have a lot of replay value to them in my opinion they bring quite a bit of variety to all these tracks and this album actually has a pretty nice arc to it as well I do really feel like I'm traveling through a well-conceived album as I listen to this thing from beginning to end and did I mention that this LP does all of these things just around the 28 minute mark so yeah really really enjoyed listening to this loved listening to it I think I will most likely end up returning to it before the years out I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana go mad forever you 
XRYppTnvr7g,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review this town needs guns or most recently shortened to TT and g13 point zero point zero zero zero obviously the title and the cover from this album are a reference to the Mayan calendar and the sort of shift we've made into a new era according to this calendar and you know we were all freaked out about the world's can end [Music] these guys are a rock outfit hailing from the UK this is their sophomore full-length LP and one of math rocks more emotional and indie rock flavored bands an also a group that has had quite a bit of turbulence over the course of their musical career over the years the band has gone through at least half a dozen different members some of them even leaving the group before they were actually able to put out their first full-length LP and with this new LP this town needs guns or TT and G is actually premiering a new singer Henry Tremaine and even though all this change has kind of gone on with the band's ranks it hasn't really affected focus or progression I guess you could say because right now the group is kind of with with this LP settled into this combination of song structures written with that straightforward modern accessible indie rock Sensibility along with a lot of math rock guitar phrasing and drumming and there is a bit of emo influence on the side with many of the songs on this LP as well which really really influenced not only the melody writing but sort of the personality of the vocals as well there might also be a bit of a sort of slick mainstream alternative rock vibe going on with some of the tracks here as well there is definitely an avoidance of aggression and abrasion on this LP which really does kind of turn some people off too many underground rock bands the only sort of modern groups that I could think to instantly compare these guys to are bands like I guess sort of maps and allyce's which also combine elements of math rock with indie rock however I don't really find maps and atlases songwriting to be all that kind of sharp or or memorable I could compare these guys to a group maybe like - the Bears well although I've never really been a huge - the bear fan either in my opinion what can be so enjoyable about TT ng on this LP is that they're enjoyability comes pretty easy despite a pretty obvious technical bleurgh the difficult to execute guitar work is here on many songs on this album but it doesn't really impede the emotion of the track right from the start of this LP with the song cat fantastic this town needs guns brings with Henry charm Ian's vocals this very sort of lazily whimper a slow singing vocal that even though I kind of use those adjectives they're not really fantastic adjectives it's sort of a captivating singing voice the vocals really have kind of a sweet modern melody to them especially when the band breaks into this slow down area of the track where all these guitar arpeggios hit and it feels like the chords are descending but yet ascending really quickly it's an awesome just top-notch stellar chord progression on this part of the track the time signature is kind of off kilter the segues in between the portions of this track are great the grooves are nice this track is well executed it's loaded with musical details I actually have kind of a strange attraction to a lot of the vocal melodies on this LP I don't exactly think Henry is maybe as weird or maybe as I guess sort of standout a vocalist as TTM geez last singer but he is a smoother singer I do think he has kind of a wider appeal with his voice Henry has a tendency to sing at a much slower pace than these sort of very busy and complex guitars and drums kind of hacking away at all these interesting ideas underneath him and it kind of gives the listener the opportunity to listen to the song at two different paces it's sort of like the vocals and the the guitars and drums are sort of in their own little worlds and yet they are so tight and they are so together and they complement each other so well a lot of the songs on the first half of this LP are pretty good I don't think the album falters until the band starts introducing these kind of short interlude segue tracks that are too short to really kind of leave an impact of their own and yet don't really bring the album into any new phases or sections or anything like that after these segue tracks are basically tracks that sound like the tracks you heard before the Segway tracks I'm not sure if TT mg is trying to distract away from that by throwing in these short little bits that are either acoustic or maybe have a little bit of piano or kind of have an electronic beat in them to kind of make it feel like there's some sort of diversity but the album doesn't really change gears in any significant way until the track two birds one stone which is an acoustic song and a beautifully awesome one but the track isn't really all that well developed when compared to other songs here and the song honest-to-god spends an entire minute fading out the rest of the LP is pretty nice it doesn't really actually kind of grab my attention in any significant way until the track plus three awesomeness repels water on which the band is actually jamming really hard on a pretty nice groove I love the way that these guys can just intricately layer guitars and drums and with just so little instrumentation just makes so much sound and just keep it kind of sweet keep it enjoyable and just intoxicatingly relaxing which I think in a nutshell kind of describes this LP I'm feeling a strong six to a life seven on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana this town needs guns dirty T and G forever [Music] [Music] 
spFbZHM9pjY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new no such thing record home no no such thing such a thing no such thing is the pseudonym of West Coast electronic music producer Jason Chung a sophomore LP that has been pretty anticipated thanks to the work that Jason put into his semi breakout debut album drift which came out in 2009 now this guy does make electronic music but he's a beat meister as well he's a guy whose productions showcased quite a bit of hip hop influence on many tracks from drift the beats and the grooves are there but there are no MCS on this LP and it's not really a hard-hitting or edgy album either the sounds on here shoot for a much more atmospheric kind of glassy feel especially with the synthesizer work and there's a bit of a glitchy quality to the rhythms and the sense on some songs as well and there are some weird kind of experimental sounds on this thing too like the overuse of compression on some of the beats here which kind of ends up making the kick drums kind of seem like a black hole a sonic black hole that sort of when they hit they suck up every sound around them mm which is sort of a technique I've heard applied by other artists that have made glitch hop and and wonky albums like old Flying Lotus work or like baths other artists from the brain feeder collective and even some chill wave acts like Toro y Moi with the LP causers of this and surprisingly Toro y Moi actually makes a vocal appearance on this new LP and blonde redheads kazuma Tino actually makes a vocal appearance too on the second track here there is definitely evidence of Jason sort of capitalizing on the attention and success that he's had with drift in bringing in these guest artists and even though the successive drift does translate into some interesting collaborations on home the success doesn't really seem to kind of peter out into anything else on this new LP for the this part I guess Jason tries to make home a success merely on the back of his stylistic progression as an artist since the release of drift and he does make a pretty apparent change on this new LP which is kind of a surprise considering just how many people who are fans of hip hop kind of gravitated toward his music as glitch hoppin and wonky were kind of burgeoning genres in 2009 III on this new LP the hip hop influence is here in a few moments but it's not really as strong or as potent as it used to be he's not really fussing around with the distorted bass sounds or just sort of the hip-hop style rhythms and poly rhythms that you would layer on top of each other on track after track and in a way I guess this is a positive because it does make no such thing a little more difficult to quickly compare the Flying Lotus which is sort of an issue that a live artists suffer from in these glitch hop and wonky genres what keeps this album feeling like a project from Jason Chung even though there is sort of a stylistic change is that he is still working with a lot of sort of and being quaint and sort of shy sounds I actually feel a lot of influence from a guy like new trapeze in his productions especially the more hip-hop influenced ones but with a much more electronic direction as opposed to kind of like a jazz influence now this very calming kind of quality to know such things music is consistent throughout this new LP whether he is kind of fooling around and sort of glitchy and familiar territory with the song snap or bringing on guest vocalists or kind of toying a little bit with the sounds and rhythms of to step with a few songs on here most notably the track tell but even so I gotta say I think because of the hip-hop influence just the the stranger and more experimental colors drift is gonna come out the favor for people who have kind of listened up until this point especially since it for a lot of people was the first album from this project that they heard I actually think the lack of a hip-hop vibe on this new LP sort of subtracts what little edge no such thing had so far in the projects short career because a lot of songs on here without these hip-hop beats sort of pulsate along very apathetically and end at very inconspicuous song lengths and just continue with kind of uninspired progressions for sure Jason chung is making a very noticeable embrace of his ambient influences on this LP or at least that's what it kind of feels like I'm tracks like distance which has these tender kind of ringing synth tones murky bass and these reverb synth riffs and with like a little bit of added sound it kind of feels like an electronic ode to an abandoned subway tunnel again it sort of has that quaint quality that I think comes so easily from this projects music but it's not really anything I would replay the song safe shuffles along really serenely it's got a very kind of nocturnal robotic lullaby kind of quality to the synthesizers and with these vocal samples kind of hanging in the background very faintly it's a sweet track but it doesn't really pull that much from me emotionally and the song glue is a little bit more interesting for me rhythmically it's got that future garage kind of feel to it that I said that Jason kind of toys with a little bit on this album along with the song tell and it's sort of as if he wanted his fans to hear this kind of shift in his production style because these songs are noticeably louder than many other tracks here but there are spots on here that do feel familiar for no such thing but I just kind of feel like the sounds weren't crafted to be all that interesting which is surprised because a lot of the sounds were pretty good on drift the tracks snap which has a hip-hop influence to it rhythmically is actually pretty flat and bland when it comes to the sounds of the rhythm the beat is just really kind of colorless I guess and I do not get the sloppily placed high hats and claps on the song try either that just does not do anything for me and beyond that I'm not really sure if I'm feeling the auto-tune vocals of Toro y Moi either overall I'm feeling kind of indifferent on this elf sadly I still like drift and and I still think that album stands as a pretty good release in genre that at the time was making a lot of noise and was an extremely interesting and new and vibrant thing but this new album unfortunately is is pleasant for sure but nowhere near memorable I'm feeling a decent 5 on this LP but if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana home forever 
FgYUNnepnzE,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review cult of luna vertical vertical bow cult of luna is a swedish atmospheric sludge metal outfit that has been putting out albums since the early 2000s and even though they didn't develop the style as early as bands like neurosis did they are still considered you know in the pantheon of great atmospheric sludge metal acts like Pelican and Isis typically bands in this genre have a pretty moderate amount of heaviness to their sound maybe they're not quite as bass E or saturated as their more due metal counterparts such as Earth or electric wizard Candlemas Mya dying bride Saint Vitus but it can't be said that bands like cult of luna do like to dip their toes into doom territory when they see fit cult of luna is definitely not all about thickness and heaviness and just massive riffs there's quite a bit of melody in the songs that the band puts together through very harmonious chords very standout guitar leads and on this particular album keyboards a lot of musical listeners actually compared a lot of the guitar tones that these guys use as well as the progressions and the melodies and the chords to that of post rock bands so it's no surprise that a lot of bands in this genre admit a post-rock influence some listeners go as far as to label bands like Isis and and Russian Circles and Colton has just post-metal because of how prevalent the post rock influence is I can absolutely understand if somebody kind of sees all this labeling is sort of like hair-splitting but you know I will say that though cult of Luna does have those spacious atmospheric sounds those heavily treated and effect heavy guitar melodies there is a very strong metal influence in what they do they're undeniably a metal band no matter how atmospheric or experimental they get but while they are a metal band they are not we'll be in that write songs that rock as much as they do slowly beautifully mournfully and sometimes apocalyptically progress and develop now these guys have written a couple great standout albums in this genre over the years like 2004 salvation and 2006 is somewhere along the highway but the group has been kind of continuously haunted by comparisons to things that Isis has already done and I gotta say overall with vertical it doesn't really seem that the band is making any impressive attempts to kind of break out of these post metal boundaries anytime soon even with some very obvious trying through electronics and and writing their longest song yet the LP starts off pretty decently after a very inconspicuous and being introduction with the song I the weapon or or or or the riff kicks in pretty quick the vocals are there the drums and bass are there I mean they are just going full force as this song begins but honestly it wears pretty thin pretty quickly for me I mean these guys definitely have their sounds in order that awesome background vocal that's like oh the guitar tones are heavy the base is really distorted and muddy the drums sound sharp I love the width they're kind of shuffling along switching between a slower pace and a faster pace the guitar leads are really whaling on this track as well but it just feels so stagnant the thing is is that the band just kind of shifts through these different modes of the same riff like various instruments will sort of you know take precedent or sort of steal the spotlight for a little bit over the same sort of monotonous not that impressive to begin with riff the ending of the song really kind of breaks things down and changes them into something else it's a pretty spot in the song and overall I liked the track I guess the the pacing and the groove was cool and like I already said the sounds are great I just wish the detail was there that I've heard and loved in previous cults of lunar releases again the song is OK but the album just gets more boring as it moves on because a lot of the louder spots function on the same same ideas and the quieter moments are just not as interesting or as dark as I think the band is shooting for like the track vicarious Redemption which is about 19 minutes it has this kind of do-nothing intro and as soon as the riff pops in it's it's really just kind of an inconspicuous riff when the vocals pop in they're just like the same vocals kind of screaming at the same pace with the same kind of intensity with no real changes in emotion or anything like that and there's not really much detail in this song in the way of interesting sounds or guitar tones or effects I feel like they attempt to though but when they try to venture out of their comfort zone and it gets kind of awkward or even like laughable like in the middle of this really long track the band kind of sporadically breaks into a semi dance beat with these bass waves that kind of resemble that of a dubstep song not only does this completely obliterate whatever great things this song had going for it so far because most people are going to link that sound a dubstep but even so even if you're not really saying oh that's totally dubstep what they're doing right there what makes this part feel so awkward is that the electronics just sound pretty generic and and they're applied and played so haphazardly the song the sweep right after this track feels kind of like a rehash of what I had heard in the previous song but just done through this progressive epic synth sound but the synthesizers are just so mashed on top of each other so messily with these screaming vocals it sounds like this just very unappealing synth vocal soup the song was synchronicity and mute departure do kind of bring their own flavors to this album mute does have some clean singing on it synchronicity has a pretty awesome glassy sort of progressive synth leads soaring over the guitarists that I like a lot sounds like something that would kind of be in like a sci-fi film but both songs kind of suffer from the same issues that other tracks on here do they're just too unimaginative in terms of progression I think the only other song I liked in the back end of the selfie was the track in awe of and it's not exactly surprising in terms of sort of building a track or just sort of bringing from point A to point B but the band does bring a lot of energy on this track and as they kind of slowed down before they hit the middle point of the song and make things a bit quieter it does stay engaging and when they finally explode with some massively heavy riffs in the second half of the track it's really kind of the emotional highlight of the album beyond this there's just a closer where you are getting clean these song vocals but it's just such a desolate track in terms of interesting things to listen to the album really kind of fizzles out in the same way that it fizzled in I can definitely say that on this LP cult of Luna has not lost their sound they most definitely have that but I think that's sort of a blessing it occurs or search the band has kind of become stuck in this in a way because they're not really writing tracks with the same detail that they usually do and like I said when they try to apply something like electronics to a song it just becomes kind of a blunder I'm feeling a light five on this LP if you given this listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what should I review next and yeah that's it Anthony Fantana cult of luna forever 
w_6nx7DdFrc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and we're here to do some reviews with the quickness we have quite a few albums to get through but first let's talk about some songs and other stuff that have kind of dropped recently the band Lo has a new LP on the way in March they have dropped a track two T's toward that title just make it stop a really awesome slow building and very kind of intense indie rock tune with some really awesome vocal harmonies and just a great melody catchy mantra to it very emotional track loving it Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have dropped a another track from their forthcoming LP this one is titled Jubilee Street it's actually pretty great tuna a little more lively than the previous song that they dropped I'm loving the narrative on this song the darkness push the sky away is certainly shaping up to be well they keep in the Bad Seeds album mm10 mode counterculture complex if you're looking for just some really intense heavy music then get into this new track get into this new track it is so busy so detailed so freaking blowing my mind also four tet has a new album slash compilation out right now it's a group of songs sketches sort of b-sides that were formulated from the late 90s to i believe about 2001 a lot of stuff on there that sounds like it could have been on his earlier albums such as rounds some really interesting ideas but but still for me not really completely enthralling but there is a stream of this LP slash compilation up right now on soundcloud Deltron 3030 yes famed hip hop trio Deltron has a new album on the way titled event 2 should be coming out this year dan freakin del the funky homosapien as well as Kid Koala and the song that they have dropped to kind of tease toward the album titled pay the price is pretty decent I think the only thing that sticks in the track to me are really the lyrics where Dell is kind of telling this story where he's in sort of a this allegorical society where he's talking about just all these things that I feel like to him sort of foreshadow its social its political and because of his rap style it's just got a lot of personality to it Raekwon the chef has a new EP out called lost jewelry find a link for that in the description box check that out the band darkstar on Warp Records has a full stream of their new LP right now give that a listen also there is a compilation of artists from my home state of Connecticut called Nutmeg State of Mind you can listen to a lot of great artists from my area and all the proceeds from this compilation which I believe is just two dollars go toward an American mental health nonprofit sort of in response to the recent tragedy in a town local to mean Newtown slomo has a new track out called later I freaking love this track he's got a new EP on the way as well to sort of follow this track and it is awesome atmospheric trap influenced and a really just moving vocal sample a lot of distortion on there it's beauty fall it's a gorgeous freakin track I am loving watching this guy progress production-wise I think he's just got a lot of Flair a lot of creativity a lot of versatility and I think he's gonna kill it on this EP fingers crossed pens in the way also factory floor has a new track out post-punk minimal wave synth Punk it's a single coming out on DFA records the song is called fall back and with some really weird vocals some sequence synthesizers and some really tight dance drumbeats it's just a fantastic track for about eight or so minutes it's weird it's sort of out there with especially with all the mumbling vocals but I love it Oh oh it just makes you wanna dance and finally a lot of people have been asking me about the new Justin Timberlake track suit and tie featuring jay-z don't like it don't like it at all don't you want to touch it I could barely get past the intro to this track horrible intro I mean garbage II trashy bad intro all of the messily mashed on top of each other vocals some of which might be pitch shift I'm not sure but they all sound like garbage and then as the song progresses what sample is in this track is that a piano kind of running up and down on the keys look it's incessantly annoying and Justin with his baby voice and this instrumental together it sounds like a JCPenney commercial I can't even stand it and jay-z especially the first few bars of the verse that he throws on there one of his most thrown-together verses I've ever heard in his entire career I can't even believe that Justin Timberlake would even think to put out the track this mediocre rah rah riot beta luv surprisingly sweet sweet new LP from this band I mean basically all of the indie synth pop jams that you can handle rah rah riot brings their usual brand of just very tight playing type performance but it does kind of sound like across the LP that they were highly influenced by like the new Passion Pit album during the writing process of this album or at least the the production slash recording process next the new mystical weapons album self-titled this is a project brought together by Gregg drummer from Deerhoof and none other than Sean Lennon it's an indulgent strange sort of all over the place colorful psychedelic rock record that's got a lot of jams on it drums guitars keyboards it's weird and in short at about 36 minutes but far from being jaw-dropping I would say that this is likable but certainly kind of just for the fans next it dog life's a risk that is what the name fit lar stands for they've got a new self-titled LP out that some people have been raving over shoving in my face and yeah you know I got to say it's just alright for me basically this is just like some coked up cheap beer-swilling california garage punk and you know the appeal of this record does not run that deep if you thought the band natural child was like a Black Lips offshoot then Fiddler's is Black Lips clones it's like episode 2 Attack of the Clones there are some catchy songs on here overall this LP does feel like a really kind of dirty filthy grimy party but for me personally it just kind of gets really old really quick I like the energy but what makes this LP feel so old is that the riffs are so generic the hooks are so bland and all the song subjects are pretty predictable very shallow just a lot of trebled guitars a lot of reverb a lot of group vocals a little bit of surf rock nostalgia moustaches stubble sweaty t-shirts the new Chris Owens LP the zone which I believe in Greek means to free a boy or a man which is a telling title for Chris Owens first solo record kind of bringing himself past that point his musical career where he was working with girls girls being the California band whose debut LP I absolutely loved actually still love still go head over heels for but for me personally it's just been all downhill from there you know Chris Owens definitely brought some great songs had very funny very charismatic vocals but Chet white who played bass in the band also did production did recording as well and without white they're just Chris Owens by himself and you know whichever production he happens to be working with he's just so unbearably cheesy they're spots on this LP especially the track New York City that sound just like a children's song there's not really all too much I like about it even the kind of ska slash reggae influenced era Iraq there are a lot of very Sammy Sammy melodies on here in court progressions which Chris Owens has done before in girls you know has written songs around similar melodies and and all that but without the diverse production that is also tasteful to kind of be underneath these songs the magic just is not there I do get that the album does have a progression to it it tells a personal story of Chris's life when he was in girls but I'm just not really liking the music I mean you can surely be a fan of Chris be a fan of this album for the very kind of intimate or E it tells but musically sonically it's just not for me free energy love sign this is basically some really high fructose power pop that it's got a lot of slick modern production cowbell handclaps vocal harmonies the songs are okay they're very hooky they're very kind of catchy but maybe a little bland at times for me this kind of feels like a slightly more modernized take on like new wave rock bands such as the cars the new faulty DLL hard courage this guy is a New York electronic music producer who for his past few LPS has dabbled in some of the trendier sounds an electronic music like future garage and 2-step and on this new LP he continues down that path of diversity it's really admirable especially on songs here where he kind of delves into an atmospheric reinterpretation of trap music or the opening track on here which has kind of like some eighties chic to it or the track finally some which has sort of a jazzy quality to it however overall in this LP I just feel like it's lacking a bit of interesting progression when it comes to the sequencing of the electronics and even though faulty DL is great at just kind of mmm emulating a number of different electronic music styles still the sound craft is is not quite there that's consistently been an issue that I've had on his LPS while yeah it's awesome to get all of this kind of genre hopping on one album the sounds to me are just really kind of flat they're kind of boring the sort of run in the mill and finally Pantha do prints as well as the bell laboratory with the LP elements of light panther do prints awesome micro house and tech house producer albums such as this bliss black noise great releases his songs are infamous for having great progressions very interesting sound craft especially a lot of weird atmospheric metallic tones in them so it's only fitting that he would bring on a bunch of Bell players to make a new album and certainly all of these Bell players has brought a new dynamic of performance to Pantha to Prince's music especially during really the first eight minutes of this album are you're pretty much just hearing these bells and it's a really rich sound that this album has to it too very kind of dense at times with layers upon layers of bells and this of course is infused with pan tha's usual minimal beadwork and these two elements fuse together pretty nicely the thing is is that I feel like stylistically the way Pantha kind of constructs a track or is at least constructed these tracks there's not really much to praise about them other than the incorporation of these bells but still I thought it was a likable album for Pantha new prints and yeah that's that's pretty much how I feel about all of this this new musical material thanks for watching Anthony Fantino quickies forever 
K27cGZKlxJo,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review villagers away land villagers is the musical project of singer songwriter and guitarist Connor J O'Brien whose music early in the inception of villagers moved me quite a bit in 2009 through the hollow kind EP on the CP it's just a nice handful of downtrodden songs of sadness tracks like the meaning of the ritual and then pieces certainly showcased a huge bright eyes slash Elliott Smith influence they are songs that O'Brien strung together shortly after the demise of his previous band the immediate I hadn't heard anything from the band in a little while and then the announcement came that in 2010 villagers would be signing on with Domino Records and releasing its first full-length LP the album which was eventually dropped was titled becoming a jackal it made it to number one on the Irish indie charts it was Mercury Prize nominated as well but still this full-length didn't really resonate with me in the same way that the EP that preceded it did the production was cleaner a lot of the songs on here were built up with with just slicker instrumentation but I felt like the the overall sound of villagers had become kind of sterile maybe a little neutered kind of predictable especially on reworked versions of older tracks on this new album such as the meaning of the ritual so I was going into this new sophomore LP hoping for more and I definitely feel like I got that for sure O'Brien makes some really clear and obvious attempts to kind of break or move away from that mole that his first album was cast in but the recipe may end up tasting maybe a little funny to people who have been hardcore fans of the very short progression that villager's has undergone so far O'Brien without a doubt is still a very captivating singer/songwriter with lyrics and a lot of emotion and and maybe for many fans that will be all that that truly matters at the end of the day but on this new LP with a lot of songs here there are a lot of electronics running in tandem with the usual mix of guitar bass drums and vocals in addition to the electronics I would say more pianos brass and strings too I think in general villager's is coming off way more ambitious in the studio with this release just take a listen to the hustling and bustling electronic tones at the beginning of the track the waves or the glitchy electronic sequenced percussion on the song earthly pleasure on top of this you're getting a lot of instances of just cascading horn arrangements that that swell and fall lots and lots of effects on some tracks villager's is definitely moving away from its kind of simple and humble beginnings with just a lot of sonic flash and while overall I didn't really end up loving this LP to death I do admire and much more than becoming a jackal not only are the songs really good the production is great but this LP is definitely the sound of a guy trying to just add a little bit of spark to his craft the song the waves which is one of the main promotional tracks that came out before this record and a great one that there's a lot of cute bubbly electronics at the start of this track with some moody guitar and vocals kind of coming up underneath it with some touches of piano as well that are really beautiful it's like all of these synthetic sounds are just sounding really kind of light and airy inand sweet on the ears while everything else is just kind of becoming more and more sour and I love the way that the vocals kind of speed up with intensity in the lyrics the way that they kind of hit rhythmically as O'Brien delivers them and I love the way this track just kind of moves and shifts and builds up from one section to another with just these subtle swells of piano organ and horns just before the chorus kind of kicks in there's a serious flow to the instrumentation all over this album whenever there are some arrangements involved they're so well played and so meticulously crafted as the waves continues the vocals just kind of fall backwards and kind of like a James Blake sort of way into this cavernous mountain of reverb as the electronics kind of get glitchy ER and then noisier it's just really apocalyptic huge ending and I like the way that villagers kind of builds up toward the end of the song The Grateful song that's got a really ambitious ending filled with strings that yeah it's not really the same mood as the previous track that I just mentioned but man is it a thick mood I mean thick with just this kind of uplifting soaring head and the clouds kind of vibe instrumentally at least there are a few other tracks on here that I wish kind of went that far like the introductory track my lighthouse or passing a message both of which I just kind of feel like get cut short and sort of but other tracks on here do a really great job at embracing sort of a sense of simplicity and don't leave me hanging in the process like in a Newfoundland you are free which is like this beautiful acoustic track which has sort of a lullaby quality to it the piano on this song and the guitar that occasionally pops in waltz together really slowly and I love the way they will Brian sings on this track his voice just the the tambour of it is a perfect setting for music this soft his voice just sounds so endearing on this track it would have been the perfect ending to this album I thought but then the rhythm composer track which kind of seems to be this singer-songwriters tribute to percussionists drummers it's it's a cutesy kind of track maybe a little corny it feels a little tagged on but even this track which i think is really one of the weakest out of the entire bunches is really not that bad so you do kind of have these softer lullaby kind of tracks but O'Brien is equally comfortable on a song like nothing's changed which is like this very kind of mid paced piano rocker a song that is very slickly produced something that I feel like the killers would have rocked back when they were putting out better tracks and I loved the string kissed climax on this song the way it just rises again another moment on this LP this kind of inspiring I feel like overall this LP could sir we have been bolder there are a good handful of tracks on here that do not take the adventurous plunge that the other songs on here do pretty much just a slight improvement I think for villagers really giving me hope that there will be something maybe even better on the horizon past this album I'm feeling light 7 to a decent 7 on this LP but if you've given it a listen what did you think about it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana villagers forever 
o6bkUlYcLD8,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Fox Egan we are the 21st century masters ambassadors of peace and magic Fox Egan is the singing songwriting duo multi-instrumentalist duo of Jonathan Rado and Sam France I fell in love with them or their music rather last year when I heard the reissue of this take the kids off Broadway which I guess at the time I thought was an EP I put it on my favorite EPS list of last year but I guess this is their new album but it's about as long as this EP it's kind of confusing and my love of this had me psyched to listen to this mostly because of this is very spontaneous mix of influences coming from a whole slew of artists who made great music during the 60s and 70s Eric Burdon and the animals David Bowie the kinks Rolling Stones Lou Reed and and many more fox Jin would just bunny hop from one sound to another with like no warning whatsoever but still come out in the end with some really great in kind of cohesive and ambitious songs that had a really interesting song structure or arc to them now as far as 21st century goes this album still sees Fox again being a very kind of nostalgic project with flashes of inspiration coming from the previously mentioned artists as well as guys like Dylan on this LP or Phil Spector maybe even a little bit of rockabilly but I feel like this time around Jonathan and France are kind of subtracting the spontaneity and not really jumping around as ferociously as they used to the songs on this LP no longer sound like three different artists alternating on a single song to me the songs on this new LP are much more about focus cohesion and really kind of fleshing out a single idea instead of developing some sort of crafty detour which is certainly a risk I mean having the whole detour thing there is really fun it's kind of distracting but I will say that in this new version of oxigen songwriting style they have seen success they've pretty much on on this LP brought a mixed bag of some very nicely written tracks that are a lot of fun and have kind of a vintage veneer to them I guess outside of that I'm not really seeing any sort of huge theme or arc or concept all these tracks together but that's not necessarily a bad thing I do think they work together relatively well it just doesn't really I guess have that gigantic punch that I would want from an album in general but still I feel like 21st Century Fox engine is still making LPS that are a little too short to maybe kind of bring that impact still there are many many highlights on this thing track for track for track like the song no destruction which has a really smoky saloon worthy kind of folk rock flavor to it I love the production on this track and much of the album and has a strong 60s vibe to it it's really vintage just like their last project but is way more clear than take the kids off Broadway I love the Lazy kind of apathetic vocals on the verses on this track they are kind of pain somewhat ambivalent too they sort of go crazy a little nutty they act out very I guess flamboyantly as they're singing about smoking pot in the subway and I love the way the pace kind of picks up on the chorus I mean if there's one thing that Fox agem is just consistent about with every single one of these tracks they bring a nice contrast between the verses and the chorus is the course is all speed up they burst they grow they just really flower blossom it's a really swanky jam and I love the ending on this track to oxygen rights a lot of tight endings for these songs as well this one in particular has some nice harmonica the song on Blue Mountain the way the song continually kind of picks up speed as it goes along it feels like racing up a mountain there's just more sound and detail as we go up the bass line kind of locks in with a kick drum which is attached to a beat that is very snappy I love the falsetto background vocals I need it I need it and the way the chorus kind of crashes in with all these Panos and and cymbals moving in those Suns I love the freakin melody on this damn chords as well as many others on here in the with song suddenly slows down as it goes back into the verse and then kicks back in toward the ending getting more intense kind of psychedelic it's a good track the song San Francisco I mean two words love ly impossible not to sing along with this freaking chorus I was born in Maui and what is that pretty punky sound on this song is that a glockenspiel there's just some really pretty chords on this song and the way the melody on the intro sort of bounces around flutters about like a butterfly but in the piano especially before the course with the chords that is being played there's kind of a sinister undertone to this song as well as many other songs on here mostly I feel through the kind of weird somewhat absurd ously ryx sometimes I pick up some themes of religion sometimes I pick up some themes of war the song Shuggie another extremely infectious chorus and I love the intro melody there are some keyboards on this track that feel like a Mellotron a woodwind as well and the title track on here is extremely rowdy I think kind of hilarious with the title of the song being kind of repeated over and over and over and over in a way that I mean it's so long it's kind of impossible to be catchy so it's sort of repeated or vocalizing this kind of wacky zany aggressive pop kind of way which is kind of a surprise because when the vocals on the Selphy do get aggressive they usually resemble much more of a I guess sort of Mick Jagger kind of thing but the song just gets kind of more speedy and more ruthless as it moves on and the final track here oh no - which to me is is a great closer has kind of this Space Oddity sort of vibe to it and these William Shatner likes spoken word interjections that I like quite a bit in the closing piano ballad on this track is stellar as well I mean really the unicorns influence pours out on this track specifically like a guy like Alden Penner I see him having a lot of influence on what Sam and Jonathan do the only songs on here I really kind of fault are the short just one minute track that has kind of a rockabilly thing going on I like but I wish it was longer the intro track on here that I liked I liked how it exploded with the huge background vocals they had a lot of reverb on him but I wish it was longer and the song oh yeah had a really great chorus to it but to me the verses just had way too many kind of I guess sort of rock cliches yeah there are quite a few of them on this album but that one just had too many to handle and some really weak lyrics too again my only main issues with this LP is that I wish it was longer and I wish the songs connected I guess in a more obvious or strongly conceptual way I mean really that's it I think Fox's j'en is on a really good progression with this album focusing more on that songwriting then those detours as I've already said with a lot of great choruses melodies stellar production and a vintage flavor but still they've maintained enough kind of eccentricity enough strangeness to feel modern new and kind of weirdly fresh I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think love it hate it why what should I review next and that's it Anthony Fantana boxes in forever [Music] you 
Ls07Jjbo_O0,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Yo La Tengo faid Yo La Tengo is a New Jersey rock trio whose versatility is only matched by their influence between the bands three main members and their 20 or so years of recordings they've actually been able to drop quite a few rock and pop styles everything from garage rock psychedelic rock lo-fi nose pop and rock indie rock dream pop folk music and more and when it comes to you ought n go there is definitely an influence in most sort of noisy off-kilter messy indie rock bands that are out there today of course you could also attribute a lot of this influence to bands such as guided by voices and modest mouse as well as pavement but still Yolo tango I can always count on them to kind of bring a thought-provoking mixed bag of ideas that may not always line up but are surely featuring a few surprisingly inspired left hooks spontaneity and the challenge of spontaneity has been kind of a standard that Yolo tango has held themselves and their fans to for many years whether they are putting together some kind of soundtrack or like a side project such as condo or doing their annual wfm you fun dr.colin radio session cover gauntlet the band's ability to function in numerous musical dimensions has been a selling point of theirs for a long time I would actually say especially on their last few LPS like the very back loaded and sometimes poppy popular songs and the very quirky and yet sometimes awe-inspiringly lovely I am not afraid of you and I will beat your ass however fade is actually surprisingly consistent not a lot of surprise shifts all over this LP and it's pretty soft too I actually don't think yellow tango has put out an album this soft since like 2003 summer fun or to thousands and then nothing turned itself inside out where they actually I guess flirted with some ambient sounds on that LP that may definitely beat out fade in terms of a low volume but I do find fate to be a bit more cohesive but even though the album does feel a little bit more connected song to song it does have its low points like the song stupid things which has all these quietly pulsating drums it's a very dreamy piece of krautrock with these meandering guitar solos that don't really feel like they've got much direction to them IRA comes in singing with his occasionally weak vocals that for some reason on this track don't really come off as charming I don't really find that much to engage with on that track but being very pleasant on the ears gentle maybe sometimes awash in effects these are recurring sonic themes on fade lots of explorative guitars repetitive rhythm instrumentation maybe a few arrangements here and there whether it be strings especially horns and vocals that are either maybe obscure a little bit with effects or just like whisper quiet after you law tango kind of has all of these elements in place with each song it's just kind of a question of whether or not Yolo tango has created something that is beautiful or maybe a little bit boring thankfully over on this LP I'd say it's more the beauty like the opener own which to me is like this really intoxicating repetition rock it's got this really kind of danceable drum circle rock bee buzzing guitar drones catchy mantra lyrics that are as awesome as the first day I heard them and the entire experience gets more and more psychedelic as the song continues on just getting heavier thicker hazy err on the track Cornelia and jane.georgia actually sings lead and she's singing beautifully over these patiently strummed and picked guitars and bass and these guitars get a really nice lift from some horn arrangements that are to me is beautiful really gives the song some body and the final track on here kind of has a similar appeal - there's some shorter sweeter less psychedelic morsels on here like the track is that enough it's kind of got this alt-country bassline shuffling drums some buzzing guitar in the background and nearly with every Yolo tango release there is one track that really sticks out to me is having a very sort of bold Velvet Underground feel to it and I would definitely pick this track as having that quality on fade I will say the song does feel a little bit formless though like a lot of tracks on here can because of the sort of wandering nature of the of the writing and the performance I actually like the track right after a bit more well you better it's way leaner the drum beat is very snappy and the keyboards are just really cute and really pretty on this track too it's just way more instantly enjoyable and straightforward for me there are other tracks on here like I'll be around that I feel like are very pretty on the ears but kind of need to cut the fat I guess a little bit not a lot to kind of bite into after a while as the song draws on extending itself to the five-minute mark and yet there are other songs out here like the song to train the rapper no not the rapper Soul Train two trains which is just about as long and as spacious I love the layers of guitar sound on this track they feel so lighten sort of ambient sleek sexy these swelling guitar courts that might have been played with an ebow or something like that lots of our Peggy O's very atmosphere reverb leads overall fate is actually a really sweet and surprisingly solid album from Yo La Tengo in this I guess sort of latter part of their career again it's one of the more consistent releases that the band has ever had stylistically but still I feel like maybe some new listeners may have a difficult time gravitating to this album because of I guess how soft and quiet on first listen it may be this does to me feel like an album that not hardcore fans but maybe a general fan would be more into because to really appreciate this LP I feel like you might need to be a little bit more familiar Yola tangos louder and then sometimes noisier side as well so again I will say the fade is solid it's sweet its pleasant and what I like so much about is that it has the beauty the detail and the emotion that sometimes just simply Pleasant music kind of lacks I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantino Yo La Tengo bade forever 
jHUsBoVOxzE,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Toro y Moi anything in return Toro y Moi is the pseudonym for music producer multi-instrumentalist singer and songwriter Chaz bundok and musically he's been involved in other projects but everything that he's done just popularity wise does not compare to Toro y Moi even though I haven't really been in love with any of the full lengths that he's put out so far it has been kind of interesting watching his progression Chaz kind of came to popularity in 2009 when a lot of artists were being corralled underneath the chillwave label a single of his blessa was one of the lead songs kind of defining the genre getting people hyped up and excited about this brand new genre that many assumed would kind of overtake music for much longer than it actually did truth be told this chill wave actually started to recede around the time that Chaz released his first album since he kind of became popular with this label that was assigned to him and even though it was highly anticipated for me it was pretty underwhelming to me this album had very little strength outside of its singles or just the tracks that were dropped prior to the release of this thing it seemed to me to be an album that was not really all that interested in crafting an interesting track or song it was really more just enthralled with its wonky bedroom beat production than anything which led to a lot of tracks that kind of meandered went nowhere sort of ended abruptly weren't all that well developed felt a little bit like filler a lot of people disagree with me on this and have disagreed with me on this in the past but I just continue to feel this way about causes of this now in 2011 taurima quickly came out with another LP underneath the pine and on this album which I liked a bit more I actually liked in general it seemed like chill weight was on the bottom of the menu and Chaz was embracing the worlds of synth funk as well as disco on this thing and these grooves felt carefully crafted they well crafted they were sexy they were alluring however from release to release vocals have consistently been kind of either met or just a turn-off for me for Toro y Moi I can't really go as far as to say that the vocals on his LPS are really all that whiny I think whiny implies like some kind of sense of intense emotion whereas I don't really get that from Chaz's vocals all too often they may be light they may be kind of high-pitched and just in that upper register but I typically find them to be a little OneNote kind of flat when it comes to giving a convincing performance that actually feels like he's conveying some kind of I don't know happiness sadness ambivalence I'm not sure because so many of his vocal takes just sound the same to me over and over and in one song after another his voice to me just sort of seems to fade into the background even when it's mixed into the foreground however what really kept me from loving this album is that it really felt bogged down again kind of like causes of this in songs that really sort of meandered ended early just sort of felt like filler underdeveloped which is actually what kind of got me excited for this new LP it is because as far as track listings go I saw that he was developing songs past that 3 minute mark consistently not only that but overall this is a longer album so I was kind of hoping to hear maybe some sort of improved version of underneath the pine are just an improved version of Chaz's stick in general however I personally I didn't really get that I actually feel like I got some sort of a maturely crafted pop torture device where the songs really kind of range from somewhat likable to just ha the album starts off pretty fine though with the very catchy and enjoyable or the song kind of kicks off somewhat of a flavor for the album with a house influence which Chas has kind of fussed with before in another project it's kind of interesting to see him take that influence into here and really kick this album off with sort of an 80s vibe I mean the way these beats are grooving and the way his voice is just on top of them it just reminds me of like a tease free style artists like Shannon or stevie be with you know just like that old-school synth-pop sound with just high-pitched vocals very sort of sweet hooks lots of lyrics kind of touching down on love and romance however I feel like those old artists you know they do have an appeal today certainly a nostalgic one Tory Mott definitely shoots for a nostalgia on this track and many others on here but it just doesn't sort of have that old-world charm and remember the tracks say that that comes shortly after is the lead single off of this album it's a pretty decent track as well it again has sort of a dance-pop feel electronic tinge in a very vintage style there's sort of these murky piano samples being looped over and over and over against these male and female vocal samples some smooth synth bass but the vocals to me are again just kind of forgettable and the lyrics that they're singing are just so I don't know I guess you would say vapid or something she's all right I'm all right the album is okay up to this point but the potholes start coming like with the track so many details the track is smooth enough at the start with this really husky fat bass line but shortly after once the hook pops in it's just like four or five layers of badly performed synthesizers clumsily jumping on top of each other and just like this ugly sound casserole the album is pleasant but very sort of in the background and and not all that engaging up until the point of the song studies where Chas comes right in sort of experimenting with his voice singing in this very high falsetto higher than he usually sings and it is just absolutely blood-curdling the Songhai living comes through the groove that feels I guess sort of sultry but on the other hand kind of ham-handed - I mean it's about as awkward as a bunch of dudes trying to stretch their arms over their girlfriends and like a rated-r slasher flick and all the synth solos toward the end of the track are just so messy and and aimless and not really well improvised the song grown-up calls brings in more very badly and chizel II placed samples it's something that Tori more consistent we does on this album you'll hear yeah mark it's like Tori MA went to the Rob bass school of sample application via the song it takes to all the vocal samples on this entire LP are useless distracting and just really obnoxious maybe except the female vocal sample on the track say that which is very kind of sweetly cooing underneath the instrumental later the songwriting on this thing gets even cheesier with tracks like cake and how is it wrong Toro y Moi vocals I think really reveal their true influence by singing on tunes that sound like they were written for New Kids on the Block I mean they sound exactly like a boyband tune from the mid-1980s on top of that it's not really well sung or well produced I mean I feel like if these songs have been handed to a boy band in the 80s they would sound a lot better because the studio work would be a little bit more precise the issues that I have with this LP are just like so glaring the lackluster singing the very hammy grooves the badly and cheese Lee placed samples and on top of that there's really nothing positive to say about the lyrics on this entire LP I feel like there are some spots where this album yeah is pretty enjoyable like the song rose quartz which is understated very kind of sensual like many other songs on here try to be and there are moments in many of these tracks that approached the idea of sexy but it just you know doesn't actually reach that point for me you know many times before I've heard people kind of come at Tory moi with the criticism that this is like merely music to kind of play in the background at the mall while people are shopping at stores like forever 21 or something like that I mean with songs like new beat and and and still sound I mean great singles I mean I would have to disagree you know great songs great singles but on this album I have to say like yeah I mean I couldn't really see myself enjoying this unless it were like I guess sort of in the background somewhere and I heard the beat I heard the rhythm and that's it because once I kind of get in there and I hear the vocal samples and I hear what's going on and I kind of like inspected a bit closer it's just I'm kind of feeling a strong three to a light floor on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what should i review next and and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Tory mwah forever [Music] [Music] 
P__GsC98jPw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd not feeling all that well today but still i just want to do this review let's let's do it let's do it put the Progressive Era peep the up Pro collapse the Progressive Era is a New York hip hop click this is their latest album slash mixtape and they've been on the rise ever since individual members of the group like Joey badass and Capital steez blew up with respective tapes and singles like 1999 and American corruption which just kind of exemplified that blueprint East Coast hardcore hip hop sound which there has kind of been a resurgence of lately with a lot of artists from the East Coast kind of embracing the old-school of things guys like Rex for example as well as producers such as static selecta Action Bronson to the progressive error is definitely trying to continue that progression of gritty East Coast hip-hop hand it down to them by artists like Smith & Wesson as well as Gang Starr wu-tang De La Soul Tribe Called Quest biggie organized confusion Black Moon as well I mean the list could really kind of go on forever progressive era pretty much takes what they feel are the best elements of a lot of these artist styles and just brings them all together into one young up-and-coming New York hip hop supergroup and they also take some cues from modern purveyors of sort of the boom bap or old-school styles such as Stones Throw Records artists like mad lib and doom as well a lot of the cultural references and the lyrics of course are modern though the production is still pretty old-school maybe a little less stripped-down than a beat you would normally hear in the 90s simply because of the ease at which you can throw detail into a newer beat with modern technology digital audio washer and samplers as well however despite the fact that guys in the group like Chuck strangers who MC but also produce a you know make a totally tricked-out modern beat with whatever kind of studio he's working in he does pretty much stay true to that old-school form a lot of soul and jazz samples bass lines rhythm guitars pianos drum brakes very dirty snares hi-hats and kicks this mixtape was originally released on the 21st December when the apocalypse allegedly was supposed to come and everybody was pretty much celebrating the the fact that the world did not I don't know what we thought it was going to do melt but at the time of the release of this tape as kind of highlighted on the cover of this thing Pro era had about a dozen affiliates just a few days later on the 24th of December one member of the group Capital steez just kind of saw fit to take his own life it was extremely shocking and saddening to hear the news not just because he was one of the standout MCS in the group who possibly had a pretty brave future in hip-hop but you know to see a loss of life at such a young age is just always depressing and you know as good as peep the approps might be it kind of puts a damper on the recording as a whole because of the loss of Capital steez in in the way that he was lost the dynamic of this group will be forever changed you know who knows what the chemistry is going to be like past this point peep is a seventeen track release it's about an hour long and uni would have to listen to the whole thing maybe even just half of this thing to realize that they take the legacy of New York hip hop very very seriously Pro eras production - their flows - their lyrical styles I mean just reeks of New York City however that's not to say that these guys don't do what they do well they actually do it incredibly well I would actually say to the point where it feels maybe a little refreshing however a number one gripe I hear about Joey badass and company again and again and again is that the music and just their style in general is just kind of drown in nostalgia I guess a lot of people just don't see the point of what Pro era is doing in a genre such as hip hop where the emphasis for decades has always been to be new be fresh be on the cutting edge however despite the really vintage style Joey badass and the Progressive Era have caught on especially with younger listeners and I feel like some people will point at the state of mainstream hip-hop and even underground hip-hop at times and say lyrics have gone down the toilet production sucks now this sucks that sucks hip-hop has kind of lost its way I feel like maybe to an extent it could be that but mostly I feel like it has to do with hip hop's age at this point hip hop has legitimately breached that point where it is old enough to kind of reflect upon its past not only that but rehash it recycle it and it sounds new and fresh to an up-and-coming generation that didn't live through that era and that is something that at some point every single genre does I mean Rock has plenty of artists that pretty much just rehash older ideas and these artists such as like the Black Keys or the White Stripes have had very successful musical careers so honestly it's it's about time the hip hop actually kind of had something like the Progressive Era despite their Progressive Era name I mean they're actually quite I guess regressive I don't mean that in a bad way though what I'm trying to say is that the Progressive Era have put themselves in a position where they have essentially become the the new face of this new old wave of hip hop now peep is not the progressive eras only album slash mixtape they also had the sex tape that came out toward the beginning of last year which was kind of spotty considering the quality of that tape I'm not surprised that the group caught on faster through individual members like Capital steez and Joey badass but overall in comparison with sex tape peep is way more mature focused it's skillset is of a higher grade and I guess I would say it's a little less sophomoric to the opening track on here like water has this beautiful piano sample this vocal cut about the end of the world being mere I mean it's a gorgeous opener with Capital steez kind of leading the way with the first to me it's a track that just makes me feel nostalgic for the world that I currently live on but nostalgic in a way where I would think man the world ended it's over home after Capital steez Joey badass and CJ fly come through all three of these guys when they pop up on a track it sounds fantastic I mean they have such smooth confident flows lyrically on this LP there's a lot of freeform verses the guys in the progressive error just like to hit listeners with a lot of similes and a lot of wordplay especially from CJ fly there are some themes that come up in the lyrics again and again and again that sort of reflect the state of the group as a whole at least at the time of the recording of this tape their success their growth in numbers things like love interests their past their present what they perceive to be their future throwing out lines about world domination or even getting the attention and love from the West Coast hip-hop scene one of the few tracks on here that is like a clear point to it is F a rap critic which is a hilarious track with a really awesome Method Man sample rapping that F a rap critic they talked about it while I live it and Chuck Strangers is a little sore on this track about how his bars have been perceived on previous Pro era affiliated tracks Chuck strangers and company continue to kind of spin about their rap lifestyle and stuff like that but you know maybe Chuck strangers bars on a couple tracks were sorta corny whichever way your opinion swayed on that I actually think Chuck has kind of stepped up his game on whatever tracks he landed on with this new LP sounding way more gruff sounding a little more aggressive kind of like he had something to prove and I think he proved it another track that stuck out to me was the song vinyls which was led by group member desi Hines who after this track really stands out to me as someone who could also drop a big solo project in this group I love the rhyme scheme that he goes into this verse with doing a lot of internal rhymes within a line meanwhile kind of telling this personal story of coming up in hip hop rapping about his amateur voice and he does it all against this really mean funk groove and desi also leads another great track on this LP that stuck out too natural where he kind of delves lyrically into the art of rap writing according to him you know when it comes to the power of writing the power of lyricism proair definitely has that there are some spots on here that do come off maybe a little corny or underwhelming some lyrical duds most notably like the our soul line where he's saying you know shorty called me a Big Mac yeah we're yeah and I guess the Kirk night feature track floors was just maybe a little bland as well but really that's about it for near terrible spots on this album there are moments on here like the last cipher which lasts eight minutes a little bit shorter than the cut that kind of finished off Joey badasses in 1999 but still remain pretty engaging I would actually say more engaging everybody pretty much came up to the mic and held their own for the most part and together I mean the chemistry of this group it just sounded fun it was just fun to listen to you felt like you were there it felt like a cypher it felt like it was just kind of unfolding in front of your face it felt playful it felt like everybody was in good spirits I guess you could say I was surprised by the kind of De La Soul Tribe Called Quest Native Tongues sort of you know lighter vibe of this tape I thought that maybe Pro era because they want to come out strong they want to grab attention they would go a more violent aggressive hard-hitting Wu Tang kind of angle with this tape but that just didn't happen the hardest tracks on this thing aren't even really that hard while the lighter songs really show off the poeta sysm and and the passion of these guys as they delve into either personal thoughts or even romantic ones though you know still I'm not going to say it's all apple pie they are young dudes Falmouth's blunts overall I mean I have to say peep is just well produced it's well wrapped it's lyrical its skilled its energetic charismatic it's pretty much everything except adventurous or experimental I mean I guess you could argue that you know they're they're adventuring in the old school but still I mean is there an experimental edge here no however I wouldn't say that ruins the vibe of this tape because again they do what they do so well some really great production from Lee Bannon as well as Chuck strangers Brandon - a on here - and just a myriad of other producers I mean Pro era picks a really great backdrop of instrumentals with horn hits and and just everything to bring that old-school vibe I think the most modern thing that was on any of the beats on this entire tape was the slightly trap tinged hi-hat on the second-to-last song on here bun and cheese but that's about it I really enjoyed listening to this tape I guess I would say I'm loved listening this tape I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think about it you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Pro era forever [Music] you you
