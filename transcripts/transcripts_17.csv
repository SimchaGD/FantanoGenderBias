tV8ianZv-j0,hi everyone get any well tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's it's it's time for a comment some thoughts given on what's probably going to be the biggest music related news of this week the big release and the press conference for jay-z's new music streaming service a title if you didn't already know people have been expecting this announcement for months now it was a while ago that jay-z rapper entertainment business tycoon bought the music streaming service spero for over 50 million dollars and he was going to be coming out with his own competing service trying to compete with Spotify and other music streaming services out there which in theory is not really a bad idea music streaming really is where music consumption is going as far as your you know your sort of mainstream music listeners however as I have said in previous videos talking about streaming services such as Spotify there have been a lot of critiques lobbed at Spotify especially in the way that they pay and treat the artists that they feature on their platform so before I get into the details of title I do want to say that I am happy that there is some other companies stepping in here and try and provide at least some level of competition to Spotify because thus far Spotify has really been dominating as far as music streaming now title has a few features that the brand has been heavily marketing and I guess basically trying to remind people of one you're getting higher quality audio out of title than you are other music streaming services what they say is CD quality audio which is kind of funny because CD quality audio is now something where we're striving for it's a standard that we're trying to reach whereas when CDs were first getting big you had people successful artists from the 80s the seventies the 60s talking about how horrible CDs and digital music sounds in comparison to the analog recordings that they were making during their hay days so it's it's it's pretty funny every generation every new generation of musicians sort of has an shuh with the current state of audio quality and and they think that you know maybe the the audio quality of ten years ago going back to that is what's going to save things but it never really is we have offline capabilities which if you're familiar with Spotify Spotify also has that as well so I'm not really that competitive of a feature there will be editorial content otherwise known as opinions somewhere in the streaming service may be sort of turning you on to a different artists that are being featured on the platform maybe think pieces essays I sort of doubt in a way that these think pieces and essays maybe even reviews if they're talking about that kind of editorial content will be that I guess critical of the people who they're putting on this platform who title might have deals with with and I've also seen hints towards stuff like exclusives are we going to get early access to music are we going to get songs that are only being featured on this platform maybe videos live performances and while a lot of these things seem really good something that was strangely vacant from this kind of painfully awkward press conference that was uploaded yesterday you can actually watch a video of that in the description box down below what was kind of missing from this was any discussion of whether or not the artists are actually benefitting monetarily any more here than they would from Spotify or YouTube or any other music streaming service really the reasons service like Spotify can pay artists just pennies for streams is because no other service is stepping in to offer them more money for maybe just exclusive rights to stream their new album now no question I'm positively sure that the artists that were featured at this press conference a dozen or so of them who have been billed as co-owners of this new streaming service I'm sure that they are getting a better deal monetarily out of title giving themselves a better deal with title than they have gotten with Spotify but a lot of the people who were featured at this press conference a lot of these co-owners are in bands with other people they're already sharing money with or they are already signed to a label so I'm not really sure how the deal that they're doing with title is going to work exactly because whatever royalties they are making off their own music through title they're gonna have to pay to their label because their label you know owns the rights to their music because they signed them I'm not sure how the math is working here but if a guy like Jack White wasn't going to be making more money screaming his music through title then he would through Spotify I don't think he would attach his name to it but still that question of artists treatment and artists payment remains because what about artists that are going to be featured on this platform that that that aren't co-owners and while I like a lot of the albums created or performed by a lot of the people who are co-owners of this new title platform it just so happens that a lot of these artists at least half of them have an incredible business acumen as well when it comes to managing other artists or labels or marketing themselves as brands and icons outside of the music world I'm not saying that caring about the bottom line is a bad thing it's what makes for a successful business however at the end of the day a lot of the co-owners of this platform are probably going to have to make the same kinds of decisions that people at Spotify have to make in order to keep their business afloat while I appreciate all of the rhetoric about art and music and passion that a lot of these people delivered in promoting this new music streaming platform at the end of the day I think it's just you know once again going to be all about business I think there are some good intentions behind this music streaming service but in my head I have a hard time imagining it working out well into the future at least if title kind of sticks to what it's promising to deliver right now which I don't think is very much title might have a lot of star power right out the gate but at the end of the day you're talking about getting people's hard-earned money out of their pockets and if you're going to do that the ex that you offer are going to have to be really enticing like this potential for exclusive access to maybe some music or something like that you know that music that people get that is either early access or stuff that they're only going to hear there it's going to have to be great and it's going to have to come so consistently that people feel justified and shelling out that 20 bucks every month and you know when you make an exclusive song for a platform like this it's only really going to be a matter of time before it leaks out on to the rest of the internet which disincentivizes other people to subscribe to title because if the song that is exclusive to this platform ends up leaking everywhere anyway why do people want to subscribe and as funny as it is but also a admirable that they want to try to do this CD quality audio thing on this platform people don't really care people don't they do not care I mean me personally I care about audio quality there are some other people who watch the show and people I've talked to online who are music buffs that care about audio quality but your average person doesn't really care about whether or not they're listening to the new Nicki Minaj single or the new Rihanna single or the new deadmau5 single in mp3 wav or flack don't get me wrong there are some people who do care but your average music listener can't tell the difference and they don't care people have been talking about the Falling quality of audio in modern music for decades and many more people have made the case a lot better than they have made in this press conference over here so if people are going to be convinced in this day and age it's it's not going to be by what was presented here and if you're ever going to change people's minds about the audio quality of things it's it's not going to be with CD quality audio I'm sorry if any of these people who are co-owners here really cared about audio quality what why don't they attempt to record all their albums analog or anything like that I think only a few people who are co-owners here have may the pointed attempt to do that with their own music exit why is there more of an outcry about the kind of just bare-minimum mp4s that itunes sells to people on these musicians behalfs there are a lot of steps that we could be taking to improve the audio quality of you know what we're hearing and and where we're hearing it but we're just not making those efforts really and and to me just giving people CD quality audio on a music streaming services like the baby askew like not helpful step we could be taking there's also the fact that this is an exclusive paid service and in a way especially if there's a lot of exclusive content on this platform it's going to put a bit of a barrier between the music that people want to hear and the music fans these days it seems like the most obvious way to maintain your relevancy and keep engaged with your fans is just to give them the content that you're making give them full access to it and you know while I don't think that a jay-z is going to make it that you can't hear any of his music unless you go on title I don't think any artist on this platform is going to take that extreme of an approach but do keep in mind that when you know artists in the past have kind of taken this position of well I'm not putting my on the internet because I just don't believe in the in the in the business model people like Prince and Bob Dylan for example I feel like in a very great way their relevancy with a new generation has kind of been hurt a little bit because they've been so shy and they've been so slow to embrace this new Internet era and allow their music to be heard by younger people sort of through the medium and the platform that younger listeners prefer to listen to music on these music streaming platforms I guess at the end of all this how this whole thing kind of feels to me it reminds me quite a bit of a of Napster when you know you had people going online using this p2p service to download music illegally for free but people were getting music for free on this platform and then once it was loud enough outcry by artists and by labels what happened was you know the labels kind of scooped up Napster and turned it into a paid service which some people were happy to oblige and took part and got a subscription but most people you know they weren't stupid they just went to other person to person file-sharing platforms like cos on LimeWire soul seek and whatever else was available at the time title is essentially trying to charge people for what they can already get for free so I'm not really seeing how you know this is going to work out into the future again these extras that they offer are gonna have to be really good are going to have to be really enticing but they might not be I mean I think these artists if they do offer exclusive music is it going to be their best music I mean I would like to think that if it was their best stuff their single worthy stuff they would probably just release it straight to the public like for example would Nicki Minaj's anaconda video have done as well as it did if she put it up on title for the first three days of its existence and then put it out to the rest of the public afterwards I don't know part of what makes something of viral success is that everyone has access to it and everyone has the ability to share it and if you sort of limit people's access to things and you limit people's ability to share things because it's on an exclusive platform unless there are going to be some things here and there that aren't exclusive maybe to entice people into subscribing or just sort of getting more acquainted with or getting more familiar with this platform over here I think I don't know what I'm saying I'm sick totally out of my mind losing my train of thought but even with my sick brain right here not much of what I'm reading about title is is making lots of sense for sure I mean yeah I'm sure there are people that want to buy into the service right now because some of their favorite artists are taking part in it as co-owners and you know they want to support them and and I'm sure in a way they feel like they're doing a service to the music industry by actually buying into a service that's going to do these artists well and do them right possibly rather than a Spotify screwing a lot of them over with just you know pennies and pennies and pennies on whatever dollar is probably being paid to the record label first and again I do think that there needs to be more competition in this realm of the music industry but what makes title a better superior music streaming service it's it's not apparent if you've seen this press conference if you use this music streaming platform what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why do you think title is going to be the next Spotify do you think it's going to change the game let me know cool cool Anthony Fantana music streaming music forever 
VDScLq5WdkE,don't worry about count I stop thinking about it and just learn to accept it cuz I have a life hi everyone pop the knee quiz chan oh here the internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new parody ring record another eternity parody ring is a montreal synth pop duo whose debut LP that dropped a few years ago shrines wasn't too bad these singles on the LP ended up early being the best tracks in the bunch but there were some good intentions behind the album some kind of sweet and very light vocal melody some rattling traps style high hats and some moody synthetic atmospheres but even though I did like some of the kind of vast and very glossy instrumentals on this album it was the kind of innocent and very childlike vocals of singer Megan James that ended up feeling kind of one-dimensional and I guess all in all there wasn't that much instrumental variety on this album either but it did feel like purity ring was on their way to honing a style and approach to synth pop however that doesn't seem to be the case with this new sophomore LP right here purity ring's approach and sound on this album isn't so much dark or mystical as much as it just has kind of a high-gloss finish to a lot of the beats on this record resembling that of like a Church's album except with less single power and not as impressive singing because the kind of baby voice Megan James still is not really doing it for me on this record a lot of the time she just kind of feels like a dull melodic placeholder rather than a conduit for any kind of significant amount of emotion she definitely hits all the notes it's just that her performance isn't really all that emotive or exciting and she had a kind of youthful adolescence to her voice on the last record but the instrumentals there just felt a little darker here it feels like her singing is only adding to the already squeaky clean and sterile vibe that the beats are bringing on numerous tracks here and sometimes the instrumentals have kind of a an EDM or maybe even like an electro trap flavor to them kind of like the song stranger than Earth except there's absolutely no viscera or citement about these instrumentals either they're kind of flattened flaccid with this new record it feels like purity ring is making a lesser version of a pretty unmemorable and very saturated approach that a lot of artists and DJs are taking right now to electronic music and pop rather than the alternative approach to pop that they seem to be taking with their last LP this album is just so sugary it's like turning me diabetic every time I try to listen through it it's like sending me to Teletubby land or when I put this music on I just see this misty pink cloud rolling in and when I breathe in deep it's just got me choking I guess I find the music to be kind of soft and squishy and smooth and pastel colored but there's nothing really all that Q or endearing about it instead it just kind of feels a little lifeless and maybe sort of breezy passive I didn't really care for this album honestly and I'm kind of feeling a strong two decent four on this thing transition if you've given this Alma listened what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it also there is a video down there in the description talking about some of my favorite Canadian records of last year sort of in celebration of the upcoming Canadian Juno Awards a little Music Awards ceremony they got up there and and yeah so give that a check out and hopefully get turn on some awesome Canadian music in the process you're the best Anthony Fanta no purity ring forever 
WG7xw2UiKwc,he'd without James giving a ted-like just a droid swimming oh my god Denise Danno oh my god that would be horrible it's time for a review of the new Earl album I don't like shit I don't go outside Earl Sweatshirt is a California rapper best known as the once missing lyricist extraordinaire of West Coast hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all who exploded onto the internet with an immeasurable wave of hype and now that most of the dust has settled I don't feel like the experience was completely pointless but it hasn't exactly panned out into many great albums but there have been flashes in the odd future pan Frank ocean's channel orange bastard wolf was pretty decent Earl's beloved debut oral sweatshirt mixtape and Doris was pretty decent even though this album was kind of underwhelming to me I was able to appreciate the fact that Earl seemed really know bullshit about his music and even though I liked the very dark and moody direction that his music went in the very cold and subdued vocal delivery Earl had going and the murky instrumentals got just a little redundant after a while and I guess I was hoping for on his next project that he would come through with a bit more energy and aggression it would really pick things up and bring some more diversity and maybe some more excitement to an Earl sweatshirt project maybe even help him push past the very obvious doom influence that's been running through all of his projects thus far but rather than turning up on this new album over here Earl has essentially hunchback limped further into the darkness with a very rusty oil lantern even though it was a standoffish album Doris at least felt like it was trying to be commercially successful at least a little I don't like shit is way more uncompromising it is not looking to please anybody it's despondent it's depressing and as if this is a surprise given the title its anti-social the slightly claustrophobic and low five production and the kind of loud mixing of the vocals definitely give the feeling that Earl is like holed up somewhere in like a very small smoky very dimly lit room recording and writing this music the production on this album is filled with these kind of warp slow motion jazz chord loops and even though the beats on this record are very dusty they're simple they're skeletal they're moving at the pace of molasses I actually like a lot of them they do have a very strong emotional tone to them some very sad melodies and just interesting sounds the beat for the track am featuring wiki of Rat King actually has these kind of silly children stock sound samples thrown throughout them oh one of my favorite beats on this entire project is actually for the song grief which kind of has this very droney instrumental I could only liken it to something a sort of atmospheric and very thick and dense like cloud wrap but the drone is just so lo-fi it's so kind of just grimy it feels like it could have come off like a grouper album or something like that and grief is actually something this record is very heavy with to the point where I think it actually affects the album's inner workings there isn't much on this album in the way of hooks and the hooks that are here are very subdued and not really some or anything like that they're usually just you know wrapped the tracks on this album are very brief and the album overall is just barely 30 minutes the track listing of I don't like shit doesn't really have that strong of a flow to it it just kind of feels like this one desolate sad flat experience and Earl's very sad funk on this album doesn't just affect how the record and the music moves on this project of course it also effects the lyrics there are a lot of themes on this album in Earl's verses about not being able to trust or maybe even love people whether that be his friends or women or his family this feeling that he doesn't have a home not in sort of you know he's homeless but like he doesn't have a place he can call home and kind of be a figurative emotional sense there people going into this album who were probably hoping for something more explosive like I was however I don't feel completely disappointed by that but I think there will be people going into this album who find this record to be just as boring as Doris and maybe to an extent feel like Earl just isn't even trying but to my ears it feels like Earl still has flow on this album and he's putting effort into his rhymes even if a lot of the verses on this album read like a kind of unfocused and disheveled update on Earl's life over the past few years the lyrical content of this album is about as eventful as you would expect from a project named idle like shit I don't go outside we have appearances and mentions of familiar faces like Christian Clancy odd future manager or Vince staples on the very last track of this LP Earl raps about his interactions with fans and how he feels like he owes pictures to them because they've got him to where he is and he also you know pays his mother's rent tries to help her out he also details the drama surrounding a pretty nasty romantic breakup at one point point if you're not interested in the finer details in the day-to-day of Earl's life depression and music career this album just might not translate to you you might find it kind of tedious at least that's how it feels to me sometimes especially on a track like inside where what Earl brings lyrically and topically while you know his rhyme schemes and his flow are definitely together on this track and I don't mind the beat what he's saying just isn't compelling to me but even though this album can feel like getting dragged through an emotional sewer pipe there are highlights like the very dreamy and kind of jazzy instrumentation on the song Huey or Earl's very aggressive vocal delivery on the song mantra or the very melancholy melody on the song faucet and the kind of emotionally powerful lyrics on this track which are very withdrawn it's a very misanthropic track and so is the song grief it's just kind of this one-two punch combo of intense sadness on this track to aural kind of wraps it out being at the precinct getting booked there's also a bar on the song off top that I love where Earl is rapping about being trouble since he tumbled out the stroller another line where he says he's been this way since the a roller raiser and the song grown-ups which features and incredibly dark instrumental and a feature from - of ASAP mob and who's also Dame Dash's nephew his feature isn't so much a standalone verse as much as a lot of the time he's kind of rapping in tandem with Earl and they sort of switch back and forth line from line or sometimes that are saying lines at the same time it has this kind of weird double the over dub quality to it that actually I hadn't really heard in that many hip-hop songs at least not from the beginning to the end of the song and it has a guess an interesting sound to it however the other features on this album just aren't nearly as I guess experimental or even enjoyable Wiki of Rat King it doesn't seem like he really did much on his feature except to spit a few bars and his verse just kind of fizzled out toward the end and he was just really filling up space and then Earl came in and just came really hard with a kind of relentless flow one of the more relentless flows on the entire album I don't know it's it was it was just kind of a weird moment I mean I'm sure that was kind of a an artistic choice for just how lethargic and uneventful wikiz verse was just like kind of a lot of this album is very lethargic and not really trying too hard and the verse knock he'll dropped on the song DNA while it did have energy to it he just sounded really young and amateurish to my ears this album though still is a pretty interesting hip-hop record if you are a hip-hop fan in any way shape or form I think this album is worth trying out because even though there were only a couple tracks that I came away from saying wow this is a good song or wow that was a great verse the entire record as a whole kind of works together pretty well in that it all reinforces these really dark incredibly depressing feelings even the title and the cover art here there's something just kind of nihilistic about it this album embodies that whole just fuck it fuck everything attitude to the highest degree so in that sense is a unique album but I don't think it necessarily saves it from a lot of the weaker tracks on here and that when I was done listening to it I just kind of felt you know really empty and and hollow inside not like it really got that much from the album I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP transition if you've given this Earl Sweatshirt project listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it like a new fan kono Earl Sweatshirt I don't like shit forever 
YGN8GB_mnQU,please God just come down here and make empty kimchi me dips and Ted it's supposed to habit Ted guy Oh burp the knee gasps tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new liturgy album the artwork liturgy is a reasonably polarizing new york rock band that has turned heads and turned stomachs with they're pretty stand out blend of math rock experimental rock and black metal and even though their sound has rubbed some people the wrong way I think it's really been the philosophy behind the music on liturgies records that may have really turned some people off a philosophy espoused by the band's frontman hunter hunt Hendrix sort of labeling the style of music that liturgy plays as transcendental black metal with the band's last full-length LP Aesthetica a lot of people caught wind of a a little manifesto and some lectures that hunter had been doing talking about this new style of black metal and maybe not intentionally but of the language he was using and the tone he was taking certainly made it sound like he was taking this new style he was creating and portraying the older sort of roots of black metal is kind of inferior in a way regardless I still do love Aesthetica definitely one my favorite rock records of 2011 and definitely transcendental black metals joyous inception in my opinion or maybe if not its inception its high-water mark definitely the best album in this incredibly micro genre and in a way when listening to this record I kind of find a bit of truth in the hunters saying at least in how this new style of black metal compares to the old school for example the burst beat in transcendental black metal brought to life by drummer extraordinaire Greg Fox on this record which is incredibly fluid cacophonous really exhilarating style of drumming and something I don't think liturgy would have been able to continue without had not Greg hopped onto this new record as well because it seemed like there was a point between this album and liturgies last where Greg was going to no longer be with the band and the other things of transcendental black metal like it being solar versus old-school black metal being lunar as well as other things like courage and hypertrophy and affirmation all these things have added up into what I think is a very bright triumphant and grand approach to black metal music and chances are there are a lot of other artists who might put as much philosophical thought into the approach they want to take with their music the issue though with Hunter is that he sorta kinda showed us how the sausage was made most people don't give a and a great deal of those who will actually hear out what you're saying will only be happy to misinterpret your words and try to use them against you especially when it comes to a culture a musical culture as insular and as traditionalists as black metal now personally a while I have seen a few recently posted charts on Hunter's Instagram that might kind of illustrate where exactly he is going I don't want to present know where his philosophical ideals lie on this new record over here but I do get a slight sense that this time around hunter is not just philosophically thinking about how his music works but maybe even creating music for this fantasy world that he's created entirely in his head not only does the music on this new record here have a really strong sense of place really like it is coming from somewhere else but it also feels like Hunter's trying to make a magnum opus out of the musical ideas he forged honest Ithaca he's bringing over those bright guitar tones those burst beats some of those clean chanting vocals there are no screams or retch vocals on this record surprisingly yeah yeah get used to that vocal inflection you will hear quite a bit of it on this record the guitars are strummed and tremolo picked very speedily and every once in a while I will get you know a bit of deja vu from the last few liturgy records so in a lot of ways this does feel like a liturgy album it doesn't feel like Hunter has you know sort of gone completely left field and totally lost touch with the sound that we know comes from this band thus far but I think he's added a bit of like symphonic metal into the equation here with a ton of chimes or bells which may in fact just be MIDI and then we have MIDI horns and maybe some real string sections on this record too that sound absolutely gorgeous especially on the track of cats a codel it's rock music with some really emotive and sad melodies but there's kind of this really obviously fake digital aesthetic to it as well that I think is 100% intentional and though it doesn't always go over sounding fantastic it doesn't necessarily completely stop Hunter from coming together with some compelling moments like the digital horns all over the start of the song fanfare which are very bright very triumphant I think a great start to the album this track sounds like the opening music - really epic battle at the Roman Colosseum and given the roaring screaming crowd of people at the very end of the second track here that leads out of that intro song I think that's exactly the feel that Hunter was going for having this music not only feel ancient in a sense but also being performed to this ancient or medieval crowd of people the sounds of all the instruments actually bleed into one another a little bit as if you are listening to a live recording however my issue with this song is that the mix is absolutely god-awful at points the chimes all over this track not only do they not totally sync up with the way the instrumentation is sounding like they're they're kind of sloppily played but they just jut out of the mix in such just like a sharp just like a pinprick kind of way it actually makes the music a little difficult to listen to without getting some serious ear fatigue there were moments where I was like bordering on having a headache and these chimes repeatedly pop up throughout the record and sound just as sloppy at some points they sound better than others it sounds like hunter sort of brings some chimes or some bells with a lower pitch and those sound much better but once he starts bringing in that day it really sort of ruins the vibe of the track a little bit though I don't think their inclusion was an awful idea in concept I just think they could have been played better and they could have been mixed better that's all other than that it was a fantastic idea there are a lot of moments on this record where I'm not so much moved or excited by what I'm actually hearing but I'm kind of intrigued and I'm thinking yeah I could see what you're going for there to add to a lot of the interesting sounds on this track we have some of the crowd noises and these chimes - kind of getting glitched out and stretched and just manipulated and thrown into the mix for some added noise and character again really it feels like hunter is trying to take some some old-world musical modes and ideas and sounds and bring them into the digital age you know it feels like in a way I'm at the Coliseum listening to this really strange metal music performance but it's all happening in a computer now this track follow actually glides into one of my favorite tracks on the LP calvo howl which features guitars these marching snare drums and more MIDI horns and this track actually portrays liturgies very unique approach to groove not a lot of bands approach groove in the way that liturgy approaches groove and you know you're essentially getting these syncopated snares guitars and horns buh-buh-buh-buh-buh buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh the constantly building escalating getting more intense and it never really sinks into just sort of something you could nod your head - it's just always off kilter it's just always off B the band actually strings this track out for like seven minutes which may seem like a little excessive for this one single musical idea but if you do remember on liturgies last record they sort of experimented with the idea of repetition well taking riffs and kind of repeating the groove over and over and over and over to create kind of a hypnotic feel and I think that's what they're going for this album as well something that is simultaneously visceral and hard-hitting and just mind-numbing ly hypnotic - sometimes they actually edit the riff so that there's like a really weird glitchy skip skip skip skip and it feels like there's some pump Orient or like some bagpipe that's also starting to play in the background and really thicken up the mix for me this is an example of how the organic instrumentation and the digital and the MIDI instrumentation on this record can come together in a really great grand epic way not necessarily a overly noisy or kind of a deflated or flaccid in the way that you have those high-pitched chimes kind of overtaking the guitars and sounding incredibly homely and now that I kind of see the full vision of this album tracks like cuts a codel which was a lead song bringing fans into this album I really get that track so much more we have driving synthetic kick drums on this track fluttering guitar leads some really weird chanting the tone of this track will not be for everyone it sort of borders on industrial metal in a way but how liturgy layers these fluttering guitars and and combines them with like these movie soundtrack quality string sections is is pretty amazing and and I think goes to show just how underrated their approach to composition and core progressions are I mean that there are a few bands that I think again approach groove and approach chord progressions and the way that liturgy does the end result isn't always amazing but the end of this ketse code will track what it really builds up to for me was pretty breathtaking and then we have tracks like hell layin on here which is a bit of an interlude song and for me the interlude tracks on this record actually are much better than the interlude moments honest ethica this is a really chilly somber keyboard piece that sounds like the intro music to a really epic RPG on a Super Nintendo and I love the way this track actually glides into the next song rain away which is 11 minutes longest song in the entire LP the chimes see a slight return though they don't overtake the whole track in the way that they do on follow and the immense layers of guitar on this track my buddy Austin who occasionally writes for the site actually compared liturgies very maximal guitar layering on this record to that of like a Glenn Branca project and I have to kind of agree and with even more strings as well as horns and a plethora of other sounds Hunter actually creates a more beautiful and and I think triumphant crescendo than he did on quezacotl just a few minutes ago this track is my favorite on the entire LP and it feels like the clothes to a really amazing live performance I mean this entire record for the most part you know despite its obvious flaws and its rough patches feels like it was just an exhilarating musical stage show experimental ancient metal style this track feels so final it feels just but the problem is the ark work keeps going with a few tracks that while I don't totally hate them I feel like they're a little tacked on and don't necessarily play into the aesthetic of the record up until this point for one the song vitriol which has a kind of different vibe these very heavy distorted sub bass hits happening very prominently throughout the song and hunter in a way we have him kind of rapping on this track there's a bit of flow to the way that he is sort of delivering this deadpan spoken word with some incredibly sinister and morbid lyrics and of course there's some a background chanting happening on this track too and some very just dark dreary synthesizers actually wouldn't mind this sonic direction of Hunter were to turn it into a solo project or something like that or maybe even work it into a future liturgy album a little bit more fluidly or cohesive up to new wretches and good but the song kind of meets an abrupt end and so does a total war which feels really like a cliffhanger and maybe that was kind of intentional because in a lot of ways I think hunter sees his music as as a continual thing I don't think he sees any of his pieces necessarily as separate art objects I think with each album he sees himself in this linear progression still I do like the melody on this track and I think more than most songs here there's there's a serious fluidity to how the instrumentation moves on this track despite there being some electronic drums on the song the way the guitars and the percussion moves on this track is so slow and I think graceful and very much together all in all I did enjoy this record I think it's a good album and I think it's incredibly intriguing and for people who might sort of get down on rock music as not being creative right now we're not having new ideas or not taking any risks this is really the record to point them to you know if you want to hear something different going on in rock music bands like Liturgy are at that cutting edge and are trying new things even if it turns a lot of people off turns a lot of people away and doesn't necessarily resonate with everyone and if it doesn't resonate with you if you don't like this record I could certainly understand why you know that I I think the way the digital and organic instrumentation comes together on this record isn't always good a lot of the time sometimes it creates a kind of ugly aesthetic but that combination of the ancient the medieval world and the new and digital world seems like a very conscious fusion on this album I just think it's not always a harmonious fusion I guess I don't think the concept is bad it's just the execution occasionally is just okay I'm feeling a decent of strong seven on this album though I can definitely see this album getting at least at least an honorable mention at the end of the year on my year-end lists there are some people who have kind of disregarded this record as trash and maybe even as trolling um I think you know that's maybe a little too cynical in my opinion I think liturgy is doing some interesting things here and you know it's not always easy on the ears and it's not always pretty and it doesn't always fit snugly into oh is this rock music is it electronic music is it metal music is it even from this century Hunter and company on this record are bringing the other so many things sonically and historically that there's naturally going to be some cognitive dissonance people are going to hear the combination of things on this record and and maybe even wince at first listen thinking that doesn't go together that does not work I had listened to this record again and again to sort of acclimate myself and move past that but but even once I got beyond that wall I thought there were some you know glaring technical flaws and again maybe a little deja vu that that kept me from really being head over heels for this album though again still check it out some interesting things going on here you're probably not going to hear another rock record like this this year yes that was a lot of talking again decent strong seventh on the same transition if you've even the Salma listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana liturgy the ark work forever 
PHQ5pGHLOXY,hey I'm so ticked off why didn't he give Jimmy tips attend why why didn't he do it hi everyone big theny fan brother here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new action bronson album mr. wonderful action bronson is a new york rapper he's been building a name for himself over the past few years with his charismatic personality great flow relentless bars about sex and food and just a touch of old-school East Coast hardcore hip-hop revivalism more nostalgia originally when his earlier material was grabbing attention he caught a lot of heat for the similarity that his delivery is flow his voice has to that of the wu-tang clan's Ghostface Killah but with a series of solid projects features singles he's been able to gain way more favor and fandom than some MCS do who have such painfully obvious influences and I was kind of skeptical myself of Bronson's talents until I actually heard the collaborative mixtape he did with the alchemist rare chandeliers where he won me over with his sense of humor and his clever lines he really came through on this project as a character with a really big personality and that goes a long way in a hip-hop in the internet age I was sort of bored by the blue chips to sequel mixtape that he followed rare chandeliers up with but regardless mr. wonderful has been one of my most anticipated hip-hop albums of 2015 mostly because Bronson has dropped one stellar single after another in promotion of this album I've seen Bronson pull through with solid projects in the past and with these tracks being some of his best so far I thought I really didn't have much to worry about as far as the deep cuts on this album went but when I actually got to listen to mr. wonderful I found an incredible amount of filler and just generally bad tracks that bogged the entire album down which is confusing because I think Bronson could have really done well on this project if he pulled together a no BS album just give us an album of what has brought you to this point your great verses but after the a third of this album the music here really becomes more about bells and whistles and complete distractions and and detours like I said mr. wonderful starts really well not with just gritty hard-hitting boom bat beats that you might be expecting from Bronson or anything like that actually really glitzy and kind of classy instrumentals with a lot of pianos in them a lot of piano rock grooves on this album this really is like the Billy Joel of hip-hop records the song brand new car is a pretty good start to this album there is a horribly sung hook on it I got a banika but it's kind of forgivable because the vibe of the song is so funny it's silly it's ridiculous and Bronson's bars are hilarious a lot of the time making mention of things like eleven bowls of crispix underrated cereal or saying that overseas he probably has tons of kids that he doesn't even know about bronson isn't funny in the way that a comedy rapper might be funny on this album he's just super witty super clever and over the top lyrically preposterous situations and hilarious brags continue on to the next song the rising with big body best who has a really huge presence on this song at one point and the piano led instrumentals especially on this track brings Bronson's music a certain kind of glamour and refinement that his older stuff has been missing but of course bronson still comes through as this funny you vulgar guy so there's kind of an irony to it with tracks like teri and baby blue bronson gets a little emotional over some love on the rocks which goes over pretty well him sort of showing his softer side and with baby blue there is a hilariously bitter chance the rapper features and on the song actin crazy bronson lands on this kind of synthetic smooth instrumental with these reversed chords and he delivers this personal story of coming up in the rap game he still loves his mom he is still easier and he's got a lot of ambition and with the song falconry which brings in mayhem Lauryn it's cool to see Bronson once again linking up with his cohorts mayhem Lorenz versus hilarious talking about how he's been New York since before the bike lane and there are these quirky synth chords on this track a big booming beat there's something kind of circus quality to it but it doesn't go so far down that road that it gets too ridiculous to take seriously at this point I feel like on the album wow this is really good so far I'm like in the clear but that doesn't end up being the case we then get this painfully awkward and time-killing the interlude with god-awful singing throughout the second half of it and the even more awkward city boy blues where we see Action Bronson singing over this kind of light reverb II old-school rock instrumental it kind of feels like I'm listening to like a really bad Hendrix song or something like that the singing all over the track is consistently awful and we only get more of this toward the back end of the album with the even more out of place the passage which feels like a really bad live version of what Bronson is trying to do on city boy blues the instrumentals even more amorphous and difficult to make out the singing is muffled and thrown in the back and Bronson is barely even present on the track a lot of the time we're just kind of getting this dead air live rock instrumentation that really isn't doing that much and with a light in the attic we get a few very sad heart-wrenching bars from Bronson and a decent instrumental but a lot of the time again like with the passage he's nowhere to be seen instead we're getting just just instrumental passages and a really big piano solo song only in America has a horrible homely hook the singing is awful on this track and I can't totally tell if it's just because the the singing is bad or if they're just some really weird terrible effects thrown onto the vocals but the song as well sticks out for a really bad reason the beat seems really thin and kind of loaf I mixed very low and the vocals are pumped up very loud this song seems almost demo quality but it somehow landed on this record and the song Easy Rider while I like it I think it's a great track it's not the most stellar of endings it feels a little anticlimactic with a song that I'm already so familiar with them was released so long ago being the finish of this album and sandwiched in between these fantastic tracks kicking the album off and in the song is just loads and loads of fat and pointless directionless filler some of which might have not been bad if it were just shorter or segwayed from or into tracks more creatively or at least in a way where it felt like it wasn't just some kind of random distraction meanwhile the track galactic love is painfully short shorter than some of these longer tracks that really didn't even deserve a spot on this album and could just be taking up a room for a legitimately good song or single at the end of the day I'm kind of torn on this LP while Bronson did bring some of his best material that effort that he put into tracks like acting crazy and baby blue does not show in a lot of these completely needless tracks I'm feeling strong 5 to a light 6 on the sell P transition if you give in the Selma listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana action bronson forever 
UlLR657vwic,I can't believe it he really didn't give Jimmy tips at Ted this can't be right this can't be right yeah hi everyone up the lobe tanto here the Internet's busiest music a nerd and it's time for review of the new Godspeed you black Emperor album asunder sweet and other distress Godspeed you black Emperor is a montreal-based rock band they've been at it for years but they've also not been at it for a few years I guess what I'm referring to is that they are fresh off of a comeback with their last full-length LP hallelujah dope then ascend which broke a 10-year long studio album silence so now with the silhouette now with this 2012 album Alleluia don't Benson we saw gods be bringing their usual post-rock style and applying they're typically lush and heavy and gritty production aesthetic to some older but yet to be studio album realized material not their most immense release but definitely an acceptable return basically rock instrumentals of drums and guitars elevated by very dramatic strings huge crescendos and builds and there were some Middle Eastern melodies peppered throughout this record - and I was wondering whether or not they would strike while the iron's hot come out with a new LP very soon or if we'd essentially be waiting 10 more years again and here we are with this new album announced just a little bit earlier this year and drop right at the end of this month and it's a short one just 40 minutes for different pieces but they all kind of add up into this one lengthy monstrous piece that the band has been fine-tuning during live shows over the past few years this LP is not really the long epic statement that a lot of god speeds double albums are but the four tracks here do flow together better than Alleluia it does sound like a more cohesive piece and God speed is taking a noticeably different approach on this new record over here right from the very start of the album which doesn't begin with a super subtle and slowly building sound or anything like that we get heavy monstrous crushing riffs hulking riffs that have this bright buzzing tone sounds like a bunch of guitar just kind of playing the riff together in unison with strings backing them up sounds very thunderous it's visceral and hard hitting a lot like a these silver Mount Zion Orchestra album if you're familiar with them they are a god speed side project but a little bit more rock-oriented these days but even though I am catching some whiffs of that what this song really sounds like to me is like an earth track something off of the band's last few records or specifically bees made honey in the lion's skull this is definitely a little psych Rock influence maybe a little sludge metal influenced the riff intervals here on this track definitely resemble that of an earth song there is a similar heavy dramatic Western beep you found track quality to it this track is just blinding sunrays tumbleweeds desert landscapes but with some Middle Eastern melody is kind of peppered in and the strings laced into this track are pretty great the song moves into a few different string movements and features some walls of noise really blazing chaotic guitar solo not something that often occurs on a god speed album and this track eventually kind of coasts into this very fuzz out noisy drone very textured that eventually kind of simmers down into something much more smooth and serene that's essentially the first half of the record and it's not bad sounds fine god speed coming through with that usual high quality fantastic detailed production but not really the same masterful tension building that I usually expect in a god speed record your record you're the second half of this album is really where the album comes to life a little bit more of this once serene but kind of eerie drone turns very dissonant and chaotic ominous there is a storm a-comin and eventually toward the end of this album we get one of the more finishes of any God speed record thus far very aggressive the aggression really is next-level with all these crashing guitars and strings and some diddling bass drums but the thing is the weeping strings and the twinkling guitar leads that play up until this point you are just kind of mild by godspeed standards one part of me thinks that maybe if this record were longer and the band tried to tease things out a little bit more just milk a little bit more drama out of these movements this would have been a better album but then again with shorter runtimes the band's debut LP as well as the slow riot EP are more cinematic and emotionally powerful and have a Wilder approach to experimenting with sound and vocal snippets - of which there are none on this new record surprisingly overall this is a pretty decent release from godspeed it's not terrible by any stretch of the post-rock imagination and it certainly still steps ahead of the many artists the second and third wave post rock artists that have been ripping this band off for years and years and years looking at the basics of what this album has going for it it should be better than it actually is but those feelings of overwhelming triumph or that the apocalypse is right around the corner just don't come through on this record nor are the soundscapes on here all that evocative I feel like God speed is kind of reserved when it comes to Sonic and musical exploration on this album they don't really venture that deeply into that vast monstrous frightening abstract and epic sound landscape they're known for creating on records like lift your skinny fists like antennas to heaven instead they deliver an album that is just so much more straightforward and maybe a little too obvious for them at points if you're a fan I think you should check it out but if you're not familiar with Godspeed there are albums just a little bit earlier in their discography that I would recommend so much harder than this new one I'm feeling a decent too strong on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Godspeed you black Emperor forever 
JFGKCtnjrDU,ix intent a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Sufjan Stevens record Carey and Lowell national treasure indie darling multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter and composer Sufjan Stevens whose discography has grown increasingly eccentric over the years you have his big break out albums loaded with contemporary folk music as well as chamber pop like Michigan and Illinois albums that were not only loaded with tracks that reference the history of these two wonderful states but there were also personal and painfully shy and sad songs on this record as well and that was contrasted by bits of very epic grand lush instrumentation there are also quite a bit of religious undertones that run through many a record from mr. Stevens he has numerous Christmas albums under his belt some of his records are hip-hop themed from the kind of tongue-in-cheek chopped and Scrooged to the sort of weird collaborative project Sisyphus that dropped last year that really went over better than it should have of course there is also the modern classical suite the BQE and instrumental tribute to new york's brooklyn-queens expressway and mr. Stevens is no stranger to electronic music either with records like enjoy your rabbit as well as the age of odds one of his bigger conceptual records with tons of sequence drums and synthesizers and and very textured glitchy electronics not really a high point for me in his discography though it seems to be for many however this new record Carrie and Lowell is taking a much more simple approach soufiane is really stripping layers away remodeling and kind of going back to very acoustic basics this is a very quiet intimate subtle and ballad driven album and incredibly personal to Stevens is really just singing about personal experiences on this album a bobble available and with his vocals as instrumentation he sort of takes a musical tone similar to that of like an Elliott Smith record and his Paul Simon fandom is a bit more readable with things being so simple and straightforward however even though Stevens isn't piling on the sounds and the instrumentation as he typically does this album doesn't feel like a regression or anything like that a lot of the tracks here are actually a testament to Stephens growth as a songwriter that he can come together with pieces of music that are so skeletal and still deliver a compelling song that also has a lot to do with the emotional quality of these tracks and the tales being told in the lyrics from what I can tell the entirety of this album is inspired by the recent passing of Stephens mother and not only does he reflect on her death but a lot of childhood memories as well in relation to her or just family the opening track on this record is gorgeous there's a folky little plucky melody that is very quiet very gentle in the lyrics Stephens is singing about his mother's ghost and forgiveness but reading into this track and others on this LP as well I kind of get the feeling that uh the relationship Stephens had with his mother wasn't the best if I'm hearing things correctly it sounds like Imus long should have known better that Stephens is kind of avoiding his mother in her time of extreme sickness maybe even when she's on her deathbed they're just not talking he's waiting for there to be some kind of cure or some kind of turnaround or something it just seems like he's distancing himself from the situation and he sings about being 3 years old and left at the video store but also acknowledging that the past is the past it seems like on a lot of this record Stevens is trying to come to terms with horrible things he might have done things that he has for a very long time not forgiving his mother for he simultaneously grieving and trying to come to terms with these events in the past that he might have been emotionally scarred by and he does this over fingerpick guitars and some really breezy beautiful background vocals the track drawn to blood seems like Stevens is I guess sort of dealing with the initial shock of some kind of maybe bloody and violent trauma and his approach to this track instrum is so simple the the rhythm of this song is essentially kept by these single electric piano notes and with the only thing which has some fantastic strings on it and the 4th of July we again are getting just very beautiful soft music set against some kind of morbid lyrics and very intense in the way that they approach personal tragedy lyrically Stevens really doesn't pull many punches when it comes to some of the refrains over these alluring folk Diddy's asking should I tear my heart out now or say we're all gonna die I guess my issue though with a lot of this LP is that Stevens vocals for the entire album aren't much louder than a whisper and I guess in theory I don't mind a subtler approach but I think this album specifically could have used a little bit more variety I think the record starts with some good intentions and some great songs too but uh things really I don't want to say fall apart but definitely wind down quality wise in the second half we are met with some songs that have some very abrupt endings the closing track on this album actually features what I would even call a non ending there's kind of these very ethereal tones just pop in out of nowhere and then just glide the track out the entire album out really suddenly Stevens is not really teasing all the potential out of these songs that he could he's really just developing them to the point where he gets some kind of personal emotional exorcism out of them and then just leaving them be which you know could be a good thing or a bad thing for fans I mean I'm sure there are people at this point we're very invested in what Stevens is trying to do with his art emotionally and to know that he is going through such an intense emotional grieving process through the music on this album will definitely attract some listeners and make this album feel special but just looking at this album from a vocal delivery standpoint from the standpoint of you know is is there a variety of approaches and different sounds on this record you know does each song kind of have its own strong personality this record definitely does leave something to be desired because for me as this album drew on there were moments that were really so faint they kind of fell into the background and I think there are some refrains and some lyrics here that the emotional impact of these tracks is sort of lessened by the fact that Stevens just feel so cold and lifeless a lot of the time with his vocals when the album started it certainly felt like maybe he was whispering because he was just on the brink of breaking down and crying but I just kind of feel like that that tension kind of drifted away as the record continued and this whisper-quiet vocal delivery just kind of became a thing just a sound and okay sound versus feeling overall not a bad record in the Sufjan Stevens discography I'm sure that fans are going to love it to death for me personally I thought there were some great tracks here it's definitely beautiful in moments it's certainly pleasant to listen to but I do think there are some lackluster tracks in the second half here and the selfie can be a little one-dimensional I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition what did you think about this album love it hate it why and what should Anthony review next but before he puts out a new video you can check out my channel where I play a lot of stringed instruments sometimes I play Kendrick Lamar songs on an eighth string guitar sometimes I play my own songs other times I or Slayer on banjo so it's a lot of fun and you should check it out and maybe subscribe yeah guitars strings forever 
yKyWZeiRe8c,[Laughter] hi everyone susta nice Penn State oh here keeping you waiting for a little bit for this new curve you know you've been waiting for this album for like eight months you can wait like a couple of days damage Death Grips is a Sacramento based experimental hip hop trio consisting of producer flatlander percussionist producer songwriter Zach Hill and MC ride vocalist crazy man they've been turning the underground on its head since the release of 2011 ex-military their debut mixtape which delivered noisy visceral industrial hip-hop with a punk ethos and even though Death Grips came through with this incredibly aggressive and unwavering uncompromising sound they actually went on to find quite a bit of diversity in their style with subsequent albums like the very catchy and I think they're Poppaea stout and my favorite album in their discography the Money Store the incredibly electronic no love Deep Web the sort of odd and short and very instrumental government plates they also had that instrumental album that dropped in the midst of the two discs of this new double LP The Powers That Be the first disc of which came out last year and was definitely Death Grips most abstract set of tracks yet loaded with dizzying rhythms as SSI or cocoa samples songs that had really unusual structures to them yet all the tracks segwayed into one another making the entire LP feel like one cohesive piece and this record wasn't a bad listen but since it was announced as the first half of a double album Death Grips essentially kept fans waiting like you know almost a year for the second half of this double LP J death bland has essentially been the rallying cry of nail-biting fans all throughout 2014 fans that might not be 100% aware BDSM style relationship Death Grips has with its listeners and the music industry in general Death Grips does give its listeners pleasure through explosive genre defying music but there's also disappointment and tension building and thirst building that Death Grips actively engages in with their fans and the music industry through canceled shows the way that they interact with their fans in the industry so elusively and stand offish lead from social media and message boards leaking the no love deep web album which got them dropped from Epic Records also putting a penis on that album cover making fans wait this long for Jenny death the sudden breakup they announced scroll down on a napkin although just recently on Facebook they said that they might make more more what I don't know and then the fact that they just said might we might because just breaking up and staying broken up is just far too define the decision for Death Grips just always wanting to keep people just on the edge of their seats however we are right now at a point of release because the second half of the powers-that-be has been dropped Jenny death which has a very different feel to its sister album that I will sort of go back to and talk a little bit about toward the end of this review but as far as Jenny death goes for a record that has been anticipated for as long as Jenny death as it does a pretty decent job of living up to the hype there are no Bjork samples on this record and Death Grips essentially is back to their incredibly hard-hitting selves with a series of very succinct songs that work better as you know singles individual tracks and they do as a holistic piece Death Grips comes through with a load of crushing powerful courses on this record and for the first time Death Grips is not only embodying that punk attitude with just that really confrontational outward appearance but they're actually embodying punk music in sound as well on this project by bringing quite a bit of original guitars into the mix there's a good chunk of songs on this album that features some prominent guitars that are kind of brittle in tone some of the riffs are a little hardcore inspired Jenni death is one of Death Grips catchiest most upfront and sonically potent records yet and it all kicks off with the song I break mirrors with my face in the United States wonderful title and this track feels like just a speedy bustling hard-hitting piece of cyberpunk like Atari Teenage Riot inspired there are some very nutty and just very textured percussion in the background wailing tones and over it Stephon MC ride is just yelling manically I recognized my face in the United States I don't care about real-life Death Grips is one of the few bands out there to embrace the digital age with such an incredible amount of grit and the way I interpret this track is that we have Death Grips smashing mirrors reflections of reality and sort of pulling their listeners into the internet because the Internet is kind of Death Grips den of Horrors now I'm not gonna say this track is amazing songwriting wise but lyrically and sonically it is fantastic start to this record and it is a fantastic manifesto for Jennie death we glide from this track into inanimate sensation which in my track review for that track I talked about how this song was sort of about fake digital feelings again we have Death Grips here kind of rejecting reality talking about later in this track Halla Stefan likes his iPod more than fucking there are also nods to rock machismo at some points of this track and with the kind of romping drum beyond this song and the constantly escalating electronic sounds in the background that are very textured kind of distorted along with the screaming vocals is all at once these constantly revving sounds is just another example of Death Grips with each record always trying something new always onto something different finding another way to make something completely whacked out and also blood pumping and when the lyrics initially kick in on this track it's like the band has just reached through the speaker's run their fists into my ear canal and just kind of swishing my brain around and beating it until it's a lump of goop and this might kind of go unnoticed because of how electrifying and aggressive this song is but what this tracks multiple parts the really great refrain below and the intense finish how each part of this song has a different kind of feel to it death grips really are pretty skilled songwriters now with the song turned off we actually have the guitars kind of taking over for a little bit these just burnt brittle guitars the chorus is incredibly hard-hitting has this hardcore inspired riff but it's also very psychedelic with Stefan's vocals kind of soaked in EKKO this track and and many other songs on this record are really overwhelming there's a lot of layers of different sounds all together but it doesn't stop Death Grips from having a lot of punch there are spots where I felt like the guitars and the drums could have been a little bit more defined maybe they sort of just muddy each other a little bit it also feels like there's a bit of an electronic buzz running throughout some parts of this track too but uh emcee rides vocals just really pop out of this track delivering some of his most insane lyrics yet talking about that he's been spinning chambers since he was a little kid that he smoked cigarettes in the shower when they get wet he lights another he prefers a cardiac attack over cancer to just sort of you know just have a quick death there are actually a lot of references to death and suicide on this record which given the title of Jenny that it's not really that surprising and it is a Death Grips record too and you know it's also worth noting that as far as the energy behind Stefan's performance on this track it's a pretty immense at times especially when he sort of squelches out from his vocal cords moving on from here we have why a bitch got a lie which kind of continues that cyberpunk aesthetic that the first track kicked off with but it kind of takes it a step further with this oddly danceable beat on the chorus and some vocal effects that feel kind of vocoder Eska definitely results in this really unreadable and very loud and in-your-face robot voice throughout much of this song which kind of kills interpreting these lyrics without going out and reading them but it actually adds a really interesting sonic texture for this track that really makes it stick out we also have them on this song and others here to a laughing very menacingly to the point where it is very creepy and there are moments in the lyrics here where Death Grips I think are kind of Tooting their own horn a little bit getting kind of braggadocious saying try and tame me and sort of putting forward this idea that Death Grips is a kind of animalistic and limitless again we kind of had these heavy hardcore riffs on the chorus here and I just feel like I'm listening to so many genres of music crash together at once hip hop and punk music and electronic music and and psychedelic music as well yet they're all working together so cohesively Death Grips continues to be this mind-blowing Frankenstein monster of a different musical genres and and that is only highlighted even further with the next tracks which is an oddly danceable and maybe even a twerk worthy bit of kind of off-kilter hip-hop it's really messed up the way this track sounds it's kind of groovy but also like mutant like and lyrically we actually get a few references to tracks off of the first half of the songs fuck me out and have a SATCOM in a way I think the chorus here kind of highlights the cheapness of sex and maybe brings a little bit of context to have a sad come but there's also kind of a demented edge to this track to making reference to pissing on someone's face in the chorus in the title track of this record I will leave it simply by saying this is Death Grips loudest song period it's just so freakin blown out and this burst of volume is only emphasized by rides lyrics right beforehand saying oh no back to do and some of the lyrics for the back end of this track actually signaled to me really what Death Grips has been about all along philosophically aesthetically comparing I guess their competition to like a sterilized white flag I've never heard Death Grips glow so much on a record but with how hard-hitting Jenny death is they have quite a bit of reason to glow I think because they definitely do make a lot of really abrasive music and and just even normal regular everyday music seem very I guess really wimpy and measly and maybe even inauthentic even though to an extent I'm sure what Death Grips delivers to us time and time again on each album his enacted as a stage show it is a performance but there's something just really real and tangible about it too tangible about the aggression and the extremity of it now sadly the record actually goes into what I think is my least favorite track in the track listing here beyond alive where I actually find the guitar parts of this track to be kind of weak this album to me is a lot like the first half of the powers-that-be in that we kind of have this sort of one instrument or sound that is a bit of a recurring theme on a lot of the tracks there it was Bjork's voice here it is this guitar and a lot like with the inclusion of Bjork's vocals this guitars inclusion isn't always fantastic the diddling theme melody that pops up again and again gets a little stale and while I don't mind the distorted fight riff that builds up to the chorus and the hard-hitting chorus as well but as soon as the distortion gets sucked out of the guitars and we're kind of getting these you know watery kind of slinky guitar chords that are pretty mild and mid-paced the guitars really lose a lot of flavor and energy for me and despite the really nmuk string like melody on the track centuries of damn as well as some really immense lyrics to this track is not really without its blemishes as well with some very kind of a pathetically droning loud blaring guitar chords there's two chords kind of switching back and forth that I don't really bring much if anything to the song the track really could have done without them however these guitars really make a comeback on the track on GP which is another track from this track listing here that I did an individual track review for I said it was Death Grips most depressing track suicidally themed and in a way kind of ballad like maybe even the closest to a ballad Death Grips will ever get there's a really fantastic lead guitar melody on this track that again I will say is is very hard rock influenced maybe even just a little Led Zeppelin esque some chilling organs on this track too and some amazing and and almost frightening lyrics delivered by stefan during the more toned-down moments of this song the track sounds better in the track listing here then it did by itself but the entire record actually finishes off with this really weird nutty kind of industrial somewhat techno influenced instrumental Death Grips 2.0 which isn't really that satisfying of a closing to this album I think on GP would have made for a better finish but still I think Death Grips 2.0 is more of a message than it is a song for a few different reasons one this track kind of sounds like what could be the background music for some kind of fantastic bit of film at the end of a really great movie sort of showing the AHA the the bad guy the monster he's not dead he's back and then some crazy to be continued signed flashes in front of the audience's eyes saying uh there's gonna be more on the way the music really has that kind of tone to it there's also the fact that the ending is so abrupt and this track overall does kind of feel like a cliffhanger and just to think about the title of this track too Death Grips 2.0 are they're saying that this album was Death Grips 2.0 maybe but the way that I read it is that Death Grips 2.0 is on the way now as far as the first half of the powers-that-be I'm not going to get too deep into it if you really want to know some more defined thoughts on each individual track I recommend checking out my older review of that record I will drop a link in the description box and there also be a link at the end of this video to I still think it's a great project which I was kind of afraid to put a score on and and have too many definitive thoughts about until I had heard Jenny death and I I will say even though I do enjoy it I don't think Jenny death is really making me rethink it at all outside of a few tracks that are blatantly referenced on to me really these are two very different albums I mean Jenny death has some very bold upfront in-your-face themes and concepts going on in the lyrics dealing with the digital world and death these two records flow very differently there are two very different lengths as well they're aesthetically different they take two very different approaches to song structuring as well one album of tracks being very abstract and obtuse and difficult to make sense of the other having very defined verses and choruses a lot of the tracks being incredibly catchy and visceral these two albums only feel like a double album in the fact that they've been billed as a double album I really don't think these two albums enhance one another at least not in any kind of traditional way maybe in a sense they highlight and make very apparent their differences and maybe in the world of Death Grips that's exactly what makes them perfect sister albums bitch but you have Death Grips most ambiguous release stapled to one of the most our records yet both coming together for over 80 minutes of mind-bending insanity and maybe separating these two albums wasn't the worst thing in the world because with this album being so difficult maybe it did take a little bit more time to digest kind of wrestle with this album make heads or tails of it and also come to appreciate how unint portable this album is and how absurd some of the parts of this record are especially the end of Lala and Big Dipper and fuck me out still though I don't think this record is without its its potholes the Bjork samples do get a little incessant and I still do think the start of black quarterback is unnecessarily cluttered Louis I think these two records actually end up adding up to one of the most impressive records in Death Grips discography so far I'm feeling a like decent 9:00 on the powers-that-be transition tell me what you think about this album did you like the shit did you hate the shit and why do you like or hate sad shit and what should Anthony review next because he doesn't fucking know half the goddamn time I don't even know what I'm doing half forgot down time I'll go by the name of the granddad or

B5OHCV2rVX4,ah make the NEMA say goes here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Laura Marling album short movie Laura Marling is a uk-based contemporary full music singer and songwriter she's been added since the aughts this is her fifth full-length LP and even though I'm really yet to love a Laura Marling album with her past work I've always been sort of lured by her very gentle solo guitar playing very husky womanly voice some decent lyricism as well and with each album I've heard from her thus far there's always been at least a couple flashes of genius just really solid tracks however in the past I have had a hard time wrestling with other cuts on Laura's albums songs that might have the tendency to I guess wander a little bit in meander and maybe feel a little obtuse or esoteric because of that usually I think Laura's music is pretty meditative though not always memorable but I have kind of stuck in there and I did have kind of high hopes for this new album over here and for the most part I did get what I had hoped for I did get what I sort of expected from Laura a more pointed direct and concise album if you want to hear this more concise shift in songwriting you only have to listen to some of the lyrics on these tracks like the song don't let me bring you down there's one moment on this track where Laura says directly do I look like I'm around no Laura you don't Laura even goes as far as to incorporate some punchy drums and electric guitar on a few of these songs here specifically the song false hope which is the loudest song on the entire record here having kind of a garage rock folk rock sort of feel to it and while some very quiet singer songwriters might kind of continue to stay quiet when they incorporate more electric instrumentation Laura instead actually steps up her vocal game and brings some very nice vocal harmonies and some passion is singing you might already be into some of Laura's contemporaries like Courtney Barnett and first aid kit angel Olson and Sharon Van Etten and if you like any of those artists or maybe even more classic singer songwriters like Joni Mitchell or Patti Smith maybe even a little Fiona Apple I think you'll get something out of this record topically here with short movie a lot of the time Laura is addressing love and kind of the darker more unhappy side of that on the song I feel your love there are some really interesting lyrics on this track Laura seems to be blinded by the love that she has with this person and this is something that she despite the blindness requests and wants to take on it's like she wants to be wrapped up in this love she's singing about to the point where she kind of loses control of herself really loses control of her senses and the mostly acoustic track warrior which kicks the album often is one of the better tracks here it's very patient it's very slow has a lot of psychedelic vast just reverb e effects on the track which really goes along with the theme of searching and finding on this song and this track is also kind of about falling in love with someone and kind of seeing that person as a hero as a warrior and then maybe down the line not really finding in him what you came to assume or what you thought you saw was there and the song strange is a very up-tempo acoustic track with hand drums and in spoken word and talks about love not in kind of a lusty or an out-of-control kind of thing but more of a thing of no responsibility and an honor Laura sings about somebody who maybe sees the world a different way and old age has opened up his eyes for whatever reason and now has made all these life choices like getting married having kids choices that you can't necessarily a you know reverse and kind of encourages this person to I guess kind of stick with their choices and just be a man which on the one hand is is really a grown-up thing to do but on the other hand I mean that's how you know a lot of families get torn apart people sort of sticking with their horrible decisions sometimes they get the feeling on this album that Laura is dealing with some really tough situations but maybe she doesn't go into them with the I guess the the tact and the nuance and the detail that that maybe one should and on this track specifically maybe I'm sort of assuming things because the second verse we were hearing a story about a totally different person on this track but it almost seems as if Laura is the second woman on this track and you know she's sort of the mistress of this person who has this wife and has these kids and she's telling that person to maybe go back there and you know be a good family man the tangled web we weave even some of the more toned down and subtle tracks on this LP or or maybe a little more direct than some of Laura's past work as well like the song easy which features some fantastic very quiet strings in the background is really lifting up the acoustic ballad making it sound even more gorgeous and the song how can i we're lyrically laura is talking a lot about taking risks and and putting yourself out there romantically or just kind of put yourself in life where you feel like you need to be even if that means hurting someone's feelings or stepping outside of your comfort zone however with this track I feel like the risk that's being talked about here is just being honest and being really frank which is not to be misconstrued with being daring which despite the efforts made on this album I don't think this album is and even though I do like a lot of this LP I'm not completely head over heels for it some songs I'm just kind of on the fence with for example the song don't let me bring you down which has is so so instrumental and a really prominent drum beat that sounds like someone's smacking a trash can which really does not compliment the song that well and Laura's tendency toward talk singing on this record gets a little stale sometimes specifically on the daughter on this track against intensifying instrumentation Laura's performances really just kind of subdued and as she tries to pick up the volume and the passion toward the back end of the track she actually strains her voice pretty audibly which I think in the mix they might have tried to mask by bringing the guitars up a little louder but it's still very very clear some of Laura's older work I found to be just a little too quiet and indirect and standoffish and as she has tried to be more straightforward with this album I don't think it's totally you know fixed every issue I think a while it is an improvement in a way new problems have in a sense and there are songs on here such as howl which to me are just as sleepy and slow-motion and impenetrable as some of Laura's older stuff so that's not really a vibe or a sound or direction she's overcome entirely with this album nor do I think that was something she was trying to do intentionally throughout the entire LP anyway overall this is pretty decent singer-songwriter album like I said earlier I'm not totally in love with it but there are plenty of highlights here many of them on the first half of the album and the title track on here is fantastic as well Laura I still find to be a pretty compelling singer I think she has a very sweet easygoing personality and vibe in her music but she's definitely bolder than usual on here though not always impressive but even in the more lackluster moments on this album it's at least pleasant to listen to on feeling a strong 6 to late 7th on this thing transition if you give him this album will listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Laura Marling short movie forever 
qTmHuavOXNg,BAM hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kendrick Lamar album to pimp a butterfly West Coast rapper black hippy member Top Dawg entertainment member Kendrick Lamar and I've been telling you telling you since 2011 Kendrick Lamar has something he's got something going on section 80 great album and album on which Kendrick showcased a kind of nasal high-pitched voice but a lot of personality he had flow he had a lot to say and he had a knack for writing catchy kind of accessible enjoyable hip hop songs with a socially aware edge a talent he would go on to sharpen with his next full-length LP good kid maad city an album that in a few short years has been widely acknowledged as one of hip-hop's best records and one of modern music's best concept albums this record told the story a story of a young Kendrick Lamar or maybe many a young man from Compton California caught up in dreams of success peer pressure drugs gang violence the record is a fantastic nuanced and very detailed character portrait this was really Kendrick Lamar's break out album he was sounding so much less like an outsider with this LP with the Drake feature the trendier beats the dr. Dre feature big singles like swimming pools that had a trap influenced instrumental as well as a message that was obviously anti substance abuse but the song was kind of masked as a drinking song even though I loved this record when it came out and I still love it now I couldn't help but feel like Kendrick kind of compromised on this album I'm gonna make trendier music but I'm gonna do it on my own terms and even if it is trendy or I don't really mind if the music itself and the the message behind the music is fantastic but I was left after this album wondering where could Kendrick go after this will he continue to try to appeal to more mainstream tastes in a way I felt like that might have been the case the first time I heard I the blend of pop hip hop and soul on that track certainly had kind of a radio friendly sound and the track actually ended up winning Kendrick a few Grammys kind of proving that songs pop appeal but instead of just hanging in this safe zone and and making bland door music Kendra continued to experiment and make some pretty bold statements like with the track blacker the berry then we started getting word of some of Kendricks collaborators and producers on this record people like Flying Lotus George Clinton of Parliament Funkadelic bassist extraordinaire Thundercat underrated FEM si Rhapsody one of the Isley Brothers and neo-soul singer Bilal among others and this change really shows up in the sound of this album there is not a trendy instrumental insight anywhere on this record there is no swimming pools and Kendrick is very upfront with the sonic direction of this album with a lot of strong instrumentals pulling from jazz some really groovy parliament-funkadelic inspired drums and bass psychedelic smooth dreamy creamy neo soul the instrumental flavor of this record has a distinctly old-school tone to it like Kendrick is really going back to the glory days of dr. Dre Snoop the farside and Tupac but there's something really modern and detailed about these beats to Kendrick even pulls a left hook in the tracklisting here by tossing in a live performance version of the song I rather than leaving in the gussied-up studio version which I actually prefer this move the raw aesthetic of the live performance of this track sounds fantastic the Isley Brothers sample interpolation on the song goes over pretty well and there's kind of an Outkast hey-yah vibe on this track to throwing this version on the record actually plays into the narrative of the album this anthem about self-love and self-esteem I think in a way Kendrick kind of sees this song as falling on deaf ears with the crowd of people he's trying to communicate it to which is why toward the end of the song the track gets derailed by a really kind of I guess angry frustrated and restless crowd with whom Kendra tries to plead and asks for you know calmness civility telling him that black people are tired of playing the victim saying that he has no time to waste time the very next track on here mortal man you kind of see Kendrick Lamar lyrically questioning the devotion of his fans asking them if they will still be a fan when the shit hits the fan and it's stuff like this that sets Kendrick apart from not just other rappers but specifically other conscious rappers while it seems like Kendrick might want to fix the world in a way I think he kind of sees it as futile or maybe even like an impossible task but for an artist like Kendrick changing minds with your art is a worthy cause worth the effort even if the boulder of problems in front of you moves just only in inch after you drop dead of exhaustion after all of your trying to pimp a butterfly is structured in a pretty interesting way it's not a story album it's not another good kid maad city it's like a series of separate but very much connected vignettes and given how dramatic and grand and rich a lot of the instrumentation and the vocal performances on this record are I actually feel like I'm watching not just listening but watching in my mind a really elaborate stage show and that is not a far-fetched comparison considering all the strange sonic detours on this record the effects the instrumental interludes the various voices we have Kendrick changing up his flow his voice is inflection constantly a pretty wide instrumental palette you have smooth sexy funk music on here like with the song these walls and then you have hardcore hip-hop with just a little bit of 90s boom bap inspiration on blacker the berry and this is something I've never heard before we have this poem being told at the end or maybe at the very beginning of nearly every track on this album and as Kendrick starts this poem with each attempt he just gets a little further into the poem each time reciting what he has already said in the poem on previous tracks and whatever words he leaves off on before the next track starts sort of dictate the theme or how tell you about the oncoming track and then at the very end of the album he tells the entire poem that he's written and it reveals a few different things one that this entire poem ties up very beautifully every single theme on the album and the second thing that's revealed is that the entire time Kendrick has been telling this poem to Tupac yes he's telling this poem to Tupac he just sort of you know talks a little bit after he's finished and you know goes to ask a question and and who is answering back none other than Tupac Shakur and Kendrick continues to converse with this no longer alive man about things like politics and money and success in the music industry in a very natural way I thought this was like an actor or maybe some kind of crazy voice hologram thing because you know we had the dance and Snoop Dogg Tupac hologram thing and thing anything anything but then I came to learn that everything Tupac is saying comes from this old interview recorded in the 90s Kendrick took his favorite snippets from it and then wrote the questions afterwards and pulled together this just beautifully cohesive conversation it's really a mindfuck moment and then he ends the entire track off with another poem recitation that actually sort of ties up and explains the whole to pimp a butterfly theme which is actually pretty beautiful and makes me feel bad for anybody who is a you know currently hating on the title of this album because it actually has quite a bit of poignant sand meaning if you actually pay attention to the final words of this record so there are some completely new and whacked-out things that Kendrick does all over this record and and every single one of them goes over incredibly well flying colors and he has a lot to say on this record as well like with his previous albums and even though Kendrick on this album is addressing a lot of hot-button issues taking on things that we see is as being very large and very political he brings it down and makes it person makes it relatable or at least emotional or something to sympathize with he's not this rapper who's just gonna like spit statistics at you like oh this many people died feel something rather than that Kendrick gives you a compelling point of view or at least connects the dots so that you can kind of see why someone would have the mindset that he has or the mindset of people who he might be talking about war portraying on this album he does this as he raps about black artists who are blinded by money and fame and success while simultaneously being exploited by the music industry he raps about living up to musical and political heroes he raps about trying to stay in touch with his roots and his neighborhood and his friends while being this really prominent entertainment figure we have black pride and black confidence on this record but also conversely racism versus the black community and the black community versus the black community and his lyrics are consistently witty and thoughtful and poetic and nuanced but there are moments on here where Kendrick doesn't really mince words either one line in particular that it's actually pretty awesome where he's talking about music critics saying that they miss when rap was about rapping if that were the case motherfucker killer Mike would be platinum I agree as well as Kendricks proclamations of this dick ain't free on the for free interlude track where he's kind of talking about issues of slavery and sexuality on the song - a track that fuses together beat poetry jazz and like this Saul Williams s insanity it was really a moment for me on the album when I first heard it I thought is this genius or is this garbage but but it only took one more listen to figure out yeah yeah it's genius and this track actually is the biggest sense of humor of any song here while this record does have a few bones to pick it's not necessarily just Kendrick shoving ideology down your throat or even really tell you what to think because there are moments here where Kendrick will say something out of one side of his mouth and then maybe he'll contradict himself a little but not necessarily just contradicting himself I sort of see it as him trying to engage with maybe every side of the issues he's trying to tackle showing that heavy problems such as the ones addressed on this record aren't just black and white they're layered onions that have a lot of different factors but despite his best intentions there will always be people who the moment they feel something political is going on at a piece of art they will reel back thinking they're too good to be told anyone else's point of view because they know the way the world works and even if you are that kind of person I ask you to give this album a fair shot because it's not like Kendrick half-asses his bars on this record I think he tries to give these topics a lot of care he's not delivering some kind of reblogged 140-character bumper sticker philosophy on this album if you listen to these songs and all you get from them is Kendricks just bitching about being black in America Kendrick thinks white people suck well that's really kind of a basic point of view and not because Kendricks being basic because you're being basic so get off that and really listen to what he's trying to say on this record cuz the way Kendrick goes about addressing things like race and sex and fame and money on this album is so artful that this record could go toe-to-toe with any album that tries to address wider social issues this entire LP kicks off with the incredibly funky fun and mystical Wesley's theory wait back up the entire record actually starts off with a sample of this Boris Gardner song which if you give a listen to this track it's actually a really fantastic manifesto for a lot of the moments on this album that have kind of a racial pride angle to them so do give this track a listen if you want a bit more context for this album but really what this track Kendrick is kind of tipping a hat to mr. Wesley Snipes and on the verses here he's rapping as characters once again in the first verse he's a successful artist who was blinded by the fame and to throw his money away on everything the second verse here we have an Uncle Sam character who is kind of taking advantage of this artist's ignorance to the industry and his money-making capability on this track Kendrick tries to portray that that this type of success comes with its risks and its debts the instrumental here is fantastic with appearances from George Clinton I love his lyrics on this track I love his vocal delivery look both ways before you cross my band Thundercats base on here fantastic and these wailing g-funk synthesizers are great to the matically the song for sale which is a very psychedelic dreamy interlude track it's actually longer than a lot of the other tracks here but interlude all the same this track is gorgeous and talks about a lot of the same stuff moving forward we get the p-funk James Brown concoction of King Kunta and with all the cartoony and zany background vocals and the kind of sad guitar line on this track as well as the uppity flow I dare say the song feels a little like old school and manemma influence too and on this track we see Kendrick kind of portraying himself as coming from just lowly beginnings but now that he's at his artistic peak or at least what we think is his artistic peak right now he is kind of this King Kunta figure the song bees walls is an incredibly sexy track about sex as well as abusing one's fame I think to get laid which plays into the bit of the poem that was recited right before this track Kendrick actually makes direct reference to this poem in the third verse of this song where he says he's sleeping with this girl who's man might actually be like in jail right now then we have songs like institutionalized where Kendrick has a lot of love for and a really strong desire to return to his old neighborhood despite the fact that he's this great success now and he could really live anywhere he wants to and it's really multifaceted track with one beat shift after another but sort of bringing the track from one moment to the next is a Snoop Dogg with kind of a Slick Rick flow inspired by the track children's story when my favorite hip hop song of all time and also on this track too we have Kendrick making reference to his grandmother and one of the refrains here talking about if you want shit to change you better clean or wipe your ass sort of putting it on Kendrick that if he wants things to change if he wants things to be different he has to enact that change he has to put in the work in order to make that change occur that personal responsibility I sort of see as another major theme of this album especially on tracks like the very intense song you where Kendrick sort of puts on himself a lot of bad things going down with family with friends maybe not blaming himself directly but sort of getting really angry at himself tearing himself apart emotionally for like not being there for his relatives and for the death of a friend the second half of this song is incredibly heartbreaking and as Kendrick whipping out that flow where his voice is cracking and breaking all over the place a lot like on the song bad city but rather than kind of pulling out this voice to portray like a young innocent kid he's really just broken up and drinking and you like get the bottle sounds in this album here it's like he's drinking in the middle of his verses literally I mean you hear the alcohol swishing around you hear the lips smacking against the bottle and being there for people who are close to you for your family are themes that come up again on tracks like mama as well as hood politics when these songs begin they end on a moment in the poem where Kendrick is just going totally insane due to the very lush life he's been living and he was going back to his home for answers he kind of mocks himself a little bit saying that you know because he made this grand comment on the place where he's from he knows everything when in reality he kind of feels out of touch and with the track hood politics I don't totally have this track deciphered but the way I'm interpreting it thus far it's a little bit like the art of peer pressure part 2 he's returning home and maybe falling back into his old way of doing things a little bit and maybe how Kendrick is feeling on this track can be added up to the survivors Gill he talks about in the ongoing poem at the end of this song that he inches a little bit further in on and this sort of survivor's guilt makes him feel anxious and kind of uncomfortable that this lack of comfort in one's own skin is kind of put at ease on the song you ain't got a lie where Kendrick I think in a way comes to the conclusion that he can be himself but also be this prominent musical figure a lot like in the same way that we have the song you that is just filled with self-loathing but Kendrick eventually progresses toward I that moment where he has that self-esteem that pride that loss and the song I is surrounded by a handful of other tracks that delve into self-love self a introspection like black or the berry as well as complexion with Rhapsody to pimp a butterfly not only comes back to the trappings of Fame but also trying to use one's status in the music world for a positive gain not just for you but your listeners and just the world that you exist in it's not a story in the same way that good kid maad city is a story but we see kendrick change from this overly indulgent emotional wreck to this bold confident graceful smart next level human being a few years ago a lot of people got on me when I reviewed good kid maad city saying why not attend I mean how much better can it get well I think this album answers that question I see to pimp a butterfly as being more daring more ambitious more unique lyrically stellar and while this album does have a philosophy to divulge Kendrick doesn't skimp on the music on this album he realizes that making music is about the music if the music under your message is garbage the music is garbage so he has graced his messages in his point of view and his personal tales on this album with delicate detailed wonderful bits of jazz and funk and wherever else his heart takes him this album instrumentally would actually be a really sweet listen as well this project really marches to the beat of its own drum and it might be to its detriment to an extent because the people who might have gravitated toward the trendier sounds on good kid maad city might take a bite of this record and just say yuck instantaneously to some of those people I might say try listening to a hip-hop record that came out before 2010 other people though might have a beef with this record being so dense lengthy and kind of difficult to trudge through if you're not enjoying every single track on this album the songs on here do require quite a bit of attention even though I do think there are incredibly catchy standouts throughout the tracklist here like alright as well as I and blacker the berry and it's fantastic that for as famous Kendrick is right now for as grand as this album is and for all the success that it's seeing Kendrick has continued to make music that is down-to-earth and what's even cooler some of the most obscure names in the feature list here are sometimes the most prominent people on the record because it was just a few years ago just several years ago that Kendrick was the underdog in hip hop and now he's making what could possibly be the best rap record of the decade Kendrick has remained incredibly self-aware and down-to-earth as he has gone through this artistic metamorphosis into a butterfly or really the face of hip hop's next generation Kendrick is someone who I think signifies a new chapter and hopefully maybe a turn of the final page on the remnants of the bling era that have been holding on for dear life I'm not trying to say every artist should try to make this record I mean you know you only get so many Kendrick Lamar's so be happy with the ones that you get but it's albums like this that people use as benchmarks in musical history and it just happens to be fantastically enjoyable as well I'm feeling a ten on this record Tran it's 4:00 a.m. I'm going to bed it's 4:00 a.m. I'm going to bed it's 4:00 a.m. I'm going to bed 
k1qQr-X_GLE,hi everyone give the knee hugs tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rat King mixtape 700 fill Rat King new york experimental hop outfit I haven't always been crazy for their sound but for the most part I do think they are kind of progressive they really won me over with their last full-length LP so it goes not too long ago an album that features just I think a futuristic take on the typically hardcore and grimy hip hop that you loved hearing coming out of New York very dense noisy ethereal instrumentals on this thing aggressive vocal deliveries between the verses and the singing of Wicky and hack and sporting life's instrumentals racking has a lot of personality and some really good tunes too case in point canal so suddenly not too long ago Rat King drops this 700 fill mixtape via BitTorrent you download BitTorrent then you download this mixtape it's nine cuts 38 minutes to get straight to it I'm not really digging it it's not the exciting mind-expanding and and I think adventurous experience that so it goes was really it feels kind of like a watered down version certainly this new mixtape here is similar in style there are similar drum Tambor's and and grooves there's a similar atmosphere to the instrumentals on this album but Rat King doesn't densely pack them with sounds as they previously have in the past and I'm not really sure what the I guess the appeal of this projects more minimalistic take is because it's not like there are fantastic hooks filling that space and it's not like Rat King is bringing super fiery exciting verses on this project either I mean the entire tape kicks off with numerous verses from wiki hack and a few guests and it's just one sleepy set of bars after another when we're not getting lackluster verses we're getting these non hooks or just spaces where there should be hooks and instead we're just getting you know just dead air and when we're not getting that we're getting life list singing in place of a hook the only good hook on this entire project is on the very last song little too late the song make it work this track is simultaneously in my opinion the only redeeming song in the tracklist here there are a few decent and surprising features in the track listing here namely death spot for one but even the song he's featured on is so lackluster and so uneventful even though I do like his verse I'm just not even tempted to go back to me this project I'm not really sure if rat King took it that seriously it just feels like a placeholder kind of an opportunity to work with a brand as big as BitTorrent and kind of a reminder to all of us that hey we're here we're still existing and we're gonna come out with new music eventually new music that you might actually like and while I do appreciate the reminder of rat King's existence I wish they reminded me with just maybe a little bit more enthusiasm this tape it just feels like some kind of undercooked detail lacking leftovers from the sporting life vault with just some like random 16s thrown on top didn't really feel like rat King was trying to write a song on this one or really even bring that exciting of a sound just kind of feels like they're shooting the because even the best cuts here are really at least a little underdeveloped I'm feeling a decent strong four on this thing transition if you've given this project listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh rat King forever 
2JVBUPfxD44,hi everyone ring theny ding tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new modest mouse album strangers to ourselves modest mouse is in Oregon via Washington indie rock band fronted by singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist isaac brock who through modest mouse lent his very unique vocal style to some of my favorite rock records of the 90s and the 2000s like this is a long drive and the lonesome crowded West the moon and and arctica as well as good news for people who love bad news that LP came out 2004 and it was really Modest Mouse's break out album and and really a breakout album for indie rock and indie pop in the 2000s as well in the mid-2000s you had a lot of once underground acts slowly grabbing the attention of wider audiences with just newer approaches and newer sounds and fantastic songs and that was true of modest mouse as well with great singles like float on the world at large and the good times are killing me really fantastically written catchy bittersweet pop rock tunes and the deep cuts on good news for people who love bad news were twangy folky really emotionally intense maybe not as raw as Modest Mouse's older stuff but modest mouse I think did a great job with this album over here of ascending from their raw beginnings to something a little bit more neatly put together something more mature and refined case in point the song Bukowski as well as the track the devil's work day a track where I think a little bit of a Tom Waits influence pours through and Modest Mouse's music so modest Mouse taking on more influences better sound poppier tracks more accessibility went over really well for them on this LP but in 2007 when they followed this record up with with with with we were dead before the ship even sank trending in that direction in my opinion led to just an overall milder album just really an all-around forgettable LP for me unfortunately with this record over here and you know I'm not really entirely sure as to what we can say is the definitive reason that it's taken so long for my mouse to follow this record up it's been about eight years since the release of this album I heard in an NPR interview that Isaac felt that you know he just needed to wait for this album and he didn't want to put out anything that he considered to be crap I guess he didn't want to rush this project and I felt like that might have been the right decision to make when I started hearing some of the teaser tracks from this album a couple of which have been a little polarizing but for the most part I enjoyed them the song lampshades on fire has a danceable Rock groove Isaac's trademark manic vocal style and a really sticky vocal melody that I want to sing along with before I even know what the lyrics of the song are there's some kind of zany group vocals on the bridge of this song there are some twang guitars in this track to some keyboards it's a detailed fun energetic well-written rock song and in my opinion it sort of takes modest mouse back to the glory days of good news for people who love bad news and if they could return with a new record here with that same energy and the same quality songwriting and the same eccentricity then why not I would enjoy it but once this album kicks off and I'm into the first track of I get the feeling very quickly that I'm in for a very different album the opening track of this record is the title track and typically Modest Mouse is not the kind of band to waste in intro song in the past they've either started off an LP very boldly with a bright loud sound really grab your attention on records like good news as well as the lonesome crowded West or they kicked off tracks on the moon in Antarctica as well as this is a long drive with songs that are just overpoweringly sad really just pulling you in from the opposite side of the emotional spectrum this opening cut here on this latest record really does neither it's this lethargic string back ballad with Isaac Brock's vocals about as audible as a whisper this track just feels like a too tired to make any kind of memorable moves and unfortunately the deeper cuts beyond the initial singles and beyond this introductory track don't really offer much in the way of relief there are some cuts on this record just like with Modest Mouse's previous that are a very mild but maybe even more so than that last album case in point the song in your cut I never guess that I would have heard modest mouse rides such a generic Rock instrumental on this new album over here and that is even taken further on the song wicked campaign we're just instrumentally the guitar tone to the just very Ealdor zack i downstroke chords on this track modest amounts are really sounding like indie rock rookies trying to make like a really meaningful piece of music more than they are vets who have come out with the fantastic albums they have and then there are songs where we're getting really bad production and instrumental choices tracks like pistol where Isaac Brock's vocals are pitched down for the entirety of the song and it sounds like really goofy and kind of obnoxious not only that the lyrics on this track or somewhat asinine a lot of the time and on the song sugar boats rigging instrumentation that sounds like it could have come out of a big top circus or something we're getting some huge bass on this track some drunken plinky piano I feel like on this song we're getting more Tom Waits influence pouring through but it's not manifesting itself in a very pretty way especially with Isaac Brock with his vocals on top of this track it feels like he's barely putting much of anything into it on previous tracks such as The Devil's workday he's just going absolutely insane he's really playing up this song and because his performance is so middle-of-the-road on this track the instrumentation just sounds kind of out of place and just really overly can't be I guess I don't really get why Isaac would have chosen this instrumental backdrop if he wasn't going to give it the vocal energy to match there are some cuts here that are decent but maybe a little save by Modest Mouse standards like ansel lyrically here we're getting a tale of a family trip and if you are a modest mouse fan you know that in the past isaac has addressed his family quite a bit is upbringing his surroundings as a kid i mean these things have been really big inspirations for him in his music so I was kind of expecting maybe something a little I guess emotionally potent on this track over here and this song seems to feature a pretty heart-wrenching story there's a point in the song where Isaac says that this is the last time he sees his brother at least at this point I don't know if it's been for the rest of his life but you know again pretty sad but still there are lyrical moments on this track like do you even know you can't know you can't ever really know how the hell would you know throwing these redundant questions together one after another just doesn't make for very interesting lyricism and there's one track here I'm getting like a little bit too much deja vu and it's on one of the lead singles from here the ground walks with time in a box and maybe for most people getting into this track you might think well where has modest mouse sounded like this song because it is in all guns blazing dance track with a sweet bass and drum groove kind of disco inspired with some plucked acoustics and some wailing guitar peppered on top but Isaac brings this familiar vocal melody and and flow that to me feels like I'm just listening to some kind of dance remix of paper-thin walls from the moon and Antarctica and despite its best efforts with a 3/4 time signature and layered instrumentation really this post rock s wall of sound the song coyotes just doesn't have the intoxicating sadness of older modest mouse tracks above a similar vibe the album finishes off of the track that features all this slow heavy dramatic playing but after all these lackluster songs just it's so hard to get into it this track is for me the instrumental equivalent of going why [Music] the track has really droopy crescendo to it gets louder but there's not really a lot of intense emotion behind it and there's an incredibly weak song beneath the surface of this track to some very weird off-putting kind of nasal background vocals it's very unflattering guitar feedback too that's actually a little too ear piercing you know I I didn't ever think I'd be saying this about a Modest Mouse record but modest Mouse who really came out with an album here where the best tracks are the singles and I guess I could say this is Modest Mouse's most diverse album most sonic variety on this album I think but it's also their least enjoyable some lackluster songs here bland instrumentals and and Isaac usually the the star of the show here nowhere near as compelling as he's been on past albums unfortunately I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this LP transition if you gave this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think Anthony should review next Anthony Fanta no strangers to ourselves forever 
DiFm53BrlOE,yeah hi everyone home ffunny worked anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new of Montreal album aureate gloom of Montreal is an Athens based rock and indie rock and indie pop outfit psych pop garage a lot of different genres in their music and their fronted by singer-songwriter guitarist Kevin Barnes the band is known as a part of the elephant six collective a collective of musicians that has seen a lot of indie darling success stories with groups such as Neutral Milk Hotel and apples and stereo olivia tremor control many of them were influenced by the pop and rock music of the 60s and filtered it through a kind of abstract experimental and modern day occasionally lo-fi lens and with a Montreal that at first manifested itself in some kind of quaint acoustic ballads as well as rock tunes with some kind of cute or maybe even surreal imagery songs such as Tim I wish you were born a girl or the song everything disappears when you come around the lyrics on that song are insane and after these initial records of Montreal sort of evolved into this very colorful playful absurd band while still pulling from those rock and pop influences from the 60s on records like gay parade this early 2000s era for the band was actually really prolific time with not only a handful of records coming out but a ton of different compilations but they were very quick to evolve past this period in the mid 2000s as they started incorporating some electronics and some dance grooves into their stuff on albums such as satanic panic in the Attic this stylistic shift put them on the track to become one of the most popular and celebrated indie bands of the 2000s some of the Bands biggest singles ever came off of the record son'll antic twins and right after came their biggest album success story with hissing fauna are you that Australia this record actually kicked off an entirely different era and of Montreal's career a really maximal era with loads and loads multitrack vocals tons of synthesizers various electronics and rhythms all layered together in this just impossibly dense pop music and it actually made for some of my least favorite records in their discography I think a lot of these albums like skeletal lamping and false priests are just a little too gaudy now the band is inching up on twenty years of age and in this current evolution of theirs they have kind of reeled back a lot of those electronics and have gone for a more organic sound and even though reactions have been mixed to a lot of these newer of Montreal albums they have been kind of pleasing to me this is territory that I see Kevin Barnes just functioning properly in like on me many baroque disco tracks on paralytic stalks or the rock and psych pop fused with some folk music and all country on lousy with Sylvian briar in 2013 and here on this new LP of Montreal continues with these wordy witty and colorful takes on vintage rock tropes there's baroque pop on this record kinks style Garage Beatles style pop t-rex styled glam rock and even a few hard rock riffs that feel like they're pulled right out of the Led Zeppelin playbook the last track on here particular has a riff that sounds just like the Rafi Troodon Led Zeppelin's immigrant song so of Montreal tips a little further in that hard rock direction than they usually would but they still cover those usual bases of vintage rock and pop music you remember them covering Kevin Barnes lyrically is as verbose as usual even though this album might strike me just a little bit as unambitious still of Montreal has never really got more than a few albums riding one idea or delivering one single sound so you know maybe they're kind of due for another evolutionary change maybe this album will be the last in this sort of little era of of Montreal's career and we'll get something entirely new with the next batch of records as far as the material we're getting on this album the whole LP kicks off with the single Bassem tabary a disco groove song with some booty kick drums and blaring guitars and it's a smooth groove with a really peppy upbeat feel and some pretty smart lyrics to me this song reads is a bit of like disillusioned hero worship there are mentions of revolution in this track the hook on this thing gusoff fiction it's not cod with Barnes when he wants to he has this knack for making some really catchy phrases out of words that'll get you sort of grabbing for your dictionary just to try to decipher what exactly he is on about there's definitely a war theme to this track which is also mirrored in the cover art to the single and I think some of these same themes come up at least a little in the track Virginian Lots which also has some kind of violent sad destructive imagery in its lyrics however Barnes tendency to really overload his songs with lyrics such as on the song last right at Jane Motel he really loses focus of whatever the melody is supposed to be on the verse here and just kind of settles into this sort of forgettable talk singing which really leaves these verses feeling kind of flat and there's some other tracks here were of Montreal they take some risks but they're very minor risks and the payoff is very minor as well if there even is any such as on the other single empyrion abattoir which is a track I like it's a danceable song it's super subdued the vocals are deadpan it's definitely trying to pull together a dance track but with a very quiet demeanor and while I do like the song it really hasn't done much for the album as a single which it is it just feels like more of a really solid deep cut there are louder and just sort of more memorable tracks in the track listing here that I think would have made for a better single though masturbating your father's pain is definitely a winning phrase from this song and I do like the way this track occasionally coasts into some really dreamy guitar interludes however the dreaminess is actually kind of a turn-off on the song aluminum crown the track features this slowed dramatically sung very syrupy hook that's contrasted with these hard rocking verses and these two separate parts of this song that alternate seem like they just have very little to do with each other musically sonically it just kind of seems they're jammed together into one song just because they had to be and while I'm usually pretty into Kevin Barnes musings on neo feminist divinations and the anatolian rock as well as the raping of the embryonic virgin spring the music's really got to appeal to me as well you know it can't just be the words I guess I'm not really enjoying as much as I am head scratching and the out of nowhere hard rock riffs on the closing track as well as monolithic egress which is really a structural mess really jumps from one song section to another a lot like aluminum crown these various parts don't really complement one another all that well and then there's the weird noisy soundscape that just enters with no warning whatsoever on the second half of the Tony endur'd the other which to me just kind of feels like a way for the band to do something weird and unexpected without actually taking a risk don't get me wrong there are some other tracks on this record that I like tracks where it feels like of Montreal are keeping up their kind of quirky emotionally confusing fun colorful punchy standards but there are other songs on here maybe the key tracks on this record that I think are hinting towards something a little bit more experimental and I actually wouldn't mind a more experimental of Montreal but if that's the direction they're gonna be going in on their future output with this record I think they're really in with in the more shallow end of that pool there are some hits on this record some misses tracks that are somewhere in the middle and Kevin Barnes I still find to be a compelling frontman you yourself if you are a longtime fan you might be interested in hearing the band venture out in the miniscule ways that they do on this record but me personally I'm not that into the kind of non experiments and the somewhat needless non sequiturs of this record I'm feeling a strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana of Montreal forever 
SUarppg_rwY,[Music] it's track Rizzoli hi everyone Anthony van tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we're going to talk about you know so the latest in rock pop electronic experimental and right now we're going to talk about the new Muse single psycho Muse is a uk-based alternative rock band they've been at it for years now numerous albums under their belt but the more recent of those records have actually been pretty polarizing to longtime fans in the mid-2000s they started incorporating elements of progressive rock into their music and with 2009's the resistance we saw not only progressive rock but some pop rock creeping and as well some electronic music symphonic rock and a lot of influence coming from bands like u2 and Queen now this record wasn't a total turnoff to me I do like the grandness of it even if occasionally the same kind of overblown may be a little over produced and it's really trying to be as dramatic as possible but it was on the 2012 album the second law where Muse really started to lose me with a series of tracks that not only incorporated just elements of electronic music and even dubstep but just a lot of gag-worthy pop rock songs on this record too nevertheless I'm into putting the past where the past is if a band can sort of come out with a record down the road that I enjoy and now we have Muse announcing that they have a new record on the way this is the very maybe sexually suggestive album cover of that album and along with this album announcement came a new single and there's good news and there's bad news with this single the good news is that muses heading in more of just a straightforward rock music direction but the bad news is that it's probably the worst single they've come out with since 2012's madness the song kicks off with a riff a guitar riff that is like such blatant obvious just great a rock though I do actually think the guitars share a grimy with like some of queen of the stone Age's more recent material but without any of the nuance or really the sharp top-notch songwriting and that is especially clear when you look at the lyrics of this track muse is still on a political and socially aware kick in their music with this new single over here which is not a bad thing in theory but the message of this song is so chewed up dumbed down regurgitated I feel like they're talking down to me or that they think the only people who will actually get what they're trying to say with this song are people just too stupid to get anything else just a little more subtle a psycho boom baby baby boo but they such a ridiculously silly refrain on this song and I do get the in a sense this track might be kind of tongue-in-cheek they are talking about sort of a private being yelled at by a drill sergeant and the army essentially owns this person's ass and they are essentially cannon fodder at this point and they will kill because they're told to kill and maybe in a way Muse is sort of mocking the machoism that usually comes with the attitude of signing up for the military I get that and I agree mostly with the political message behind the song but for me this track is kind of a case of a piece of art trying to mock another piece of art or a certain kind of expression or mindset and maybe embodying that mindset more than it is satirizing it and the things in this track that do make their sentiments clear on this issue like the drill sergeant yelling at the private like just before the bridge is just kind of silly and cringe-worthy still though there are a few things that I can praise music I really liked how the distorted vocals and the very primal drum sounded super dark maybe even Marilyn Manson inspired on the pre-chorus at one point on this song I think Muse for as corny as this riff is they really rock the groove after initial listens I found it kind of hard to not be bobbing my head to this song I thought that for the most part the vocal melodies on the verses were nice even though I wasn't really enjoying the lyrics and the bridge of this track is really epic and grand I like the fact that even though Muse instrumentally might be doing something just really straightforward hard-hitting in-your-face they can always throw some some really epic vocals on top of it and have it fit the tone of the song in a really nice way and maybe there will be some more interesting and more well developed and I guess more detailed and nuanced tracks deeper in the tracklisting here this new song here might just be trying to be as simple as possible but still this this song does not make me interested in hearing this new Muse album at all I really do think it's one of their worst songs in a while those are essentially my thoughts on this new single here what do you think of this new single do you love it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next and transition you're the best thank you for watching this video I hope you have a nice day eat some fruits and veggies get outside enjoy the weather and hug somebody that you love Anthony Fantana use forever 
iK9WuSWDc1M,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a trap review we're you know talking about the lates and rock-pop electronic death grips on GP Death Grips experimental hip hop trio industrial hip hop trio from Sacramento a number of albums under their belt thus far and the project fans have been waiting for is just around the corner Jenny death the second half of their yet to be completed double album the powers that be Jenny death has finally been slapped with a release date it's going to be coming out next week almost a year after the first half of this double album was put out Death Grips has teased toward the release of Jenny death with the fashion week instrumentals where all the instrumentals spelled out Jenny death when and and then we had the inanimate sensation single toward the beginning of this year and then finally just this week the pre-order for the powers-that-be came out via harvest records it doesn't seem to be out right now I think they took it down maybe they oversold or maybe they sold more they sold out of all of the physical copies of the album not totally sure so we've got a release date we've had a pre-order and just to make things just a little more real Death Grips has released a new song the 9th track from Jenny death on GP now up until this point Death Grips has consistently surprised fans with new sounds new directions with each new single and new project and this track over here is no exception fans who are excited for new material might be surprised to hear their enthusiasm on this track is being met with Death Grips most depressing song yet there are some kind of dreary hard rock style chords coming through on this track and yes there is a coherent chord progression coming through on this song one of the few Death Grips tracks that actually features a coherent chord progression throughout much of the song and it's coming from a guitar of all things it kind of reminds me in a way of songs like spread-eagle across the block we have prominent tarz throughout that song much of that track is just a long spanning sample of a link wray instrumental and also the song i've seen footage not that i think they sound exactly the same but to me this track in a lot of ways is Death Grips playing with the idea of making more conventional music which to me I've seen footage was Death Grips kind of blurring the lines between hip-hop and experimental music as they often do but there are some wailing guitar leads through this track I'm not sure who's playing the guitar if the guitars are sampled the drums certainly feel like they're coming from Zach hill but the wailing guitar leads on this track I love them they sound like they're coming from this 60s 70s hard rock psych Rock era maybe like a little Led Zeppelin inspired there's some very dreary organ chords at one point in this track as well the guitars actually get pretty chaotic at some points during this track which leads me to believe that maybe these guitars aren't sampled from anything maybe they are original because of how noisy they get it's really hard to tell and if you stripped the vocals out of the song entirely it would be kind of hard to believe it was a Death Grips instrumental but of course MC ride comes in and you know does his usual shouted short of breath angry flow oh good first his flow is manic its unkempt it's crazy he sounds like a madman but when you dig into his lyrics there's actually a lot of coherence here maybe more coherence than usual for Death Grips and even though ride may come off aggressive there are some seriously dark tips of the at to a suicide mention of the phone ringing obviously because he is a to not alive to answer it a mention of buying a noose is ride talking about suicide from a personal angle is he talking about suicide as more of a band related thing because death grips in the past has said that they are broken up and they're not together anymore and maybe after Jenni death is released that will in fact be the case I love how the guitars and drums in the background really match the emotion of the song I like the dynamic instrumental how there are times when the instrumental is more quiet there times toward the back end of the song where the instrumental does get noisier and more intense and as the song is kind of you know roller coastering emotionally ride is really just kind of adjusting his inflections and his articulation - especially when the instrumentation gets quiet and he's kind of doing this a shouted word thing it's actually kind of chilling there's also some moments toward the back end of this track where ride says that he'd be a liar if he sat here claiming that he'd exit in a minute so maybe in a way he's kind of talking himself or maybe even the bad back from that ledge of ending life but no matter what the true meaning intentions or interpretation of this song is the themes are very clear and they are really disturbing really loving this track it's got me even more excited for Jenny death than I was already I actually think between this song and inanimate sensation my feelings are pretty solidified and that I am not anticipating to be disappointed but you know you never know if you've given this track a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and Tran it's important big clean up in yeah how did you feel about the project huh did you like it please you hate it would you rather hear you can say freestyle over and over I didn't listen to shit again let us know why city review next let him know and don't forget to subscribe to you boy that is big Quinn indeed b.i.g to you int space indeed okay I do news reviews and reactions man and folks boy with the needle drop if you haven't subscribe to him please do please do you put you on to the new shit so the new new shit some underground deep shit so should you haven't even heard before I'm telling you man the bay is Maddy knows music I'm telling you I'm telling you she bought big Quinn indeed 
AhHAO9_Oxgo,hi everyone i pre-ordered Jenny damn i pre-order Jenny death here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Clarence clarity album no now let's put the washed out up there cool Clarence clarity is a uk-based producer singer songwriter he just dropped his debut album over here via Bella Union but the reception to this record at least from what I've observed thus far has been a little quiet which is a bit of a head-scratcher for me because there's a lot of great things going on this LP I think has a few solid singles but I won't say that getting into this album enjoying it will exactly be easy for one Clarence is a smaller name right now which makes some people apprehensive this album here is an hour long pretty long for a debut record and musically and stylistically with this new album over here he's taking an experimental and sort of strange approach to R&B and pop music I think pulling from a lot of radio and commercial R&B and pop music from the 2000s which isn't always people's cup of tea especially right now with there being so much saturation in the alternative R&B world maybe some people might be put off by the cover art here which kind of looks like some gimmicky vapor wave inspired piece of aesthetics and mr. clarity over here actually saw fit to name his project after the second-tier meme of some kid having an epiphany in the middle of a rave hopefully these things don't really get in anyone's way of enjoying this album as far as the music goes on this LP if you're into a lot of these newer alternative R&B artists I don't think this album is going to be that much of a stretch I think clearance clarity has a lot in common with people like James Blake how to dress well Oh to nuvvu but rather than taking the same slow atmospheric dramatic approach that they've taken Clarence's production style is glitchy it's debts it's in your face it's loud and it's bold the tracks on this LP are loaded with heavy beats and densely layered synthesizers loads of lead vocals and background vocals some of which are chipmunk tore pitch to be lower there are some psychedelic effects in the mix here too to the point where some of the songs in the track listing here are kind of obscured more than they are enhanced sort of like on that new animal collective album centipede hurts and I can actually see Clarence pulling a little bit of influence from a band like Animal Collective or at least grabbing the ears of fans of Animal Collective maybe even the ears of people who might like the vocals of a mr. David long strengths of Dirty Projectors but even with all this cacophony in a lot of the instrumentals on this album Clarence's vocal melodies and his songs are often too bright and too sharp to be totally drowned out Clarence's vocals shine through as soulful and passionate and eccentric but not every track here has pop intentions behind it there's really like a gradient of difficulty and experimentation with each track here like the second half of the song with no fear toward the back end of this LP which sounds like a very glitchy disorienting sound collage kind of inspired by John Cage's Williams mix and then you have songs like those who can't cheat where despite the maximal approach to production and just so many sounds hitting you from every direction just these blinky metallic what sounds like glockenspiels layered on top of one another just like very tiny toy piano chords and then you have these sprinkled arpeggios that sound like they're warped and reverse or a kind of effect heavy beats funky bass line this song is catchy through and through it's lowdown it's dirty it has kind of a very sinister vibe to it despite how danceable and sweet and instantaneous it is for me tracks like this and buck-toothed particle smashers and alive in the septic tank are just instant hits but sometimes Clarence will take an incredibly catchy song and purposefully derail it with sound effects bursts of noise sudden gaps of complete silence glitched out grooves and other unexpected surprises kind of like the song off my grid which is really one of the best ballads on here and is just obscure a little bit with just a lot of fuzz a lot of different noises and then we have the song blood barf - which has one of the more sensual baselines on the entire LP one of the better vocal melodies - but how Clarence subtly kind of switches up the groove and glitches out the track and adds noise here and there really kind of keeps you on your toes even though the groove might feel relaxed the overall vibe of the song just leaves me feeling anything but and there's something about the groove of this track to me that feels like a vapor wave song not that I feel like Clarence sampled the track and kind of slowed it down or something like that it feels like he tried to make a vapor wave instrumental from scratch and then he sang over it if you don't know what vapor wave is click on my floral shop review at the end of this review cool cool there is definitely something kind of odd and absurd with Clarence's approached production on this album sort of like on the new fka twigs album but not nearly as smooth and ethereal again Clarence is maximal he's disorienting he's kind of absurd and these are things he pushes to the point where he can be kind of obnoxious on some of these tracks like the song will to believe and maybe the song meadow hopping with the just chirpy background vocals on this track as well as the lead lyrics on this thing about the witch house and the Catholics it's kind of a fun song but it also has sort of a creepy Halloween esque bead they're just some tracks on here where they just feel a little too goofy or kooky going down still these are approaches that are not often taken with this kind of music and for the vast majority of the 20 tracks here they're executed pretty well and when Clarence wants his production to be really layered and really dense with detail but not noisy he really wants his songs to shine through he does it in a fantastic way namely on the song cancer in the water which feels like this big gospel inspired fusion with 80s pop Oh cancer in the water there are so many highlights on this album from beginning to end and despite the fact that clearance is new at least under this pseudonym and we're getting 60 minutes of material this actually wasn't that arduous of a listen pretty far from being one-dimensional or boring in my opinion from the song one hand washes the other which features these very plucky banjos or the song the cue which kind of borders on glitch hop each instrumental here really has its own flavor again with the exception of the song meadow hopping in a few tracks like it that have this purposefully playfully creepy vibe that just felt a little silly too silly I guess not to say the rest of the Selden takes itself super seriously which is part of the reason why it's such a fun listen fun and and very well written very well put together and even with so much well assembled creative material here this album really could have used a little bit of trimming at least it might have actually made the album overall maybe a little bit punchier a little bit easier to digest but still you know I thank and bless mr. clarity over here for giving us some really envelope-pushing R&B and pop with this record will it translate to other people not totally sure if that will happen but I know it has translated for me I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition if you've eaten this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana clarence clarity forever no good 
medwB35qz_A,hi everyone get any Trenton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new lightning bolt album is it me if so Nick I am here for absolutely no reason whatsoever lightning bolt is a Rhode Island musical duo easily one of the best musical duo's of the 2000s they had a fantastic run for 10 years with a handful of great noise rock albums ride the skies hyper Magic Mountain wonderful rainbow and the album Earthly Delights in 2009 the only real low in their album discography is a 2012 b-sides album oblivion under kinda demo quality a little messy you sort of reminded me of their debut live album but the rest of their discography is an overwhelming atomically explosive colorful abrasive and psychedelic freefall into the mouth of a volcano and they've been able to keep up this level of intensity with a pretty basic setup for years just drums and bass lightning bolt is two guys but they make enough noise for five first we have Brian Chippendales dizzying frantic drumming and he also does vocals as well in the way that he records his voice not 100% sure and what the apparatus is or what kind of microphone is he using but the way it's incorporated into lightning bolts recordings it sounds like he's singing at you through the talkbox of like a fast-food drive-through and then we have Brian Gibson's bass guitar which he plays a lot more like a traditional electric guitar he's riffing he's shredding he's playing Leeds on the bass guitar he's throwing tons of effects into the mix - like reverbs and a loop pedal distortion and all these things have been improved upon and sort of finely tuned his lightning-bolt progressed from ride the skies to Earthly Delights the drumming the vocals the bass loops and the layers actually got so intense on the album hyper Magic Mountain when that album first came out I had to stop playing it because I kept giving myself migraine headaches and even though their music is seriously intense there's something kind of fun and absurd and demented about it - now even though I do love the sound of Lightning Bowl I love the idea behind this duo it's a sound that I imagined is pretty difficult to stretch out for five records but despite the delay despite the doubt I still went into this record with high hopes I mean with nearly every lightning bolt album I kind of go into it wondering what they're going to do next to keep their sound and keep their style entertaining and they've always managed to pull through and with this new record here at their core they're really still the same band delivering a lot of the same trademark sounds the grimy roaring bass guitar intense drumming fuzz doubt brittle vocals all thrown together in a whirlwind of sight punk noise insanity over the runtime of this album lightning bolt manages to toss in a few new or different ideas but maybe the most cool thing about this record at first listen if you are a lightning bolt fan is that it's not quite as heavy or densely layered as their more recent efforts this record definitely has a roar aesthetic but still packs a lot of punch maybe not quite as raw or as noisy as oblivion hunter but not as overdubbed and is tightly put together and as flashy as an album like hyper magic mountain it seems like on this new record here lightning bolt is really trying to keep this record afloat with some great intense performances this LP kicks off with the metal east which features these rolling bass triplets in this driving snare drum there are these little ascending and descending melodies in between these verses of frenzied vocals and for the most part it really sounds like lightning bolt as usual aside from kind of a weird high-pitched noisy chaotic freakout in the middle of the song and a point toward the end of the track where I think we're getting like a weird keyboard riff or something I wouldn't be surprised this sound came from Brian's bass as well but there is something kind of synthetic about the sound that kind of struck me like oh that I've never really heard this sound and a lightning bolt song before but it lasts such a short while that it really doesn't leave an impact for me on the song as a whole despite a couple of novel ideas again this tractor's feels like lightning bolt by the numbers which makes me wonder I'm not sure stripping things back was kind of the best idea for this record because it's not like alternatively they've kind of found a new avenue or kind of a new direction to go in with this simpler approach there are some longer cuts on here that my number up to six or eleven minutes the plane gets a little more chaotic there might be some more psychedelic effects in the mix like with the epic closer snow white or the very thick and chaotic dream Jeannie and the song over the river and through the woods as well which is actually one of my favorite tracks here until the point where the entire groove of the song changes and it feels like Brian Gibson starts delivering this kind of basic straightforward dancey bass riff that sounds like something off of the death from above record at which point the song really starts to drag the shorter cuts on here are more straightforward more concise pack some energy but maybe the riff writing isn't the best that lightning bolt has ever delivered I love the galloping groove of the song horse power but without a fantastic riff to ride that groove because we're really kind of getting OneNote riding this groove a lot of the time it gets a little redundant the song makes me think back to older lightning bolt cuts like to towers where for a majority of the track minutes at a time were like getting this one rip this one groove and yet lightning bolt found ways to kind of keep it intense keep it interesting keep it hypnotic just by varying the groove slightly as they continue to play it and of course wonderful rainbows incredibly crushing sound helped keep that track interesting to a crushing sound an extremely crushing sound that I don't think this record quite has there are also ideas I like from the song king of my world like the fluttering lead melodies all over this track and the intense wall of sound that accompanies them and the jagged drumbeat but the song just takes so long to get going and once these fluttering melodies in the wall of sound introduced themselves they just kind of pop in with no real tension or build or anything this just feels like a really weakly assembled track thankfully the song of your times can kind of picks things up with an interesting dynamic sounds really primal low-key drumbeats and quiet chants some droney bass and then all of a sudden blast beats and loud riffs and ah I also love the fluttering ascending delayed intervals toward the end of this track another example of a sharp idea on this record of which I think there are many on this album they're just not encased in to some of lightning bolts best songs but really I only feel that way about the first half of this album the second half of this LP I actually think makes for a great lightning bolt record it's fast its frenzied its sonically intense the performances are great lightning bolt proves there's still one of the most unique bands in noise rock even if unintentionally they sort of show how limited their sound is I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana lightning bolt fantasy Empire forever 
LHShxTVDv7E,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Steven Wilson album hand cannot erase Steven Wilson a uk-based multi-instrumentalist songwriter singer producer and frontman of the neo progressive rock band porcupine tree whose recent output has kind of slowed since 2009 the incident but filling that void of porcupine tree albums has been one Steven Wilson solo record after another like grace for drowning and the Raven that refused to sing and so far Steven Wilson's more recent solo material hasn't really continued on the more modern end of the progressive rock spectrum rather they have gone back a little bit they are kind of studied rehashes of classic progressive rock tropes and as detailed as they may be they are a little passionless or at least that's how I read them to be just passionless reassembly zuv ideas from the great works of King Crimson Rush Pink Floyd topped with kind of passable boyish flimsy singing so yeah these latest Steven Wilson solo records not really pushing the envelope in the way porcupine tree had they just kind of feel like Steven doing what feels comfortable coloring by the numbers in his favorite genre which is something he's so desperate to do he got the mellotron that landed on those old-school King Crimson recordings and put it on the Raven refused to sing and when I originally reviewed this record I assumed that this classic historical instruments less than flattering appearance was really just because it was a mock instrument or some kind of really terrible synth patch but it was actually the real deal Steven Wilson has all the toys he has everything that you would need all the all the ingredients for a classic progressive rock record but none of the thrills not only excitement and none of the guts true revivalists of a vintage style of music usually take a little bit more notice of the energy behind the music and the emotions behind it maybe just the the recording style on the way the instruments sound and not to say that Wilson is a terrible producer his instruments definitely sound better on this new record here than they did on the Raven used to saying they are a little bit more lush colorful punchy er but still that oomph that I look for in a rock recording across all rock subgenres is really just not there instead of trying to attain that lightning in a bottle Stephen kind of just settles on compositional accuracy by a progressive rock standard and it leads to a kind of sterile delivery I don't see Stephen on this new album on his previous two albums performing progressive rock as much as he is showcasing it here our sounds or riffs or chord progressions or instrumental accompaniment that I think is great in this genre and Stephens love his awe his reverence for this style of music really keeps him from making a visceral recording with it because he babies and delicately handles every riff solo every guitar interlude like he's handling hallmark figurines are like a really extensive beanie baby collection perusing through Stevensville prog isms can be just as tedious as staring in all the little porcelain knickknacks and your grandmother's hutch that's roughly how I feel about Stephens past two LPs that's pretty much how I feel about this new LP though again I do give it to Stephen that things sound better they sound more lush they sound more colorful on the production front and I do think we are getting a little bit more stylistic and sonic variation on this new LP like with the peppy staccato acoustic guitar chords on three years older really upbeat way to start the album the way the next song rolls in with some pumping downstroke guitar chords feels like a little bit of pop rock there's a very chilled spoken word piece on the song perfect life the chugging and heavy riffs at the start of home invasion are actually pretty surprising a nice explosive change of pace but there's a really awkward funk groove on the end of the song that just does not sit right of course there is a synth Odyssey on the song regret number 9 and the jittery electronic beat and the whimsical strings on the song ancestral almost kind of has a trip hop vibe to it there's a really explosive guitar solo on this track too which actually adds up to one of the more fiery and dramatic moments on the entire record and the song happy returns is a relatively grand finish and lyrically actually pulls together and ties up very nicely a lot of the album's themes of history and memory and family growing up growing apart and life and there are themes of Technology and urban living in in modern life and isolation on this record as well which Stephen has explored before in other projects but maybe not with the same exact kind of focus that hand cannot erase provides once again with hand cannot erase Stephen proves he understands the art of the album from a technical standpoint the album is coherent its thematic its conceptual it's mixed well it's not stylistically one-dimensional but aesthetically and stylistically the record is kind of drab and safe and bordering on unimaginative you know again I appreciate and I acknowledge Stephen Wilson's writing ability and his virtuosity on this album and it's great that he has a crowd of passionate fans that want to hear him make the kind of music that he makes but again even with Stephens talents being so obvious and out there in the open I'm really failing to connect with with much of anything on this record in a meaningful or an emotional way I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on the cell P transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it I'm sure you probably enjoy it more than me but that's cool you're the best what do you think I should review next and I hope your will Anthony Fantana Stephen Wilson forever 
eEDfCQ0cF-8,hi everyone both in Shortino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new hemas album Eat Pray thug teams or human she was in New York rapper formerly known as one third of - racist a New York hip hop trio who if you're not familiar with them I recommend trying out their mixtapes shut up dude and sit down man two projects of absurdist hip hop in a lot of ways anti hip hop these two tapes as well as the commercial album that - racist followed these tapes up with poked fun at hip hop lampooned it as well as celebrated it now for reasons not really discussed in great detail publicly a - racist broke up not too long after the release of relax it's been said the breakup was planned the whole time but as soon as - racist broke apart it didn't take too long for teams and cool ad to start dropping solo stuff some of which I've been on board with some of which not so much a lot of cool eighties latest projects have kind of trended toward the more absurdist side of things to the point where I just have a hard time taking it seriously or really even enjoying it or getting anything out of it teams has been a little bit more I guess conventional and coherent and and easier to enjoy with projects like neighbor jackets a mixtape loaded with cohesive songs concepts topics on these tracks - especially with tracks such as thug handles as well as women in my opinion a unique project but he's followed this mixtape up with another titled wild water Kingdom team has really tried to do a bit of a cloud wrap thing on this project with loads of atmosphere which i think just kind of smothered his rhymes there were some terrible hooks on this thing - just a lot of botched tracks and and now hims is back giving us another round of reasons we wished - races stayed together with this new project here Eat Pray thug and there's really no clear unifying sound or flow or overarching theme that brings all these songs together they're really a mixed bag sonically and topically there are some tracks on here that are just awful terrible auto-tune ballads soaked Reverb that stick out like sore thumbs and the track listing here tracks like damn girl tracks like this are not only unenjoyable and just not pleasant at all but it just feels like he is just getting super lazy like he's not even trying and while this might be tongue-in-cheek to a slight degree something I think he ms maybe sort of hints toward on the song pop song games he might be kind of giving us a wink making us aware that he's aware that he's just kind of dishing out solace filler but even the possibility of these two tracks being just a bad joke doesn't make them any more entertaining there's another track where teams kind of gets emotional over a breakup on the song home but even here the most effective thing about the song is the instrumental and the contributions brought by Devante Hinds ache a blood orange and I'm not even a blood orange fan the way this beat here is sprinkled with some twangy kind of reverb eath in guitar and some spacious drums some chili droney since it's actually a beautiful instrumental and then of course you're also getting these hard-hitting kind of satirical cuts on the record here like the opener sometimes which has a pretty basic straightforward concept hymns is rapping about how he sometimes this and he sometimes that it's funny it's cool it feels like that classic - racist sense of humor coming through but with four minutes of length and just not that much variation and not much in the way of stretching this concept out past its initial idea it doesn't really justify the length there are tracks like so New York and especially John Cage where teams shows off a much better flow the speed is there the articulation is there the energy is there just in my opinion though he's not really coming through with a concept or really that many lines that are sticking with me not as sticky as what he was doing on some times and the song al-qaeda is a kind of ear grabbing because he's kind of throwing out a lot of violent imagery almost as if he's trying to do some gangster rap here but he's kind of putting it against kind of a I guess a terrorism backdrop saying that you don't want to mess with these people you'll get murked these guns are from al-qaeda instrumentally here we have a hard trap style banger some really squeaky silly synths and on top of that there really isn't that much on the song the way of very bold memorable humor so the absurdity of him rapping about guns being from al-qaeda is I guess hard to take as absurd I'm sure there would even be some crazy people out there who would think he's halfway serious if it weren't for the fact that he has this back history in - racist I mean even FoxNews if they got a hold of this track they would have a  field day and then we have songs where he messes going political like usual but he's bringing a really serious tone something he hasn't really done that often in the past take the song suicide by cops right now given recent events I think cops are kind of deserving of a lot of the social commentary that's being thrown their way however he's doesn't really seem to focus on the topic he's implying is central to this song given the hook and the title the whole track kind of drifts by without him really saying anything that paramount however I do really like the track flag shopping I think it's my favorite song the track listening here this track is an incredible and moving take on the racism and the prejudice that him and his family went through directly after 9/11 s and this is a story that is not often told in popular music and it's a story that I think should be told in popular music I think it's a track told from the standpoint of someone who has a very unique experience when it comes to patriotism and racial profiling government wiretapping mob mentality and the ugly side of American politics however sometimes he gets kind of blinded by his desire to say something really poignant when he really should just be trying to package what he wants to communicate into a good and a coherent song on the closing track here Patriot Act we do have a pretty decent track going for the first half but then he just devolves into this rant talking about just anecdotal stories and his personal experiences existing in post 9/11 America and while it is heartfelt and I do sympathize and I think these stories need to be told it's just something that I guess would have gone down easier for me if it were for the fact that there was just so much filler and so many just throw away tracks that came before this song overall I was just really not liked in this project unfortunately I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition if you've given the Salamah lesson what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana team's Eat Pray thug forever 
PiW8pFjOIUQ,
_526INQlmss,ah the memes the memes they got me hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a new series where I talk about all the records that have recently made it into this collection over here hmm first I want to give a shout-out to our sponsor of this video vinyl me please the monthly record club they do exclusive pressings they pass you a record every month you know you sort of pay a fee for a subscription and you know they pass you some sweet exclusively pressed vinyl with some extra art thrown in there maybe a lyric sheet as well a postcard too if they have it there's some drink recommendations stuff that comes along with a too little bio for the record as well so you know you're not going into a totally blind and you know I'm signed up for the the subscription service myself so you know we have these two releases over here that have come from them recently a fantastic little cool jazz and soul jazz record from the Ben Webster quintet this is a record I'm not terribly familiar with but giving it a listen it actually wasn't too bad if you're at all a fan of cool jazz it's not incredibly inventive if you just take it in the grander scheme of things but this was actually a pretty fantastic record and considering that this was just the late 50s when this record came out just before a lot of the greatest albums in cool jazz would be released and there were some fantastic little beautiful songs on here like time in my hands lever come back to me the way Ben Webster plays the sax on this record just just double-checking that yeah the tenor sax he kind of has like these stuttering notes throughout the record that are kind of attention-grabbing background instrumentation is really sweet really smooth and as far as the record pressing itself there's a fantastic little uh catching on here it's not necessarily a label but uh in itching which is very quiet which is nice you know the logo the name of the record Ben Webster quintets the name of the logo the logo the verb logo name of the record so yeah you know nice little fetching on the label there as opposed to just a label definitely uh you know a nice little package right there straight forward to the point and this new father John misty double-lp gatefold came in the mail from them as well and it's actually a a spot of clear vinyl which is a pretty sweet pretty sweet it's got a few clear records and yeah I mean if you guys have seen my review for this record it is one of my favorite singer-songwriter records of the year I don't know how many more I'll have as far as singer-songwriter records they never can tell I never can't predict but there's actually your beautiful record in my opinion more enjoyable than the last father John misty album I think which I thought was a little kind of run-of-the-mill for the genre and not to say that father John misty is reinventing the wheel or anything like that but I found his lyrics to be a little more standout on this album there's a sweet little lyric sheet that oh that comes with this album as well with some interesting collage style art lyric sheet is gigantic as you can see you can read all the lyrics right now if you pause this thank you and I actually do one other thing I like about this record is I just sort of get a chance to not only does the record itself sound very nice but I just get a chance to sort of see the art of the album you know just enlarge because it's actually a pretty detailed little mural going on here there's a little beautiful piece of art going on in the gatefold as well so yeah you know really digging this up here really dig in this package and you know again thanks to finally please for you know hooking me up with that you can check them out down in the description I will put a link at the top of the description box for that service alright moving on we have some record that were passed to me promo to this radio station I used to work at I visit over there you know whenever I do have some mail that I have to pick up and they pass me some some interesting records these two singles these guys are old English spelling bee recordings these two singles from Outer Limits recordings I'm just assuming that's the name of the group because I don't see that that's the record label or anything on here and you know you do kind of have to seven inches and it's not like there's any other band name on here other than Abra Limits recording so Outer Limits recordings these two seven inches the songs I need my TV burnin through the night Julie and plastic child favorite songs I need my TV plastic child of this fantastic song and these are two little loaf i psychedelic DIY recorded pop tracks pop seven inches sort of in that vein of our Stevie more aerial pink if you can get your hands on these there are some sweet moments on this you know it's got a lot of character and plastic child and I need my TV are super silly super catchy I wouldn't say these guys are you know the best DIY recording you know best loaf I pop outfit you'll ever hear but you know these to seven inches were we're definitely sweet and I see no reason to uh ditch them and then there was this which was totally perplexing these guys look like every terrible band I ever played with or played in in high school the the gym shorts the cargo shorts the garage the the the wooded area you know the the the the bass guitar you can't really tell but you know if you look at the bass guitar if you find a the high-rez cover art of this again the record is chaos destroy lightning strikes twice I didn't say that yes so you know for the first time Kaos destroyed lightning strikes twice if you get a good look at this bass guitar it looks like a hundred dollar starter base from like Guitar Center or something and and when you put this a record on it sounds like that it has this like really terrible crappy hollow grinding tone that is just god-awful actually you know it really does sound like they're playing with all the instruments featured on this record you know all of which look look fairly cheap and the recording itself you know sounds super cheap and noisy and lo-fi too but but the thing about bands like this is that the from from what my experience was playing in them and watching bands like this play they were usually super generic super boring and didn't you know we're just like ripping off crap that was on the radio but actually this band is actually like a noisy experimental kind of they're definitely inspired by grindcore to band you know they definitely don't play by anyone's rules the riffs are super distorted super abrasive the the the distortion the noise on the recording here is very ugly you know very like you know not even palatable to a degree and the vocals are just like I'm just like you know totally ridiculous and absurd you know that these guys are really just going batshit insane and this is a little you know piece of art that comes with the with the record it's just it's just totally senseless and and totally ridiculous it's it's definitely a freakish in a sense you know there's definitely something kind of weird about it but do do like I enjoy it not necessarily no but when I had it on that was kind of like a little bit a little bit of fun so you know there you go and this is the last thing they threw my way which I'm incredibly appreciative of this this is absolutely amazing Ariel Pink's picks from our Stevie Moore's back catalogue of Volume one a double LP pink vinyl a lot of the songs on this compilation are appearing on vinyl for the first time so you know and of course it is pink it is a beautiful you know sort of a splashy pink print really great labeling over here and been playing the first half of this thing sounds great sounds fantastic our Stevie Moore you know the aerial painted picked these tracks you know we sort of curated these tracks but you know the aerial pink is not on these songs at least from what I understand and and what I know of a few of the tracks here like summer comes again you know these are you know actually no you couldn't played on any of these songs all these songs are really old majority of the songs here from the 70 is picked from our Stevie Moore's a cassette collection if you don't know our Stevie Moore he is this amazing multi-instrumentalist DIY home recorded artist and he's been doing this for decades and decades and decades way before loaf I was sort of you know very chic and you know recording things yourself was kind of in and and and easier to do for artists frankly you know he was doing DIY stuff one you know you had to do things and single takes and or you know if there were kind of tricks and workarounds for that I don't know them but you know if anyone did he certainly knew them you know he had to do things and single takes and you know you were working with tape and you know you had the mixing was I'm sure a pain in the ass too so you know our Stevie Moore he has Punk tracks he's got dance tracks he's got avant-garde sound scapes he's got spoken word he's got pop music he's got psychedelic pop he's got baroque pop he's got all kinds of different genres of music in his catalogue and he never stayed with one genre for too long you know always jumping around and trying different things and because his catalog is so diverse compilations really are one of the best ways to enjoy his stuff and you know and it's compilations like this that pulled together some of his best pop tracks you know some of his more accessible material and this is actually pretty pretty wonderful from what I've heard of the first track you know his his lyrics are super funny very crass very satirical a lot of the time but he's capable of of wonderful statements of love and life as well so you know if you're looking to try to get into arts TV more and you don't know which album to start with because he has so many you know and tons of albums that haven't even been released to the public you know though he does have a band camp where he just has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of releases that you can look up you know this compilation over here is really not a bad place to to start and it's actually you know fantastic to finally get some kind of our Stevie Moore vinyl into the collection because I do think he is a musical master and you know has been deserving a place in the vinyl collection over here he actually sampled me in a song once it was like a clip of me talking during my aerial pink review four before today which was pretty ridiculous met him once before as well and you know completely nice down-to-earth very cool guy and when I when I saw him perform he was really just with the crowd playing some good songs but you know totally with the crowd too you know playing some just weird completely you know incoherent all just say crap you know just for just for no other word because it seemed like he didn't seem to be taking it very seriously and then everybody was like wow you know he'd be like mmm you're not really liking this you know it's not pretending you know he seemed kind of breaking people's balls with with the performance he was doing and you know that's that's just the kind of person he is and actually I have another compilation of tracks from harsh Stevie Moore over here as well the personal appeal compilation with came out which came out a few years ago and I I didn't know just from looking at you know digital pictures of this of this record cover but and I don't know if you could tell right goes through the camera but the way that this is sort of printed and presented is that it looks like a real honest-to-god pencil drawing like you know looking at it really closely and really deeply it doesn't even look like it had been printed it just looks like somebody hand drew this single copy over here and then just threw it in and then was handed another piece of paper you know or another cover over here and just started drawing again it looks like a really you know I'm afraid to to move this around or really do much of anything with it because I'm just like afraid it'll erase or something like if I took it or an eraser to this like I could just get rid of this whole face it's actually really awesome to you know have something like this on a record cover and again this is just like you know another compilation of our Stevie Moore's you know more accessible stuff I'm not particularly sure you know doing a research on this compilation not particularly sure the date range from you know when this material has come from you know but with our Stevie more you never really know you know if anybody can actually find that out and throw it in the comments that would be a you know fantastic and amazing maybe I'll do an annotation or something like that if I find a if I find out eventually but you know there are actually some great tunes on here a one track that really stuck out to me makeup shake-up where he was singing against some pre-recorded you know classical strings but he set some hilarious lyrics to them about um makeup you know and just uh mascara and foundation getting on people's pants and you know so on and so forth you know it was it was just a really funny observation on makeup and a structure of love sounded wonderful the song old where he kind of pitched his voice down to sound dreary and just like his song has have a lot of personality and he goes into songs with you know usually big ideas or concepts as to what exactly he wants to say or communicate and that usually ends up impacting the way the music sounds and you know some kind of profound and sometimes hilarious or beautiful way our Stevie Moore is just you know super creative super interesting you know I just wish I had a lifetime to listen through his entire discography you know but but but I am happy and thankful for you know collections of songs like this that pull out you know some of his best and most entertaining stuff all right moving on we have a classic heavy-metal record over here reviewed this band recently four classics week this is one of my favorite records of theirs I've never have had it on vinyls so you know I just wanted to pick it up because I saw it and you know these recording to record an analogue even though it is a reissue it's nice to get the vinyl to get that old-school punch we have Iron Maiden's powerslave people are asking me why did I review number of the beasts and not power sleeve you know there's so many great catchy tracks on here and I agree this record for Iron Maiden really is and even though I do love killers I love number two the beast this record really is where Iron Maiden perfected their studio craft and and came together with some wonderfully mixed and recorded and perform songs like two minutes to midnight and Aces High some of the most exciting tracks yet though you know I just I do like that raw feel of some of the earlier recordings this album over here is fantastic but and they really had to together on this album and that's why it still stands today is one of the best heavy metal records of all times so you know if you're looking for an in with Iron Maiden you know the power slave is not a bad place to start and it is a really heavy thick 180 gram record and you know we sort of had this white sleeve and then we have the lyric sleeve over here you know which you can sort of use separately from the white sleeve if you don't want to screw up your lyric sleeve or anything like that this one's actually already pealing wonderful but you know we do have the lyrics here old school picture of the band Bruce Dickinson over there look like a total badass so there you go Iron Maiden powerslave alright moving on if I could pop this in the record sleeve which I can't so that's just probably never gonna happen we're never gonna move on from this record this will this will be the last vinyl update ever and it'll probably be the last review ever because I will be here for the rest of my life trying to stick this album in the sleeve it's just never gonna happen sorry y'all reviews are canceled but up there we go got it finally back looks nice too you know these old-school you know sort of hand-drawn pieces of album art they definitely have a specific kind of character to them you know it's not Photoshop is uh you know not that that's bad just saying um a fan of the show past this record to me a mr. Noah thank you sir this is amazingly generous of you thank you very much give a listen to this 12-inch single it's fantastic but I'm not surprised about that because you know similar with the record that this single came off of and you know it's just nice to have it on vinyl I don't have this record on vinyl though I do have another album from this band and my collection spiritualize the single stop your crime which is a wonderful little piece of string kissed pop music it's really sad music just like profoundly sad little tune about how you know really it's it's the people you love are the ones who often end up hurting you the most played at 45 we have a two non-album tracks on the b-side and the album version of stop your crying on the a side sounds amazing so again Noah thank you for passing this to me it was wonderful I was moved by not only the song but your generosity as well and I will take this opportunity to you know again say thank you and say if you have not listened to spiritualize please do you know look the band up even though they do have some records that people do enjoy more than others I think singles like this and as well as their latest album as well the album ladies and gentlemen to all fantastic records you know really can't go wrong starting off with those albums or you know really much of any album in the spiritualize discography you know I don't think they've ever come out with like a horrible record you know if you're into bands like Mercury Rev and you love psychedelic rock and you love rock music that features you know really big huge instrumentation but it's executed well and tastefully spiritualize you know most definitely could be the band for you another band that could be the band for you the debut EP of noise rock alpha experimental rock outfit the Jesus lizard this is before they were you know in there form with some of their biggest records like goat for example on the you know we do have guys like lead singer David Yau on this album you know who is going completely insane on tracks like Bloody Mary for example you know he's definitely doing his thing on tracks like that the Jesus Lizard if you love heavy riffs if you love insane vocals if you love visceral grooves if you love noise if you love volume you really can't go wrong with the Jesus Lizard really what kind of holds this EP back from being you know you know the the band's later and greater stuff is is really the lack of real drums though I don't think it holds them back that much you know there's definitely like a fluidity to the performances on this album they're just not really at that peak of insanity and intensity that they would be on goat which you know might be something they kind of I guess evolved into through their really crazy live shows but you know this EP has five tracks they're really heavy really aggressive in your face it's a nice thick record you know it's got a lot of punch to it played at forty five again it's just a handful of tracks not their best of their best stuff but you know it's definitely interesting to sort of see the band at this early evolution period you know we have a picture over here of the drum machine they were using and a bit of backstory as well as some quotes from people like Henry Rollins and this releases liner notes and some pictures of the band too it's just uh you know an interesting little piece of history four people are into this specific kind of music and you know just might be a big jesus lizard fans but you know for you if you're this is your first time getting into them you know that they're full-length LPS that they would come out with not too long after this EP you know it would definitely be the great way to go and you know this thing late 80s late 80s this came out you know and Jesus lizard such a sign of things to come in a lot of ways yeah this record is totally just you know insane intense messed up and you know again you know put the kids to bed you know if they if they can't handle this album art over here apologies apologies issue I should have given fair warning but yeah there you go again Jesus lizard and finally another heavy record another bit of metal here this is another reissue as well we have a home cro-mags with Alpha Omega cro-mags celebrated fantastic crossover thrash band from New York bringing together thrash metal with hardcore punk other fantastic fans and that genre includes suicidal tendencies if you're looking for bands that are more on the punk side of that spectrum because there were groups that kind of slid in between the two if you're looking for bands that are more on the punk side suicidal tendencies and if you're looking for bands that are more on the metal side at least on this record anyway this cro-mags album over here will do their earlier stuff was definitely more Punk influenced but this album over here kind of sounds like they got a hold of like Danzig's debut album and just turned around and didn't look back there's some huge thrash riffs on here some really sad songs as well you know there really can't be melodic just you know over the top like the other side of madness revenge the the picture of the band over here is actually pretty actually pretty sweet you know looking looking looking real look a real tough there with real 90s and we have a John on vocals over here who was an absolute madman you know just he's so over the top on this record he is absolutely batshit insane on this album in kind of in low sort of way sometimes but you know the the grooves are there this record definitely does have a sound does mark a time a certain time in rock music that I think is interesting to a degree not one of my favorite moments in rock music but you know definitely representative of an era and you know and if you are a vegetarian or vegan the lead singer this band you know Johnny actually wrote a book called meas for pussies that I actually think is a pretty hilarious look up John Joseph me is for pussies and and and and yeah and yeah that's that's about it for this you know again very heavy and and even though this record is very metal influenced sometimes you know that that punk ferocity does come through and in the speed in the intensity so it's not like they've gone totally you know heavy thrash metal but you know it's it's certainly you know something that shows up on this on this album and I think that is it for this month's vinyl update cool cool transition have you give any these records a lesson to even own any of them if you don't I recommend that you know you pick some of them up if they are available at your local stores or you know if you're in the market for some new vinyl and yeah that's about it I hope you're doing well thanks for hanging out with me for this vinyl update and just kind of chillin checking out some records the best 
JKM79q5lKVM,hi everyone Bethany friend tanto here the Internet's best friend and it's time for a review of the new Leviathan album scar sided Leviathan is a West Coast American black metal project that is masterminded by multi-instrumentalist rest aka Jeff Whitehead he's been at it for years now some of leviathans recordings span all the way back to the late 90s and Jeff has also been featured in other musical projects such as lurker of chalice which is another solo project Van Gogh as well as Twilight which is kind of a American black metal supergroup of sorts featuring mal effectives ass there as well as Blake Judd of not miss diem and even Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth at one point among other artists as well but Leviathan is the longest-running project rest has been involved with and one that started out pretty traditional by black metal standards if you can get your ears on some of aizen's earliest recordings and as Leviathan started evolving past that more standard black metal sound in the mid 2000s rest started incorporating maybe more atmosphere into the mix his music started getting more depressive the album silhouette and splinters actually flirts with dark ambient a little bit this time period was actually pretty prolific for Leviathan we had rest dropping one split CD after another with black metal projects from the US and Europe but things eventually took a more aggressive turn in 2008 with the album massive conspiracy against all life and creating a hellish depressive and frightening vibe really became the focus on the next Leviathan album true traitor true whore with the guitars and the vocals on this album reaching just loud and freakish levels of insanity Leviathan was kind of staying true to those black metal roots but also experimenting pretty boldly with sound on this record to the point where I'm kind of sorry I didn't review it when it originally came out but still you know given the experimentation of the adventure that leviathans been embarking on sonically with his latest output I was sort of you know curious as to what Skaar cited was going to hold but I'm not going to talk about this album just by myself I have invited the one and only mr. Mike c-town of his own YouTube channel as well as deaded hip hop to discuss this new Leviathan album with me transition and here we are magic of the internet with mr. Mike c-town to talk about this new Leviathan album Mike see town all the most metal guys I know decided that we needed to talk about this record together um so Mike what do you think about this new Leviathan album I I love it man it's pretty much exactly what I wanted from the buyeth ed I don't think it's too much of a sharp turn from true Trainor um I just think that with this one it just sounds way more focused and it's suffocating it's ugly it's gross its disgusting it's exactly it's everything that I go to Leviathan for that's that that's pretty much what I thought about it too I mean the first thing that hit me about the record when listening to is that this album is freakin massive it is a huge record and it's such a fantastic record for the progression that he's been going in since you know like the late 2000s when he kind of came out of that depressive black metal spell and started doing harder more aggressive stuff and you know true trader true whore so aggressive I'm so noisy and so chaotic and in this album to me you know especially with um some of the opening material like dawn vibration for example it's really hellish it's really noisy it's so overloaded but it never felt like difficult too difficult to decipher for me kind of like a porno album or something like that it felt a lot like controlled chaos hmm I don't know man I am i think the best parts about his albums are that they do kind of take at least for me they take a little bit of getting used to a little bit of deciphering because yeah first for sure I mean I get I guess what I'm saying is that it wasn't impossible to yeah you know what I mean it didn't seem like trying to decipher it didn't seem like phew yeah there are so many layers of you know especially on one of these opening tracks here you know what he's doing with his vocals kind of delivering those really deep azzaman you know guttural vocals which kind of border on you know a death metal style there's so many of them on top of each other in in in the mix and it's really overpowering I thought that was one of those interesting things about this record is it's not really a black metal record you know um I think he's been going in this direction for the past three or four records but um with this one I think there's a there's a lot of doom metal there's a lot of like he's like portal ish death metal there's a lot of ambient there's a lot of there's even like some noise elements to this like he's mixing in so much stuff and it comes together so well yeah it's really eclectic and and what I love about this record - he really changes up his vocal stylings a lot as well he throws in some spoken word um there was one track on the tail end of the song uh on the tail end of one of the tracks from beginning of the album where often the guitars go kind of clean and he's just you know letting out these like blood-curdling shouts and it was just super chilling like some of the best parts on this album are really freakish you know when whenever I listen to - black metal it's like my mind immediately goes to like either despair or or anger and the best thing about Leviathan Records is you can get both of those things and like a shit ton more and that's just in one song and I think that's like one of the best parts about Leviathan is when you put an album on you get so many different feelings and so many different emotions from listening to it and that's that's pretty rare in black metal usually if you have a record it's one standard theme throughout the entire thing this is not the case no and then the thing is I think you did a really great job of elongated things on this record um true trader is a little bit more of a direct album you know it's just about 40 minutes long and this one is over an hour the title track alone is 10 minutes and then the the fact that he he puts so many different things into his songs excuse me allows him to drum up all these different parts and phases in each track so you know it's these songs aren't anywhere near redundant you know they're always progressing towards something different which which is a characteristic I pick up in a lot of American black metal acts you know a lot of those Nordic acts tend to be a little bit more repetitive and minimal and you know would really go for an atmosphere um which which is fine but you know I would say this album you know not only brings some death metal to the table some noise to the table but you know definitely some progressive and experimental rock elements - I agree absolutely um so you know for me some of my favorite moments come right in the beginning of the record and right at the end of the record the beginning of the album for me can't contain some of the most hellish parts on the entire album dawn vibration is made my favorites of all those because it's just such an immense way to start the album especially after that you know sort of droney ambient intro that I think kind of gets you calm right before he just throws you know everything at you everything he's got all at once and then my other favorite moments are maybe the three final tracks which another interesting thing about this record I think as it progresses it gets a little less cloudy and a little less difficult to decipher on the very next track on here on gardens of I'm going to I'm going to botch this pronunciation over here corporal light um you know you start hearing a little bit more guitar melody in there and I think as the out progresses forward you know you're getting a little bit more melody here and there that was still heavy it's still sinister and those three final tracks are some of the most epic songs on the entire album and they just feel really grand and really huge yeah um I'll say my two main favorite songs on this whole album had to be definitely with enthrall and dawn vibration and Dawn vibration mainly because he's he's he's definitely stepped his guitar the guitar game up like always I use a great musician but the picked our work on this album I think is fucking awesome and on dog vibration I hear a lot of like Prometheus era Isan when I listen to that and it's and I love you know Emperor's my all-time favorite black metal band so hearing that on this is is fuckin great but with enthrall absolutely blew me away because I love how it has it starts off with that that pre-standard like death metal is riff then it gets quiet for a second then it comes in with that that just straight-up darkthrone old-school black metal riff and it's just a perfect song but I man there's not a single I came to think of a bad song is I'm gonna bad some of this whole album man it's just it's so good I can't think of one either you know I mean that track and a veil is lifted weren't to my favorite songs on the record I thought as the album came toward the middle we were at a point on the record where I think the songs got comparatively straightforward in comparison with the other songs on the help they weren't as you know cacophonous they weren't as weighted down like tons of vocals the guitars felt as you were saying you know a little bit more straightforward and you can read them easier and they were more technical but the songs work is huge as some of the finishing tracks and and maybe as a result of that you know with my initial listens here they didn't stick with me as much as the initial songs and the ending songs but like I had I have a lot of reasons right now to return to this album and I think as I listen to this out more those tracks are only going to grow on you know because even those songs you know didn't really strike me as awful um I don't think Leviathan here in the grander scheme of things is reinventing the wheel with black metal but like he's doing really creative stuff with it you know and throwing things into it that I don't think a lot of artists would think to or would in general and not necessarily my kind of a gimmicky way like oh you know he threw a banjo into the mix oh my god you know I think how he experiments with black metal who's you know with just great compositions and and when he does throw sounds in there that wouldn't normally be there um they're really chilling and they're really scary and they're really freaky you know every sound that is sort of new and different only enhances the the best things and the most amazing things about black metal you know that you come to expect from a genre yeah I definitely think that that what rest does is he's pulling off something that very few bands could actually pull off without sounding cheesy and yet he's one guy exactly how amazing is that that you have this one dude that goes into a studio and is able to make this incredible ridiculously disgusting but complex super complex album and it totally sounds cohesive it isn't sound like a mess you know true traitor at times sounded like a beautiful mess I don't get that same feeling with this it sounds like even though I know he said sometimes that he does improvise in the studio when it comes to his music but it sounds like every note every bridge you know every every piece is put into place for a specific reason and everything just comes together so just perfectly I can't think of another band really that is doing something like this that's doing it this well it doesn't sound like a shit storm yeah I mean you know I could there are some other black metal acts that American black metal acts that I can think are doing music that you know tries to to be grand not the same sense but you know like death heaven or something like that and there are other acts like knock miss diem that you know do comparatively you know do comparative experiments but this album is just so just so huge you know while maybe it not it might not be as obvious with its crescendos is like a deafheaven album um you know it's definitely huge but stays true to that black metal sound you know doesn't feel like he's bringing post-rock into the into the fold when he's you know making these songs huge and I think that's really what separates this this LP from true traitor you know while that album is gruesome um this one is gruesome and grand you know especially during those finishing moments yeah like the closing track mounted either Zhou live there try of an a I'm gonna leave it there but yeah he's doing with like the really deep guttural vocals of the spoken word on that track is just really you know come a nightmare it sounds you fucking scary and again like like I like knock miss diem but they're not scary to me but even Krieg is not scary to me like lurker a chalice which was you know that shit is scary is like anything this guy does is fucking which is actually a good you know point of comparison you know because I think I think elements of that project leaked into this album as well because you know sort of sets that that the latest album from that project for me is that there's a lot of different parts to work with you know the song was featured a lot of progressions and and they're really multifaceted and I think that's what he started doing here yeah yeah he's definitely doing black metal a huge service by by putting out music like this because so many black metal bands now especially the u.s. bands they're just they're I don't even get into the whole cult and true bullshit they're just not dark they're not scary everything about this shit is fucking terrifying and I love about it so much ya know I think a lot of American black metal bands you know they fall into a certain you know trend you know they definitely pick up the blast beats they take tremolo guitars and they might even incorporate some of those wretched wretched vocals as well but they're not necessarily trying to you know be scary or be frightening or be freakish you know which which is fine you know but I think I think Leviathan again has managed to stay true to what you know black metals roots are but you know is just doing it bigger you know on this record you know this is a great recording you know it's very high fidelity it's very detailed it's very dense and complex but you don't feel like you're listening to something over produced you know you don't feel like you're listening to a something that has been spruced up and cleaned up to the point where it's just really sterile yeah he's definitely he's definitely found that great middle point between the more clean they're modern stuff and like old nasty recorded in a fucking trash can under water lily just know our type shit like he found that perfect middle point I just can't I can't say enough good things about this it's so good yeah I mean I'm really liking it I think it's gonna be with my favorite metal records of the year you know it's still too early to tell if it's going to be my favorite but you know it's definitely a fantastic album for you know it's March snow is melting soon hopefully things are picking up musically you know more records are coming out every week you know some of the bigger artists are starting to drop their stuff and you know I think this is a really great record to uh you know just to kick off the start of the the musical season absolutely I agree all right I'm feeling like a decent strong eight on this thing I mean I don't know about you oh I don't know man I'll go with that this you just love the shit out of it that's the holy D think too strong is that good that work that's that's fine with me it's hard with me all right guys the ladies and gentlemen that's what we thought about this new record check it out and then leave a link down there in the description box where you guys can stream the album for yourselves and I want to thank Mike again for coming on absolutely man thanks for having me I'm going to leave a link down there in the description where you guys can watch his videos he does final update see the solar reviews of course you know

2aX-AqRgjIo,do boo-boo hi everyone animal leave friend tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new payal album you are better than this payal is a boston-based indie rock and post hardcore bands their fourth full-length album I believe they've been added since the late 2000s I stumbled upon them in 2012 through their album dripping one of my favorite rock records of that year for its punk ferocity it's jagged guitar riffs its guitar playing which actually had quite a bit of character the weird winding twisting songs on this record to hear when the band would go aggressive there were some clear influences coming from groups like Husker Du and some Fugazi and maybe some shellac - but what set payal apart from those bands and other bands that copy those bands were the over-the-top vocals of frontman Rick Maguire as well as some of these songs and just melodies hiding underneath some of this aggressive rock instrumentation because there were actually some memorable lyrics and some memorable songs beyond the volume of the band especially our tracks like so hard which through the guitar arpeggios showed a little bit of fulk influence and if you've heard dripping maybe you like this new album of piles as well because it doesn't really sound like they've done much of anything to change up their sound now don't get me wrong there most definitely some changes going on here but they're incredibly subtle maybe the band sounds a little bit louder maybe there's a little more reverb on the vocals the reverb sounds brighter a bit sharper though it doesn't exactly help the vocals at all which a lot of the time I find to be kind of buried behind the slightly pumped up guitars I think this record might be a little more aggressive than dripping in some respects but stylistically though the band really is the same group you might remember from several years ago which is fine if they continue to deliver good material though I was kind of hoping that would change things up at least a on this album considering that you know even though I do like dripping it doesn't have the most original sound on the block what really made that record appeal to me was just that it had good solid songs and great performances but I don't think this new album over here has as much of that I think this time around pile is a slightly less dependable band more unpredictable in a sense more prone to intense mood swings we will get into that in a second though first I do want to give this album props for having some of the best song titles I've seen on any record this year appendicitis number two hit single the world is your last and the one minute acoustic interlude the police which is actually incredibly well written and performed and one of my favorite tracks in the track listing here and this track is an incredible contrast to how the album actually starts out with an incredibly loud flurry of staccato guitar chords the snare drums sound like pistols going off vocals are all frenzied going insane the whole song is really punchy really in your face but it's a it's really all kind of a blur - and there are aggressive moments and piles back-catalogue but on this album there's just something kind of unfocused about it like if you took away the volume if you took away the energy that there really wouldn't be much of anything there or if there is something there it's kind of difficult to decipher with how buried the vocals feel a lot of the time and I feel roughly the same way about a lot of the louder more aggressive tracks here like number two is single the slower dreary er tracks are really where some of the album's best tunes shine through even though they're filtered through these really heavy slow dreary depressing guitars like the song mr. fish which has some of the weirdest lyrics on the entire LP Rick seems to be kind of singing from the standpoint of a character on this track there's a really anthemic build toward the end of the song that's pretty nice - I also dig the incredibly slow and heavy sonically and a moose only hot breath there is not a single song on this record that is as dismal and I think just as as wallowing in its sadness as this track and for the most part I dig the really big finish of this album - it's a seven minute track appendicitis kind of strung out guitar chords at the beginning of this track following a slightly funky progression then all of a sudden the guitars get heavy the song just changes pace changes flavor it starts building intensifying there's a really weird break of silence with like some vocals left over from just the studio recording just not being cut out and the song eventually finishes with this huge explosion of just noisy twangy guitar leads there are definitely highlights on this record pile still sounds like a very capable man the performances on this record for the most part are still very tight but I just can't help but feel like this record is just a tad too aggressive and it feels weird saying that because I love the fact that a lot of rock music is really visceral but after repeated listens the loudest and craziest parts on this album just weren't anything more than an unmemorable rage and it could be the mixing the compression maybe a little bit of the reverb - but I felt like I spent more time than I should have on this record just trying to decipher what was going on and not necessarily because any of the plane was overly technical or anything like that but I felt like the guitars and the vocals were constantly clashing which were both being bodied all the time by just how loud the drums were just feels like pile kind of switched up their production style a little bit - something that just didn't really complement them as well and I think it made a lot of the material here less enjoyable then then it could have been I'm feeling a light too decent six on this album transition if you've given this elma listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana pile forever 
6ygh9uA_blQ,hi everyone vape that a wave tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cannibal ox record thank you baby names blade of the Ronin cannibal ox is a new york-based abstract experimental hip hop duo they made their debut in the year 2001 with the full-length LP the cold vein which is celebrated as one of the best hip hop albums of the 2000s I would say that assessment is justified for several different reasons one the progressive and futuristic production on this record brought by V one and only LP aka el producto a rapper and producer who has seen incredible success lately with the duo he's been working in with southern rapper killer Mike run the jewels but also on the sell P we have rappers vast air and vaudeville mega who both had the rugged gritty delivery of a great 90s rapper but also spit lyrics that were pretty heady which was nice and refreshing approach considering we were just on the cusp of the bling era being in full swing but even though this project at the time was relatively well received and his only garnered more critical acclaim over the years cannibal ox has been pretty silent as a duo since the release of this album of course we have seen solo records from vertol mega and vast air but now we're kind of hitting a point where they're due for a comeback it's been over ten years since their biggest record came out they've been silent for a while the cold vein continues to establish itself as a classic and with this new project here I see vast and and Wartell coming back to take advantage of that growing popularity which is fine if they can come out with a record that is as good as the cold vein or at least decent as a lot of you know comebacks can be kind of unpredictable they can really go either way there are amazing comebacks but in the vast majority of them are kind of underwhelming and even though I went into this record hoping for good things right off the bat something does kind of feel off and I think that is the lack of LPS production and even though I do respect portal and vast as MCS it's kind of hard because how could it not feel that way cannibal ox is biggest and only record features LPS production but even if differences did get settled an LP connected with cannibal ox again I don't really think we would see the same magic even LP is in an entirely different place now when it comes to his music and his production so getting back with cannibal ox wouldn't necessarily mean more beats in the vein of the cold vein so considering that I sort of see blade of the Ronin as cannibal ox showing us what else they can do almost 15 years later overall with the sound of this LP it's definitely clearer than the cold vein it's punchy ER less psychedelic less experimental a lot of the songs here are much more concise and I think rely a little bit more heavily on hooks there are no five or six minute tracks in the runtime here but yeah this new record here is surprisingly straightforward in comparison with their previous one we also have a bulk of the production with the exception of one Black Milk beat being handled by a mr. Bill cosmic whose instrumentals features some kind of eerie mystical melodies there's an ominous feel to some of these beats but these melodies the higher frequencies are backed with some pretty traditional boom bap drum grooves even without looking at this album from a lyrical standpoint just taking the beats just taking the hooks just taking the flows it's it's very obvious on first listen that cannibal oxes is not going for something anywhere near as experimental as the cold of a portal and vast do bring flow on this album I wouldn't call both of their deliveries relaxed per se but they do make what they do sound kind of easy almost as if it's just effortless or second nature to them on every Vorta mega verse here we hear him very laid-back very subdued flow but the rhymes are pretty thoughtful a lot of the time I think he consistently mines some of the best lines on the record he's kind of monotone he's kind of lifeless but he does bring bars gather him in vast air pull on themes from karate movies and sci-fi outerspace and a ton of different things now vas tear on the mic though is a huge contrast from Virgil mega he's much more energetic enthusiastic in-your-face there's a strong rasp on his voice he's on the opposite side of the spectrum his lines are a little bit more blunt visceral and that kind of comes with its cons as well we have one MC here that brings lyrics but neglects energy especially on the song blade the art of aux on this track verbal sounds half asleep like he's slurring his words and just can't keep it together really as the album progresses his verses feel less like verses and just more like ramblings that happen to have rhymes in them and then we have another emcee that brings energy but I think kind of neglects lyrics I sort of wonder how long bass stare sort of sat on these lines before he decided to deliver them there are numerous lines on this project that like grab my attention and not for good reasons did I mention I like to fight imps from the fifth dimension and there are other lines on here lots of other lines that aren't necessarily terrible rhymes or anything like that but either they don't really make much in the way of sense or they're totally ridiculous or sort of cringe-worthy to the point where you're kind of wondering why he would put so much emphasis and so much energy behind delivering things like ain't you the guy that got caught touching Pikachu Butterfly smoking with caterpillar or some very cliche drug imagery they're kind of trying to be psychedelic with a really flat kind of drained hook on the song Thunder in July then a milky ish way by her pelvic zone that was nice when he said ham he needed to specify that that was hard as a mother grandmother telling him to settle his chores another example of him just kind of phrasing things really awkwardly in these lines kind of making you kind of you know sit back for a minute like what is he trying to say there and kind of takes away from the impact of of what he's trying to come he even Boches lines on the concept tracks on here like iron rose that features MF DOOM right off the bat vast air is just pulling for ways to incorporate the word iron into his lyrics saying his kids are so tough they eat iron candy and that his girl is so tough she wears iron panties consistently the features are far more interesting on this record one verse after another from people like Elle's I and MF DOOM and you God and even the more unknown features on on this record are just more entertaining and thankfully they're there because they kind of break up the monotony of much of this record you know definitely Vorta land vast do bring flows the beats are kind of Spacey I think as an instrumental album this record would be pretty the rhythms thump real nice the vibe is enjoyable on this album but don't expect to dive into the details of this record as you may have on the cold vein and get the same amount of enjoy ability if you do dive into this record you may actually come up empty-handed I was really anticipating this LP for a little while and it's kind of a shame just how little it actually ended up bringing to the table I'm feeling a light too decent 5 on this thing pretty indifferent it's not the worst thing in the world a lot of the time it is pretty listenable but there really wasn't much of anything on this project I could ever see myself revisiting transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantana cannibal ox blade of the ronan forever 
dLV5i15nz4Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new fashion album the ecology this guy is a West Coast rapper and is his second solo full-length commercial project which I have been waiting for since like late 2009-2010 and like five years a really long time in rap years especially in the internet age but fash has been busy doing some feature appearances yeah he had a Murs collaboration he's also been touring a little bit he had a mixtape drop in 2011 too and he's also signed with nas's record label mass appeal for the release of this new album as well but in my opinion fashions debut full-length LP Boy Meets World was so good that it was definitely worth keeping an eye out for whenever he would eventually drop the ecology which was a project that he announced he would release that would be the follow-up to Boy Meets World not too long after the release of that album now this record was entirely produced by rapper producer exile who was also fresh off of a really fantastic project with fellow West Coast artist blue and Exiles magic work similarly for fashion as well fash built up to this album with a series of mixtapes live shows ciphers so when he eventually dropped this album he sounded super confident experienced and he delivered loads of conceptual tracks that reflected on his past his childhood his experiences with gang violence his mother's revolving door of sometimes dependable and sometimes really seedy boyfriends there was a tribute to California on this record as well and my favorite cut on the entire LP V ecology which was a really just urgent hard-hitting and dark take on fashions surroundings which was a tone I assumed and hoped would carry through onto this new record over here given that it was titled after the hardest song on Boy Meets World but unfortunately in my opinion there's not a single song on the ecology that that is as good as the ecology the song nor do I find this new LP to be as charming or as interesting as Boy Meets World it doesn't really have that hard dose of reality that Boy Meets World had and I don't think it consistently delivers that down-to-earth relatable charm charm charm I thought a lot of the instrumentals on Boy Meets World were a little more preferable as well really soulful a little dirty but still really sweet on the flip side the instrumentals here feel maybe a little too squeaky-clean even though the bulk of the production here is handled by exile himself even the alchemist finds himself in the production list here however my issues with this LP don't entirely lie with the production but still there are moments on here like they're really gaudy banger out of the trunk a loud bass e trunk knockin pop rap track that sounds kind of dated like it would have went over a lot better in the 2000s also features a really prominent Busta Rhymes sample the humble demeanor in personal stories of his earlier stuff just don't really come through on this track and instead I feel like we're getting a song that's just kind of general just really meant to appeal on a visceral level I don't really think this track is meant to a catch that years of people are really focusing in on lyrics which is fine you know if you're making hip-hop music like that but I don't really think that's a lane that fashion plays in very well I've never considered him the slickest guy in a lineup and I just think he's better at delivering stories and vivid imagery than he is punchlines there are some other tracks here that feature super forced clumsy hooks like the song place to go you know you know you know you know I know a course that is seriously overused considering how under written it is pretty much every chorus on here where I hear fash doing singing vocals doesn't go over that well though he does have some good guest singers on here when they do appear like bj the chicago kid he appears on one track I just wish maybe he left more choruses to some of these guest singers especially on the song the world the whole world but I loved the whole world not not only are the lyrics on the course here at incredible turn off but fash is singing on this track just gets super obnoxious plus the uppity B and the glitzy pianos on this track really aren't doing his vibe any favors either there are some pretty nice sweet relaxed female vocals on the opening track here that remind me a little bit of Lord it's not too bad but the song is actually way too mild to kick an entire record off especially a song that's acknowledging it's been a while since we've heard from fashion at least in a full-length album capacity luckily things pick up on the next track here confess which has a huge tip of the hat to Boogie Down Productions and the lyrics it's hard-hitting its gritty in a sense but still the record isn't sitting quite well with me and fat Shawn might insist that that might have something to do with me not following his evolution on this album which he does on the song higher where lyrically I feel like fash is kind of preemptively stepping in the faces of potentially unhappy fans and listeners calling them out as being impatient or just unwilling to follow him down a different road or into some different territory and I will be the first one to admit that you know sometimes listeners throw bands that they once loved to the curb and no longer be supportive the fan artist relationship isn't really the healthiest out there but getting super indignant toward the people who are listening to your record isn't exactly a solution to the problem and despite fashion's mentions of evolution he continues to circle around a lot of the same topics taking some of them at slightly different angles there is a tribute to California on here though this one seems to be a little more old-school than the previous one fashioned at Penn on Boy Meets World it also features a sweet g funk style instrumental he also raps about growing up with his misfit friends getting into trouble on the song to be young which features some really nimble pianos there's also a track here where he's telling a story about having to be the man of the house at a very young age and the song on the back end of this LP in tribute to his mother is really beautiful in a lot of ways it seems to detail just how their relationship is and in her life as well but still he holds an incredible amount of love and respect for her it's kind of a display of how deep and unag Nora below these blood familial bonds can be there are tracks like mother where he pushes an emotional boundary he dives deeper into the topic he makes revisiting it worth it but the rest of the time I don't really feel like that's the case especially with these noticeably blander instrumentals though I do have to give props to the alchemist for the bee he dropped on this album with all the hilarious Sesame Street samples on that beat that was actually pretty awesome bland is really how I feel about a bulk of this album and and I'm not really sure what took so long to release it was he waiting for the right label the right time was he really kind of at a loss for what to say because when this album isn't trying to reheat cold topics its delivering tasteless hooks with subpar singing or maybe even some nondescript verses this album just feels super basic and and in a really unflattering way given that it's been five years of time between this release and his last flanked LP I just figured he'd have more to say and the instrumentals maybe be a little bigger a little more epic but instead they're just unbearably sterile unfortunately this LP was kind of letdown for me but as as a listener who wasn't really into where Fushan was going or where he wasn't going with this album I don't really think it has much to do with evolution as it does a lack thereof I'm feeling a late two decent five on this thing transition if you give him this album listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh the ecology forever 
J6FSd14ATB4,still love me too hi everyone Casey and Jo Jo Jo here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jeff Rosenstock album we cool no we not cool cuz you're ripping me off you're campion me buddy how am i copying you you got my hair you got my skin you got my face you're just ripping me off well how can I be a copy of you when you're just a figment of my imagination oh my god I was just making him up the whole time how they found it tore tilith yo give me a piece no get your own Jeff Rossen sock is a singer-songwriter once singer and guitarist for the band Baum the music industry the punk band formed in the mid-2000s disbanded last year personally I never really got that deep into them they're bright uppity melodic poppy approach to Punk never really sat that well with me but I did find there occasionally downtrodden and snarky lyrics pretty admirable and coming off that bomb the music industry demise Jeff is just sort of going back into a solo direction because it's been a little while since he released music and some of his other side projects and while he has gone solo once before with the record I look like I think he's really doing it on another level on this new release here but aside from pop punk on this record you can also expect whiffs of indie rock and Weezer s power pop some alt-country some folk music there's definitely some undertones of Andrew Jackson jihad on this album like knife man era Andrew Jackson jihad as some of you may know that band actually made their side one dummy debut not too long ago but I didn't care for that record all that much because I think Andrew Jackson's rough around the edges quirks were part of what made that band so interesting whereas on the flip side with bond the music industry as well as Jeff Rosenstock solo stuff I've always thought maybe they were just too for my taste maybe they needed to be cleaned up a little bit primped and synced up up up up and we cool does in fact feature a cleaner brighter punchier recording than jeff solo stuff and most bond the music industry releases in my opinion the drums the guitars are all tightly assembled on this album and complemented very well with some sense and some glockenspiel and some piano and some brass even though you're getting that throttling punk energy you may be getting layers of instrumentation riding along that same tempo just making the song not only sound exciting and just blood pumping but epic and atop all of this our Jeff Rosen stocks very lively vocals and some pretty sharp lyrics too even though Jeff on this album is deep into his 30s on much of this record he is reflecting on emotions I think most people have in their 20s when they find themselves at a crossroads where they just don't know what to do with their lives is Jeff going back into the past and remembering these feelings or is he having these feelings now because of the demise of bond the music industry and he's not really sure where his own music career is going there are certainly some present-day reflections found on this record like with the introductory track where it seems that Jeff is talking about friends of his or just people that he knows getting established buying homes having families meanwhile he doesn't have to get up he doesn't have a kid or he's just kind of bumming around and this is something that I think gives him freedom and gives him excitement and leads him on all sorts of adventures that he enjoys but he finds like depression in this too especially with tracks like nausea which is a really clumsily played piano rock track but it's still very awesome it's a endearingly clumsy and on this track we see Jeff avoiding loved ones and avoiding family conversations with these people and diving instead into alcohol because he's sick and tired of talking about and thinking about what he's going to do with his life these very sad feelings are amplified on the next track beers alone again which is a bit of all country or on the song polar bear or Africa where Jeff has this really killer refrain on this track where he says that I'm going to die and you're going to forget my name which i think is also reflected in the song Hall of Fame too this is a pretty morbid album overall Jeff may see some lows on this record he may see some successful highs but he doesn't even seem to enjoy those because he sort of sees death as this great equalizer that knocks all of us down but these sentiments are balanced out with incredibly energetic guitars and epic choruses and righteous guitar solos many of the tracks on this album are super anthemic and if you were to strip the lyrics out of the equation you could even call the music upbeat and a lot of the songs flow into one another really well I don't think Jeff was trying to write a story or outright create a concept album but it certainly feels like that with how seamless some of the music is from track to track and given that Jeff centers around a lot of the same emotions and in lyrical themes on this 30-minute record Jeff is not in his 50s right now but still this album kind of feels like a midlife crisis record if the life expectancy today was 60 with a lot of personality and emotion conviction humor Jeff tackles reflections on death and expectations ambitions the game of life there are a few lulls in the tracklisting here like with the song novelty sweater which sounds just pulled straight out of the Weezer playbook not really seeing what Jeff is doing for this sound other than just kind of copying it for this track here even though the tune is okay and the song all blissed out to which sees Jeff and his acoustic guitar sort of drenched and reverb thrown in the distance and it's just difficult to connect with the song right up until the very end where the instrumentation just explodes I think the only major issue that some people might have with this record is that Jeff's vocals are a little off-kilter yell P not for everybody and he's working with a pretty straightforward pop punk sound which isn't anything entirely new it's a stage we're all very familiar with but on top of this stage I think Jeff gives a very smart elaborate performance for me this record is a fun catchy but also comprehensive take on those formative but also embarrassing moments in our lives where we just don't know what direction to move in so instead some of us refuse to do anything or just refuse to grow up this record hits quick but it says a lot and musically I think it's really dense too I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition if you've given the album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it what should Anthony review next what am i doing on this channel and not only our TV that's pretty much it ar TV shameless self-promotion the needle drop forever 
cw9WIp0np44,hi everyone Juggalo Fantasia here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Swain EP heavy dancing let's not believe or not review this EP is just 7 minutes long Swain netherlands-based punk outfit used to work under the name this routine is hell came out with one of my favourite Punk records of 2013 how obviously the man has undergone a name change when I asked them about that they said that they felt like they were working with a sound so different right now that they didn't feel comfortable continuing with the same moniker from releases like Verve Crusader net or ether and how the band has consistently been delivering these heavy sludgy mid-paced punk tunes with groovy riffs and a strong focus on lyrics lyrics that are fed up with societal pressures and societal norms that kind of see things like dying as being more preferable to having a house and a family extreme point of view but when I think that they put very poetically on how all and here on this new EP - in fact much of the Bands original style continues on this new EP here it doesn't really seem like that great of a change of pace in my opinion but there are some noticeable changes there are some harmonious background vocals at some points on the CP guitar riffs that feel like they're influenced by a Nirvana style grunge some flanged guitar chords actually there are more guitar tones overall on this EP than there had been on most of this routine as hell's back catalogue the production on this EP is slightly rougher which I think might just be the case for this EP P P the sound is not as pummeling in fact in some moments is kind of demo ish the drums are not as punchy and a lot of the drums vocals guitars bleed into one another a little bit too much and I guess my other gripe with this EP is that some of the songs the songwriting feels a little underdeveloped despite the incorporation of some of these newer sounds and musical ideas to the Bands flavor anyway to me the CP while is enjoyable overall I think it just feels kind of like a bit of a moment of transition but if they apply the same songwriting ambition to their next full-length that they have on their past two full lengths I think these new sounds could really carry over well not that they haven't already it's it's just the tunes on on this EP that I think are okay if you're a fan of the band already definitely check this EP out if you're not a fan don't expect this EP to wow you with this new name and this slightly different sound I think this is the band's way of teasing toward maybe a larger change on a next full-length record I'm feeling a strong six to light seven on the CP Tran issue boy ake a young guy a K I'm back in this thing you probably wonder I got to see it but on well one real gangsters wear seatbelts - I'm finna go slide to your auntie crib and busted with sugar balls like the kool-aid man now time by but let me get a quick couple shots real quick shout out Katie T Corey David Nate Spencer and of course the main man himself needle drop or as I like to call him the world's most busiest music nerve or as I like to call them the world most busiest gangsta music nerve coming gangsta I mean first of all he's part Italian they mob bosses - y'all seen the brother arms man the brother arms is swole man nigga like he bench pressing got down 345 pounds now talking about messing with new job he probably mean lift wheeze he probably lift finals and and he probably know other calculations at a vinyl the diff group that's a 1/2 a meter he played the double disc the double vinyl Prince Purple Rain he probably know everything the Purple Reign probably 10 pounds extra man you probably know everything like new drops strike me as type of dude if he was a gangster probably robbed like a vinyl store and not robbing for the money but the actual vinyl like he running there they hey give me everything oh we don't have any money sir weird we're uh we're late on cash I don't want your money I want your vinyl East Opera give me the James please give me the death grips give me the Madlib give me the Big Sean psych no he's going crazy baby go back home and they like review it hello I'm Anthony mandingo he give it you know I hate bringing stuff like I will dress the wrong like five so I need to drop do before I get out of here shout out my man Scout you Chester I love me some Cal to Chester but please somebody gotta get count to test out that stank-ass sweater he'd be wearing man you know what I sweated every video haven't seen a man we need to start a hashtag hashtag get cow - Chester some new clothes hashtag get counts who's Chester some new clothes we need a hashtag going around because I'm not standing here wearing I stink as yellow and black broke poor boy chessboard a sweater man I'm not I'm not a fan of it at all so y'all do that for me and so damn it's your boy young guy needle drop forever 
ecdgA-7kU-0,hi everyone Boyan 'i blame tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and now it's time for the darkest most depressing most trying monthly segments of this channel the why you know review where i talk about a series of records that i didn't get a chance to talk about over the past month and i wanted to address them in brief here here we go one the new Chief Keef sorry for the wait mixtape Chief Keef Chicago trap rapper drill rapper chief Sousa not too long ago actually a few years ago I reviewed his finally ritual which the label he was on sort of pushed through as a commercial release to sort of capitalize on the fact that he had all these hot singles at the time like I don't like but on here there was quite a bit of filler as well even though there were some singles on here that I thought were really good Chief Keef didn't really show much in the way of flow or lyrics but there were some really killer refrains on this thing and I think the real standout star on this record to me was young chop who has proven himself to be a pretty great producer as he has worked with more and more artists as the release of finally rich and he is on this album as well as well as a ggp and together they handle the bulk of the production on this new mixtape and keep in mind Chief Keef has dropped a lot of stuff between the release of finally rich and this new mixtape over here however this new tape stands out for a handful of different reasons for one all over this project you hear Chief Keef audibly talking about his life his artistic trajectory the glory boys the the group he's affiliated with in a multitude of other things up until this point Chief Keef has always really been standoffish and mumbly and just kind of shy in interviews and here he's really coming forward and kind of lifting the veil and talking with his fans and I guess even his haters in a very frank way and giving us the insight into his thought process with music and life and on and so forth but I think people have been looking for since he broke and I guess the other change of pace on this project is that Chief Keef seems to legitimately be trying to write some verses on this thing his flow sometimes is really just as off he's either dragging or he's speeding as he was on the finally rich tape but they're actually like you know line after line after line on this thing and not to you know compliment him too much because the lines are pretty dumbed down I mean there are some lines here where he says that he kicks bitches out of his bedroom or his bed because they're corny and he goes on to say they are full of corn I guess literally corn and then there's one track Himalaya the track that I actually like where he's delivering a series of lines were he's saying I put the letter in word and one that really stood out was I put the e and retarded and what's kind of weird is the why he picks certain letters to put them into words it isn't really explained but you know whatever and of course just like with finally rich I really enjoy a lot of the production here it's dark it's hard-hitting it's great traps style production it's super heavy monstrous bass the rattling high hats the sharp snares there's actually even a beat here that chief keef it says that he is credited as producing and it's one of my favorite instrumentals on here and once again Chief Keef does come through with some good refrains as far as some maybe technical issues with this project some of the mixing is pretty terrible which sometimes sees chief Keef's vocals was buried in the beats to the point where you can't really make out what he's saying he does sort of still have that mumbling problem and do keep in mind that a lot of those big singles that we heard not too long ago a chief keef recorded them while he was a different age I mean some of his biggest songs were recorded when he was a teenager and now he's in his 20s his voice through age or through a multitude of other things has deepened pretty noticeably on this project he sounds like an entirely different artist so in a way there is some noticeable progression between when Chief Keef broke and this new project over here it's not exactly winning me over I don't exactly find Chief Keef to be an exciting voice in and of himself I still kind of see him as more of a figurehead or kind of a poster boy for this musical movement going on in Chicago but I can tell that there is more effort at least from Keith on the lyrical side of things on the flow side of things so you know maybe over time he could break some of those assumptions here's to hoping next we have the new cakes the Killa EP IMF this is something the New York rapper dropped this past Valentine's Day and it's just a bunch of love themed songs a lot of heartbreak on this EP and cakes is wrapping over production that is very different from what you might have heard on the eulogy as well as hunger pangs assuming you are excuse me familiar with those projects the instrumentals here are very atmospheric very cloud wrap ish it's it's definitely takes on a different tone than a lot of his previous material I wasn't really in love with it or anything like that but it's nice to see him kind of expanding and just experimenting and trying out new things there was actually one moment on hunger pangs where he was doing a track a lot like what resembles the themes on this new EP and then he kind of stopped in the middle of it only to to laugh and say hi you thought I was on my drake well on this EP here he actually goes just head on down that emotional road and some of the results are good next the new jeff bridges project the sleeping tapes something a lot of you might have seen advertised during the superbowl it's a really strange I guess sample based and field recording and and be an album that according to the advertisements and what you can see on the website that represents the sleeping tapes it's to I guess kind of help people sleep sleep sleep sleep and while yeah it is a pretty eclectic collection of different sounds and there are some very beautiful atmospheric instrumental moments on this thing that feel very vast and I think very imaginative I think evocative emotionally stirring when I listen to this thing I just kind of see just vast landscapes maybe sort of a dark starry sky or something like that however some of the samples of either people talking or kids playing or something like that do at least kind of you know kill the vibe for me if if this is going to be a sleeping tape or anything like that me personally I've always had trouble sleeping to music music is just so stimulating to me so to have it on even even just like a drone or just like a really soft just kind of falling into the background eventually ambient piece it's it's always kind of in the forefront of my mind in some way it becomes something to concentrate on so you know sleeping - music for me is just not really ever an option ever ever however you know I will give it to this to this tape to this project it is relaxing it is a free album and from what I understand you can buy physical copies or digital copies of the sell them as well and all the profits actually go to charities so if you're looking for an ambient album that you can buy that will make you feel good after you buy it consider this next in new strange mountain album glass clouds - which is another ambient record synth based and it's it's very dreamy it's very I want to say a smooth in its textures and it's got some beautiful moments to compositionally you're just kind of hearing all these sinful layers and arpeggios and chords swells on top of one another it's just a very just a very rubbery just huggable record it's just so slippery and smooth mmm is that getting too suggestive it probably is I I guess for me my one gripe with this record as I wish it was a little more texturally diverse but the synthesizers on this thing do sound fantastic for the most part and if you are looking for a very simple straightforward very smooth and vast ambient record do look this thing up next they knew a place to bury strangers album this is a new york-based noise rock and shoegaze band they had a handful of records under their belt so far their first two are my favorites in their discography they have a third out that they really kind of reeled it back in terms of the noise and the volume on the album their sophomore LP exploding head is one of the most pressed albums I've ever heard of my life almost to a fall but it makes the record so intense and so hard-hitting exploding head really as a proper title for this project but with their newest LP over here while it's not as heavy as the band's earlier work it certainly is more sonically diverse than their last album which is actually really good you know it seems like they're trying to do a different sonic experiment with each track and there are some cuts here like straight which are actually in a lot of ways just straightforward kind of catchy post-punk songs however for most of the deeper cuts here the songwriting is just kind of okay while I admire that a place to bury strangers is experimenting and they're trying to do something different ever since they've just kind of turned down the volume I feel like they've lost just a touch of identity which I feel like they're trying to find once again by just working with different sounds and trying different things and and I hope they get there and I definitely feel like on this project here they are closer to something interesting than they were with their last project the new primitive man EP home is where the hatred is if you're looking for a just hard-hitting heavy heavy doom metal and sludge metal EP with just long lengthy monolithic tracks give this thing a listen these guys have a record out that came out I think in 2013 wasn't too bad but my issue with that along with this new EP over here is that you know there's there's not a lot of compositional diversity I guess you know it's it's very redundant it's very meditative I I guess I would like maybe even some more layers in primitive man's music but really at the end of the day this is kind of my preference if you're looking for some doom metal that takes a really primitive caveman like approach I mean if cavemen tried to make do metal I think this really would be their approach I mean primitive man they very clearly go into these records with a certain style with a certain level of simplicity in mind and I think they executed and even if the repetition is a little incessant on this record primitive man you make up for it in a sense with incredibly massive abrasive sound so if you're looking for some doom give the CPA listen next inu an autumn for crippled children album The Long Goodbye this is a black metal project I reviewed not too long ago and when I did review it I enjoyed the very gauzy blissful and kind of heavenly vibe that was coming off the music here was kind of shoegaze II something I also enjoyed on that new botanist album as well but I think that record might have done what this autumn for crippled children album was doing a little bit better but with this new record over here that kind of gauzy just I guess kaleidoscopic sound that the project's previous record was going for is just completely evaporated and now the band the project one person is giving us something much more harsh dark and and I think the result is just kind of alright it seems like it's trying to be more menacing but the kind of low fidelity very trebly and thin brittle recording I think takes away what what could have been a maybe more menacing release just my opinion though if you're looking for sort of a loaf I underground alternative black metal release sort of scratch that itch I would give this thing a try next let's go into the new suzanne sun for project 10 love songs suzanne is a singer-songwriter electro pop and art pop synth pop artist and this new album of hers i I didn't really dig it her last LP the silicone veil I thought was a little eccentric but not really edging past well a lot of Swedish Norwegian synth pop and art pop artists have been doing since the 2000s but with this new project over here I feel like she reels back a little bit from the experimentation that I think could have pushed her into maybe some exciting territory and delivers just some pretty straightforward synth pop electro pop art pop tracks and the production just seems kind of dime-a-dozen run-of-the-mill as well as her vocal delivery to there are some standout singles like the songs delirious and fade away but it just seems just like an average album for this genre in my opinion I also feel that same way to an extent about the new torch record restore these guys are a Florida Stone Iraq sludge pop band who have put out some really standout records over the years for this genre such as hermano crafts and the in return EP and meander Thal and as the band has progressed forward they've found different ways to fuse this really heavy style of music with just pop rock and pop music in general just making it really sweet catchy but also heavy and aggressive in a sense with some kind of clean vocals and with this new LP here and maybe I should have saw this coming the frontman of the band is seen to reform the group that torch was born out of just kind of phoenix from the ashes from and that was a group floor they dropped an album not too long ago in their Reformation and now a torch sort of seems to be echoing that return to roots with this new project over here called restart er and it really just feels like torch hit the reset button and have gone back to they're just heavier days they're less poppy days on this record over here and maybe in a sense that could be a welcome idea because now the band is working with better recordings and they used to in the past maybe they could do this sound that they used to do in their early days and their flora day is a little bit more justice with this latest incarnation of the band but it really just kind of felt like treading water to me nothing really that new or exciting a lot like that songs for singles compilation they drop not too long ago I think tort as long as they continue experimenting it is trying new things they're gonna be an interesting band but if they just kind of stick to what they're most comfortable with like on this record over here it's just gonna be a little kind of one year and out the other for me next the new krill album a distant fist unclenching this is a bit of indie rock here some garage rock lo-fi math rock as well some interesting grooves on here in guitar playing as well I I think it has some really good things going for it but it's the production that really kind of kills me on here especially with the Reaver be bouncy delay on the vocals here and the vocals can be kind of just and just like wimpy whimper which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the delay on here really causes them to just bounce around the mix and cover up anything interesting the instrumentation is doing a lot of the time I think what the band is doing at times can be kind of technical but it's the kind of distance the wetness of effects on the instrumentation that makes it all feel kind of hard to interpret and connect with writing-wise performance wise I can tell there's some good things going on with this record I just wouldn't have really complimented this band with this kind of recording is all maybe something more straightforward drier more intimate and the new body and now collaborative album you whom I have always hated these two bands are two sludge metal bands with very distinct styles and different approaches to the style of music some of which I have enjoyed in the past but neither have really been putting out what I think some of the best stuff in their discography lately however they did come out with a collaborative EP not too long ago people seem to respond to that positively and they have followed that up with an album and both bands their sounds are really heavy bleak nihilistic and I I feel like all of those characteristics are just amplified as they are collaborating together on this new collection of tracks it's not anything too much more adventurous or risk-taking than what they did on the EP or even what they would do separately but they definitely complement each other again in a way it's still not really for me because I've never cared too much for the vocal approach that the body takes on their records not really vibing with that but I know there are some people who are into that if you're looking for a group or a collaboration that takes a kind of freakish approach to one of metals heaviest and most destructive genres then give this project to listen and that is how I'm feeling on all these records you're the best and have a nice day transition if you've given any of these albums a listen what did you think of them did you love him hate him why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana why you no review forever 
OzQmLfChVe4,the color buddy the color hi everyone Mon theny dad tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Dan Deacon album glycerate her Dan Deacon is an electronic music producer and poser and I heard of him in the mid-2000s the same way many people did through a viral video of Dan delivering this insane performance on some local NBC affiliate morning show which was absolute insanity and thanks to this video there was a little bit of an infatuation with who Dan was and what his music was like and just why is he so strange not too long after this video in the growing height between Dan's back-catalogue he signed with carpark records where he would bring his wacky densely layered pop visions to life with a much better recording on the absurdly titled spider-man of the Rings which actually had a really awesome single with the song crystal cat Dan most definitely had a knack for this psychedelic futuristic colorful pop music but his real ambitions lied in some other cuts on this album specifically the song Wham city which was a long 12 minute layered mostly instrumental number that was pretty well put together very fun and showed that Dan had a kind of a growing passion for instrumental composition and minimalism I think Dan's compositions are maybe a little too varied and feature too much progression to be truly minimalistic but he is certainly inspired by the small microscopic hypnotic repetitions in that style of composition and when Dan tried to launch in that stylistic direction with his next full-length LP in 2009 Brahms it was actually a huge success and and really his breakout record however the album was not really that enjoyable to me personally with one layer on top of another layer on top of another layer of hot buzzing synthesizers this made most of the songs kind of obnoxious to me difficult to untangle and gave me about as much ear fatigue as an hour-long Murs bough listening session and even though it felt a little more well put together I felt roughly the same way with the follow-up album America just a few years ago however dan grabbed my attention once again when it came to some of the songs leading up to the release of this new album right here while I may not have loved them it seemed like Dan was changing stylistic directions maybe going back to what people knew of him when he first came out with spider-man of the Rings he was writing more concise songs there was a very clear vocal presence - it sounded like Dan was drifting back to the ecstatic overwhelming pop compositions that I knew him for early on and that's pretty much the case with glitter for the most part Dan mines through his synthesizers on this record for some of the brightest Tambor's he can muster and then he bakes them into these incredibly sweet funfetti cakes of textural happiness and there's some positive results on this LP there's the song when I was done dying which reminds me quite a bit of Wham city with these large spirited group vocals and a really huge rhythmic backing section it's actually a pretty sweet song but some of the other tracks on here that are about the same length are kind of empty just unfulfilled a lot like the song feel the lightning which features Dan and a guest vocalist singing very lethargic Lee just mired in effects behind a wall of synthesizers and a lot of the time on this LP you while Dan may hate you with a lot of very bright sounds his compositions aren't really that ambitious or a chord progression tension tensions still though the plethora of sounds that Dan may hit you with can be pretty impressive sometimes I actually think this is the best Dan has sounded since Spider Man of the Rings when it comes to sounds being mixed eq'd balanced I don't feel like I'm being hit with one sound after another of the same flavor just thrown on top of one another there's actually breathing room in the mix here between each sound it's not a claustrophobic recording like I feel like I got on prompts in America and this is a nice change of pace for Dan for me it actually makes his songs listenable and tolerable even if the vocals can be kind of obnoxious sometimes and while a better sound doesn't necessarily mean for better writing I certainly enjoy one of the instrumental closing tracks off of here take it to the max it's really bustling it's busy I think it's one of Dan deacons best instrumental compositions in a while and the closing track here is actually a pretty evocative instrumental swell and drone so from a sonic standpoint I think Dan is definitely sounding better fuller but some of the songs here I don't really think are that high which they escalated a little further like the song meme generator which as hilarious as that song is titled the music itself is in a sense reserved at least by daddykins standards while I do think this record C is Dan Deacon changing for the better when it comes to sonic clarity this is his best release yet but for me this is a change that so long overdue something that should have been on Brahms or at least America because while I do acknowledge this improvement I don't think he's putting out his best material here to me the vocally LED tracks on here don't really match up to his early work and while a few of the compositions do definitely stand out they're nowhere near as lively as what people perceive to be his best material Dan Deacon really is just kind of treading a bit of water for me on this LP even if the sound is remarkably improved I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it you're the best I hope you have a good day and I hope you enjoyed this record more than me you know definitely give it a try if you didn't dig this record definitely try out some of Dan Deakins earlier stuff you know maybe you'll even like prompts more than me if you've never heard of it before if you're looking for some crazy electronic compositions yeah cool cool Anthony Fantino Dan Deacon Gliss River forever 
fKZho5UsCmM,hi everyone Fantana forever here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick little video talking about my favorite records of the past few months i didn't do a great albums video in january because things were a little slow didn't really feel like added enough albums to talk about or to sort of mention in that video but now i have a bunch of records to recommend to you reviews that you might have missed over the past few months records that i think are fantastic and are worth bringing up once again albums I'm still revisiting and enjoying let's get through this list the year is most definitely in full musical swing now because I have like nine projects here that I think you should check out before we head fully head on into March if you love punk music experimental rock specifically post-punk music make sure you give the new pop group album a listen citizen zombie this is a danceable frenzied insane comeback album the band's first LP in 35 years and I think it's one of the best comeback albums of the decade so far then we have the new Drake album slash mixtape if you're reading this it's too late a lot of people freaked on my review for this thing because nobody expected me to enjoy this as much as I did and hey you know what neither did I however I think Drake is really spitting on this project it's not too emotional it's not too hard it's kind of you know just just really playing that tightrope walk between the two very effectively and I think there are a lot of great minimal beats on this thing this is really mixtape Drake back in full form and I just love the simple aesthetic of the entire project and there's some very catchy moments on here as well the new URL Droog EP this guy is an East Coast rapper and this is a hip hop EP that is rock themed filled with rock music references and this guy he got hot not too long ago because a lot of people thought he was nas he does sound a lot like nas but his wordplay is so impressive that any immediate comparisons you could draw to any other artist it just sort of gets at least thrown out the window with me because I just find his - lyricism so entertaining also the new father John misty record I love you honey bear one of the better singer-songwriter records I've heard in a while I'm sure it's gonna be one of my favorites of this year filled with very sarcastic but clever and sometimes very sincere and loving and sappy lyrics they're just fantastic songs all over this record while it may not be a huge departure from his last full-length LP under this same pseudonym I thought the instrumentation was bigger I thought a lot of the songs were catchy ER and I thought his lyrics were a little more readable on here - really making a Jay Tillman the figurehead of father John misty so much more tangible for me on this record again just great clever fantastic and gorgeous a singer-songwriter record you know open mike eagle EP a special episode of if you're looking for some art wrap with some clever wordplay and a very endearing style definitely give this EP listen the Newsies record Z this is an experimental Rock a Vaughn Rock a little bit of minimalism and jazz in the mix here on this record as well definitely one of the weirdest releases I've heard this year and while isn't as explosive as some of Z PSA's previous material I think the repetition of this record and just the oddity of it makes it a pretty memorable experience it's very meditative it's a very cerebral release and I think it excels in those two things on the opposite end of that spectrum we have the new napalm death record apex predator easy meat just hard-hitting meaty grindcore with killer riffs loads of aggression blood guts and trails just everywhere also the new Joey badass album before the money New York rapper beast Coast Pro era figurehead comes through on this project his first big commercial project which he had fans waiting for for a very long time and I think he just delivered a lot of very solid tracks there have been some criticisms that and maybe he sounds a little bit too much like all these 90s rappers but lava I mean he definitely does pull his style from that era but in that I think he has found his own voice there are some very personal moving conceptual tracks on this record and some songs where Joey just goes in goes insane just talks a lot of that are just as enjoyable like in the hooks like in the instrumentals not really reinventing the wheel or anything like that but all around still a very good record and finishing up with the new Bjork album volnek Europe York is back with a very string backed sound that is kind of atmospheric a little amorphous reminds me a lot of her 2000s record Vespertine she is reflecting on a very unfortunate breakup on this album in a really intimate way and delivering some incredible lyrics in the process too and as usual her vocals stand out are amazing not really the stylistic departure we expect from Bjork with every new release but still another great album in her discography in my opinion even if maybe at the end of the day in the long term it is a little bit more of a fan pleaser and those are my favorite releases of the past few months got a lot coming up in March Godspeed album it's beautiful transition if you've given any of these albums a listen what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and what were some of your favorite songs and albums that came out over the past few months and all day Kanye all day not bad yeah so that's all you're the best yeah Anthony Fantino music forever 
GFazQdsIxDw,I'm sorry for no no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a serious review of the new nagura bung get album Tao the Guru Bunga is a black metal project with folk metal and progressive rock leanings and when it comes to metal of the bulk variety I do tend to be a little picky there are some groups that just add folk instrumentation to an already over produced mix which is kind of a turn-off for me where the guitar tones are just really tame and the drum sounds super synced up and just perfect technical flawlessness and then just throwing some acoustic instrumentation on top of that and not into it it just kind of feels like placing window-dressing on top of an already sort of an interesting sound I prefer it much more when a band can sort of use folk music as a base and then add some drums some electric instrumentation some loud guitars into the equation without losing the organic feel and the dynamics of folk music and there are a lot of great artists who over the years have been able to do that successfully Agalloch and oliver as well as the new panoptic on record which i thought was really great irish band primordial as well and I would say this band has done so too with records like ohm with the very glossy and sometimes very ambient synthesizers on this record the woodwinds and the other instrumentation too ohm is not just a dynamic record but it's a menacing record too without heavy some of the guitars can be in the very dark abrasive vocals and even as you move backwards into the band's discography there are still some interesting releases even when they were just more of a straightforward black metal band before folk music played such a large role in their style on such releases the band would play black metal with such explosive intensity that I think it would grab the attention of any fan of the genre and since these days the band has undergone quite a bit of sonic evolution and I think on this record over here we see that evolution at a standstill which isn't the worst thing in the world if you're doing something well keep at it but unfortunately Tao is just not doing it for me in the same way that previous records from this project have the intensity of previous records I don't really think is is here some of this albums most powerful moments can be summed up with just some mid-paced double bass drums some dreary but very basic chord progressions and these large clean voiced choruses that feel more lethargic than epic as the band uses them over and over and over throughout the album and I think the synth sound great on this LP if I am hearing real brass on this album that sounds pretty good as well but some of the woodwinds on here can be kind of rough with how they're mixed and how exactly they're not really following the flow and the tempo of some of the songs that they're playing over the third track here as soon as the woodwind solo enters on this song it just kind of feels like I'm listening to just a cut from a really rough practice session that was just for whatever reason overdub been spliced into the mix here there's even a spot on the opening track here where there's this incredibly loud and and wavy lead melody if you could call it that it kind of sounds like it's coming from a theremin or something like that and it's just very eerily all over these metal drums and guitars and it really just kind of ruins the overall mood of the track previously I found much of nagura bum gets incorporation of instrumentation other than guitars drums bass to be tasteful but that just doesn't seem to be the case on tau even some of the more subtle and acoustic spots on this record don't end up being complimented by the heavier passages that may follow like on the acoustic intro that kicks the entire album off which sounds fantastic really sets a tone for the record but all of a sudden it's just smothered by these electric guitars that don't really follow the pace of the acoustic instrumentation melodically in any way really it's like the band just didn't want to build off of this fantastic start and just crushed it instead with some run-of-the-mill black metal guitars so while there are some lengthy tracks on this release here the multiple parts that are jammed into these songs don't necessarily make for an engaging experience from beginning to end as it might have on previous releases with all these kind of lethargic drums and guitars and group vocals I actually find most of this album to be kind of one-dimensional except for one particular cut on the back end of this album which when it kicks off has a really bouncy beat some quirky dulcimer it sounds like a piece of folk music straight out of the Eastern Bloc nagura Bunga is really playing up their Romanian roots on this track but even here again I feel like they're not fully complementing the kind of music that they're playing so well in a sense especially once the shredding guitar solo just comes in out of nowhere it just seems like a little much overall for me this is a really weird record in this band's discography in a lot of ways it doesn't really feel like it's too far off from their previous releases in terms of just tone and style but then again in the most subtle of ways this album just feels really lackluster in comparison to those releases with the lackluster incorporation of folk instrumentation the lackluster songs the numerous disjointed parts that make up these tracks there are moments on this record that feel like they're in bad taste or maybe just a little overkill and yet again so much of this album sounds kind of lifeless and just lacking in the intensity that I've come to expect from a guru Bungay I don't think this album is god-awful or anything like that but really after numerous listens I'm just super super indifferent toward it that's that's really how I am feeling indifference pure indifference much of the time I'm feeling a strong 5 to light 6 on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino the Guru Bunga cow forever 
cKmbySC3V6U,
w6bDXhZNHvY,Oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new pop group album okay but is it the real pet music cuz I only listen to the real stuff you know they're not even really pop so we're just we're just not gonna get it be real it's got to be that real pair we're not gonna do that the record is citizen zombie the pop group is a Bristol based post-punk band who dropped their debut album and the late 70s is one of the most important and fantastic post-punk albums ever in my opinion if you're not familiar with post-punk music it can be a lot of things generally it was a group of artists in the late 70s in the early 80s that took inspiration from the throttling aggression the rough-around-the-edges aesthetic as well as the simplicity of punk music and fused it with other competing genres at the time sometimes psychedelic and krautrock music or disco experimental rock art rock in the case of the pop group a little bit of jazz and this lack of limitations led to post-punk being a pretty diverse genre it's sort of more of an umbrella term or or a description of an era in punk music more than is a description of a finite sound and with this diversity came a league of offshoot John Rizzo Ike no wave and dance punk groups that were playing noise rock and gothic rock around this time period also had very close linkages to post-punk but the pop groups approach to this style of music was very freakish it was loud it was herky-jerky and topped with the incredibly shrill vocal stylings of Mark Stewart check out the song we are all prostitutes which was the first song I'd ever heard from the pop group off of a Rough Trade post-punk compilation years ago when I was in college and even today that song still sticks with me it is a it's a messed up song and even people such as Nick Cave of the birthday party in the cave of the Bad Seeds has had this song sort of turned his life upside down as well so on this debut pop group album you get these rock songs with really noisy guitars visceral crazy jagged dance grooves and tracks like this are coupled with long strung out cacophonous tortured experimental rock pieces that can get kind of into them abstract the band sophomore record in 1980 really followed suit stylistically for the most part although it has not received the same critical acclaim over the years they dropped a compilation not too long after and then the pop group was essentially kaput the band's lifespan was incredibly short but each member splintered off into a variety of different groups a lot of which were influenced by a lot of the same genres so the band left us with a beautiful corpse a short but very volatile discography decades later the band saw fit to reform in 2010 for some live performances and now just five years later we are getting the pop group's first studio effort in 35 years which is kind of weird these days written comeback albums from artists that work hot in the 90s in the 2000s the pop group really is long overdue for a comeback not only that but there are plenty of other groups that came out of this era of post-punk music who were contemporaries of the pop groups and they are still making music today such as Mission of Burma or Gang of Four wire as well but I don't really enjoy their new stuff quite as much as their old stuff so admittedly with citizens aam being disappointed and I even had myself convinced maybe through the first half of this record that it just it just wasn't gonna be good but I think the man actually pulled through and even though I think citizen zombie in a way might still be kind of a picture of an aging band by far the pop group is not quite as out of control as they were in the 70s and the 80s and the opening track here puts on display for all to hear a noticeably cleaner approach to production especially with the heavy punchy drums and the kind of glossy and very rich and nicely harmonized group vocals that make for a really epic chorus citizens ombre but the band still maintains a lot of those eccentric insane and lovable qualities that made their early work so fantastic for one the dance grooves the jerky dance grooves and we also have Mark Stewart in his yell P vocal quirks as well as his very sharp critical and satirical and snarky lyrics and on top of that what I think the band continues to do well is sort of subvert and pervert established pop tropes ideas modes of musical expression which i think was one of my favorite things about post-punk music in general that they were taking more accessible forms of music fusing it with Punk for just a really odd freakish and danceable and catchy sound so there are plenty of tracks on this record that are weird do feel like oddballs but are insanely catchy as well like mad truth which features this either plinky guitar synthesiser lead that sounds like a steel drum the vocals on this thing are insane but the melody they're singing is absolutely sick and feeling a strong 10 on the groove and the song sofia is equally as danceable and I think features one of the best hooks of the year and on this record the band actually pushes outside of the pop blends they're usually toying with and experiment a bit with dream pop on a track here there's a really glossy thick heavenly crescendo on the song nowhere girl that sounds really lovely and while it may be kind of heavenly it may be kind of dreamy pop group definitely put their own weird spin on it keeping this saccharine and syrupy style of music really bold and sharp like a knife in the shoulder and without Stewart's vocals on the song age of miracles the pop group could really pass for like a modern day indie dance pop group that constant very clean kick drum as well as the kind of delayed very clean keyboards on this track I think there's some DJ's that could sample the very beginning moments of this song and make a really cool epic EDM jam I actually kind of just turned my head I'm like am i listening same CD when this instrumental came on and then what Stewart's vocals entered the picture the song really took on a different flavor I mean his singing is really enough to send any instrumental tumbling down a rabbit hole of insanity so there are some really catchy hard-hitting accessible tracks in the track listing here but the band also of course goes on to the darker side of the fence and pulls together some really dreary and abstract tracks like on the closing track here which is a ballad a piano ballad to be exact with some overdubbed vocals and just a really depressing sad vocal melody coming off this song Stewart's vocals are horrifying and kind of soulful at the same time there's also the very abstract and danceable shadowchild which kind of feels like a Frankenstein monster of different pieces of music that might have been recorded in the studio and then sampled later and then thrown together these bass lines a bunch of different vocal takes some very eerie dissonant strings the song features a similar aesthetic to other tracks on this record but it's very apparently assembled in a very different way giving it an obviously different vibe these song Nations features a electronic pulsating quiet rhythm hanging in the background as Stewart delivers some very cutting satirical spoken-word there are lyrics very interesting lyrics sometimes funny and how snarky they are lyrics all over this record dealing with societal norms and religion addiction paranoia modern technology which honestly just adds another layer of Awesome - and already very solid musically and production wise as well album I think all around this is an incredibly impressive release and I think one of the better comeback albums of the decade so far this is just a varied well written well performed energetic exciting and I think explosive post-punk record with a strong personality grace sound and I don't really hear at least in my opinion an Achilles heel on this album again I do think it is apparent in a sense that the pop group has aged they are a different band at this point but I can't really hear that working against them in any significant way on this record I'm feeling a strongly to a light 9 on this album transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana the pop group citizens aam be forever 
RmWexPrl6Ys,hi everyone Bob Denis baldano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new screaming females album rose mountain screaming females is a New Jersey band who I believe this year celebrating their 10-year anniversary happy birthday and this I believe is the sixth full-length they have released in that time span I heard about this band way back when I was first starting the needle drop like in 2007 while I was scrounging for bands around the internet to talk about four bands promoting your music on the Internet was a relatively new frontier mp3 blogs were super relevant super important when it came to breaking new up-and-coming artists I think I might have seen some people hyping up this van so I decided to go and check them out and they really stuck out to me for a load of different reasons their Punk energy the Banshee like screams of front limb Marissa Paternoster and her very bold and flashy guitar playing as well I've caught them live a few times if you do have an opportunity to see them live they kill it and in my opinion Marissa is most definitely an underrated guitarist and Jarrod Dougherty and King Mike also provide a really great rhythm section with drums and bass while over the course of this past decade they've never been the biggest band they have stayed true to their sound and they always did things their own way thanks to the songs that dropped before the release of this LP I was excited to talk about excited to listen to it but I'm not going to be talking about this release just by myself I'm also going to bring in over here Joel of the daily guru to review this album along with me and give his thoughts and ideas on the album as a whole as we change over to this segment I will also be changing my shirt my jacket and I will be growing a full head of hair transition and here we are thanks to the power the magic of the internet with Joel the daily guru and we are going to talk about this new scream ales album rose mountain you know we're going to talk about some of our favorite tracks here just kind of kick off - what what exactly made this albums enjoyable to you in terms of just saw highlights the first track I really like I think it was a good choice for a leave track empty head thought I did a really good groove it was kind of just really coming out of the gates Full Tilt which in my opinion not enough bands do and then later in the album I think my favorite song in the album was the track burning car again great groove it had a really good guitar tone to it and it almost reminded me of the Noisettes record what's the time mr. wolf just had a really good raw energy to it definitely those two tracks yeah I mean I think there's a lot to celebrate and a lot to enjoy as far as screaming females when it comes to guitar tone stuff like that I mean they're not really a band that historically has thrown a lot of reverb or a lot of effects on their instrumentation in terms of except for distortion you know but but even some of the tracks here are kind of vacant of that you know so some of their earlier recordings are way more raw and more distorted way Messier I thought this album was kind of cleanly put together in comparison with some of the earlier stuff that there was that one song I believe it was actually the title track of the LP rose mountain where they can't I don't know if you felt the same way they had kind of like this heavy-metal intro yeah yeah I thought there was that and then I think it was the track right that the guitar tone was it was almost almost early Black Sabbath esque it had a really good product super heavy yeah and and I was kind of thinking myself I I kind of like them going in this direction I I dig I dig it getting a little sloppy in a little murky and you know even though that Rose Mountain is one of my favorite tracks on the LP I thought I had you know I thought the song following that metal intro mom was good I thought it was a well-written track but you know I when I was first looking the record I kinda hope that they just followed suit throughout the rest of the song and just did a metal track because it sounded good yeah absolutely absolutely and that was kind of one of the things I was thinking throughout was it was almost like they got this good idea and they're going for it but they back off too early in a number of different cases and I feel like a couple of these songs could have could have been a little bit better broken neck when they slowed things down I was just like finish this thought it was it was really cool it was going but it just didn't didn't get completed so you do have kind of like these these dry guitar tones of these distorted guitar tones I think another guitar tone that's pretty prevalent on the record I mean not only to some of these riffs and needs and chords sound like something off like a 90s indie rock record that's kind of Punk influence but there's definitely I think maybe here a little more than some of their previous LP definitely a surf rock influence I think it's some of the soloing and some of the leads yeah yeah I wrote down a few times when I was taking notes on this I said I feel like they've been listening to the first two Smashing Pumpkins records a lot because it really did have that 90s all tone especially the last track criminal image I think it was called and I think triumph was another track that had that tone really good guitar working it was almost getting into a bit pop at that point it was it had a very interesting pop sensibilities how it was arranged I mean I thought there were popular songs on the record but that track definitely is one of the nastiest grooves on the entire record I mean and then and then as soon as that chorus is over I mean that bassline that the song settles in into the first dude dude dude dude dude like it's it's seriously rhythmic it's one of the most rhythmic tracks on the entire LP but I mean as far as like pop appeal for me I thought hopeless was a really catchy track at the hopeless the way that Marissa sort of layered her vocals together for a really nice harmony on that song and I thought the lead single off of this LP to Wishing Well was incredibly catchy I liked that song a lot just you before that album was even released it has one of my favorite lyrical refrains of any screaming female song where she's singing about not even bothering with wishing wells because she knows all the change she throws in there goes to hell you know the some of her lyrics could be kind of dark and defeatist and I thought this is kind of a high point for that yeah I mean with wishing well in particular I thought it was a good song I I felt it went on a bit too long I thought one extra verse it started to get a little tedious for me and it might have been because I think it was poorly placed in the album ordering you have the two songs right out of the gate that really grip and have this great energy and then all of a sudden it's like they just throw everything into reverse and then you go into burning car and you're back up to speed I may have been it which is an odd place um from the album which is why I didn't love it that much yeah um yeah I mean uh I think the flow this album is okay I I think at the end of the day it all kind of works in that a lot of the songs are pretty much all the songs just really have a similar vibe to them that just reminds me of screams females general sound and maybe that's my first big gripe with this LP that um you know the band has been around for like ten years or so and the amount of evolution they've shown over that course of time has been SuperDuper minimal you know even though I think their first initial records are super raw and I love their sophomore LP and I love Cour move but to me Power Move kind of signified a change in that they weren't going to be overly aggressive like they were on their earlier stuff and instead they were gonna be a little bit more toned down a little catch here and I don't really think on records like castle talk they necessarily provided the songwriting that would have made that transition preferable but I think on this LP over here with tracks like you know triumphant and hopeless and wishing well they're finally writing like some super catchy songs yeah yeah I don't think you can get past that I think these to me they're sort of record that if my knew someone who really wasn't into the band or didn't know them I could give them this because it's a very accessible record in that sense the hooks are really clean and clear and and there's a lot of almost every single one of these has the kind of hook career you know you might pause it halfway through and find yourself singing it in your head and I think that is a testament to the style of writing they're doing but when I compared to the rest of their catalogue you kind of refer to it my biggest gripe with this record is it's too clean for the sound is it's too produced there there's no there's no dirt on this there's no grit to it which isn't agree yeah III think you have to have some of that yeah I mean you know I I give this album props in that I think it it does bring a little bit more viscera for me you know I I think that they're finally finding a decent balance between having some aggressive rock tracks and having some catchy your songs - it definitely doesn't feel like the drow artistic drought that I felt on their previous two albums as soon as Power Move came out you know I thought that was a great record the songs on there you know some were pretty catchy but you know my favorite thing about that out is just how energetic and is how off-the-wall and explosive it was and that explosivity just really didn't translate to the next two albums you know for whatever reason and I feel like here while you know it definitely is not as aggressive as the band's earlier work there are some catchy stuff here you know and even though it's not exactly you know rough around the edges it's not super angry or anything like that I still think you know there's something to be said for the fact that Marissa's vocals do lend a lot of eccentricity to the band's style you know and still makes them a pretty standout band in my opinion out to me there are no other vocalists out there quite like her you know in an active you know underground rock group yeah yeah the second she started singing you know who it is and she's she's almost unapologetically herself at times which does limit the vocals but I don't think it's it's in a bad way what I think they really excel on here is just the grooves I think almost every song has a really cool groove on it the bass is a little bit more forward in the mix than usual and and maybe that is something that comes from it being a little bit of a cleaner mix is that you can sink in and hear those crews better there's some drum patterns and fills that I played back a few times like I was really really cool and you know maybe what this is is the band starting to experiment and maybe move into a slightly different musical world I mean I agree with you in a sense but also like it feels different but it also feels the same in a lot of ways you know and and maybe that's the sign of it being a good record you know it feels like the band is trying something different in a sense but they still like that familiar group that that I know I've been listening to since since of seven yeah I mean I I didn't love this record I didn't love it and I was disappointed I wanted to love it and especially with as great as the first two tracks are everything after that it kind of was like and I really feel like this could have been an extraordinary EP maybe maybe what I feel is there's some filler on this record that kind of dilute how good some of the other songs are maybe maybe it kind of feels like I mean I wouldn't say any of the songs here necessarily throwaway in that like wow we really didn't feel like they tried here but um I think that at the end of the LP you can't help but feel like that way to an extent just because of how similar or a lot of these tracks are the song it's not fair the way that it's chorus kind of builds up in the pace of its downstroke chords on that song actually reminded me quite a bit of wishing well yeah it kind of felt like you know that they were trying to repeat that same catchy formula once again and that it just felt like a little bit of the Xerox like just kind of working with the same bones but trying to come together with a different track yeah yeah I mean and I made a similar I had a similar thought with when rose mountain the title track came out as I said I think this would have been better had the other two slower style songs not already have been from out there yeah without more and it would have just been better not those songs are bad but I think you have situations where you have good versions of what they can do and great versions of what they can do on the same record yeah you know that's actually pretty that's pretty act observation you know and and and I agree with you you know I'm not really in love with this record either but you know I did come out liking it and I and I did enjoy it more than the band's past two LPs while it's not you know a Power Move to me or if they were watching TV you know it's it's certainly good to hear their or tone down version of themselves actually resulting in some really catchy tracks you know for once because those those two previous LP stay you know it kind of felt like they were turning things down and for what exactly you know while those recordings weren't as cleanly produced as this one I didn't feel like the songwriting was quite as strong as don't work here and here personally I'm feeling like a strong six to a light seven obvious where you are I'm kind of in about a five maybe maybe a strong five or four yours I just I feel like if it was an EP it probably would've been a seven or an eight but definitely for me I would give this to people who like rock and roll ups I think there's a lot in there to be enjoyed yeah and you know keep in mind everybody you know you know joel has his opinions on this but you know I'll tell you straight up that a lot of what I'm feeling on this album is sort of derived from the fact that I have been familiar with the band for so long and you know it's it's not really that different or an exciting a record to me but you know if you're new to screaming females and you know are happy to look into a new band with a great frontwoman and it's really strong guitar playing and a great rhythm section you know it's sort of an old-school indie style which you know I'm surprised they haven't caught on a little bit more now that you have labels like run for cover records that are sort of putting that alt and the emo style out again because it's kind of seeing a bit of a resurgence right now on the Internet you know if you're into some of those bands screaming females you know might scratch that itch as well and you know if you haven't come across them you know this record should definitely stand out to you because they do have I I would say a definitive style for as obvious as their influences are sometimes yeah I think there is definitely a stellar and I think there's a lot that other younger bands and smaller bands can learn from that because they are great musicians and every single one of these tracks shows that and they're able to do aggressive sounds and in the way that they're able to write I think there's a ton to be learned there from other bands and I mean again it's it's not that I didn't like it I was just hoping for a bit more I guess yeah and you know I I agree I mean you know if you're a young band I mean try to check it out live I've seen Y a few times and you know they're completely ripped each time so let's go transition and that's essentially what we think about this record right here let me know what you think about this album down in the comments thank you for watching also don't forget to check out Joel's youtube channel as well daily guru youtoo.com slash the daily guru he talks about is it well know yeah thanks for thanks for coming on being a coolgrub always ready to do it all right entity Fantana daily guru it's pretty females those mountain bratter 
NXwhaTEW9Vc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new the satisfaction record earth the V satisfaction is a musical duo featuring Stasha irons and Katherine Harris white and together the few Spacey neo soul and hip hop into an intergalactic alternative R&B soup they have been added since the late 2000s but I first heard of them in 2011 through their features on the fantastic Shabazz Palaces album black up on Sub Pop Records which this record is also on Shabazz Palaces of course features ishmael butler of diggable planets fame and this 2011 LP over here is one of the most standout creative and eccentric imaginative hip hop albums I've ever heard as some of you may know I wasn't really a huge fan of the murky sequel to this LP that came out not too long ago but when it comes to the contributions of the satisfaction on black up the very smooth but confident singing has really helped make it what it was in 2012 is Wendy's satisfaction really dropped what I would call their breakout LP on Sub Pop Records au naturale and in a lot of ways I think the satisfaction was doing for neo soul what Shabazz Palaces was doing for hip hop really pushing the works of Badu and Jill Scott into Spacey experimental and kind of psychedelic territory there's actually even a few features on this new record over here from Meshell Ndegeocello who I believe plays bass on the two tracks that she appears on because on these two songs which are right next to each other there are some really prominent bass lines and I do know Michel is a fantastic bassist so Katherine and Stassi most definitely know their stuff when it comes to the I I think the very underrated underappreciated world of neo soul and on this debut LP I think they took these influences and and really ran with them for me the Achilles heel of this record though is kind of the the singing I don't really think that the satisfaction have vocals that are as strong as the women that so very obviously influenced though there are a lot of very cool very subdued and relaxed vocal melodies and harmonies on this album that sound fantastic but once the satisfaction pushes out of this vocal range whether it be lower or higher things can get a little shaky but still I think this is made up for at least in a sense with really progressive production and sticky refrains clever verses and I think that's roughly the same dynamic that's going on with this new LP over here stache' and Kathryn pretty much like going for very much the same sound they're singing for the most part is very relaxed the rapping on this record borders on spoken word and the flows are very gentle the instrumentals on these beats feel futuristic and space-age I read a little spiel that was posted on sub Pop's website in regards to this new album over here and the phrase neo ancient was used which i think is a very apt term to apply to this record given that there is something really kind of simple and rudimentary and primal about a lot of the instrumentals here but then again there's also kind of very modern and postmodern I think about the way these instrumentals sound as well so while sonically a lot of this record may be kind of esoteric and abstract emotionally I think it's very easy to access because the songs here are very cool they're calm they're collected they are charismatic they're intoxicating even in the more lively spots of this LP like no GMO the satisfaction is still relatively toned down and once you quiet down and you focus and you just kind of lean in very closely to hear what's going on what's gonna become apparent are some jazzy chord progressions thoughtful lyrics beats that can be synthetic and a little punchy other rhythms that are loaded with hand drums feel more like a drum circle sort of like on the stone-faced track recognition recognition recognition I still think the singing is is sort of the weakest part of the equation here especially when these vocal passages are extended as they are on the song nature's candy but for the most part this album still adds up for example the song bland land which i think is one of the smartest and most entertaining songs on this entire record the satisfaction really tries to address music as an our form on this song talking about things like soul jazz and hip-hop essentially turning into bastardized forms of themselves for the mainstream music stage taking these culturally black art forms and essentially watering them down for a lower common denominator something I was just talking about in my previous video there's a very slow and chilled keyboard and drum groove on this track this song is cerebral to the tenth degree and Ishmael Butler comes through on this track with a fantastic verse aisle the line where he's talking about these diamonds that they made getting ground into dust and this is one of many guests verses he lends to this record and actually this the satisfaction record as a whole I think relies more on guest spots than their previous projects and the results for the most part are just positive there's not really a single inclusion on this album that I think takes away from the record as a whole you have the song fetch catch which seems like a tribute to the art of seduction as well as lust and the song planner for sale seems to kind of take an environmentalist point of view and these satisfaction they're not really like oh hey recycle rather they are a duo who seems really spiritual in nature and I think some kind of connection with the natural world is important to them in that regard and the song work which I think was one of the more compelling songs on here as well seems to talk about working or maybe the loss of time as a result of working relaxation the song topics on this record are nice but there are a load of other tracks on here that seem a little bit more abstract and that's fine too I don't really feel like I'm losing out on these songs necessarily like the opening track here prophetic perfection or we're getting a lot of imagery of a bird wanting to interact with the water sort of dip its toes in it I do wish this song was longer though it just cuts out so abruptly and the track really gets a beautiful vibe going but then it just sort of you know flies away and departs without really leaving a lasting impact and that for me as well as the case for the song no GMO or even the song recognition to an extent if this album suffers from an issue that the previous record maybe head down path a little bit more its its structure there are tracks here that I think give up on themselves and cut out prematurely there are other songs such as post black anyway that I think extend without enough variation to really justify that length so while I do think there are a lot of great instrumentals on this LP and lyrics to a lot of the songs here the record as a whole gives off a very otherworldly spiritual and kind of sexy vibe the way these songs are structured and built really leaves a lot to be desired though still the best tracks on this record aren't going to win you over with huge choruses and earworm refrains this album finds more appeal in its subtlety really there are a lot of revolutionary ideas I think going on on this record but they are delivered with the gentle demeanor of like a lullaby so while I do think this record over here does improve upon the sound of the last album in a lot of ways I think the singing is a little better I think the production is more detailed I think there's more variation here the guests bring a lot of character to the album there are clear philosophical statements being made here but I think the satisfaction needed to maybe ruminate on some of these ideas a little bit longer and develop them past the point where they feel like just a motif I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this LP I recommend that you check it out it has its highlights just don't expect them to jump out at you at first I would say transition if you've given this out and listened what do you think of it I feel different why did you love it why did you hate it what do you think I'm sure of you next well that's it I'm Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd forever I eat something's wrong with the I feel different 
Y7RnH6bnGHc,hi everyone and swarthy question tanto appear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan a query that I'm going to answer to the best of my ability give my opinion my point of view on it here we go and so hey Anthony I was curious as to what your thoughts are on the issue of white rappers becoming more prominent in hip-hop I'm sure you've heard of folks like Lord Jamar talking about the influx of white rappers up for Grammys this year whereas eally banks calling out Iggy Azalea for not using our music to address social issues do you think it matters if hip-hop continues to be a prominently black art form where are the issues brought up by Jamar and banks to reactionary I apologize if this is badly worded or confusing thank you for your videos over the years they've made me think a lot more about what I listen to and have opened my ears to all kinds of stuff over the last four years Nick thanks Nick there's a lot to unpack here white rappers their success Azalea Azealia Banks Lord Jamar and the old school's perception of this new wave of hip-hop whether it be black rappers or ripe rappers whatever so I'm going to try to approach each of these pieces of the puzzle individually and just tell you what I think about each and every one of them and to start white rappers white artists Caucasians they have been relevant in the genre already for every full decade hip hop has existed and I don't really think there's any level of complaining that's going to change that from the Golden Age and the 80s you had the Beastie Boys third base Stein ski as well as Rick Rubin and vanilla ice you've got the 90s House of Pain RA the rugged man who was actually recorded with Biggie Aesop Rock got his start in the 90s DJ shadow and to the 2000s where there were even more prominent whites in the genre brother Ollie sage Francis you've got LP who was coming up also the streets from the UK who was making great music that was gaining traction over here know of cunning linguist and also keep in mind that many of the artists from the past two decades of hip hop were seeing continued success into the 2000s and finally you you have to talk about Eminem he sold over 150 million records no rapper has sold more so there have been successful and respected respected by fans and fellow artists white hip-hop artists in hip-hop for the past several decades so to hear this conversation cropping up now over a few eggy azaleas and macklemore's seems kind of weird and another reason I think it's kind of silly to center all needs to artists when having this conversation is that it doesn't really take into account how relevant either of them are going to be in two to three years I mean I wish Iggy Azalea and Macklemore all the luck in the world I wish them great success but neither of them have shown to me that they have any real serious lasting power they've both got some decent songs they both got some great viral singles but do they have a career beyond that McLemore I have a little more faith in but I'm not sure it's really too early to tell but I get the concern there are a lot of notable white rappers right now Action Bronson and riff raff MGK yellow wolf Mac Miller Kay tempest from the UK and there are a lot more as well but even their fates to an extent are up in the air how relevant are any of these artists going to be in two to three years I like some of these artists but still I wonder and in my personal opinion I don't really think any of them have more influence over hip hop's predominant artist base which is black t de Danny Brown Kanye West jay-z Madlib Joey badass Chief Keef the roots Freddie Gibbs ASAP mob Odd Future Big KRIT Rick Ross Wiz Khalifa I can't guarantee that there's always going to be more black artists than white artists in hip-hop but over the years despite the success and involvement of white artists hip-hop continues to be the black art form that Lord Jamar says it is and I will get into Lord Jamar in a second but when he says this he's not saying who can or can't participate in hip-hop he's not saying white people aren't allowed he's not saying they're not talented he is simply stating a historical fact most career rappers are black and that is also reflected when you look at the white to black ratio of the genres most key foundational records so if you're an aspiring rapper and you're also white you have to go into the genre knowing and respecting that that's all because we live in the United States where for generations african-americans had suffered through slavery and then about 150 more years of systemic racism which still is very much alive today and a lot of hip hop's most important records are born out of a frustration with that not all of them but a great deal of them and that's sort of the angle that Lord Jamar is coming at this conversation from he's an old-school rapper from New York known for his membership in Brand Nubian and he's now known more for his controversial Vlad TV interviews than he is his rhymes and his interviews on Vlad TV are so controversial because there are a lot of younger hip-hop fans that don't necessarily identify with his ideology when it comes to the art form he thinks hip-hop has certain limitations when it comes to cultural norms and the way it sounds and has expressed some pretty strong opinions on race and sexual orientation even the way a rapper should dress and chances are if you're a younger listener hip-hop is is maybe a very different thing for you than it was for him he participated in the genre before it was the international powerhouse that it was today in the 80s and 90s I wouldn't call rap music obscure but it definitely played closer to its cultural roots and it was more localized this was before the age of bling but now hip-hop is huge their rap artists all over the world rapping in a multitude of different languages hip-hop is now more of a general music style than it is specifically an expression of black culture and now it could certainly still be that but these days if you are rhythmically rhyming a set of words over an instrumental of some sort no matter who you are or where you're from or what you are wrapping a out people will probably just recognize it instantly as being hip-hop music but for people like Jamar the message the style the sound the culture they're inseparable and given the lyrical content of brand Nubians records and when he was participating in the genre it's not really that hard to believe why he would feel that way and it's fine for him to have those feelings it's fine for other people have other feelings but as we debate and squabble and I think you know we should have this conversation but as we are having it the rest of the world is already making hip-hop music but we're just kind of deaf to it because we see America as this mecca of hip-hop culture which it is which is why you have foreign artists looking over here for inspiration people like yung lean and die Antwoord keith ape with the song it Jima which is pretty much a og MACO ripoff we also have Ciel's the baddest female look at that track if you haven't heard it foreign artists have been making hip hop music for years but I think the difference in this decade right now is that some of them are actually gaining traction over here a little bit more than what people like the streets were doing in the 2000s and here is sort of where Iggy Azalea comes into the fold so why is a guy Azalea such a catalyst for this kind of conversation personally I think it has more to do with authenticity than it does the color of her skin and because he has sort of shown herself to be inauthentic in in a way her skin kind of becomes a battleground for people to attack her on hip-hop is an authenticity obsessed genre which is not completely unique to this style of music I mean there are forms of rock music that are sort of the same like punk rock as well as black metal in the case of hip-hop fans really expect a lot of the time the stuff that rappers are saying to be true in a sense they expect songs to contain some kind of real personal experience or at least a deeply held point of view hip-hop does use hyperbole and exaggeration as modes of expression as well but truth definitely Trump's those two things when comes to what people value in a hip-hop song and not that I think that Iggy songs are loaded with any more lies or fabrications than any other rapper I mean you know just look at rick ross but i think hip-hop fans get kind of irked when they see an artist who interviews and speaks in an Australian accent and then when she goes to rap she puts on what I've heard some people refer to as a black scent which is kind of an unfair term because there are people of other races who talk with a similar twang southern inflection but I think what sort of fails to appreciate and acknowledge in her music is that she's rapping with an accent that is not her own is not her natural accent and for hip-hop fans accents say a lot about you they communicate where you are from the kind of community or neighborhood you might have grown up in things that a rapper might wear like a badge of them in his or her music Iggy ignorantly and maybe unintentionally mocks that tradition by just putting on some other accent when she goes to record and while there are rappers that do fabricate events do tell lies in their songs do just totally make things up I guess the things that you make up the things that you fabricate can't be so egregious or obvious to us that we can't suspend disbelief plus there's this really terrible old electro pop song and music video she's got floating around YouTube from before she was rapping in some ways it's kind of clear that hip-hop wasn't necessarily her full-time thing but kind of an elective she hopped on to and then after this accent thing her public image issues were only exacerbated by the really ungraceful way she handled people prodding her over social media to show some kind of concern for what was going on in Ferguson Missouri last year she came off sounding super conceited super callous and like she doesn't really care about the fate of those who continue to breathe life in the genre that she benefits from hip-hop and this is where azealia banks comes in who is a New York rap artist she dropped an album recently I reviewed it there were some decent tracks on there and she has been very critical and vocal of Iggy's place in hip hop over twitter and even though i think some of her criticisms hold water some of the things she's brought up may be needed to be said it's kind of like when Trinidad James came to New York to say that Atlanta runs New York musically maybe there was a grain of truth to what he said but wrong messenger between all the homophobic slurs the anti-semitism the completely unprovoked attacks of everybody on Celia bankses Twitter page she is every bit as much the garbage heap that she says that Iggy Azalea is I don't really think she's that concerned about hip-hop addressing social issues given that her music doesn't really address any social issues and that she when it Lupe Fiasco of all people who is maybe one of the best conscious rappers of all time why you would go out of your way to on him when he has done more to raise awareness than you ever will I don't know personally I feel she will say anything for attention kind of like the girl who ate a tampon while jamming her to on to single and plus you kind of have to consider that Azealia Banks is sort of a little bit in the middle of a beef with ti as well to you you you and Iggy Azalea is TI's paycheck at the end of the day so maybe this is kind of another way of her to get it ti and I think there's a little bit of jealousy involved as well because I think right now Iggy Azalea is occupying the lane that Celia banks could have been it she had a really hot single but then her career stalled because of some mediocre tracks a lot of social media drama and the fact that she's burned bridges with numerous artists even going after Pharrell and attacking him for the lack of success of a single that he worked on for her meanwhile Pharrell's getting Grammys and she's just getting angry in my opinion the only kind of rapper who would be concerned with Iggy's popularity is a trendy one who only cares about appealing to the lowest common nominator being famous and not really making a deep emotional connection with their audience and having a long-term career Iggy Azalea poses no serious threat to a Kendrick Lamar or a Lupe Fiasco or a Kanye West or a jay-z she doesn't make the kind of music that fans of those artists would even be interested in for a minute Iggy Azalea has probably more crossover audience with ariana grande than she does any popular rapper out there today Iggy appeals to more of a pop audience and even though I like Macklemore and he has years and years of music under his belt he's put out hip hop albums in the past I think he kind of suffers from a similar issue right now if that mainstream support is there for him on his next release will he be able to fall back on the hip-hop community to support him I'm not sure I guess my point is people like Iggy Azalea may be popular right now she may be white and she may be rapping but the music she makes is not really of concern to the hip-hop community she's more of a just straight pop artist at this point which is fine and I guess my advice to her is that Iggy no matter what you feel about yourself as an artist the hip-hop community for the most part doesn't really see you as a true-blue hip-hop artist and maybe it's just best to not concern yourself with that drama and instead just focus on entertaining and keeping happy the multitude of fans you've been able to amass so far and if you're upset that someone like Iggy Azalea can come along and get popular off of rap music I'm not really sure if there's anything you can do about it that was a Pandora's box that was open long ago by things like the rise of pop rap in the late 90s in the 2000s and there are pros and there are cons to that the pro is that the hip-hop listener basis is gigantic but there are varying degrees of how invested in hip-hop as a genre some of these people are you have more hip-hop listeners today that are more familiar with Kanye West than they are a Tribe Called Quest so of course when you have a genre whose current date figures are more popular than its forefathers current-day culture is going to be different than the culture the genre started out in styles of music go through a lot of change and evolution sonically and ideologically over decades of time and personally I don't subscribe to the idea that all forms of cultural appropriation are horrible I could take that mindset as far as to say I'm going to avoid any white rock artists because all rock music is rooted in blues and rhythm and blues so I'd be checking out my Punk records my metal records my indie record think of all the fantastic and amazing influential pieces of music I would have to avoid seems kind of ridiculous and short-sighted to say the people of one culture can't participate in or enjoy the art form of another culture when the mere fact that someone in Korea might want to make hip-hop music is a reflection of the power of music its ability to transcend cultural boundaries and influence and inspire people who might be completely unfamiliar with the culture the music was born in and while I sympathize with Lorde Jamar's wishes to try to maintain hip-hop culture I don't see how revoking the opinion privileges of white artists and maybe even white fans will end in the results that he wants because as he has pointed out in other Vlad TV interviews there are black artists who he is very unhappy with as well because he thinks they are doing the genre and doing the culture a disservice and I don't think the Macklemore song same love is really even an opinion or a comment on hip-hop culture at all it's just a general statement on homophobia in Western culture he may be making a hip-hop song to express that but he is not alone in expressing these sentiments artists like Kanye West and even Jadakiss have also said they don't really hold any animosity toward homosexuals prodigy of Mobb Deep as well in his own autobiography and while yeah kind of sucks that hip-hop has just taken his entertainment these days not really just a platform to address social issues the entertainment side of hip-hop and the socially aware side of hip-hop have coexisted for years dating back to the 70s with the Sugar Hill Gang moving forward to Kurtis Blow fat boys 2 Live Crew while serious political hip-hop that is in too with its cultural roots is great there's always been a great deal of rap music that doesn't take itself too seriously either in closing being a hip-hop fan myself and talking with hundreds more over the years people who I know that this is one of their favorite genres they grew up on this stuff I've found most of them to be more concerned with lyrical content skill level when it comes to rapping production and whether or not you're being true to yourself as a person then they are the skin color of the artist and again who cares if Iggy Azalea is hot right now anybody concerned with that is not thinking of the long term this is nothing against her but are we going to look back 30 years and think of the song fancy as a high point for music no it's bubblegum which is fine every generation needs entertainment but eventually we spit that bubblegum out transition what do you think of all this let me know forever 
hehR6VpW-lk,hi everyone Luigi Nintendo here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the New Adventures album supersonic home ok yeah but it's is that that really new rack how do you know what this record is I didn't even say the genre yet cuz I only listen to that real indie rock the real stuff what even makes something real indie rock to you you know a guitars okay alright never mind um debut full-length LP here from Pittsburgh band adventures which lands on run for cover records a little Boston indie label they've been building a steady following since the label formed about ten years ago catering to a new crop of bands that sound like lost emo and indie rock relics from the 90s a lot of the bands on this label in my opinion perform and record with a kind of amateurish flair or lack thereof a lot of which I don't really care for even though there are some groups I do find interesting or enjoyable on the roster of this label like I do enjoy some self defense family songs they're also working with MEK averse kin and they've also put out a record with experimental abstract New Jersey rapper GDP and I am looking forward to that new Elvis to Presley record and on the labels YouTube channel they also host a weekly Q&A segment called Tuesdays with Tay which has been one of my favorite web series over the past year and while I'm not really huge on a bulk of the material the label releases they always make their records readily available to stream and I do like to try to keep up to date on what they're putting out just to kind of see if something grabs my attention and voila we are here now with this new adventures' album like much of the run for cover roster adventures pulls their sound from the 90s specifically these genres of indie pop and rock power pop and a bit of emo maybe a touch of twee as well even though that came earlier I digress but a lot of the clean guitars and performances and the really catchy on this album to me say that the band is also kind of hip to a lot of the radio-friendly alternative rock that was coming out during that decade as well bands like Smashing Pumpkins maybe just a little bit of Third Eye Blind and there's something about the vocals of frontwoman reba myers that kind of reminds me of the cranberries maybe not quite so Y LP but there are some nasally and twined inflections there that do remind me of some of the cranberries biggest tracks there are also some really tight vocal harmonies that play a very prominent role throughout much of this album and for the most part sound great even if some of the singing is a little green a little amateurish to a degree and even though the vocals on this record can be a little shaky at times they could be a little nasally I don't think they ruin the enjoyment of these tracks I actually think they add a very youthful innocence to these songs that's a really endearing and matches up very nicely with the sweet blissful pop rock melodies on a lot of the songs here also let it be known there's kind of a moody angsty vibe going on with some of these tracks too as far as the instrumentation goes it's it's pretty straightforward and dare I say plain in a sense it's really just vocals guitars bass drums most of the time being played at at a very easygoing mid-paced tempo be very punchy clean recording and mix balances everything very nicely and the performance is overall are very fluid they're very tight they're not too stiff or anything like that it definitely fits the emotional and very gentle energy behind these tracks and even though there are things on this album worth praising that there isn't too much on this record that is altogether new I don't even really find the guitar tones or the vocals on this album as enjoyable as they are to be that distinct especially with some of the DejaVu riffs on this album here and there but there is magic on this album and I think it lies mostly in the very well crafted hooks and vocal melodies on this record many of which I found myself singing along to even on just the second listen to this project like the song heavenly the vocal harmonies on the chorus here which is really big really lush and rich there's so much mana saving you thing getting choked up a little on the song my marble home the band picks up a bit of speed and does a little jangle pop with this track but still maintains their usual vibe so the slight genre transition goes over very smoothly the song pure the slow ringing guitar chords at the beginning of this track are so anthemic it's like a creed song but good then after this we shift into a kind of shy verse with very reserved vocals eventually we hit some heavier guitars some louder bolder vocal harmonies and even though this track isn't one of the catchy ER in the bunch here it is a show of adventures writing pretty dynamic songs with numerous parts I love the climactic ending of this track - there's also the song walked to bed smooth catchy sweet or the song long hair which sounds like the perfect soundtrack to lying down in a field and the spring underneath the Sun with someone you got a real crush on and the song tension one of my favorites on here finds a lot of power in just these very simple downstroke guitars just gains tension from these guitars and at least from what I can interpret in the lyrics here just kind of seems like loving someone for the wrong reasons kind of like they're just a plaything you're wanting this person for the tension and that's it not the attention which I actually think was a bit of a play on words on this track it kind of seems like you would want someone for the attention but instead adventures want someone for the just the tension overall it's not a bad record I found a really enjoyable it was sweet it was fun could sing along to it it just stuck in my mind I I guess again my big gripe with this LP though is that it's it's really just nothing all that novel or refreshing to me it was just a bit of very well written well played and well put together nostalgia with it with a kind of shy personality I think Adventures is off to a great start with this LP there are definitely some standout tracks here but there's most definitely room to grow as well I would say I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it adventures supersonic home forever 
6XOgZ2qp9us,hi everyone Anthony Kardashian here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of a hip-hop record a collaborative hip-hop record bad bad not good and Ghostface Killah Sour soul this may be hip a bet is it real hip hop why are you not in the closet real is it real yes it is a real hip hop album it is it is a really a hip hop album because I don't only listen to real hip hat I don't even understand what you're saying yes it's it's a real hip hop album is your real though it's real okay you don't got you yes this is a collaborative album between a young Ontario jazz trio whose music I have reviewed numerous times in the past and infamous Staten Island rapper and wu-tang member Ghostface Killah has got a second wind lately and has been embarking on some pretty interesting projects like 12 reasons to die a revenge fueled story album with loads of vintage soul funk and rock flavored instrumentals from bandleader Adrian young and Ghostface Killah tried to recreate much of that very same magic on his next full-length LP 36 seasons a revenge fueled story album as well but with less captivating verses and characters and instrumentals but really for me this record was kind of just a lukewarm appetizer because as I was listening to this album my head was already in the future in February 2015 because at the time of the release of this record this new collaborative album over here had already been announced and given that I am a big bad bad not good fan I was really more anticipating this if you're not familiar with bad bad not good they've only been around a few years thus far but in that short time span they have recorded some very impressive energetic and explosive fusions of jazz music hip hop and rock and given they've had previous experience working with hip hop artists on records or performing Odd Future Pharoahe Monch I figured this new record here just it's a layup it's in the bag it's it just can't be anything else but awesome however after listening to this record I guess it didn't really reach my expectations instrumentally this record really seems to be in a similar vein to Ghostface kills previous to once again the music backing ghosts versus pulls from 60s and 70s soul funk and rock music maybe a little bit of a exploitation film soundtrack work there are also some pretty lush horn and string arrangements on this LP and the bass the keys the drums are all really tight so while yeah instrumentally this record does reach kind of a standard of technical and performance quality it feels like bad bad not good is really playing it straight on this album album however maybe this change of pace isn't totally unexpected given that the last bad bad not good album relied so heavily on dense layered compositions than it did freewheeling fiery improvisation but together the band and producer Frank Dux actually do recreate this style of music with an extreme and impressive attention to detail like with the interlude instrumental tracks which there are a few of on this record like starts reality and the closing song experience however my first kind of gripe with this LP is that it's it's a little brief you know it's it's just over 30 minutes in length and for a record this brief there really aren't enough songs where ghost is rapping at least at length for me because there are some songs here where he'll drop one verse maybe it's kind of short but one verse all the same and then he'll kind of duck out and maybe the song will end at that point or maybe there will be a little bit of instrumental padding the feature list on this LP is actually pretty impressive though we have detroy MC Danny Brown whose high pitched inflection and insane delivery is always a highlight no matter where he turns up of course we have doom aka MF DOOM whose verse is pretty kooky on this record as usual up-and-coming MC tree from Chicago whose delivery is kind of subdued on his appearance here maybe a little too subdued and then my favorite appearance on this record has to be the LZ verse there's one line here where he says hit the bottom of the asphalt it's probably your asphalt but as far as go face goes on this record the core figure of this album I think a lot of his verses on this LP are I don't know just kind of average by by his standards nothing terrible nothing offensive I don't get that same lack of excitement or drive that I got 36 seasons his expressive flow is there his charisma is there the usual lyrics and themes about being a seedy and violent criminal are there as well but I can't help but listen to this album and feel like his ambitions didn't really push past the idea of let's just make some tracks together the title track on here go space sort of seems to be portraying himself as a twisted and very paranoid individual who is worried about being spied on and microchipped the instrumentals very laid back with guitars and bass and drums but it feels like you know more of a tones that are more of an introduction than the actual very short intro instrumental track I love the very dramatic track gun showers again with Elle's I then there's the song tones rap which I wish was longer but for the minute that it's on ghost face kind of seems to deliver a pimp's lament which if you just take it as straight fiction is pretty funny Ghostface Killah is flow goes kind of speedy on the song street knowledge which is cool even though the refrain here is very busy and kind of jumbled there's another track on here I feel the same way about my playing tricks on me where the refrain the hook is again just really jumbled and not much translates in terms of it being memorable but to go back to this track Street knowledge again trees contribution here is a little too sleepy just really uneventful and I guess the other feature that kind of underwhelming was actually dunes on the song Raygun which isn't a terrible song it's definitely one of the more upbeat tracks in the tracklisting gear but it's not one of the hotter songs have heard ghosts and doom do together definitely surpassed by the mask on danger doom or the song chinatown wars one of my favorite tracks on this record is actually toward the end food or food for thought it's low-key its emotional it's inspirational even though Ghostface sentiments the messages he's communicating might be a little basic there's a gorgeous theme melody on this track and ghost actually sticks around for two full verses instead of just one and again that's kind of another one of my issues with this LP even some of the tracks that I like such as nuggets of wisdom for example they just come off so brief while there wasn't anything outright awful on this album much of it doesn't show any initiative I think at the end of the day this collaboration was more exciting in its billing than it was in its execution I thought this record was decent it had its moments it had its great melodies it had its great instrumentals it had its great verses just don't expect too many of those and don't expect the good ones the best ones to last very long I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Ghostface Killah that bad not good sour soul forever 
fW60RaP67qU,hi everyone to thinnies stacks tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new drake album slash mixtape if you're reading this it's too late Drake is a Toronto rapper singer whose career was put on the fast track in the late 2000s by little Wayne through a cosign getting signed to Young Money cash money records and he has dropped three successful albums since and has impacted the music industry more than any other rapper his age I think with loads of hot singles under his belt like zero to a hundred and best I ever had Marvin's Room headlines the motto hold on we're going home start from the bottom now ahead but despite Drake's incredible success and his influence on modern-day hip hop with his blends of pop rap and R&B he's continued to be a pretty polarizing figure for some he represents an ideological shift a generational shift in hip-hop music one that's less macho more in tune with its emotions which has been fuel for many an internet joke and personally I can't really say Drake has been a favorite of mine over the past five or so years either on every Drake LP there have been some singles that I've gravitated toward a little bit at least but would thank me later I was kind of turned off by all the sappy love songs on this record some of the lower moments on take care like Marvin's Room in my opinion were kind of immature and trashy even though that record in a sense is pretty interesting in that it is so kind of moody and ethereal for the genre and theoretically nothing was the same was a kind of interesting change of pace in that this help he was even more ethereal and even less single driven there are tracks on this record that managed to be big hits and very popular despite not being as a media in my opinion as previous singles like headlines but still nothing was the same did contain some of my least favorite Drake songs so far like wu-tang forever and worst behavior not only did this LP pop appeal but it also lacked real confidence which I think on a lot of the songs here Drake was overcompensating for again do you bring it back to worst behavior which features a vocal inflection that's just ridiculous kind of like Drake is trying to make up a big boy voice but now we have this suddenly dropped new mixtape slash album which comes in the midst of drama heavy drama involving Young Money cash money billionaires labelmate little Wayne from what the music media has reported thus far little Wayne has not been able to release his new full-length project is commercial project the Carter five and live and learn little Wayne of course is pissed is trying to leave the label is trying to sue the label and some music websites have been reporting that this new project here fulfills a four album record contract that Drake has with Young Money cash money however some journalists have responded by saying well actually we're not really totally sure whether or not that's true where is this information coming from what's the source on this information so I'm not I'm not really sure I mean this album here could either be an appetizer for the LP that Drake is scheduled to release later this year or maybe it's Drake showing solidarity with Wayne and trying to break away from the label if in fact he has finished his record contract out with this project we'll we'll sort of see whether or not that obligation has been filled when Drake goes to release his new album later this year so in a way this new project over here is kind of like a placeholder and some people have kind of theorized that this may in fact be a bunch of b-sides or just unused recordings and even if that is the case I don't think there is a lack of effort reflected in that and actually I mean a lot of what's here seems pretty new like Drake is reacting to some pretty current events on a few of these tracks and sonically aesthetically all the songs here are pretty cohesive almost as if they were recorded and conceived within a very recent time period if this were a bunch of b-sides we would be getting tracks that sound like thank me later Drake we'd be getting tracks that sound like take care Drake we'd be getting tracks that sound like nothing was same drake and maybe even mixtape drake from 2009 but really i just don't think that's the case especially considering just how well a lot of these songs flow together as far as the material that's presented here we're essentially getting 17 tracks lyrically drake isn't really approaching any topics here he hasn't before he's famous he's a rapper successful he's rich sometimes he's in love sometimes he's reflecting back upon his family in his youth and there are some memorable lines on these tracks to drake drops some gems there's one line where he's rapping about throwing rappers heads up on his mantle as if he's a hunter there's another line here that i liked were you saying that he has to act like he likes some of these rappers but his acting days are over so screw that and Drake's acting days are usually something that has haunted him and has been kind of used against him in a negative way and I think this was an interesting bar to kind of flip that around fire back and reverse that weapon on his critics there's one line where he's talking about all these things that he's buying and buying and buying and then he ends the series of material things off with and you better keep track of it everything I'm buying the new shits on steroids it'll never pass a physical really a drug test but physical okay the other line about someone picking their casket and he'll put a nail through it there are a lot of lines here I'm like okay Drake sounded aggressive he's sounding charismatic he's sounding like you know he's really going forties hungary's intense and there are a lot of tracks here where Drake sort of seems to to center on a certain idea like on energy with haters and people sort of bugging him draining him of his energy and he's not gonna he's not gonna let that happen I would actually say it's a pretty awesome anti hater anthem the opening track year legend the idea behind is pretty simple if Drake were to die now he would become legend maybe you and the six Drake is getting kind of nostalgic and he's kind of rapping directly to his mom on this track and it's a pretty heartfelt on the song Madonna I think he's a I don't know seeing potential in this girl telling her to get in his car kind of hitting on her but in a way I'm not really sure if that potential is really there he's just kind of feel your head with nonsense to I don't know get her pants not sure there's the song company where Drake is rapping about how he is a dog and kind of unworthy of a real loving relationship and the song used to as well which you might kind of be familiar with if you heard the mixtape little Wayne dropped earlier this year Drake is essentially talking about getting used to the fame on this track how long has he been famous at this point he's still getting used to it but that's kind of been a consistent thing for Drake even at his highest points in music there's always just like a little bit of awkwardness that you could read into on some of the deeper cuts of his albums just kind of the sense that he's not where he belongs or he's just not comfortable in his own skin and that's been kind of a turn-off for me on past projects like if you're going to be that insecure I mean just be open about it and just own it and just make music about it rather than swinging back and forth violently between just TMI exposing a little bit too much and then sort of overcompensating for it I think on if you're reading this Drake finally finds that happy medium that he used to kind of be at in his older mixtape days to finish off the record topically the song star 67 has some pretty smart phone metaphors and the last track here which the internet has been in an uproar over Drake froze an incredible amount of shade at Tyga really clever line about him not acting his age but his girl's age rappers just really want to marry into that Kardashian royalty don't they but what's most important on this LP is now what Drake did or what Drake said but really what he didn't do what he didn't say he didn't make me cringe anywhere on this entire record there is nowhere on this album where he is desperately drunk-dialing some wannabe like I was with you first there aren't any moments where he's too afraid to get out of the car to pump gas instead Drake loses with actual confidence which on this LP i think is pretty contagious in the same way that it would be on a 2000s era jay-z record but also Drake is a little more self-aware in that he'll kind of check himself and maybe say something poignant every once in a while about himself his position rap music as an industry or other rappers and I get that some people aren't really going to be interested in that topic bake bake bake Drake is not going back Packer political or super deep or anything like that but his very high profile position in the music industry makes his autobiographical rhymes worth delivering so Drake's confidence is convincing on this project but he brings some good hooks and melodies as well like on the song energy or know yourself running through the six with my wool or even preach with partynextdoor or use to which has a quick little funny cool catchy repetitive hook or the song six man and most of these songs have some pretty aggressive flows to maybe just aggressive by Drake's standards but aggressive all the same Drake has a certain approach to aggression he's not super angry super mad or anything like that I would say his aggression is more fact-based let's talk numbers who's bigger who's better who's got more of everything if you want to view the world that way that's okay I guess what makes it charismatic to me on this record is that Drake's consistent confidence has him filling out these big-boy braggadocious shoes now sonically this record actually reminds me quite a bit of nothing was the same but with some actual aggression and bite and I would actually say this project has more guts to it even if it doesn't see as much success as nothing was the same formulaic ly most of the tracks on this project actually reminds me of a zero to 100 atmospheric skeletal instrumental confident delivery and beat change up toward the end of the track where Drake might be doing a little bit of singing or maybe some more melody is introduced in the instrumental and maybe kind of dark and nocturnal - like I said most of the songs here run with that formula and even tracks with more bustling aggressive beats and flows like six God for example even this track with its very simple kind of plain actually fit into the minimal aesthetic of the album overall and I think these songs actually see a lot of success and quality because of this 0 to 100 formula especially the songs that have the most epic and huge emotional change ups toward the end like the song company with Travis Scott and even the two partynextdoor tracks on here kind of feel like one long cohesive song the songs are turned off by the most are the ones that follow this formula to the point where they don't actually do a change of toward the end and instead kind of stagnate and sound a little repetitive by the time they finish songs like legend which I wish varied up a little bit more maybe was just kind of shortened or Madonna or jungle or now and forever but even though these songs are low points to me I wouldn't say they're necessarily horrible they're not songs I'm scrambling to skip once they come on actually like a bulk of this album even if this record doesn't go down as one of Drake's biggest projects historically I think it is my favorite commercial project that he's dropped so far if you're looking for some simple straightforward low-key but very catchy pop rap with a lot of confidence and a lot of brags then I would check this record out there are also some creative references to some pretty important influences to Drake on this LP like genuine as well as the roots and Erykah Badu on one particular track here and I really think on this project Drake has his usual emotional baggage kind of in order to the point where he isn't losing control over it it's not impeding upon the enjoyment of the album and hopefully he continues to keep it this well organized as we continue on to his next full-length album later this year I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this no way yeah I know ashin if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantan Oh Drake if you're reading this is too late forever 
aSoVb3Wkjak,and then I said to him they're called memories Cal Cal stop playing with me Cal stop playing with me oh my god Cal's dead I left them in the closet to die and now he's Dharma is there's a new drink out the mouth yeah I know Drake album hi everyone Wynn finisher Tito here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new your old Droog EP Kinnison Kinnison EP your old Droog is a relatively new up-and-coming underground clever and deep-voiced New York rapper who caught a bit of buzz last year often EP that had him confused with one of hip-hop's greatest voices nas in a sense it must be kind of flattering to know that your flow your wordplay and your inflection are so together that people would actually assume you're one of hip-hop's greatest voices in disguise but the problem with that is once you reveal yourself you're no longer what people really expected you're someone completely different not the rap God that they already had a vested interest in that's cult of personality man still drew continued to release some pretty solid music in 2014 like the hoodie whether single with prodigy of Mobb Deep one of my favorite hip-hop songs of last year and at the tail end of 2014 he dropped his self-titled record that was pretty good maybe he had a little bit too much filler on there it was just maybe a little too long not enough diversity to justify the length but rube was still improving his wordplay dishing out more thematic conceptual songs going into tracks with less non-sequitur Rhymes and more overarching themes and that's the case for this new EP over here as well this is a rock themed rap EP 11 cuts 30 minutes and even before listening to these songs the intro and the track titles really set the tone with songs such as Rage Against the Machine and porno for Pyro's and Sonic Youth and the introductory track over here is essentially a vocal clip of comedian Sam Kinison ranting about rap music saying that rappers aren't really talented because they aren't playing any instruments and he was saying this to a roaring crowd and this was a very common and popular opinion in the 80s and the 90s something rap had to overcome as a game more mainstream and pop appeal during The Bling era in the 2000s so there was a time when rock music was more dominant and the culture was kind of on rap music unfortunately and doesn't take this opportunity to clap back or say ah told iya instead he has reverence for the genre and his appreciation runs deep especially given the very generous Captain Beefheart sample on the opening track here there's a sparse smooth drum beat on this track some beautiful female vocal samples a nice very deep bass line and Droog just drops one golden line after another my favorite piece of wordplay on this track and maybe this entire EP is when he says these hoods that even Eric would get Clapton Eric Clapton he makes a shot at conscious rappers who were secretly egotistical even though publicly they are humble and multi syllabic fast flowers as well favouring instead of slower more engaging delivery where his wordplay can be a little flashier and just give you a lot of ah moments and I love that Droog sounds old-school but he doesn't sound afraid to engage with this new brave world of hip hop and not in a 100 percent ooh how come nobody's we're in Tim's anymore kind of way there's a great line on porno for Pyro's where he says saying my Styles dated is like checking to see if lines expired he makes knowledgeable references to punk rock as well as death metal on this track - and take shots at Papa Roach fans and Incubus fans as well on the song Sonic Youth not only does he actually reflect upon youth and vanity a little bit but I think his rhymes get a little kooky here and maybe a little MF DOOM ish there's one line where he says his diets macrobiotic and he's kind of talking about himself in the third person over a very villainous string sample sounds very doom inspired I love all the nostalgic references on this track and other tracks here too but especially on Rage Against the Machine which is quite literally a retelling of his days his younger days as a very passionate Rage Against the Machine fan wanting that debut album with the guy on fire on the cover feeling a slight disappointment when evil empire came out listening to their stuff on those wraparound headphone and even educating himself at the Rage Against the Machine reading list which I kinda did too I had to turn this tract off it was just too real and even though earlier on the EP drew criticizes these flashy fast flowing rappers he kind of does this himself on the freeway fire track it's just him straight spinning not a lot of structure on this track no big chorus or anything like that but he just drops one fast rhyme after another but he still manages to keep up his usual quality of wordplay the song is short but lyrically dense and that's kind of how this EP as a whole is in this amount of time Droog says twice as much as some rappers do even though I am a little bit let down by the sort of tongue-in-cheek gentrify my hood I wish this track had some more lyrics to offer it seems a little lightweight in comparison to other songs in terms of bars when it comes to quality and quantity but the song itself is still kind of funny with drew talking about how convenient he finds all these newly open coffee shops that have opened in his neighborhood and how he sort of crushes on these baristas and there's the track get the paper to which has a an old-school Beastie Boys instrumental but he rocks it very nicely with this wordplay about getting the paper as in money or getting the paper is in the newspaper it's a bit of greed as well as nostalgia and talking about news and just sort of the being the essence that in his life surrounding the newspaper he continues to drop solid bars in the outro track here as well I agree that Droog has a decidedly old-school sound and that's naturally going to make some people who want to hear something new who don't want to dwell in the past sort of ignore him and just throw him into the back of their minds but if you dig beyond the outside the outer shell the aesthetic that he creates music in you're gonna hear that he's kind of eclectic eccentric and he has great wordplay I like these song topics on this EP I think all the rock references made for a great theme his flows are solid every track has at least a few bars then sort of drawn to or that I remember there are a few tracks here where he's just a little more amped a little more energetic and that's great it brings variety to this EP but what I like about Droog most is that he's low-key and he's the kind of rapper that reminds you of how great the poetic component of the genre can be I'm feeling a light a decent eight on this thing transition if you've given the sepia listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh you're old Droog kinnison EP forever 
K0OKHJ3K8qs,what day is it how long have I been in here hi everyone Woodsen e bangtan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new pond album man it feels like space again these guys are a perfect psychedelic rock and pop band they have been added since the late 2000s and when it comes to that vintage psychedelic sound garage rock they really know these genres these styles like the back of their hands they have a lot of reverence for these musical movements you can tell this just from the fact that the cover of this new album over here resembles very closely the front cover of the Big Brother and the Holding Company album cheap thrills also this band has numerous connections to another Australian psychedelic music heavyweight tame impala namely the fact that Kevin Parker used to be in the band the mastermind of tame impala and also known for his part in melodies echo chamber but he also has produced numerous pend albums even this new one right here but pond also pulls quite a bit of stylistic influence from their contemporaries as well bands like Flaming Lips the falsetto vocals moaning very faintly amongst a very generally psychedelic collection of rock instrumentation expansive expressive guitar solos some pretty keyboards some chaotic jams remind me quite a bit of Flaming Lips on records like beards and wives and denim as well as hobo rocket occasionally the band's jams might get a little too chaotic for a truly vintage sound or their experiments might just get a little too weird but for the most part I find pod to be revivalists when it comes to that psych pop psych rock sound however I've never really been super wowed or impressed with their vocals or lyrics or songwriting they aren't terrible they're not god-awful it's not like they put me off of enjoying upon record but I've never really listened to a pond record all the way through feeling completely fulfilled I've always left wanting more and that is also the case for this new LP Oh over here even though I think in a lot of ways this album is a bit of an improvement upon what they've done in their past releases this record features a change of pace that really perked my ears up for one there are numerous tracks on this album that feature very punchy warm just very compressed funky drumbeats and grooves something I would expect instead on like an unknown Mortal Orchestra record and with the just very glossy pretty enveloping synthesizers all over this album I actually think Pond takes a step towards sounding a little bit more like tame impala and there are some moments on this record where I'm reminded of some of the dreamier contemporary indie rock and pop acts coming out of the US right now like Smith westerns or even Mac DeMarco on the second track here Elvis's burning star if you've heard Mac DeMarcos past two albums the vocals on this track are just a dead ringer for his delivery and with the very driving bass line and the heart beats on this track it's like I'm almost listening to a more upbeat version of DeMarcos usual shtick and then with the song is on I feel like I'm listening to a kind of a trippy surreal watery Strokes there are some kind of stiff drums on this track some buzzing guitar leads that sound like they could have fit in very nicely into the room on fire repertoire it's one of the catchy ER tracks in the track listing here and I'm loving the kind of stuttering glitchy vocal edits on this song as well as some of the strange serene and ethereal interludes the song just dips into so suddenly they really play with momentum very nicely in this track and that's the thing while pond doesn't have the best vocals or the best songwriting I've heard in a record of this genre I like what they're doing instrumentally much of the time the way that they're just experimenting with sound on some of these very fun and colorful tracks where the record really starts to lack for me is on the slower songs here and I definitely appreciate the variety the band is trying to bring with these tracks but on every slow burner here I just feel myself tuning out a little bit without the excitement of the more visceral songs I'm sort of forced to focus on the songwriting a little bit more like on songs such as holding out for you but on this track as well the playing is really loose and the way the instrumentation comes together the song just feels kind of unkempt and in kind of an unflattering way and I feel roughly the same about the song sitting up on our crane though I do like the kind of Spacey intergalactic aesthetic that this song and many other songs on here bring it's just that without a bold song to back that up the sonic theme of this album just wears thin a little bit even if the band does draw up some pretty inspiring instrumental moments on the album here like at the end of Medicine Hat which takes a while to get towards its finish in terms of energy but once it sits there the soaring guitar solos spattered with very glossy synthesizers it sounds like a comet flying through a starry night sky and the closing track on this record is actually pretty epic too personally I think this record is decent if you're a psyche pop diehard I think you should give it a listen and maybe there will be some longtime fans that are a little disappointed to hear the just the gruffer more distorted rock edge drift away from pond sound on this album but I think the fact that they've just embraced a more poppy sweeter more instantaneous sound and just some really fun danceable grooves has improved things I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you given this album we'll listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana pond forever 
_TCbKdhYsXM,hi everyone rebel PAC found Tina Beshear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new father John misty record I love you honey bear No okay Jenny death yeah what is this terrible wallpaper I put it up do you like it no get in the calzone no matter how bad you mistreat me I will always love you and me father John misty aka Jay Tillman singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist known for his percussion work as well in groups such as sax and Shore and Fleet Foxes and he has a healthy back catalog of solo releases as well which I recommend diving into if you're a huge singer songwriter country rock Americana contemporary folk fan the late 2000s was a was a time of transition for mr. Jay Tillman he departed from Fleet Foxes as a drummer he went on to score a film he signed with Sub Pop and sort of gave his solo career a second wind with a brand new pseudonym father John misty his debut record under this name dropped in 2012 fear fun and overall it didn't really grip me all that much there were some good tunes on this record some witty and clever lyrics as well some interesting song topics like tracks such as I'm writing a novel or I'm learning to love the war Tillman's sense of humor and his lovable personality came out in interviews and live shows but on this record here felt kind of obscured in a somewhat bland recording of guitars and bass and drums and vocals all bleeding and just melting together a little bit and just a tad too much reverb but I think here on this record Jay Tillman rectifies all the issues I had with the last LP with just a few minor tweaks the arranged instrumentation on this LP it's richer it's larger there's some really grand choruses on this record - lucious strings bright pianos some cute blinky glockenspiel there are some gorgeous instrumental crescendos on this record - I think Jay Tillman really masters that larger-than-life sound I enjoy hearing on a Fleet Foxes record but he does something with it that is just more tangible more down-to-earth less wondrous and just more practical and vocally Tillman is just spotlighted now and his stories his lyrics ring through really clearly I catch whiffs of The Velvet Underground & Nico on this record Paul Simon occasionally maybe some Harry Nilsson among others singer songwriters who might have just unusual approaches to storytelling and lyrics sometimes maybe even tongue-in-cheek and on this record here Tillman radiates with a similar oddball quality but his mastery of melody and his pop sensibility most definitely balances that out it makes this a pretty sweet and easy record to listen to plus it's nice to hear an artist and a record not take itself too seriously on the subject matter that seems to be the prime focus here and that is l.o.v.e SEC love on the subject of love Tillman turns into just a total SAP and on the title track here he embraces that role so wholeheartedly that it's kind of gutsy there aren't too many singer songwriters that I could think of that would so proudly belt out I love you honey bear and just back it up with huge instrumentation that just hams it up this track is a solid tune and there are many other solid Tunes on this record as well just great vocal melodies and solid chord progressions the music is beautiful its pleasant but I think it's really the lyrics that add a bit of edge to this album and really make this LP worth revisiting and reading into because Tillman tries to explore this already thoroughly explored love thing from different angles like on the song chateau la b4 which has a bit of foreign spice in the instrumentation it's a tale of lost virginity among other things there are themes of marriage on this track the lyrics are lusty but hesitant and also offbeat - there's a moment where tilman talks about pulling up this person's wedding dress that someone was probably murdered in and not that I assume these two songs are related storyline wise but the song the ideal husband of Tilton really portrays anything but on this track he goes I I think kind of berserk on this song which really fits the menacing harder-hitting garage rock instrumental on this track with a lot of buzzing bass guitar and just heavy drums and there are other tracks on this LP that are not as love centric but they are equally entertaining like The Velvet Underground esque the night Jay Tillman came to our apartment and the song strange encounter which seems like a really huge passionate retelling of a very traumatic turning point in his life and the life of the person in the song who almost had a life no more but my favorite song on this LP that sidesteps the love theme is a board in the USA which starts out like a very dreary unassuming lonesome little piano ballad but then gets utterly hilarious and kind of bitter in the lyrics toward the end as Jay Tillman starts saying that he is bored in the USA and starts talking about having a subprime loan and the craftsman home and having his prescriptions filled up but he can't get it up the song holy shit seems to spit in the face of similar Western cultural norms as well as religion a little bit too and there's quite a bit of instrumental variety on this LP as well just straight a baroque pop to strip back ballads the song when you're smiling and astride me is just a straight-up soul instrumental I think the one downside on this record to the instrumental shits is the song true affection which takes an electronic turn and causes this song to stick out like a sore thumb in the tracklisting and not necessarily in the best of ways I think the sound of the electronics on this track kind of take away from the organic appeal of much of the album though it does seem like Tillman try to be as subtle with it as possible with a series of synthesizers and in very light beats that seem kind of Postal Service inspired you know it's not hard-hitting punchy ETM or anything like that and I do catch references on this track to communicating through devices or something like that so the song could also you know be a bit of a comment on the technological age that we're in but other than that I don't really have too many huge complaints about this record it's not really reinventing the wheel or anything like that but it is well written and I do think that josh makes up for his lack of new ideas and maybe lack of a really distinct sound with a really big personality and some great lyrics I think there are a lot of heartfelt emotions on this record but simultaneously he's not afraid to step into some weird songwriting idea territory and put together some lyrics that are kind of unusual or racy or comedic so if you're looking for some good songs from a singer-songwriter who has something clever and interesting to say I think should most definitely give this record to listen I'm feeling a strong 82 a light 9 on this thing transition if you're given the Savile listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should view next and that's it Anthony Vance no father John misty forever 
mVzNlKik18A,
4C2TRjy9oVQ,now we're here chillin at my lake house I got your girl he or she wants to make out cuz I opened up the oven pulled the cake out but first Colin order me some cake girl hi everyone honey dance town oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new open mike eagle EP a special episode of West Coast rapper Hellfire Club member open mike eagle he dropped one of my favorite records of last year dark comedy a record loaded with melodic textured beats low-key but very pretty and playful and full of character too and character is basically a word that sums up mike's lyrical style as well his lyrics feature silly references an abstract imagery along with a lot of personal introspection sometimes sad personal introspection but Mike maintains a positive mental attitude throughout this he's got a pretty laid-back flow and he usually makes it a point to have some kind of point to what he's saying it might be a funny observation of a larger social issue or maybe just a small fleeting personal want like this is my emotional eight-faced I'm the president of rappers who don't condone date rape I should eat rice cakes and drink water fools learn to do yoga and vibrate my molecules he sings a lot on his tracks too even though his singing can be kind of weak it's also endearing as well lol but if you want to know what I'm getting at listen to the song qualifiers what if Mike's best written songs and that's another thing Mike is a a really good songwriter or at least he's honing that side of his craft because I thought dark comedy showcased his best material yet so far when it came to that so given that Mike I think is in a really interesting point artistically in his career he has now dropped this new collection of tracks and it's just a solid short release with one good song after another it feels kind of like a bit of a dark comedy epilogue especially given the opening track here dark comedy Late Show which has been open and straight both to the public for months now it features production from exile and it's kind of a revision of the opening track to dark comedy and I think it's kind of an improvement it might have not been intended to be improving upon the original song maybe just delivering a different version of it but in terms of the clarity of the vocals and the production as well as the lyrics and lyrical themes explored in this track I thought it was just bounds better than what started dark comedy off I loved the rattling trap style high hat that was applied to this tracks already very melodic instrumental and Mike lyrically seems to be diving into a lot of themes of disillusionment with the whole college career path he wags his finger a little bit at you too dropping their album a little while ago on all of our phones he seems disillusioned with music the music industry media race relations in America to an extent and also I guess the government of America itself because there's a hilarious moment where he talks about clicking on the Constitution's Terms of Service the tracks split pants in Detroit is a shorty on here I wish it was a little longer but the opening line about beats that sound like Zelda towns and given that that is exactly what the Beast sounds like on this track and that mic used to not know what that means but have knows what that means it was a really clever moment and even though the song is short it is still kind of a pretty funny story of Mike splitting his pants these song raps for when it's just you and the abyss seems to continue down this trend of Mike writing a series of raps that he feels centers around a certain thing and on this track and others here and even pulling back to dark comedy on this one he addresses a lot of I guess anxiety issues the beyond this track is is very pretty either these just wavy warble e tones on this song as well as diddling guitars and and these make up the bulk of this very watery B I like the themes and the song trickeration where essentially you're just getting all these tricks essentially Mike talking about things like how do they even get milk from a soy bean and even I do like Mike's verse on this track it's really MC Paul barman and Milo the guests on this track that they're really still the show emcee Paul barman his verse is awesome he doesn't really have a busy flow his actual verse borders on spoken word a little bit but he really makes sure that everything he says just has so many deeper meanings double entendre x' dorky double entendre z' and just clever turns of phrase and milo whose style is usually closer to that spoken word delivery is actually flowing pretty consistently on this track and sounds great sounded charismatic and and funny sort of how i remembered him from his older stuff his his last full length LP was a bit too subdued i guess all in all but here he felt just more lively and i like that especially as he dropped this line when he said when it comes to collecting rubies he's the poo piest or i guess you know this and then he rhymes that with being the new deist he's hilarious you know it's to be expected when he wants to play that angle he plays it really well if you're into just kind of smart but also slightly immature and just nerdy humor and then the closing track on here ziggy starfish it features a really jittery beat and maybe i'm either reading too much or not enough into this song but i kind of got the feel that mike was portraying himself as like an alien being on this planet or something and he is just having a difficult time adjusting to social pressures and emotional expectations and whatever and that is essentially this EP i think mike continues to be a unique and intriguing and entertaining and funny and emotionally relatable underground talent and this EP here as well as dark comedy and even much of his previous album animal hospital I think these records are really starting to put Mike onto a streak and they've got me looking forward to whatever he's doing in the future solo and with Hellfire Club - I'm feeling a decent strong 8 on the CP transition if you've given the CP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantan open mike eagle EP special episode of forever 
E_rFDt6hVfc,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Montana Roberts record coin coin chapter 3 Riverrun the saxophonist composer storyteller of Montana Roberts who came out with her breakout album back in 2011 on constellation Records coin coin chapter 1 free people of color a poetic and intense jazz record a live ensemble recording with an army of instrumentation pianos and guitars horns violin drums bass vocals both spoken and screamed bone-chilling screams I might add and as far as modern-day jazz is concerned I thought this is a standout record that boldly experimented to the point where it was pretty refreshing there were moments where this album was noisy and unpredictable and abrasive and on the flip side there were others where it was just absolutely gorgeous and it was also interesting how this album addressed things like black history as well as slavery and spirituality but another interesting thing about this record when it originally dropped Montana also announced that it was going to be a part of a 12 part series and this was just chapter one not quite the insane wow factor of Sufjan Stevens now abandoned 50 states project but still kind of wildly ambitious artists are lucky to get 12 label backed albums out in a single career much less 12 records that all center around the same overarching concept so now with this new record Montana is essentially at chapter 3 she is a quarter of the way through of this twelfth chapter project assuming that it's still going to be 12 however after listening to this album and its predecessor chapter 2 Mississippi moonchile I'm not nearly as excited as I was when I heard the first installment I didn't think chapter 2 is really as vibrant or as adventurous or as lively as chapter 1 and maybe miss Roberts isn't really that concerned with how each album sounds by itself individually and is thinking more about how all the album's all these projects are going to sound together as a whole or just how to them fit into the narrative of this 12 chapter series however I don't really see myself returning to chapter 2 or even chapter 3 unless it's to re listen to the whole series and and recontextualize those moments in coin coin on Riverrun thee montanus connections to traditional jazz music are kind of severed there are moments here and there where I do feel some inspiration coming from spirituals but the entire record really is Miss Roberts by herself performing a drone album with elongated vocals and keyboards and horns field recordings and noise as well as spoken word a plethora of different things to just create these very long-winded sound scapes all of which bleed into one another very seamlessly so even though you do get an array of different tracks that do feel slightly different from one another if you were to skip around the album they all really blend together quite nicely to the point where it just feels like one holistic piece and themes of black history come up again on this record as well there are a lot of moments where it seems like she is reading directly from the Diaries of people who had some kind of contact with the slave trade whether they be a historian and we're merely observing it or maybe slave traders themselves the historical context of what she's saying is very clear at least when you can understand what she's saying sometimes her vocals are really obscured by these drones or you're getting a few different vocal takes of reading layered over each other so it just becomes a bit of chatter so in a way this this does play into the narrative of the coin coin series so far however just cold reading historical documents isn't really what made the first record come alive for me it was kind of the emotional reenactment of the pain of this history in these situations that that made that album so compelling but I wouldn't say this entire album is sapped of emotion there is singing on this record which is very very eerie and and forlorn on the opening here there is one particular song here called the come away with me which given the context of what is being talked about and sung about on this album is very eerie how miss Roberts is sort of that can in come away with me the most emotionally impactful moment for me on this entire record was the ten-minute opening track which is the longest cut on this entire record by far and lyrically it kind of sounds like I'm listening to a really remorseful account of someone who might have had some really close ties to this slave trade that is talked about throughout much of this album someone who maybe at some point hit a turning point where now they regret a lot of what they've experienced and they have these horrible memories haunting them and maybe a lot of this chatter a lot of these readings and various vocal snippets that are placed throughout the drones on this album are kind of just a really long nightmarish dream sequence the thing though about these drones is that they don't vary that significantly from track to track you're really just getting combinations of these spoken-word vocals and moans and some very quiet subdued singing and electronics and keyboards and noises and cycling samples it just very song to saw on how each of these sounds are emphasized and while this does bring some level of distinction to each track those distinctions are just faint and plus on top of that I wouldn't necessarily say that the singing and the chatter and the instrumentation necessarily come together and create something significant or create something that feels all that well orchestrated it doesn't really feel like these sounds are working together in any significant way it just kind of feels like I'm listening to a bunch of stuff happen at once which in the loosest sense of the word does make it a drone but uh I guess not a drone that I find particularly entertaining all in all I think this album is intriguing at least from a contextual angle and it's certainly interesting to read into the concept in the and themes explored in this record and the coin coin series thus far and I do admire this albums a tensed seamless cohesion because again it does feel like one uniform 45-minute piece again I have to say I'm surprised I didn't expect miss Roberts to go down this stylistic direction on this album and I I guess you could say this is a particularly dark moment in the series thus far but to be completely honest aside from a few tracks especially the intro here and a few of the ending songs I'm very indifferent toward a bulk of this album though again it might sound better and more interesting in the context of the entire series who knows I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantana coincoin Riverrun be

J5RTivkcdnA,hi everyone Heath any buzz tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new John Carpenter album lost themes director screenwriter producer and soundtrack composer John Carpenter not a commercial selling pop or rock artist but his music has touched the ears of countless people anyway through his many soundtrack compositions for movies like Escape from New York and the fog and Prince of Darkness as well as the Halloween one two and three trilogy Halloween one being one of the most infamous and significant horror movie soundtracks of all time and on these soundtracks especially Halloween one John was building on the foundation laid by synthesizer led progressive electronic artists of the 1970s but was trying to hone a chilling eerie horror centric vibe to fit the tone of the films he was sound tracking and now after decades of being a world-renowned director and screenwriter as well as film soundtrack composer we now have this new album here of non soundtrack material the first collection of tracks like this in John Carpenter's discography and from what I understand on this album John creates the music here in his home set up he collaborates with his son as well as Daniel Davies who provided music for the i Frankenstein soundtrack so if you've heard John's previous work and you just look at the title of this record you can pretty much figure out what you're getting into here the tracks on this album are lost in that they don't really have any images or narrative or action or anything to guide them in a sense they are just kind of naked bare lonely songs but given that the tracks are instrumental and they are written and performed in John's trademark style they do kind of sound like the theme to something their moments when I'm listening to this record and in my head I just see the opening montage that starts a television show and I'm just seeing actors turn and their names appear under their face is they have just a longing gaze into the camera we have nine original tracks here that span just over 40 minutes a lot of the tracks on this record are Moody and cinematic and evocative they feature pulsating rhythmic synthesizer sequences ethereal piano chords and high-pitched synth leads with a lot of reverb on them wailing keyboard and guitar solos give a listen to the opening track on this record vortex which to me is proof that John can sort of thrive and create the music that he makes really well in the digital age I do miss hearing more analog synthesizers in the mix I do miss that sort of warm tape sound that I'm sure he used to make his old recordings but much of the time I think the same kind of magic carries over like on the closing track here night which has lots of gurgling bass lines and kind of warbly wavy guitars it's chilling it's dark it's nocturnal I dig the song fallen as well which has these really grand melodies that seem like they would be really fit for like a sci-fi epic and this track has a really grand finish - there's a second half where all of a sudden the music makes a sudden shift and all of a sudden there's a lot of intensity and momentum here like we're getting some action happening even though there aren't any visuals to accompany these songs it certainly feels like John is sound tracking an idea or there's at least some kind of progression here that is complementing some kind of unmentioned storytelling we get this image of how the song begins then all of a sudden there's this occurrence and the music just really takes off that's most definitely the case here for the longest song on the record of obsidian going over eight minutes in length but this is one of the songs on the record where I think the cleaner plainer drier digital aesthetic of John's music on on this album just weakens his compositions a little bit the drums are kind of thin the bass isn't as heavy the the lead melody is the high-pitched melodies don't really have that textured feel I love to hear in his music that just sounds super clean I still enjoy the composition of the track though the writing though I don't really think the the fake organs toward the end of this track or anywhere on this album really do John any favors these fake organs also show up on the track domain which has a really upbeat rhythm to the the track it's it's it's really lively and I'm just not totally sure how he wanted this track to sound just the way the instrumentation comes together on this track it just feels so small it feels so featherweight and it feels kind of corny it doesn't really have that heavy chilling vibe that I love to hear from a John Carpenter track this song sounds like the theme song to a bad soap opera set in Transylvania and everybody's like either a vampire or a werewolf or something but it is still undoubtedly a show I would watch still though I think this newer aesthetic this newer recording or whatever you want to call it continues to weaken some other songs here like mystery which I don't think sounds nearly as devilish as the melodies on this track sound like they should be I could really go into each track just talking about how I like the composition but but really just consistently if a thorn does show up in the side of these songs it's just that because the way they're recorded or the quality effects or the quality of the the sound of these synthesizers it just leaves John's compositions just sounding smaller than usual they don't have that large vast horrifying aura surrounding them I feel like in a lot of ways we're kind of hearing what John would write before they were treated to extensive post-production just to make them sound bigger it's bigger still though all in all I do think this is a pretty good progressive synthesizer progressive electronic album it's not reinventing the wheel but it is a reminder of how good the genre could be in the modern age and on top of that I think it's an essential listen for anybody who is a fan of this style and specifically a fan of John's I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on the selfie transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana John Carpenter lost themes forever 
MIvCSukQN9c,hi everyone parenthood taro here dad the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Z's album Z this I believe is the fifth full-length LP if I'm wrong on that don't break my balls I know they had a remix album of new slaves I'm not really counting that again I'm counting five albums fifth album I think so these guys are an experimental rock group and avant-garde music band one of the more prominent groups from New York right now in this style they started to turn heads in the aughts with albums like arms and they finished that decade out with one of their most large and ambitious albums yet new slaves and while Z's music may be strange and it may be abrasive at times I also think it's kind of engaging it's dense its technical there's a lot going on it's live Lea Lea Lea Lea and to an extent I think it's kind of playful or at least I interpret it to be playful or fun or weird I find a lot of the challenges presented in their music to be kind of inspiring and creative imaginative and there are some really bold and clear influences coming from jazz music as well as the very noisy and abrasive no wave scene in New York from decades back there are occasionally some weird grooves odd times from the school of math rock chaotic free improvisation Noise music as well as drone with all these stylistic influences AZ's record could go in any direction and it does often times but there are some constants running throughout a lot of these albums with each ZZZ project you could expect some sax freak out some very skilled drumming and unusual difficult guitars and during their sextet years the band put out some pretty dense complicated recordings but on this latest album here the band is now being stripped back to a trio we have Sam Hilmer on tenor sax longtime fans of the band will remember him and then we have more recent additions to the group like guitarist composer Patrick Hagen as well as drummer supreme Greg Fox of Guardian alien and liturgy Fame so new members very similar MO when compared to previous records as well but I would say zis go about what they usually do with a sort of different flavor I would say comparatively this new version of zis is toned down subtler the longest moments on this record don't exactly reach the intense highs of some of the songs on new slaves but there are a lot of very lively in the moment and intimate performances on this record the compositions on the self you rely on an incredible amount of repetition which is another characteristic of zis music usually but in this instance here without the incredible noise and aggression and layered instrumentation there isn't much else to focus on other than the repetition and I would say the result is just more cerebral more hypnotic than usual for zis and the progressions of these tracks are very gradual a lot of the time case in point with Greg Fox's drumming usually in these longer tracks he's focusing not on his entire kit but a few key drums on which he is playing some really dizzying and amazing rhythms just these little micro rhythms just so detail them just full of minor changes so while Z is not one of Z's most hard-hitting releases I still do think this project offers up a lot of virtuosity and kinetic energy the record actually brings one of its noisiest moments the future of royalty right at the start it's just about a two minute track and it kicks off with a lot of very noisy dissonant lead melodies backed up with these drums that sound like they're keeping the pace of the freakiest most insane marching band you've ever heard I just wish the track was a little longer really but what's interesting is this track and pretty much every other song here segues into one another quite nicely so there is a really great flow to this album I think and the album suddenly devolves from freaky parade - total freak show science experiment on this track called wolf government which feels like a very noisy primordial stiff soundscape this track is the sound of cells splitting and electrons orbiting sporadic distorted glitches and then we move on to dizzying cycling noise then a texture drone punctuated by these sparkling melodies while it is one of the album's more abstract moments it's still a pretty fun track to listen to because there's a lot going on it's a very engaging drone some twenty lead guitars lead this track into one of my favorite moments on this record core or corpse these lead guitars I mentioned actually kind of sound like something you would hear on a battle's album so if you're into those thin bouncy math rocky guitar leads I think it'll dig this track a lot however the song doesn't develop into a explosive normal just kind of exciting rock verse chorus verse progression this track instead is very meditative and with some saxophone hanging in the background it does some interesting things in the right channel as well as the left channel it's like we get some weird effects or maybe just some strange overdubbing in one channel that we're not getting in another that just kind of changes things up and this little lead melody this little phrase that the song introduces at the beginning exists throughout much of the track and the band just kind of figures out different ways to slightly alter this groove or intensify it or just kind of just simmer it and bring it down it's actually very pleasant and hypnotic and and really interesting I think however I don't think this formula works all the time on the very similar closer the repetitions get kind of tedious especially with the plucked harmonic notes on the guitar though I do think the ending of this track is really immense and and does leave the album off feeling kind of climactic did remind me of something really interesting or did make me think of a strange situation these really repetitive phrases are kind of alternated with these sax freak outs and this kind of descend weird guitar riff and it kind of sounds like being really frustrated trying to figure your way through a maze of some sort and then the song gets really loud as you realize that you're right where you started at the beginning again and the song explodes at the very end with them you know maybe just a the most intense frustration of the entire track that maybe you're never getting out of this maze overall my experience with this record was really positive I think it's a great album I loved a lot of moments in the midst of this LP it's intriguing again I don't think it's quite as freakish as some of Z's most recent material but I think the way they approach oddity on this album is a little more beautiful and concise and pretty direct too because this album is just about five tracks forty minutes there are moments that I would say are somewhat catchy memorable on this album the playing is consistently impressive the flow of these tracks is great the entire album goes off without any major hitches or just potholes with a single track and while this record probably will not be one of the most controversial in in Z's discography mostly because it's not really allowed extreme spectacle I think people who are a little more detail oriented and would really just love to get lost and a expansive abstract music piece those kinds of listeners will really get the most out of this record I'm feeling a strong 72 will light eight on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should be next and that's it Anthony Fantana Z's forever 
kB6OVpabOD4,hi everyone hi dams hano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly segment why you know a review where I talk about a series of albums in brief that I wish I had reviewed over the past month before whatever in it I didn't get a chance to and you know I'm just just gonna talk about the album quickly here that's all I want to start this video off with two projects that I'm not gonna go into that deeply I just want to say that you should check them out one the bus driver instrumental album instrumental series instrumental project V doll folder you can stream it over on his website I will leave a link down there in the description box if you are familiar with bus driver rather if you aren't he is an experimental hip hop artist he had a great album last year called perfect hair and some of my favorite parts of that album were the instrumentals and bus drivers really interesting almost jazzy horn like Flo though that Flo is missing from this album being that they are instrumentals it still is a really compelling LP or just collection of snippets beats whatever you want to call them and then uncommon NASA another experimental hip-hop artist who came out with another great album that I loved a lot last year New York telephone is coming out with a project called cold war-era or there is some music streaming from this project right now I will link to that in the description box as well so definitely give those two projects a listen moving on from that conduct fear and desire these guys are a Winnipeg band this album of theirs is a debut record and it's a post-punk record noise rock record a little bit of post-hardcore in their really raw recording which I believe producer extraordinaire Steve Albini had his hand in and it's not a bad LP the performances are really energetic they're noisy they're chaotic I think the band has some really herky-jerky grooves and danceable beats all over this LP if the way you like to dance is that is how I like to dance so this record is a dance music record for me and the vocals the vocal performances are actually pretty tortured and really emotional over the top that's really the selling point of the album for me however some of the riff writing some of the melodies are kind of basic kind of forgettable but I'm hoping as the band develops in the future they they come up with some more interesting ideas writing wise but if you are looking for a raw hard-hitting rock LP with a lot of guts a very gutsy give this thing a listen the new Jessica Pratt album on your own love again Jessica Pratt is a California singer-songwriter she had a self-titled LP come out a few years ago which I thought was pretty good it was a really skeletal intimate album just acoustic guitar and vocals from what I remember and even though it was a very simple album it had some serious charm to it I thought Jessica rats voice was absolutely lovely really pretty little voice kind of nasally but very distinct a bit of a I would say a Joni Mitchell vibe coming for some of her music the songs themselves compositionally were were nice and simple but I thought her lyrics were sweet I thought her vocal melodies were sweet but but still it felt a lot like a demo felt like a very basic album I was kind of hoping as she got assigned and came out with another record she'd do something a little more ambitious and this new album of hers is really a lot of the same there are a few tracks here that feature a little extra instrumentation just very faint very subtle but for the most part this just feels like the sequel to her self-titled album in its simplicity in the fact that it sounds like you're you're listening to an old dusty tape recording of a singer-songwriter who had given up their dream to be a singer songwriter long ago and while I still love Jessica's voice I still think she has a standout voice and interesting voice the songs really aren't much of a selling point to me there isn't a lot memorable or captivating about these tracks as I'm listening to them and as I'm trying to engage with them and it's it's mostly because of Jessica's really shy demeanor these songs are just way too indirect to be as skeletal as they are for songs this stripped back what makes them pretty the melodies the lyrics everything should just be really laid out there at least in my opinion so there are some good tracks on this LP and sonically it is a pleasant singer-songwriter album I just wish it was a little more direct and straightforward the new Marduk album French wine this is a Swedish black metal project been around for years since the 90s dropped multiple multiple albums this obviously over here is the latest and I can't really say too much about this album I mean it's got some comparatively clean production those tremolo guitars and the blast beats the rest vocals the brutal lyrics it's pretty standard by the rules of black metal it plays to them so closely I don't really think it has many distinct characteristics there are a few standout moments like maybe a slightly over the top were crazy vocal delivery there are a few slower tracks that don't really do too much for me occasionally there's a very sour dark melody that feels a little sharper than some of the other very standard melodies on this LP the lyrics on the song Africa are pretty brutal and the blonde beast actually features a kind of dancey drumbeat but none of these things are so significant to me that they really create a strong sense of variety on the album again it just feels like a standard black metal record it's not terrible it meets all of these sound and performance requirements that you would want in a metal or a black metal record it just doesn't really push beyond those rules of thumb I guess moving on to the new Decemberists record these guys are an indie pop in an indie folk band been around for years put out some of their best stuff in the 2000s I recommend that you go back in to their discography and hear some of that stuff now if you haven't and ever since they stopped making music that was kind of quirky as they transitioned from picaresque to the crane wife I just really haven't been into their stuff as much in this latest string of records that they dropped finally coming to this one over here just has been very middle-of-the-road to me very stiff performances with the instrumentation the lyrics aren't quite as eccentric the vocal performances aren't quite as dramatic or over-the-top it just feels like the band is playing it super super straight and super super safe whereas to me older Decemberists records the ones that I enjoy the most sound like theatrical performances and that appeal is just no longer there on their new stuff and I I understand that there are some people who might be turned off by just some of that older stuff being so over the top but that's really what did it for me and and that's just not the case with these newer albums these newer albums doing it for me they don't next the new Mark Ronson album uptown special Mark Ronson pops super producer and multi-instrumentalist long writer he's had some great singles come off of this new LP of his one with mystical it's pretty awesome and funky and one with Bruno Mars as well one of the only Bruno Mars songs that I think is fantastic and outside of these singles the deeper cuts on this record I thought were either slightly obnoxious or just kind of bland and reverb II and a little forgettable just some really run-of-the-mill vocal performances on these tracks from the guests that Mark Ronson brings on this album doesn't really feature some of the weird and just completely unlikable potholes that have been on his past records like record collection for example but Mark Ronson albums just never really come together for me either they're jumping around in style track after track after track and you don't really get a cohesive feel the entire record itself or you're just getting lackluster moments the new turnstyle record non-stop feeling a lot of people been asking me to uh check this album out it's a bit of New York hardcore new album but sounds old-school sounds like it's influenced by bands like mad ball and maybe a little bit of cro-mags but of course there's some it's it's not like pure New York hardcore it's like New York hardcore after groove metal caught on like on the radio and after like rap rock and hip hop was getting pretty big too because there are some elements of groove metal on this album an alternative metal like they've been listening to some Living Colour or maybe to an extent 311 because there are parts on this record where the band will go into a clean voiced moment and maybe accidentally they kind of end up sounding like 311 and it's not a pretty sight but I guess the biggest shortcoming of this LP is that it's nostalgic they grab an old sound they recreate it to a tee and they don't really do anything else with it I understand if you want a you know sort of support the punk scene and go out and see you know heavy hard fast aggressive bands I mean you know a lot of a lot of those bands that in my opinion did it best or either no longer around or performing like they used to but the wait turn style approaches this genre they've got the blueprint but they don't really have anything else and there are some tracks on this record that are absolutely terrible like love lasso and Blue Bayou I do admit songs like drop and gravity some of the more hard-hitting tracks on here are fun while they're on but if you're really into this album and for whatever reason you're not familiar with the genre that these guys are playing in listen too sick of it all listen to cro-mags listen to Madball listen to youth of today next they knew little wayne mixtapes sorry for the way - this album this mixtape rather was a pretty sorry excuse for an appetizer as we are sitting here waiting to hear the next installation of the Carter series which who knows when that's gonna happen considering little Wayne's issues with Cash Money and Birdman right now if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about either look it up or maybe you just don't care don't look it up but the most disappointing thing for me on this on this project is little Wayne used to hop on really popular beats really popular instrumentals and would go on these instrumentals and would kill them would make his version more interesting than the original version would make it funnier just more fun to listen to and that doesn't happen in any case on on this project every beat he hops on he puts out some mediocre who cares set of bars with a bunch of punchlines that are so I roll worthy that to listen to this entire project from beginning to end my eyes would probably roll out of my head or roll into the back of my head it just sounds like little Wayne put together something because we would be waiting for this new album and he didn't anticipate that and and that's really all it's not a big deal mixtape to me I zero interest in it I was annoyed when I was listening to it and yeah I'm just gonna leave it at that and the new effects twin EP computer-controlled acoustic instruments part to aphex twin amazing electronic music producer from England he came out with some great stuff in the 90s he just put out his comeback album last year and I guess he's sort of following up and and signaling to us he's not going anywhere anytime soon I hope with this new EP that the the concept of this EP is really apparent from just the title you're getting a kusik instruments that are computer-controlled and the concept of this EP wears pretty thin pretty quick you're getting what sounds like piano on this thing drums occasionally some strange indistinguishable sounds but I think the sound palette of this record overall in comparison with FX's acoustic previous acoustic stuff and electronic stuff seems kind of limited and not only that but he's not really composing some of his best stuff on this EP a lot of the tracks here are incredibly short and even the lengthier tracks don't really seem to have been as well developed as some of the stuff on his main studio albums there are some funky moments on this project that I thought were really good like discs at one and the sort of extension interlude track discs at - but melodically and rhythmically this isn't really some of my favorite effects twin work and I don't really think it stands toe-to-toe with some of his best stuff and again I think the concept becomes very apparent and very thin very quick especially with the lack of significant interesting writing and finally periphery progressive metal jet band periphery just came out with two albums juggernaut Alpha and Omega two records of cleanly produced staccato rift angsty voiced prog metal that I have like no interest in but hey maybe you'll like it and that's it for this why you know review that what transition if you've given any of these albums to listen what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana forever 
yREeV_Efnw8,hi everyone scared that he straight a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Shibata album earth and liberty oh you're reviewing black metal again you just reviewed too much black metal that's all saying too much black metal this is the sophomore full-length LP from LA hardcore metalcore band Shibboleth a band that I caught on to in 2012 because in that year they dropped one of the most badass uncompromisingly aggressive records that year hasta la birthday which was a riff led rage of a beat down hardcore album and with help of greg anderson of sun fame the album also attained the low range frequency of a doom or drone metal album really setting Shah Baba apart from many other bands in their genre also Taylor Young of nails on production with this record which led to a massive heavy just pummeling recording musically there were enraged vocals all over this record some really grimy down tune tremolo guitar straight out of the death metal playbook and on most of these tracks the vocal breaks were pretty catchy and for the most part the grooves all over this album were pretty irresistible even though in a sense the band did exemplify the tough-guy hardcore band cliche I thought just the the depth of the guitars the low-end heaviness and just the the incredible aggression of this album kind of transcended that the wrath of this record was so strong that it could go toe-to-toe with numerous records in numerous genres this album featured the kind of uncontrollable anger that could drive you to punch a brick wall until you've just ground your fists down to bloody stumps given that I was looking forward quite a bit to the band's sophomore record right here when I heard it was announced and I'm happy to report that be raw and extreme anger on the previous record is still very much intact on this new album here - in fact not much of cheval bose style really changes on this LP we still get those down tune death metal style Tremeloes those just heavy pummeling rips head-banging grooves double bass drums blast beats the band constantly shifting up and down in speed finding different angles to explore the the groove of the track every moment as mosh worthy as the next however the most obvious critique that I could think of for the band's last record that it's just kind of one-dimensional hardcore music is kind of difficult to ignore on this new record for one she baba moves forward without the doom metal sound or influence that was really clear as a bell on their last record they kind of revert to their older sound which is noticeably less unique on this thing and while it doesn't ruin the album it does make it slightly less exciting on this new album here cheval the sound seems less like a novel idea and more like just an exercise in catharsis though this is an album that serves that end really well right from the start of this LP and amigo where there's one part of this track where I'm just hearing the we're ready to myself awesome part but how the song actually starts is just with a this deep dark belly growl and then a heavy riff there is no real setting the tone or anything you're just thrown into an alligator pit you're like to figure it out the riffs the dissonant tremolo guitar harmonies the vocals all fed through a series of intense build ups and breakdowns and while it's not exactly rocket science it's not exactly complex or flashy it's certainly visceral and after this track I guess it's just sort of a question as to whether or not the other tracks do the job of this one as well are they as hard-hitting are they as blood pumping and for the most part they are moving out to the next track we have gorillas where the lyrics take kind of a a militant turn and the riffs do rip the song does kick ass even if the vocal intro of the track does reek of hardcore machismo the song winter has a lot of drug themes especially with the slowed down sample of a bong hit right at the beginning of the track the song had past descanse a actually has one my favorite intros of any track on this entire LP some more mean-faced riffing and this is one of the few tracks here where the van actually layers some really nice things on top of these riffs and on top of these chords you're getting some really sour dark harmonies and toward the very end of the track there's actually sort of a doom metal moment with some melodic leads but as much as I may enjoy each one of these more aggressive tracks individually as a whole they all really just kind of blend together and aren't really so exciting that I'm that I'm dying to return to them and when you move beyond these tracks there are a few variants there's a short little interlude cut in the middle of the LP that's just about a minute long and isn't really a highlight for me it's just a bit of filler in my opinion and then the closing track which lasts 12 minutes long I don't really feel the band has the the writing chops or the finesse to pull off a track of this length and it just ends up being a ball and chain that really drags the entire album but especially the end down it was just too little too late if you'll forgive the cliche I still prefer hasta la muerte I still think that's a great record it's something that's a really solid record and you know I still give these guys kudos for at least being dedicated to their sound and they are aggressive this album does hit hard it shows mercy to no one yeah the band is mad as hell but that's not all that made their last LP so good I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this album listen what do you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana should Baba forever 
rajg9r684ik,hi everyone sick then EBT oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Mount Erie record sauna Mount Airy is currently the main musical pseudonym of multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter and producer Phil elrom and for years he released some of my favorite music of all time under the name of the microphones he later transitioned to the Mount Erie name with a pretty minimal sound change still dabbling in lo-fi experimental noisy avant-garde and abstract folk music with a lot of lyrics focused on mortality existence the natural world at large and even though I've always considered Phil sound to be pretty progressive and and unique idiosyncratic there's always been something kind of amateurish and sloppy and a little innocent about his performances and his recordings and while I do think he has a really a defined style his albums usually are kind of cluttered unpredictable do - just how esoteric and abstract and and harsh the sound of a Mount Erie album can be bbbbb and after Phil transition to the mount Erie name he continued to come out with music that I liked quite a bit the very sparse an acoustic dawn album as well as the lost wisdom collection of tracks with Julie Doran of Eric's trip early beautiful set of songs on this record also the black metal inspired wins poem and there was a collection of tracks influenced by metalcore and hardcore punk on the black wooden ceiling opening EP that I liked a lot however with his latest string of releases clear moon for example phil was delivering much droney ur much more ambient tracks the album wasn't too bad but the record he followed it up with very immediately ocean were just kind of felt like a series of afterthoughts that were maybe a little uninspired so even though these last few records haven't really been my favorites in the Phil elrom de sky Murphy I still went into sauna expecting good things considering that Mount Airy always tries to do something at least a little different with each project but I don't really think that's the case this time around I think this new album here is is maybe even more drone ridden than its predecessor I think the sounds for the most part are kind of warm laid-back relaxing especially when it comes to the opening the title track on this LP which is one of two tracks in the track listing here that are over 10 minutes and they make up a good chunk of this albums 56 minute runtime and this opening track actually mimics the feel of a sauna quite nicely there are these warm constant droning Keys cymbals that sound like the sizzle of water hitting the really hot stones and these drones are sort of punctuated very lightly with Phil singing and lyrics as well as some very bird-like nice and pretty female vocal harmonies it's not a pinnacle of great songwriting in the Mount Erie discography but it is still a very blissful pleasant moment on the album that I think sets the tone of the record pretty well but I'm not finding the tracks that follow immediately after this song to be nearly as inspired or interesting the very brief song kind of feels like the the beginning of one my favorite tracks from the globe part two except with the electric guitar and just not as developed in terms of chord progressions like the beginning of one of my favorite tracks but it just doesn't move beyond that initial point the only thing I really find interesting about this track is Phil's very solitary poetry referencing morning light and feeling disoriented after being awakened and the words that Phil uses sort of gives me this impression that the days are sort of melting together for him and there's like this thaw going out outside the seasons are changing it's almost as if he's woken up from some kind of hibernation and then after that there's a song dragon which I've heard a solo version of before and this version is kind of revised with the bird-like vocal harmonies the appeared on the opening track here and it seems pretty nice until the point where these roaring gusts of either wind or maybe like a field recording of a of a jet flying very low but but in the distance kind of just whatever this sound is it just overtakes the song itself to the point where it's nearly unlistenable and even though this sound may seem really important to Phil I'm just not really sure it enhances the listening experience of the song it just really kind of distracts from it the song emptiness was a kind of interesting change of pace there was this really determined baseline on this track sounded like a synth bassline that would have made it into the background of a zombie record or something like that but then the droning keys come in thicken the song up and it just sort of sounds like a variant of a moment from Claire Moon between these keys and the kind of dramatic drumming the sound is is pretty heavy but Phil's really gentle vocals and melodies don't really penetrate for me I feel the same way about the song pumpkin to an extent too even though I do like the more skeletal and poetic moments of this song but as soon as the track gets heavier I just feel myself losing touch with what's going on and as if this album needed more similarities with Claire moon we another interlude track on here just titled something and it's just a bunch of planky keyboard filler these song books just kind of feels like another interlude as well but with plucked strings playing for much of the duration of the track except for the songs very final moments where all of a sudden it just feels like the track cuts out entirely and a new song is introduced with guitar and poetically Phil delivers like this ode to books which is actually pretty intriguing but even that moment just fades out completely very suddenly much of this record breezes by me and the spots that actually catch my year and sound interesting are just so incredibly brief these song planets is maybe the first moment on this record where the songwriting actually stunned me I thought the 20 reverb guitar leads on this track were actually pretty haunting and beautiful and the lyrics talking about how when I die the planet dies along with me it just kind of feels like either Phil is talking from the standpoint of something much larger like a planet or maybe like a solar system or something like that or maybe he's just talking about his perception as a human when you die everything else that you've ever known might as well be dead because it no longer exists to you and for the rest of this record there actually isn't another moment I find to be as poignant or beautiful and while three and five minutes are perfectly fine lengths for songs the average size cuts on this record just feel really fleeting and and minor more than usual for Phil because he has a bit of a reputation for ending songs really abruptly but at least not before they captivate for me a lot of the tracks here either don't do that at all or at the very moment they do that they just fly away as for the other lengthy track on here spring actually dig this song a lot to the ascending layered guitar leads on this track coupled with the vocal harmonies it's actually very beautiful a lot like the opening track here but I really do get the feeling of spring of spring coming on transitioning from those colder months to those warmer month month months these two lengthier tracks alone make the album worth checking out and if Phil were to make a record that kind of centered around songs of these lengths that that could be interesting aside from this track I really like the song youth I think the heavy explosive and climactic guitars on this track actually make the song a really fitting closer which is kind of interesting given the album didn't really give much attention to flow at least from what I could tell and my experience Phil is usually pretty anti traditional flow he'll throw some of the weirdest most abstract and some of the longest tracks right at the beginning of the record to throw people off overall I think this album is all right I like a lot of the poetry I like the monstrous drone tracks there are a few moments where I think Phil employs some newer or just different ideas like the vocals and woodwinds on the second-to-last track on here as well as the very heavy BC synths on the closing track that are just hard-hitting I think he works this into his usual instrumental palette really nicely without throwing the whole record off but beyond the sound at the core of these tracks when we're talking about melody and just the way the instrumentation is composed and arranged I think this is one of mount Airy's most unmemorable and unremarkable projects in a while Phil's usual ragtag aesthetic seems to be emphasized to the point where it's it's no longer endearing and instead it's actually hindering these tracks and just making them feel well maybe a little unfinished a little too unfinished I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Mount Erie sauna forever 
ibMp5-ItAFo,a bad review for Lupe the album's not poop a bad review for Lupe them's that poop a bad review for Lupe the album's not poopy hi everyone sorry for the wait tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new title fight album hyper view title fight is a Philadelphia band I caught on to in the middle of 2012 thanks to their pretty good sophomore record floral green this album was released just a year after its predecessor and at this point title fight was building a growing reputation as a punk rock band with some post hardcore and emo leanings pulling a lot of influence from bands like Husker Du as well as jawbreaker and there were some moments on this record where I picked up some food gauzy and they translated these influences pretty well you know it's it's not like they did the man injustice on this album but maybe there were points where they translated them a little too well meaning the band had the blueprint down for this kind of music and there was some decent production on this album and some good performances too sometimes the writing was standout in the case of tracks like head in the ceiling fan as well as secret society really catchy rock tracks but also the band kind of drowned in their influences a little bit they didn't really have that distinct of a sound or approach when it came to this style of music leaving this album I was kind of hopeful given the level of tell the band had displayed and the band seemed to stick with this sound going into 2013 with a split they did with Touche amore as well as a little EP but two years later now in 2015 the band delivers a new full-length LP right here on anti records with a pretty big sonic change of pace within the matter of a few years I think title Phi has really turned their sound on its head and have gone from a energetic emotional occasionally over-the-top post-hardcore band to a mid paced emotionally disconnected blase reverb heavy twangy indie rock group with mumbled vocals basically the kind of inoffensive rock music that gets the shoegaze tag because a little too much echo is thrown into the mix and funny enough I can't help but be reminded of another semi post-hardcore emo band who made the same transition last year from their previous record to their latest record pianos become the teeth and the result there was utterly bland and disappointing and I think we're seeing a repeat of those results here though I will say title fight does maintain at least a little bit of edge occasionally on this record the band does deliver a slightly faster tempo with some harder hitting sharp kind of flanged and watery guitar chords that are blaring and bright but the band consistently chooses to deliver the most forgettable and done to death chord progressions even at peak volume it's like they just want to make sure this album leaves no impression whatsoever case in point the song hack which ends disappointingly abruptly not that the song really did anything up to the ending that that really demanded any sort of level of attention I doubt most people will notice how this song ends there are a few other kind of upbeat moments in the tracklisting here but much of this very brief album kind of sounds like the the background music - someone's really mopey day in their bedroom and something like Elias Smith might just be a little too depressing the slower and more ethereal tracks on this record provide little to no highlights on this album dime-a-dozen trendy guitar tones vocals mix solo they might as well be background vocals guitar leads that only add to the lazy unambitious feel of the entire album and the writing the writing approach that the band takes on this record not that the writing was me track for track for track on the band's last LP but hyper view features the kind of middle-of-the-road simplicity that is stripped back enough to be minimal but is it bold enough to be exciting in any way whatsoever it's enough to give me grabbing for like a real estate or even a dive record though the song Rose of Sharon does stand out and the reason for that is the vocals seem kind of aggressive as do the drum fills on this track is kind of like listening to the band back in there gutsier days but on this album the track ends up suffering due to the production style many of the tracks here including this one just sound like a codeine drenched haze that leaves the band feeling too distant to connect with them in any significant way this track just feels like I'm listening to a song from floral shop uh no floral green but I'm listening to the band play at the far end of a cavern with a wall between me and them and not a cavern in like a creepy or haunting or stirring way for me this album is just another faceless reverb addict in a growing crowd of faceless reverb addicts I'm feeling a strong three to life four on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana title fight forever 
rTrT9V6MJeQ,hi everyone Heil today so here dude that is my and I know you did not just try to steal my kept short elbow here Bjork is an Icelandic singer songwriter producer one of the most unique voices in modern music instantly recognizable a one-of-a-kind talent thanks to her incredibly strong and confident vocals and her sort of unorthodox approach to pop music with very experimental progressive instrumentals also the fact that she's given fans a new direction with each record from the vocally dense medulla to the whimsical and enchanting Vespertine my personal favorite the electronically tinged trip hop music and house music influenced homogenic her very intimate and stripped-back debut record and the album she left us off with Biophilia which was a record and an iPad app together in one capacity or another Bjork has been in the music industry a long time she came out with her first record around the age of 12 and later on in the 80s went on to play a significant role in Icelandic post-punk and noise rock bands like poco and Tapie two chorus and then went on to the sugar cubes in the late 80s in the 90s doing a lot of post-punk alt rock and drink pop with them then after that she went on to make the records we all know her for today consistently throughout her career she has always jumped at the chance to do something different do something new do something ambitious and in the case of biophilia to sort of bring in an app that would kind of complement the music seem to be that new thing that next step she was taking there but I also think this record kind of marked a change of pace musically for Bjork to a lot of the songs on this record unfold like stories and even though there was a good chunk of this record I was kind of underwhelmed by when I did like it Bjork's lyrics and the really lush background instrumentation created a sense of wonder especially with all these themes of nature and the world and space and mythology coming up lyrics and for me this new record right here volnek cure actually takes off from where Biophilia left in a lot of ways to me a lot of the songs on this record read like stories read like theatrical pieces follow a kind of linear structure at least the music feels like it bends to the whims of Bjork's narrative rather than Bjork sort of forming her lyrics into a more predictable verse chorus verse deal but the lyrical focus on this record is so much more personal not really the same intrigue toward nature on this record though Bjork does like to bring up such for the sake of metaphor or kind of creating a mood narrative wise this album really kind of reads like the build-up towards and the aftermath of a really significant breakup and Bjork is actually as bold as to any lyric sheet of this record put the months either three months before five months before nine months before sort of putting you in the timeframe of the mind state that went into this song as well as two months after six months after eleven months after giving you an idea of feeling the dread of just kind of seeing that oncoming storm or just not really being able to stop what you know is coming and then sort of healing after the trauma of having this thing torn away from you that you felt really strongly about this breakup record to me is a little different than others and that it doesn't really focus on the breakup itself but a lot of the things sort of surrounding it another thing pointed out in the liner notes of this record are the co-stars and co-producers two of which led to a lot of excitement toward the release of this album dark ambient producer the hacks and cloak as well as new up-and-coming superstar producer ARCA who had a pretty big hand in the latest two releases from arc pops starlet fka twigs her latest full-length LP LP one was with my favorites of 2014 I sort of catch Bjork's collaborators and whiffs on this LP like on history of touches where the I see skipping just stuttering since all over this track just feel like something that could have landed on LP 1 and on the song family just the deep dark heavy bass II drum kicks on that track feel like something that could have landed on hacks and cloaks last full-length LP to outside of that and just the really in-depth personal breakup narratives all over this record much of this album is a pretty familiar territory for Bjork I think there are a lot of similarities between this record and Biophilia and considering the very subtle ever-evolving beats on this record combined with the lush strings and just really theatrical vocals this album in a lot of ways feels kind of like Vespertine for Bjork to go back to that sound on right here I think is kind of fitting given the romantic and sometimes very sexual content that we see on that record which was likely inspired by the same romantic relationship that we see in its demise here so while this help he isn't really that the the new sound or direction I was hoping for given the collaborators and the fact Bjork always has something new up her sleeve I do think this album still stands strong as an elaboration of one of my favorite moments in Bjork's career the record kicks off with three tracks which are the settler more primordial songs which the album's more intense emotions grow from later on you have the song stone milker which is kind of foreshadowing toward the demise of this relationship thanks to a lot of shortcomings some emotional needs aren't being met there's a lack of mutual RESP ect there are feelings that must be synchronised I love how Bjork can take the emotional language of love and approach it in a way that is beautiful and poetic but also kind of scientific and calculated like a robot trying to make sense of emotions or something moving on to the next song Lyons song I love the very tight slightly manipulated into strange chilling vocal harmonies all over this track really makes it highlight and lyrically on this song we seem to have björk alluding to a war or a fight of some sort and fretting really just worrying about whether or not this love she has going is going to survive this fight or this war and she kind of compares maintaining this love to taming a lion which I don't really think she has any patience for and then on the next song which features my favorite lyrics on the entire record a history of touches this track is all about the difficulty of just filing through all of those left over positive beautiful and endearing memories that you might have left over building up to and after the breakup point especially those memories of a more sexual nature while in one context at one point in the relationship they could be beautiful after words after the demise oh they could sort of be torture 'some is that even a word I don't know and the way she describes dealing with these memories sort of being overwhelmed by them and facing all of them at once it kind of reminds me of the that recent film interstellar the way Matthew McConaughey toward the end of the movie spoilers was seeing all of these various memories and sort of time hallways I guess she could say of his daughter's room it at various points it kind of seemed like Bjork was floating in this purgatory of just sort of seeing all of these different memories around her all at once and not really knowing how to deal with it then we get the 10-minute Black Lake instant mood change on this track just turn so gloomy so fast the track is profoundly sad and really theatrical about her vocals just constantly swell and shrink in volume there's some wonderful swelling strings on this track too and amazing beat shift in the second half and the way she describes this love being torn away from her at this point she feels naked she's missing something really essential to her being like a womb or a shield for protection and the song family kind of takes on the way this relationship breaking apart affects the people outside of it specifically children who might be you know sort of relying on the foundation of these two people and again this is another reason I really like the way this album approaches this theme while it's dealing with a cliche topic it concerns itself with sort of the minor outer lying things that aren't usually discussed in length the stuff that on the surface while it may seem less dramatic and sexy and intense Bjork still finds a very large amount of heartbreak in these moments and translates them onto the record musically and lyrically really nicely and while the final three songs on this record don't really feel like they are placed in any kind of specific timeline in the grander scheme of the tale that's told in the first six tracks they do concern themselves with a lot of the same themes we had Adam dance with Antony from Antony and the Johnsons and while I've never really been a big fan of that project and Antony's vocals have never really rubbed me the right way I think the way he accompanies Bjork on this track is is really wonderful I think that her and the way that Antony both just have a penchant for chamber pop and their their eccentric vocal styles really does make them kindred spirits and they just play together really well on this track and when Antony sort of takes the spotlight on this song the way that he's saying was just kind of sound like a weird warped glitched out voice he's got a really strong vibrato that just sounds over taken with emotion of course the strings continue on this track the song also features some of the busiest percussion on the record some strange glitchy electronics and Bjork's lyrics on this track are some of my favorite on the entire record one of the stranger metaphors on the entire LP - talking about - coral reefs that are I guess sort of thirsty in low tide and they're looking for this ocean of love - I guess kind of quenched them and bring them back to life the track mouths mantra while it's not a bad song I guess I was sort of expecting a maybe a bigger lead up to the finish of the album though the really dreary 3/4 strings are pretty nice and do feel sort of waltz ish even if the electronic percussion does kind of take that vibe away as the song progresses and the some quicksand I'm a little torn on it I wish the track wasn't so short I wish the ending wasn't so abrupt but looking at the song simply from a lyrical standpoint it does bring the album quite a bit of closure I think and I think maybe in a grander more abstract sense deals with a lot of the feelings addressed on the song family and despite its brevity the song does feature one of the denser more intricate instrumentals on the entire record a really great melody - and even though this album will be categorized as a breakup record it does leave that album off feeling a kind of hopeful in a sense I feel like the way that the mother figure and the child figure on this track are connected kind of staves off the sense of loneliness and a dread that's so tangible on many of the other tracks here above that I think we just have a collection of really well written well composed well produced and just really gorgeously performed art pop and chamber pop songs here I think they're really nimble and dynamic and detailed string arrangements pair very nicely with the quiet but incredibly detailed beats and even without reading too much in the lyrics or the overall narrative the album does have a very nice flow to it and feels like it works in three very distinct parts while it's not incredibly catchy or immediate or hard-hitting if you're looking for something that's a bit slower more emotional more melodic and soul touching I would say give this record listen I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana volna Keira forever 
khuhS6vAny4,haha comfort tea and jello here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lupe Fiasco record Tetsuo and youth Lupe Fiasco famous Chicago MC and songwriter who rose to popularity in the 2000s a lot of people would credit that with the spotlight Kanye West shown on him at the time while that endorsement may have happened Lupe held fans attention with legitimately good albums filled with solid flows and food-for-thought lyrics some interesting song topics Lupe was rapping about skateboarding long before it was a cool thing to do in this decade in hip-hop music basically Lupe Fiasco likes to present himself as a forward-thinking guy somebody who is always sort of a step ahead philosophically in the genre that he creates music and he always comes off as good-natured and a gentle soul even if it is to his detriment occasionally because there are some hip-hop listeners who might find his music to be a little preachy regardless Lupe kicked his career off with two records that most hip-hop fans can agree have some pretty great qualities Lupe Fiasco's food and liquor and not too long after that Lupe Fiasco's the cool and then several years down the road in 2011 Lupe Fiasco came out with a record titled lasers I was there when this record came out I reviewed it I listened to it and yet I still cannot believe it happened this LP would have been an incredibly disappointing change of pace for any rapper and it was especially so for Lupe and his fans had such a negative reaction to it even Lupe himself had come out saying he was not entirely happy with the results on this album there were so many things stacked against the enjoyment of this record the electronically tinge and really glitzy instrumentals the very sugary soaring and radio-friendly hooks and the fact that lyrically Lupe wasn't really packing as much philosophical punch there was a very slight return to form on the next record which was very bravely titled food in to an album that is not nearly as good as the record it's supposed to be the sequel to the very mild forgettable instrumentals on this record compounded with the many obvious and and basic philosophical points in the lyrics here made me feel like I was being talked down to or taking a very boring class as opposed to listening to a good hip-hop record ever since lasers I've been waiting for Lupe to just come back hop on great beats tasteful instrumentals and start delivering perspectives in a compelling way again with some more ambitious flows and improved wordplay and some unlikely themes and concepts and I think Tetsuo and youth takes a pretty noticeable step back in that direction this LP is his longest yet and it feels like it with five and six minute tracks eight-minute tracks a nine minute track Lupe parses the album out into sections with four interludes that are named after the seasons spring summer winter and fall but whatever the conceptual aspirations of this record are the reason I'm enjoying this album more is because these songs as individuals are better sometimes Lou pays fans tend to kind of get a head head head head of themselves praising the conceptual 'ti of Lou Bay's records while ignoring bland instrumentals and cringe-worthy lyrics and the beating of metaphorical dead horses but there are quite a few songs in the track listing here that are praiseworthy outside of their conceptuality in the larger scheme of this record because they are just simply good hip-hop songs even if they are incredibly ambitious and long-winded a lot like the opening cut on here mural one of the best songs here Lupe just brings bars on this track yes he does have a sort of point of view that he delivers through his verses on this track but the flow is impressive and the wordplay is impressive even if you don't agree with his point of view you can appreciate what he's doing as a poet and I love the beat here - the wind piano sample on this track that sounds gorgeous it really serves the track well and doesn't get old by the end of the song and keep in mind this song is titled mural and like a mural there is a huge picture presented here Lupe has a lot to say there's a lot to unpack in this track between the childhood references here and references to gender norms and religion and race and even though Lupe tries to address these really urgent and just really huge topics he simultaneously is very self aware of his efforts on on those fronts after all of these years saying in one line that he's kind of like missionary to a clitoris which is easily one of the most hilarious and clever lines on the entire LP and I recommend if you give this tract a listen replay it because there's a lot to take in however on the very next track we get a dose of why I'm not really a huge fan of Lupe's music in this phase of his career with the song blur my hands I think we turn really hard toward the catchy ER side sort of that pop rap side of the spectrum not that I'm against that side in general but I don't really care for the sounds that Lupe mines up when he goes down that road though the beat here is mostly tasteful there's a really slick hook from Guy Sebastian here some very grand and epic pianos and guitar soloing it sounds like a kind of radio friendly and sort of sweet and sugary take on some of the instrumentals that would have landed on a roots record like how I got over and even though this track is more concise musically and and structurally Lupe is a little all over the place still when it comes to finding out and digging up what this song exactly is about or is focusing on still though there are other tracks here worthy of praise like the very cute dots and lines wonderful melody on this track smooth instrumentation and it's a very pretty harmonica playing throughout and one of the better hooks on the entire record too and even though I cringed so hard that my jaw curl up the side of my face when I heard the circle circle steve urkel line there's a lot of interesting references to math and geometry and life paths on this track especially on the course where Lupe says go straight don't sign like a sine wave I thought that was really smart and maybe there's like a whiff of creationism on this track too not completely sure but I still thought it was a beautiful song however here is well we're getting another moment where um I feel like we're just getting unnecessary space added by an intro and an outro of a really bitchin banjo solo but um just don't really see what it adds to the track other than length maybe this recording of this very short banjo performance has some kind of significance to Lupe and if it does he doesn't really explain it I'm only really left to guess which is also the case for the four interlude tracks which are named after seasons in the track listing here though with listening to this album over and over I can say these songs that come after the first interlude summer these tracks are much more warm I think have a an innocence to them and have a sense of hope - once we get into the fall tracks I think the songs tend to get a little dreary er grittier and once we're in the winter tracks we get songs that are some of the eeriest in the track listing here and are either very callous and mean like chopper or we're facing very hard and depressing truths like with the track Madonna and then with the spring interlude the spring enter loop closes the album out so there are really no songs to sort of contextualize the spring interlude unless you were to count the closing track with absol he has a pretty good feature on this record each each season on this record has its own flavor its own set of themes its own emotional palette and Lupe is our narrator our character who kind of guides us through section and there's a pretty interesting structure or pattern to each section of this album with each interlude brings one of the longest tracks on the record and then immediately after that we get a few easier to digest songs that are a little more verse chorus verse driven like in the case of the song chopper which is a nine minute long Posse cut that features a series of rappers some more underground than others that are more of the hardcore hip-hop and gangsta rap persuasion it's not one of the best pastas I've ever heard but it definitely helps set the very dark tone for the winter section of the record I'm sure anyone with a theory on this is typing it ferociously down in the comments right now meanwhile the song prisoner one and two I think is one of the most heady hip-hop songs that will drop this decade this is one of the longer tracks in the track listing here there are some really awesome piano melodies and dramatic tight strings on this thing too this track is one of the longest in the track listing here it features some really dramatic piano and some tight tense strings and lyrically we get we get a lot we get depictions of actual prisons and prisoners along with depictions of more figurative prisons on the outside Lupe mentions being imprisoned through rebelling through protesting through going against the status quo he also brings some imagery in from detainee Guantanamo Bay style imprisonment bars death row and then later in the track he sort of flips it around to the perspective of the correctional officer saying that this system that the prison functions in imprisons them as well in a way again loopy gives us a lot to unpack on every track here but some songs he just dives deeper and while that results in some amazing music it also makes some of the other tracks here just feel a little lighter in comparison like loop is not trying as much or maybe the topics he's approaching he doesn't really have as much to say especially as we glide into the kind of melodramatic no scratches which has a lot of relationship metaphors in it while I can appreciate what Lupe is doing here lyrically instrumentally this track sounds like the soundtrack to a dimly-lit sex scene in the middle of an action movie to be completely honest this track isn't really that essential of a moment to me and what feels maybe a little less trivial but still trivial to an extent is the song delivery I like the idea of the juxtaposition of this track it's basically a song that explores living in a neighborhood that is so dangerous that normal day-to-day things become an impossibility and in this particular case here getting pizza delivered to you thankfully the concepts and the emotions way much heavier on the next track Madonna which kicks off with some Kanye West's esque vocal harmonies hmm and the song is in ode to mothers who find themselves raising children in dangerous neighborhoods and and battling against misbehaving kids and bad influences and corrupt police officers it's actually a gorgeous and very well-meaning track to well-put-together song and I would say the same of adoration of the Magi which has this really gorgeous ethereal jazzy be some video game references on this track some bold ones there are actually video game references throughout the entirety of the album and it doesn't stop there there's actually quite a few appeals to memories from Lupe's youth there's a lot of nostalgia on this record and if I may present my own theory here if I can have my own theory on this album that might have something to do with Lupe being from Chicago and and sort of rapping about a lot of things that he might not be dealing with directly because he's in his 30s now he's an adult but he might be seeing a lot of younger people deal with right now and having dealt with those things when he was younger he's sort of maybe going back and reaching and sort of feeling nostalgia for some of those older days but sort of that violence that corruption and all those bad things are sort of the running constant for me this record deals heavily in personal nostalgia especially when it comes to the title we have Tetsuo and youth youth is a central theme of this record Tetsuo is that the name of our character who were dealing with on this record possibly and going off of that youth theme maybe there are numerous portions of this album that happened earlier in Lupe's life or earlier in the life of the character here like maybe the song delivery I mean caring about whether or not you can get pizza delivered to your house kind of seems like a kid's concern especially with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reference at the end of this track and it might also explain the idealism toward the beginning of this record and the various interludes and snippets of sound that feel kind of like memories from a distant past like a sample of a pinball machine playing on one of the final tracks here or maybe some fireworks and maybe even this banjo sample I mentioned earlier has a similar significance to Lupe either way I love the first two verses on this adoration of the Magi track but the third verse is absolutely fantastic Lupe really steps it up with its flow on this track start wrapping faster throws out all sorts of internal rhymes during the first handful of lines really one of the best verses on the album overall in my opinion this is a pretty good record for Lupe a bulk of these songs are really really good some of them seem just a little more inconsequential than others but it has more to do with just bland uninteresting instrumentals than it does liu pays lyrical acumen lyrically I actually think this is one of Lupe's best releases in years he really gets to the heart of some really pressing issues this time around and he does so in a really engaging way with a lot of conviction I really like what he tried to do with the concept on this record I like the multiple phases of the album here what significance that has to you and how you interpret how the album moves through them or how it should move through them backwards I don't know that's up to you it certainly seemed like Lupe was trying to do something bigger this time around and I think for the most part he succeeded and with news of Lupe possibly going independent with his next release may we're gonna see something that's even bigger in scope next time around I'm feeling a light seven on this record transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Lupe Fiasco gets will see a shit right there you see that shit you see that shit ha ha 
EXux7PJ4fMI,hi everyone coffee tea happy you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new napalm death record apex predator easy meat now what we're going with a dead kennedys BAM actually the Nazi Punk's fuck off single cuz napalm death has a really awesome cover of that you could look up on the Internet napalm death is a uk-based rock band grindcore Godfather's death metal savages one of the longest-running and most important extreme music acts of all time a band so volatile that on their first full-length LP the personnel on the first half is almost entirely different than the personnel on the second half they have gone through quite a few band members over the years but once they started dropping albums more consistently the lineup changes sort of smoothed out and this current lineup has been serving them pretty well for a while it's amazing and really admirable that a music act so extreme has been able to thrive through multiple decades through the 80s where they were mostly a grindcore band and right at the in section of that style of music as well as embracing the attendance of crust punk in the 90s they continued toying with death metal with grindcore but they kind of hopped on to that groove metal trend that was very popular during the time but in the 2000s napalm death really returned to form and saw themselves competing with a new breed of amazing grindcore bands with even heavier harder faster sounds like nasan as well as Pig destroyer and worm rot and napalm death stepped up and made some of the most gruesome material during this decade the band is continually evolving and fine-tuning their sound while finding new things to experiment with and and take risks with while simultaneously looking for ways to just push the abrasive envelope with beefier guitars and pummeling drums and Barney Green Wave's vocals one of the most ruthless metal vocalists out there they're there now we're halfway into a new decade and so far napalm death has not been nearly as prolific as they've been in the past the only other LP they dropped in this decade so far was 2012's utilitarian which while aggressive it wasn't really a standout record for me the more aggressive moments didn't really get my blood pumping though there were some interesting detours on this LP appearances from none other than John Zorn which was a pretty awesome collaboration considering that just in the previous decade they had work with Jello Biafra and Jeremy joste but with this new LP of theirs it doesn't really seem like napalm death is relying at all on star power and they're just really trying to get back to their very brutal basics like the album art here the band is keeping it pretty simple but still with what's portrayed here so much is said the band has more to say than their guttural unintelligible vocals would lead you to believe for years in the case of napalm death music and message have have come very much hand-in-hand with lyrics that typically deal in the human condition in the flaws and the follies of the world at large and philosophically this new album here is really no different apex predator the human race we are prey to no one yet insanely we have our meat our hunt conveniently packaged up for us you could also say that's true of our culture and a myriad of other things everything comes in a box napalm death showing once again true brutality is in real life and they're just reflecting it by singing about and addressing things like violence and apathy callousness the mundane day-to-day of modern society and globalization sonically on this new record right here napalm death isn't changing up there sound too much they are working once again with producer Russ Russell on this LP which again means over driven distorted overwhelming bass and guitars crystal-clear punchy pummeling drums and the vocals mixed so high so so high that they're just engulfing everything else as if all these guitars and drums are being performed within the monstrous throat of Barney Greenway there are loads of blast beats on this record DB variations speedily strummed dissonant guitar chords dizzying riffs that ride sporadically changing grooves and all of these together create a lot of tension but the band usually ends up settling into a head banging groove with some thrashing mosh friendly riffs occasionally some clean vocals get worked into the mix which also showed up on the band's last full-length LP but on this album they are incorporated a bit more seamlessly like when napalm death switches from those guttural vocals to the cleans they're a bit slower more melancholy and grim they really fit into the Bands typical aesthetic and it's not like a jarring change and tracks that incorporate these cleaner vocals the most actually add some really epic variety to the album songs like dear slum landlord or hierarchies on my favourites on this LP another pretty significant change of pace is the opener here while songwriting wise it's not an amazing track it does have these heavy staccato riffs that feel kind of industrial ish on other cuts here with higher speeds and less subtleties you're just getting relentless riffs and pure adrenaline and the potential issue here as it is with many records of this style is are any of the songs really all that memorable do they all just blaze by some grindcore Bands newer grindcore bands have a lot of speed and virtuosity but really no feeling however napalm death ray jizz is actually very palpable on this record even though they've never really been the tightest flashiest grindcore band and that's especially true of their older older stuff they've always had an instantaneously felt rage that's made a bulk of their discography so appealing this is true of tracks like cesspits and how the years condemn as well as stunt your growth which have fantastic riffs and just kick ass from beginning to end I also love the song beyond the pale where you see some vocal variants there we're switching from the guttural vocals to some wrenched vocals on this track and there are a load of other highlights on here and they are highlights because they either feature a riff for a really interesting Segway or just a really sharp nasty lead melody there are a few cuts here that do feel a little less defined or distinct maybe don't have as many memorable or exciting characteristics like timeless flogging or bloodless coup but by no means are these songs lulls in the tracklisting because for about 40 minutes on apex predator the band really puts the listener through the the musical ringer overall I think this is just a really great record for napalm death in this decade I'm glad the band is still around and continues to hone their sound and just find new ways to improve it or make it better just different things to change and what they really ended up perfecting on this album for me we're just some of those huge grand clean vocals that that complement their usual sound very well as far as the other cuts on here go the ones that you would typically expect from napalm death while they're not particularly ambitious or groundbreaking or anything like that they do serve as examples of the band once again doing what they do best a lot of the riffs on this record may be kind of simple but they are effective effective when it comes to stirring up things on the darker side of the human emotional scale and above all else I think we're getting consistent quality here a good recording I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana napalm death forever 
GhWy8s2oc3E,hi everyone dunfin Estep tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Belle and Sebastian record girls in peacetime want to dance Belle and Sebastian is a Glasgow based pop group known for their lavish string arrangements and endearing gentle demeanor charming melodies quaint lyrics dealing in themes of love and youth innocence God and the trials and tribulations of those awkward formative years they pull a load of influence from artists like The Velvet Underground and Nick Drake numerous sixties psychedelic pop acts with a little bit of post-punk mixed in there they've been dropping records since the 90s and they are about as married to their sound as they are their album art aesthetic Belle and Sebastian has never really strayed that far away from their sweet acoustic instrumentation and jangly guitars and shy vocals however the band has made some conscious efforts to step out of their musical comfort zone on their last few records but none have been as surprising as the material the band has presented here on their latest record girls in peacetime want to dance I don't know who told balance of bastion that but they certainly heed the call with a collection of beats and bass lines and synth sequences inspired by electro disco and indie tranaka from the 2000s in a world where Arcade Fire is dropping singles like reflektor why not and the band strings these dance grooves out to sometimes six or seven minutes which has resulted in one of their longest albums yet however these dance cuts only really take up a portion of the record there are plenty of guitar and string driven tracks in the tracklisting here like the opening track on here nobody's empire or the song Ally or the track of the book of you which seemed like just louder electrified more lively versions of what Belle and Sebastian usually lay into a record while the instrumentation might sound a little more visceral at the core of these songs are just general Belle and Sebastian tracks especially the song Ally which has yet another clever set of lyrics that just kind of seemed like a really quaint character portrait even though they keep up polite appearances when it comes to the vocals on this album the band sounds totally done with being the soundtrack to your lazy Sunday novel reading instead they seem like they really want to make the cut of your next dance mix instead and in a way it's kind of a welcome change of pace for me even if this album does end up turning off more purist fans it's at least going to be an interesting listen Belle and Sebastian's start incorporating these changes just a few tracks into the album with the party line which features synthesizers and echo drench guitar leads that feel distilled from old MGMT and cold war kids records there's even a weird low-pass high-pass filter thing going on with the intro to the track that feels like I'm about to be introduced to like a really hard a DM drop or something like that and even though I think the groove of this track is really mean on the versus how sugary and just bright the choruses feel it's kind of a turn-off on songs like the power of three the band really kind of tones things down simmers down but still wants to maintain those light dance grooves and those synthesizers and in doing so I think they actually lose a bit of their original charm just kind of end up sounding a lot like any other dreamy synth pop band from SoundCloud as much as Belen Sebastian may seem eager to change on this record they don't entirely let go of the past there is the song cat with the cream which is maybe the most Belle and Sebastian asked song title I've ever heard in my life it's a really slow whisper quiet atmospheric and dreamy cut that brings forward the band's typically gentle style it's really sweet on the ears it's a beautiful track if you like this song I implore you to go back and listen to their older stuff because this song really is much closer to their old style and for such a banger album the closing track on here is just mysteriously underwhelming the dance numbers continue with the song enter sylvia plath and on this track with the boy/girl vocals as well as the really theatrical presentation this song is just Abbas Fernando through and through just electrified and even though I appreciate that influence I think Abba gets way more flack than they should I think they were a good pop group I think they wrote good songs I don't really think Belle and Sebastian's take on their style is all that fantastic I think the groove and the synth sequences on this track fall a little flat and don't sound as exciting at the end of the track as they did at the beginning it feels like a bit of musical tourism the style that they're making this music in it feels more like a fleeting interest than a passionate devotion even as they're pairing the music here with obnoxiously bright synthesizers and dramatically strum guitar chords it just feels like they want to get people dancing but not breaking a sweat there's also the song Perfect Couples which is a clever concept track with some really interesting lyrics and this song instrumentally features some looped hand drums and some groovy bass while I don't mind the instrumental on this track I think Belle and Sebastian's typically flat and shy vocals don't really complement the song all that well they kind of get lost in the clutter the instrumentation and sort of just fall completely out of focus and there's the song play for today - which features the kind of flavorless Caribbean music mimicry that was a huge turnoff for me on the Arcade Fire record there their recent one there are songs that I like on this new Belle and Sebastian album but there are mostly tracks that resemble their older style even if they are a bit louder and punchy er it feels like the band wants to take steps to change but instead of just taking the plunge they're dipping toes and coming through with just middle-of-the-road mediocre dance tracks me what makes this record disappointing is that it feels like a bit of a loss of identity not a loss of talent because at the core of a lot of these songs it feels like Belle and Sebastian can still perform they could still write the lyrics for the most part are still pretty good and are maybe one of the few intact elements of belem Sebastian's original style lyrically what's made the band great all along may still be on this album but when it comes to the instrumentals here they're not very flattering they're not flattering for a Belle and Sebastian record they're not flattering for a dance music record could they make a better dance record in the future possibly you know and and why not they've already come this far I think there's some minor tweaking that could be made that would have made these songs more interesting whatever direction they end up taking I I hope they just put a little bit more heart into it kind of like on the track everlasting Muse which has a really slinky jazzy bass line on the verse and then when the chorus comes in and the climactic ending to Belle and Sebastian transitions straight into the Eastern Bloc pulling folk music influences from countries like Turkey or even the klezmer tradition or polka music there's just a really slow grand oompa feel to this part in the song that I thought went over really well and it seemed like the band was really into the details of this kind of music whereas I think the finer points of dance pop might have slipped by them slightly I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Belle and Sebastian girls want to dance at peacetime forever 
X-qtbMsHk3s,ha smelly stank tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a review an album review of the new Joey badass record badass or before the month before duh money not before the money Anthony see the album write everything you've ever said is ring it irrelevant now because you can't see the album title you're bad Joey badass is a Brooklyn rapper and this is his debut commercial project right here here here he is also seen as the figurehead of New York rap collective Pro era and this whole story seemed to begin just a few years ago when Joey was catching some massive buzz off of his 1999 mixtape and even though it's been just a few years since the release of that tape so much has happened since he put out that somewhat underwhelming summer nights mixtape we also had the Pro era mixtape we had the survival tactics single get really hot that promoted toward that 1999 mixtape also the unfortunate and untimely passing of Pro hair remember Capital steez numerous features on numerous records for a moment he was flirting with signing to jay-z's Roc Nation label and very recently there was a photo of none other than Malia Obama that leaked onto the internet wearing a pro era t-shirt easily one of the most epic hip hop cosines ever but all that extra stuff aside Joey is where he is thanks to his consistency and his style his talent his sound he is easily the most relevant young rapper right now when it comes to the revitalization of New York's classic hardcore hip-hop sound hip-hop is aging it's maturing as a genre and now it's been 20 years since artists like Black Moon and Smith & Wesson and nas biggie jay-z big L wu tang a Tribe Called Quest all dropped some of their best stuff and Joey has been the forefront of artistically celebrating this newfound nostalgia for what a lot of people are seeing now is sort of a golden age and hip-hop and Joey also tips his hat to a lot of artists who hit it big in the late 90s early 2000s Lauryn Hill mos def Fugees MF DOOM even though a lot of people might argue that the value of lyrics is going straight into the toilet when it comes to a lot of modern hip-hop simultaneously the genre is establishing its greats that came out in the 90s and hip-hop eventually moved on past this sound into the bling era of the 2000s because it was a young Jean WA and hungry for success which is maybe one of my least favorite eras of hip-hop period but you know things have to change things have to move forward regardless that doesn't mean we don't have room for people like Joey badass in hip hop's current-day state people who are great rappers great writers and are also a reminder that there is still life in boom-bap drums and just hard-nosed flows so far in his career I think Joey's yet to put out a garbage verse but simultaneously he hasn't put out a project yet that's totally blown me away so that's why I've been anticipating this record on which he is pretty stingy with the features which is fine because going into this album I had faith that Joey could carry a project on his own because from what I've been able to gather so far he's pretty versatile when it comes to his emotions his topics as well as his flow he brings on singers like bj the chicago kid chronics Maverick Sabre he also has Pro era member Diamond Lewis on a feature here the only appearance that I was sort of uneasy about going into this LP was Rory's as you may already know I didn't really care for his breakout project all that much but when he appeared on escape 120 uh I didn't really mind it at all he came on with very fiery fast andré 3000's --k verse what's more impressive about this project is the you have brain feeder producer Sam I am on here up-and-comers like Basquiat and Freddie producers like Lee Bannon and static select a team up with Joey once again you have classic heavy hitters on here like DJ Premier Kirk Knight of Pro era Chuck strangers of Pro era as to be expected hit-boy a relatively new producer who's mostly known for his more high-profile projects with people like Beyonce Eminem Kanye Drake and ASAP Rocky and Dilla and the roots make an appearance on the same track the song like me which is maybe one of the sleepiest most nocturnal quietest unsuspecting instrumentals on the entire record not that it's a bad beat it's not a bad beat at all but it's not exactly as explosive as the names tagged on to it that's all and overall it's a really good collection of instrumentals there's some beats here that are very smooth charming jazzy soulful like the intro track the outro track OCB peace of mind these instrumentals have a very easygoing vibe which there was a lot of on Joey summer nights mixtape and even though this same feel appears on this new record here he does reel it back a little bit makes room for more hard-hitting tracks which I like a lot other instrumentals here are more moody in tone maybe a bit more spacious and skeletal simple like on paper trails or hey-zeus view and they're legit bangers on this thing too like number 99 and Christ conscious which is really gritty and hard-hitting despite how hazy it feels but as much as I like the instrumentals on this record it's really Joey who ends up stealing the show which is fine with me because that's what I expect from him he's the kind of emcee that values flow and values wordplay and lyricism in the same way that a traditional emcee would which is not the only way one could or should be an emcee but this very established style Joey does it justice and he carves out room for himself within it as apparent as Joey's influences are I think he makes compelling songs and I could easily pick him out of a lineup so for much of this LP Joey comes through with really impassioned deliveries and great flows and constant quotables like the opening track here there's one line where he says that he feels inferior in some areas but he shares wisdom dot dot dot and leading up to that line there are a ton of lines with just one internal rhyme after another also the Jack the booty like I'm Sparrow line was cute there's also the track paper trails where Joey kind of raps about the trappings of Fame and specifically the money that comes along with it and while the money may help in certain areas it also attracts a lot of unwanted things as well and there's a nice whoo tang reference at the end of this track sometimes Joey's flow on this track feels a little ODB inspired order on the track big dusty I love when he kicks one line off saying he's juxtaposed from or with his prose meaning the proair members and then he's talking about other people biting his flows and how they even jokes the pose jokes meaning robbed that was awesome but this is one of many lines on this record where Joey sort of raps about other people's stealing things that he's doing whether it be rhymes or flows or I guess sort of deliveries and I guess personally I have to kind of take lines like this in stride because as much as I do like Joey his influences are so apparent to me for a genre that is constantly recontextualizing other things hip hop is very much obsessed with originality and maybe that's something that needs to be kind of re-examined as we have more artists like Joey badass who are so heavily influenced by the old school along with good bars and good verses there are some good choruses on this thing - like on hey-zeus view I love these saying on this track where Joey says that we may be riding the same trains occasionally but I can't see what I can't relate to there are some low-key cuts in the middle of this LP like the song like me which has some kind of playful sexual imagery at the beginning but it turns a little dark as the song progresses there's also belly of the beast where we get some really gritty wordplay as Joey describes his surroundings and up bringing his voice is particularly deep at this point on the record and there's just a real sense of danger and entrapment and fear at some points in this song proving his versatility joey goes on to go absolutely bonkers on tracks like number 99 which is loaded with shots at police I love the line on this track where he says the last one to pull his card was easily dealt with also the bad man reference on the chorus here is one of many tips of the hat to Joey's Jamaican roots on this record Christ conscious was another good hard-hitting single to go into this record not just for its instrumental but because of how energetic Joey seems on the instrumental and then the album kind of settles into some more easygoing cuts a lot of which are very emotional and while I really wanted tracks like number 99 to be on this record I wanted more number 99 s really going into this album it's it's really these more sentimental cuts that resonated with me because I didn't really know Joey had it in him to do songs this emotionally moving not that he hadn't moved me before but he really seems to focus on some very personal topics on these cuts I love how on the song on and on Joey sort of seems to contemplate his own mortality sort of informing his fans as to how to think of him or remember him or celebrate him after he's gone there's a line about there being heaven for us hip hoppers the Big Pun reference and wordplay that you'll hear if you give a listen to this track I thought was great I thought the mention of Joey sort of envisioning his own gravestone was a particularly sad and gripping but Joey really takes his biggest risk on the song escape 120 where he's rapping and singing over a kind of speedy break beat that reminds me of a lot of popular electronic music coming out in the 90s you sees but this track overall to me is is maybe one of the weakest on the record because the flows aren't always on tempo 100% on the song nor do I think the kind of melancholy slower singing complements the beat I just think it could have been done better lyrically and emotionally Joey is pretty dark on this track but he gets even darker on the song blackbeetles his life feels like a bad dream where he feels like he's dealing with a lot of low self-esteem and inequality and the haunting melody on this beat just sets the tone of the song perfectly and on the final two tracks on the record Joey really just sort of focuses on family especially his mom on the finishing track curry chicken which was one of the sleepier singles to build up to this record but in the context of this album it really gives the entire LP a-- just a glowing aura of down-to-earth beautiful humbleness it's a song where joey sort of talks about how his career is taking him away from his family but he sort of longs to be back with them and even though he may be successful it's all within the context of his upbringing and his mother and and everything he never loses touch of of who he is and I thought that was really pretty overall I thought this was a great LP it's consistent quality wise I thought there were a lot of great verses on here great bars some people may sort of get bored with him off the bat due to his lack of novelty he's not really trendy I think there was a point at which he was trendy a lot of people were hyped over him and not to say that there isn't hype building up to this record but I think Joey has gotten very popular thanks to his talents but it's it's not because he sort of jumps onto any bandwagons necessarily don't go into this album if you're looking for like a really catchy viral earworm or something like that you know go into this album expecting some food for thought something you're going to dig into a little deeper something that's going to stir your emotions a little bit because Joey has an incredible amount of heart and that is part of what makes this album so appealing the only major criticisms I think I have as a whole is that I think Joey could have gone a little bit further with his topics but still he's young and I hope that as he progresses his ambitions grow and the things he raps about become a little greater or wider in scope oh and some of the cuts on here specifically peace of mind were just a little too easygoing for me but that's about it I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing Tran dition what did you think of this album did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony fan tanto Joey badass forever 
c6VCmibTdZQ,hi everyone no theny asleep tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and in this video I'm going to quickly list out and talk about since we are just a few weeks into 2015 now on the on the start of a new musical year we started off with classics week we just finished off a week of reviews of new records that are going to drop or have just dropped and now we have the rest of the year ahead of us and a lot of albums to anticipate in this video I'm going to list out the album's that I'm looking forward to that I'm interested in not necessarily planning on reviewing it's gonna depend on how they sound to me once I try them out but I am intrigued I am looking forward to trying these records out I am curious about what is on these records albums that I know have been given release dates for the next few months and then after that there are a league of artists that I would like to sort of mention because I'm sort of wondering whether or not they're going to follow up something to did last year or whether or not they're just going to start up another album cycle this year so let's start with the coming week January 20th we have Brooklyn rapper Joey badass coming out with his commercial debut Lupe Fiasco another rapper coming out with an album as well hopefully coming through and actually out doing the very mediocre albums he's been dropping as of late then we have indie rock and evoke indie pop stars The Decemberists dropping very soon as well as twee indie pop baroque pop stars Belle and Sebastian dropping a new album as well so some pretty big names coming right out of the gate at the start of this year and there are some more underground records I'm looking forward to this month as well like a new LP from cheb alba heavy droney sludgy do me metal band with a lot of guts I love their last full-length LP which featured a member of Sun on it on a track and was also on Southern Lord Records further down the line we have music from napalm death coming out one of the biggest names and important names in grindcore also one of the biggest names an old-school heavy metal music venom will be dropping an album this year as well don't know if either those records are gonna you know end up actually entertaining me it's been a while since either band dry an amazing album in their catalogue in my opinion but still because of the name because of the context of the band and because of the the weight that they carry as an act you know their music is at least gonna be worth trying then once we get at the start of February sacred bones records is actually dropping an album of non soundtrack material from composer John Carpenter that's probably one of my most anticipated records of February we also have music for Montana Roberts coming out who has dropped some pretty interesting avant-garde experimental and very thematic and conceptual jazz albums as of late we also have music from indie act murder by death coming out as well as an album from title fight post-hardcore band that had a pretty nice album a little while ago and another record I'm really anticipating for the start of this month is Mount Erie's sauna Phil elrom singer songwriter producer aka the microphones aka Mount Erie is dropping a new record under the Mount Erie name this year I thought his last few records were just okay really loved wins poem the way he experimented with black metal on this record he usually works from a different angle or just a different sonic palette or concept with each record so I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with sauna coming up after that we have father John misty Jay Tillman he came out with one record a little while ago under the father John misty name but of course he has numerous solo records under his own name he used to play in Fleet Foxes really awesome folk in the act and yeah I personally don't feel like I gave his debut album under the father John misty name enough attention enough of a chance and I'm not gonna let it slip by on me on this this next one in the middle of February we also have amazing music from black metal act Leviathan coming out as well as a collaborative album between bad bad not good Canadian jazz hip hop trio and the wu-tang clan's Ghostface Killah shoegaze and noise rock act a place to bury strangers is going to be dropping an album in the middle of February as well and then coming not too soon after that is a new album from the pop group awesome post-punk act that has not dropped a record in decades so they're coming back with this new record over here we're getting another comeback album and toward the end of February we have music from thee satisfaction coming out they had a record drop not too long ago titled odd naturale that I thought was really good check them out if you're into experimental hip hop music African music neo-soul sludge metal sludge pop just general heavy rock band torch is coming out with a new record as well as screaming females if you're into just sort of gutsy ballsy strong lead guitars and your indie rock music check them out we also have new music from Gang of Four dropping this month as well from what I understand so classic post-punk act right there again they have not dropped an album that I've loved in a while but their first few albums are some of my favorites in the genre so you know just just as a fan of the group I am curious as what they're doing now and then we have a Dan Deacon electronic music composer whose new music I hadn't really cared for for a while I haven't really loved a record of his inspire man or the Rings but still curious as to what he's doing because he always seems to be trying something different as well to kick off March we have albums coming out from indie pop psychedelic pop group of Montreal we also have new music from modest mouse coming out indie rock heavyweight right there there Madonna's dropping this year metal off enslaved is dropping this year at the start of March we also have ex - racist member teams dropping a new album this year March 10th Twin Shadow is dropping a new record this year I thought it was gonna happen last year because he actually dropped a single in the middle of last year that sounded like in an arena rock - and that was a huge turnoff and I don't know if the records just been held up for whatever reason but it seems that it's finally going to get released this year from what I understand in the midst of March we are gonna see a new Bjork record as well art pop experimental pop progressive pop artists Bjork just experimental music in general she's actually going to have beats from not only the axe and cloak dark ambient artist the axe and cloak on this record but production from ARCA all over this album production from ARCA and co-production with arc on this record if you're not familiar with his work he had a full-length album drop in 2014 and he also had tons of beats on FK twig second EP and he took part on her debut full-length LP as well which was one of my favorite albums of 2014 we also have music from portico coming out formerly portico quintet it seems like at least from what I've heard of the music thus far on this record they're not really toying with jazz like they used to and they're just kind of fussing with electronic music which is fine if the music is great I'm just saying maybe expect a change of pace with this forthcoming record then we have singer-songwriter Laura Marling coming out with a record this year as well we have full croc outfit vetiver dropping an album at the end of March as well and to finish the month out Death Grips is going to be dropping the second half of the powers-that-be Jenny death along with the first half of the album on you know physical format and I believe this is going to be the release day it stays at there was a point in time when everybody believed this album was going to come out toward the beginning of February but it seems to have been pushed back toward the end of March hopefully it stays here Sufjan Stevens singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist composer should be dropping something at the end of March - as well as The Prodigy everyone remembers The Prodigy I hope so so those are the album release dates that have been sort of solidified I told to the public that I am anticipating but there are a ton of artists that I think are gonna be dropping this year that I hope we're gonna be dropping this year that I want to mention here for one Chicago rapper little herb is he gonna follow up phase ole and is he gonna put out a commercial project is he gonna continue gathering attention this year what is he doing what's the plan I want to hear new music from him because I did really like his mixtape from last year as well as fellow Chicago rapper Mick Jenkins who came out with a fantastic project last year the waters really slow watery and I would say deep both philosophically and frequency wise well tons of bass on this record just really serene mean record in my opinion except for the last track on this thing which is a total banger is he gonna put out another project this year we also have rapper clips member Pusha T is gonna be dropping a record this year that I'm looking forward to hopefully it's a little more adventurous than my name is my name post track outfit explosions in the sky is said to be back in the studio and maybe trapping an album this year black metal outfit peste Noire Kanye's Kanye West gonna come out with a new record this year hope so also Kendrick Lamar he's gonna be dropping this year as well also fellow TDE member jay rock and will his album drop this year I hope so because the parental advisory single he put out was actually pretty fantastic as much as people were hyped over the Kendrick Lamar single I I liked the parental advisory single a little bit more but because of out conceptual Kendrick tends to be I think I am anticipating his album a little bit more but regardless Action Bronson he's gonna be coming out with an album this year how's that gonna sound also black breath death and roll death metal thrash metal hardcore punk just fusion band black breath they came out with a fantastic album not too long ago that I gave a review to actually you know what hold on hold on here we go sentence to life badass freaking out love that out well well well the Sun is drone metal duo Sun gonna drop a record this year and I don't mean a collab tired of the collabs I want to hear a son record I want to hear the new phase the new era of son I want to hear what son does to follow-up monoliths and dimensions fantastic record what are they gonna do next I want to hear a son record sorry just being impatient there Macklemore what does Macklemore gonna do this year sort of top one you know he did a last year Lil Wayne as well who I'm typically not that interested in but considering all the drama with the holdup of his latest LP and now he's coming out with a sorry for the wait mixtape what what is this new record going to hold now that Birdman has kind of put his career on pause a little bit and a young thug who Birdman through Cash Money is sort of supporting now and sort of putting on everyone now what is young thug doing what is he going to do is he going to come out with a project a mixtape he's basically been handed and has gained all of this hype and and it's been pretty healthy you know the the amount of tension that he's gathered and been pretty consistent you know there hasn't been a lull in the hype surrounding young thug throughout 2014 but what is he gonna do in 2015 to sort of maintain that attention and digital oaf as well whoo I know he is a collaborated with she ended up on that Detroit vs everybody posse track as well what is she gonna do this year to you know continue to gain attention also from what I understand run the jewels might be dropping run the jewels three this year which if they could pull out a trilogy of fantastic Records one year after another that would be amazing you know props to killer Mike and LPD for the two albums they've done so far if they could top it with a third that's great within a year's time that would be really amazing Earl Sweatshirt what does Earl Sweatshirt gonna do because as far as Odd Future goes earl seems to be the only one who's really sort of worth taking seriously rap wise not that Tyler can't rap you know he is sort of a figurehead of the group but it seems like he's kind of diversified and involved himself in other projects which is totally fine if that's what he's happy with but as far as rapping goes earl is really the only person who I'm interested in and while I didn't love his last album Doris I still saw a great potential in and I still thought there were tracks on it that were great also Hudson Mohawke lunes will there be another tonight record this year what are they doing either together or solo will there be a new burial project this year I don't know well to be a new tool album this year alternative metal band progressive metal band tool a lot of people thought they were going to drop last year but are they gonna drop this year also Godspeed you black Emperor they cannot the fantastic comeback album are they going to hit are they going to strike while the iron is hot and do a follow-up record of new new new material bill bill also American black metal outfit deafheaven they had a really huge year with the album sunbathe are they going to come out with a new record this year from what I understand brand-new by be coming out with a record this year that's amazing also will Radiohead dropped something this year I would be nice to hear them come together for a new record because I don't really want to hear another Thom Yorke solo thing this year as fine too some of the tracks on those projects where I would really love to hear a Radiohead record going down the list even further ASAP Rocky ASAP ferg ASAP mob what are they doing this year I know he sat Rocky's gonna drop will ASAP ferg drop I know he put out a mixtape last year so I'm anticipating an album this year hoping it is as good or better than trap Lord also Billy woods underground New York rapper Billy woods has some fantastic projects under his belt under his own name Armand Hammer super crown flight brothers looking for an album from him this year also Danny Brown what is Danny Brown gonna do is he gonna follow up old I I think Danny Brown if he wants to maintain his popularity needs to put out something this year either him solo or something with bruiser brigade he's had a relatively silent 2014 musically anyway aside from some features and then we have YC the cynic awesome New York hip hop artist who has a fantastic record I reviewed not too long ago I've seen the light a few times awesome amazing live performing if you can catch him is he gonna do something this year then following that post-punk outfits savages one of the biggest breakout rock bands the year they drop their full-length debut album and sort of hoping for something from them this year and let's see tame impala psychedelic rock and pop group tame impala they sound a lot like the beatles are they gonna drop a record this year they had a fantastic sophomore release that i liked a lot and failure rock outfit underground rock outfit failure they should be making a comeback this year from what I understand they should be dropping an album this year looking forward to that also PJ Harvey I've heard his back in the studio dream pop outfit beach house if they want to continue holding people's attention I think they need to put out something this year one of the most significant groups new groups and dream pop music today and let's see we have Donnie trumpet and the social experiment with chance the rapper they had a really awesome single last year with Sunday candy hoping they come out with something this year a full-length project as well as chance the rapper too because while I didn't love acid rap all the way through I still think chances very progressive I think he has an original sound I think he sticks out and you know somebody who is that far outside of the norm for contemporary hip-hop I think has to have a good full length project a consistent full-length project because that was kind of my issue with acid rap just lack of consistency but there has to be a consistent great project in him somewhere also looking forward to a Chelsea wolf album this year if that happens sort of hoping she puts out something this year since it's been a little while since she put out a record and finally Frank ocean looking forward to see if Frank Ocean puts out something interesting this year I did like channel orange didn't love it but Frank is another person who I think if he continues to push his singing chops and just adventures a little bit more can put out a really fantastic project and those are essentially what I'm hoping happens in this year a lot of guests work there but I'm hoping a lot of that happens this year the first half of the video like I said you know there are release dates behind a lot of those records and even if those release dates change those records have been promised at some point but you know everything I've just mentioned either you know has been sort of mentioned in passing or oh yeah I will put out a record at some point this year or I'm just kind of crossing my fingers hoping so you know what are you looking forward to this year as far as musical releases what artists are you hoping put out records and yeah that's it you're the best transition I love you see you soon forever 
ONikj9CXwrQ,haha hi everyone Nance theny grace tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Marilyn Manson record the pale emperor infamous alt rock and alt metal industrial rock singer and frontman Marilyn Manson known for better or for worse for his controversial look music videos lyrics which frightened many a Christian soccer mom in the 90s and 2000's his ability to instigate the public and challenge the long-held political and religious traditions of mainstream America made him one of the most hated figures in modern music this mostly occurred around the very popular trilogy of albums and Manson's discography Antichrist Superstar mechanical animals in my personal favorite Hollywood however my fandom of Manson's music of Manson as a public figure kind of stops there as I mentioned in my review of his previous record born villain and I got a pretty interesting response to my review of this record a long written or typed response from YouTube's very own amazing atheist Wow and in this review TJ categorized me as a Manson fan who only really favors his older more popular works and that's accurate regardless of your feelings on TJ whether or not you know him because I know you can be kind of controversial he did eloquently explain why he still finds this post trilogy era of Manson's career to be compelling citing that Manson is very well aware of the fact that he's been dethroned as America's shock Rock pariah and he has responded to that very cleverly with singles like Saint and no I didn't really give Manson enough credit for messages like that as I glossed over records like high end of the low as for the nods to dadaism on records like Golden Age of grotesque while I know Manson is no philosophical or historical slouch I've always seen him as more of a pop artist than an avant-gardist even with his ability to go against the social grain and get a rise out of people which is not a jab because it's the accessibility of his music that I think made his message so viral and resonate with so many people and made him infinitely more relevant than so many artists out there who were equally as critical to the very same norms and ideas that he was but were more abrasive and experimental I like that Manson took these occults and morbid and dark and rebellious and sometimes anti theist themes and threw them on to really catchy good well produced high performing rock music on the Golden Age of grotesque though I didn't really feel like this record was as raw as the previous material that I came to love and that was due to a multitude of issues including Twiggy Ramirez departing from the band for a little while this record in the few that followed it also marked a loss of identity and purpose for Manson which also made me feel like kind of turning a deaf ear and the low-budget production and the kind of weak songwriting on born villain justified that choice however now that Marilyn Manson and his band have switched over to Cooking Vinyl they're going to drop a second record on that label and they dropped the first single from it late last year and it really caught my ear in a big way it was just a really good tune full dreary single third day of a seven-day binge this song features a steadier mellower manson who also sounds kind of overcome with depression and the theme of this song the just soul-crushing excess that he seems to be going through and the fact that he is so tired and so weary in the midst of this journey and he's not even at the halfway point just barely there there's a very dreary guitar chord progression on this track to the instrumentation is all pretty reserved except for the wailing guitars toward the end of the track and marilyn manson who as the song goes along it's more and more intense his howling vocal performance really takes the song over the top and I think vocally he's kind of a thrill to listen to again thanks to tracks like this I think the overall sound of this record is a little more intimate the deluxe version of this record even features three acoustic versions of tracks in the original track listing that all sound pretty good like the track third day there are other cuts on here that are similarly skeletal brooding and slow burning like the song killing strangers that opens the record up or the song warship my wreck which even though the title of this track does make me just cringe ever so slightly the instrumental here is so twisted and pressing there are some cuts in the track listing here that take on a bit of a rock and roll or a western vibe a lot like Cupid carries a gun which is kind of a tainted love s dark love song like the romantic relationship you're having is a kind of dangerous maybe because the the person you're in love with is a bit of a disturbed individual there's even one track Birds of Hell awaiting that takes on a bit of a blues vibe and Manson and his band as they step over this genre line they blur it a little bit by bringing their own style to it but still the band's take on this style is so amateurish I wish they didn't even move in this direction especially at the very end where Manson is just going kind of insane vocally sort of doing his his own weird impersonation of what would sound like an electric blues rock band singer but kind of goth doubt and aggressive if he had a little more prowess I could see the Papa sness of the vocals here kind of going over not too bad but the end of this track is almost hilarious there might have been some people who went into this record hoping for a kind of a return to form or something like that but there are songs like mephistopheles in Los Angeles that signal that Manson is still very much in a different part of his career than he was with Antichrist Superstar because the lyrics on this track are very self centric very personal I think the only thing really familiar about this track is that Manson still finds a lot of power in religious or mythological terminology when he's picking lyrics maybe to the extent where they kind of become a little bit of a crutch where rather than spinning interesting words around these terms he kind of relies on the historical context of these words to kind of bring us meaning I'm not really impressed with the prose a lot of the time I've always considered Manson to be more of a provocateur than a poet but there are phrases on this record that do end up resonating with me like a slave who wants to be king rather than wanting to be free or how he doesn't want no motherfucker looking down on him kind of a simple sentiment but plays into that classic manson ethos he's the kind of person who would not even agree with something religious on the principle that it goes against the ideal of self-determination and control of one's outlook in life path even though this record is not as hard-hitting as previous Manson albums there are some heavy hitters in the track listing here like deep six one of my favorite tracks on this album one of Manson's best tracks and years I think even though the groove and the riff on this track is is very measured it still features vocally anyway that classic Antichrist Superstar ferocity and overall I I don't really think the pale Emperor's is that bad of an album I I think it's actually a decent album I wish it was a little bit more diverse instrumentally maybe a little bit more aggressive at points but I think straight simple dark and rock music was a pretty good vehicle for the lyrics that Manson wanted to deliver on this LP and the few instances of acoustic guitar or piano or plucked strings at the very end of this record were a nice touch there are better vocal performances I think on this record then there were on born villain but when it comes to the lyrics in this more personal era of Manson's career I don't really get that much excitement out of this record still though I do feel a genuine sense of despair coming through a lot of his singing and through these tunes as well and I think that translates very strongly even if sometimes he over does it in the singing Department and under does it in the lyric department case in point the closing track on here the imagery of angels dying in the arms of demons warrants an eye-roll or two but this track still feels like a final descent into the depression of fuels the entire record and there are other lyrics on this track that do give me a real sense of just there's no escaping the very grim fate that awaits you there's no exemptions from it I'm feeling a decent 666 on this record ann's ition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Marilyn Manson the pale emperor forever 
46jHFBgvZJ4,hi everyone no one should be killed over a drawing ever what is wrong with you here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new panda bear record panda bear meets the grim reaper panda bear is a singer-songwriter a multi-instrumentalist a producer mostly known for the very large role that he plays in the contemporary psychedelic music group Animal Collective and given the band's groundbreaking and imaginative back catalogue any solo album to come from the animal collective camp should be cause for excitement and anticipation however that has not been the case for me as of late with the several solo albums we have been handed recently 2011's tomboy from panda bear as well as AV tears solo records like down below as well as the slasher flicks record that came out last year rather than expanding the wondrous world of sound the animal collective presented to us throughout the 2000s these are recent solo releases in my opinion have only served to show us how limited this pool of ideas really is and despite having relatively positive feelings toward the mr. Noah EP that came out late last year this following album for me is another round of lesser versions of what panda bear would normally hand into an animal collective project I just cannot come to terms with how unbelievably dull some of the instrumentals on this record are like with the opening track sequential circuits a very uneventful introduction very watery manipulated sound effects hanging in the background matched with icy frigid synthesizer swells and atop this skeletal instrumental is panda bears very typical vocal harmonies ascending and descending very dispassionately clearly panda bear was not looking to set expectations very high with too much emotion or excitement there are some cuts on this record that in comparison are are lively but still don't end up being that interesting like butcher baker candlestick maker this track is mind-numbing ly redundant even though panda bear continues to work with a sound set that at least to my knowledge no other an artist does today his vocal melodies on this track are the definition of forgettable while the very simple beats and the phantom synthesizers that are so quiet and so light and so breezy that they're barely even audible and then all these inconsequential effects come into play all of these things just cycle and cycle and repeat and repeat until the song essentially becomes just sonic wallpaper it just hangs in the background and really doesn't do anything to command any sort of attention in the forefront of my mind and yet there's something just kind of guardian and slightly eccentric about it like it's it's wallpaper but it's just like not in good taste wallpaper it's like a really horrid flower print I feel roughly the same on the following track boys Latin except for the fact that panda bear continues to mix his vocals Solo in his music that he sounds like a muffled background singer on his own song the track come to your senses hands us about the same amount of musical variants as a three-minute track on this record but for whatever reason lasts seven minutes in my opinion the first bright spot on this LP aside from mr. Noah which is a song that I still feel is relatively likable I did dig it somewhat on that mr. Noah EP but the first bright spot really is Tropic of Cancer the song is mostly harp and vocals it's very skeletal very stripped back and rather than engaging in a lot of the repetitive editing and just useless beats pana bare hands us kind of a simple ballad with a pretty Beach Boys Brian Wilson inspired vocal melody pandabear can most definitely sing and write a vocal melody but he's not much for building or progressing or arranging case in point as well the song Selfish Gene another winning vocal melody on this LP and another that has a very strong Beach Boys Brian Wilson vibe to it but the beat throbbing away very lightly and in substantially in the background is just so thin that the track feels like it's in a constant state of introduction like a burst of bass or rhythm or just other frequencies than this really bland gray mid-range or about to just rush in and fill the song out and actually make it feel like a kaleidoscopic display of color that doesn't happen though this is just another instance of an instrumental on this record that teases toward an ascension that never really comes same with the track lonely wanderer whose title actually lives up to the way the song is composed with a kind of sloppily chopped up piano sample that cycles again and again and again panda bear delivers his typical vocals over that and the song never really finds its direction or point of captivation it's just nothingness and navel-gazing the album also features a pretty uneventful closer that doesn't hold any more significance musically than any other track here and I have to say overall I think this is the most disappointing collection of songs panda bear has handed us thus far all these recent animal collective records in my opinion have really just been supplemental something for hardcore fans who just kind of want to peek behind the curtain and sort of hear what Animal Collective does in a really basic element in order to get a better grip on how the band's studio magic comes together so regardless of why you like listening to panda bear I don't really care for this LP I think the instrumentals just don't really have much meat on them and get very boring very fast the vocal melodies aren't really that fantastic throughout the LP though there are some bright spots here the lyrics are pretty simple though I do draw some abstract meanings out of a few of them it's not like they're so dense that they actually make up for the very bare instrumentals and melodies and just as a whole the record a lot like tomboy is is mixed to the point where just everything is just drowning everything else out and nothing really just sounds that I guess vivid or interesting I'm feeling a strong for no no any No why you got to do that why you got to do that to Panera bear my favorite spare metal music man transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Animal Collective panda bear panda bear means the grim reaper forever 
O-U2u1zZEeo,hi everyone Claude Van Damme oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sleater-kinney record no cities to love sleater-kinney is a West Coast indie and punk rock band who had a pretty good run from the 1995 release of their debut full-length LP to their breakup about ten years later and in that time especially in their 90's output they came out with a lot of model underground rock on the Kill Rock Stars label featuring singer-songwriter guitarist Korn Tucker who was a wild vocalist in the band's heyday her singing featured an insane vibrato was like listening to a vocal earthquake and behind these vocals were jagged angular guitar riffs and leads a lot of them played by Carrie Brownstein and behind these guitars where Janet Weiss's drums a very versatile drummer who complimented the fiery or sometimes glum and downtrodden songwriting the band would deliver as a band Sleater can you stuck around just long enough for indie rocks rise to semi mainstream popularity in the mid-2000s and they closed their decade-long run out with their most ambitious album yet the woods this record was heavy sonically and emotionally plus it was their most detailed winding and expressive set of songs yeah which is really saying something considering their previous material but after this album after the band's breakup they didn't leave us completely Corin tucker brought us the corn tucker band as well as other projects Janet drummed and recorded with a handful of different artists like The Shins Conor Oberst played with quasi and the very recent wild flag which also featured Carrie Brownstein who had been spending a lot of time writing for various publications and PR music of course she starred in a very popular TV show of her own creation Portlandia but now with their first LP turning 20 years old and their breakup essentially lasting just 10 years they have come back for some reason I guess just because they want to but here's another example of hey there's this 90s artist who was like super great in seminole and influence they come back yay so this return album is just ten tracks about 30 minutes long sleater-kinney is obviously not looking to overstay their return and stylistically they seem to kind of be just going back to basics stripping away some of the long-winded experimentation from their last full-length LP even though in a sense that might seem a little regressive sleater-kinney doesn't really come through feeling like they are trying to pull together a throwback here or that they're trying to relive the past and that's because the songwriting on this LP is sort of sophisticated the mix feels very modern clean clear punchy the songwriting is pretty detailed and I think the lyrics for the most part are pretty self-aware and and timely for a band that is as old as sleater-kinney is for a band that is making their comeback with this record I think it's safe to say that indie rock as a movement was more exciting when sleater-kinney broke up then it is now upon their return the genre is no longer as volatile as it used to be now it's established and it's a little more calculated despite that though sleater-kinney has no lack of enthusiasm on this record they serve up a set of really good songs and performances some great guitar work on some of these tracks Tucker's vocals ours over the top as ever and as I said before I have to give it to the lyrics on this LP two for one the opening on this album price tag great start catchy riffs nice groove on this track really thunderous vocals lyrically we see Tucker kind of addressing the everyday nine-to-five rat race money the system that we're living in capitalism in a sense and the song needs a really chaotic end with layers of just wailing noisy guitars the title track on here is my favorite cut on the entire record really killer chorus Sade's de la I think lyrically this track is really smart at least the way I interpreted it it feels like what's being addressed is the way people fetishize places cities I really want to live here and how in in a sense it's just another place like any other place and the song also gets down to what people might actually love about where they live whether it be the whether or the people other tracks like bury our friends and a new wave sort of address where the band is right now status wise or artistically or where they sort of see the artistic community that they they thrived in at especially with a new way where the band delivers one of my favorite lyrics on the entire LP inventing our own kind of obscurity really great dance groove on the verses on this track the song has really peppy start peppier than any other song on the record I think sleater-kinney sounds really happy to be back this is really upbeat record which is a real emotional change of pace from the woods and there's the song hey darling - which makes a very direct statement about fame saying that it leads to mediocrity which again points to that whole self-awareness thing and sleater-kinney seems to be doing their best to avoid it but I don't think trying always leads to success here for one the song fangless yeah little a little fangless while one of the lead singles off of this thing's surface NB seems a little too eager to write and deliver a fist pumping sing-along rock chorus then the closing track on yours feels typically slow and heavy sort of going for a sadder emotional outburst but it's it's slower pace doesn't really seem that significant in comparison with the other tracks and and leaves the LP feeling a little one-dimensional still I did come out liking a great deal of this album it's it's full of standout tracks and moments but I wasn't really blown away by it as a whole there's not really anything about how these songs come together that that really gets me excited but sleater-kinney has shown themselves to still be a very capable band I guess it's just a matter of whether or not they want to keep it going and continue to put our records into the future I'm feeling a light decent 7 on this thing Tran dition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Santana sleater-kinney no cities to love it's a good song forever 
nwy-MpYk9Z4,hi everyone watch the box Shanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the self-titled Vietcong album the life spans of some musical groups are cut tragically short sometimes before the group even reaches their full potential personally this might have been the case from one of my favorite bands to come out of Canada in the 2000s women over the course of their relatively short lifespan the band put out just a couple albums and very early on had the support of multi-instrumentalist producer and singer-songwriter Chad van Galen the band had a super haunting lo-fi sound very brittle xx start guitars pummeling drums the treble on their records is just so sharp and loud very distant cavernous vocals soaked in reverb and there was a variety of different rock influences flowing throughout their music - art rock acts like The Velvet Underground post-punk acts like Joy Division as well as noise rock psychedelic rock garage a lot of their songs especially on their sophomore LP public strain were very catchy but also weird and subversive too loaded with just jerky rhythms and grooves and the occasional odd time signature as well unfortunately the band's progress was cut short by a sudden breakup there were a lot of rumors of band tension and infighting and not too long after the breakup was the very sudden passing of former women guitarist Chris reamer now within a year of the band breaking up to members of women Matt flagel and Mike Wallace formed Viet Cong along with Scott Munroe and Daniel Christensen both on guitars and now in the beginning of 2015 we have Viet Cong returning to the label that women was on jag jag you are and they now have given us the self-titled LP with a few singles teasing up to the release of this thing and even though Viet Cong is a different band this album kind of sounds like Mike and Matt are taking things from where women left off they are pulling from pretty much the same stylistic influence and sonically they deliver much the same production style as well maybe just a tad clearer than what women was doing on their last full length LP but still very low fie chaotic haunting and Matthews vocal style and Vietcong isn't really all that much different from what we've been handed before on women records with maybe the exception of the very fevered tense vibrato that his vocals brings sometimes that kind of remind me of Spencer Krug of Wolf Parade or sunset rub down Fame so the sound of women remains kind of unchanged and really intact in the face of time passing by and a new band lineup and while it does lead to a kind of a lack of surprise part of me is happy that this sound is continuing in a world where tons of bands are addicted to reverb and kind of fall back lazily on to lo-fi recordings and sort of use these as an excuse to make really bland background noise rock music here instead we have a group that is actually using these effects and techniques to create something that's very emotionally stirring and detailed so even though I am glad that via conga is kind of carrying the torch and they have progressed in some ways there are some pretty prominent synthesizers on this album which occasionally are glistening beautiful very glossy and I see it has very nice contrast to some of the harsher more distorted moments on this record I would say in comparison Vietcong are definitely a sweeter hooky er poppier band than women but in some ways it still does kind of feel like I'm listening to a band that's that has experience but has also hit the reset button as well for one this is a pretty short release we've got seven tracks here they run about 37 minutes and the lead single off this thing continental shelf is actually pretty fantastic we get a 60 style vocal pop drumbeat ding-ding-ding Shh wailing distorted guitars hanging in the background creating this wall of chaos against a pretty nice easygoing bassline the course features a galloping beat that I loved a lot there are some kind of uneasy weird vocals at the start of this track that intensifies the song progresses I love how in the pre-chorus the vocals just really start just yelling shouting out passionately and there are some pretty heavenly harmonies that enter right after this point in the track is well just very chilling it sound like something out of a horror movie but in comparison with a lot of the nastier instrumentation in the background it's a pretty sweet it sounds like a ray of Sonic light beaming through this instrumental even though there are some very catchy moments on this new LP the album itself does kick off with a very noisy abrasive start the track newspaper spoons features some of the nastiest guitars on the entire record and it doesn't really feel like that well-developed of a song it feels like more of an intro just kind of a mission statement a sonic mission statement sort of let you know what you were in for this track glides into the relatively sweeter pointless experience which is one of the few songs on this record whose story lyrically is is kind of apparent where I feel like Matt flagel is actually saying about the pointlessness of life and there's kind of a sentiment in the lyrics here of hey let's just get it over already and even though I like this tune it does feature an instrumental that would fit really snugly on women's public strain it actually sounds like it pulls some guitar ideas and some grooves from that album same with the song bunker-buster even though there are a lot of characteristics about this track that I like as well I think this song too carries some pretty intelligible lyrics I'm picking up some war themes on this track there's a nice key change here to a very harmonious guitar passage that contrasts some of the nastier points on this track and you know there's a different vocal approach going on here just the instrumental itself is just giving me more deja vu from public strain and the closing track death the longest track on here at 11 minutes builds into this really nasty tense groove that gets louder and noisier as it continues and then as it seems like it's at its breaking point the song they're suddenly transitions into just a really clear Rock instrumental just for a third phase of the song it's a really nice move and a move that tells me that beyond the existence of women these guys do have a lot of creative ideas overall I really like more than how for the songs on this record I think the production is interesting I still have the recording style that these guys put together I also think the playing on this record as well they sound very cohesive and just well-oiled as a band itself but as I mentioned earlier these moments of deja vu these spots in the instrumentals on this record that just feel all too familiar for me as a women fan even if for whatever reason women remained a band and have the exact same lineup and name up until this point there are some tracks I could see on this record just not enjoying because they just feel like the band is treading water regardless I think Viet Cong has a lot going for them right now they are currently riding on quite a bit of potential I think and this new record of theirs offers at least several great songs I'm feeling needy such a strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Vietcong forever 
LPoDXPVw2xA,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the first album review of 2015 Death Grips fashion week Death Grips West Coast California experimental hip hop trio one of the most mysterious bands existing today and they have come through the new project here an instrumental album and it arrives at a pretty peculiar time in the group's career from 2011 to 2012 Death Grips had an immense winning streak with their debut breakout mixtape their commercial peak with the Money Store and then the violent break away from their record label Epic Records with the sudden self release of the album no love Deep Web then the band followed up that record in 2013 with government plates their shortest released so far aside from the EP they debuted with in 2011 and maybe the most disappointing release in their discography at that point for me because while the first half did have some of their best material on it the second half songs felt a little redundant in my opinion but I still got it anyway in 2014 the band got me excited once again with the announcement of a new double album the title being the powers that be and they saw fit to release the first half of it on its own I reviewed it earlier last year and there were a lot of things about this record that made a stick out in the Death Grips discography for one Bjork recorded original vocals for this record which Death Grips sample all over this album and sort of use this vocal cut is like an instrument a lot of the songs on this project following pretty linear structure not much in the way of repetition sometimes all the tracks segue into one another very fluidly and there are a lot of very noisy jarring sound effects all over this LP this is definitely one of Death Grips most tangled albums so far very synthetic very digital however 2014 finished out with no appearance of the second half of the powers-that-be Jenny death death death but what they did give us in 2014 was a breakup notice scrawled on a napkin and then posted via a picture on to Facebook however the group still said Jenny death was on the way but didn't really give us a clear answer as to when that was and so as a result impatient fans started typing in all caps all over the Internet Jenny death when but this past December Death Grips rose from the abyss to drop one of the most intense noisy and kind of catchy singles they put out in a very long time inanimate sensation so in a sense Jenny death at least felt closer at this point but this music video gave Death Grips fans another reason to be excited because it drew attention toward a twitter account a Death Grips Twitter account that most fans assumed was fake because it seemed to rise out of the ether when the band had demolished it's official verified Twitter account which happened months and months and months ago at this point but this particular Twitter account had a screenshot from the inanimate sensation video which was posted back in August months before December not only that but there's a recent post on this Twitter account of the two giant inflatable pills which have appeared at numerous death-grip shows and this image was shown in the cover art to the money store artwork and interestingly enough on this very same Twitter account it is said that people think we're broken up but we're really not and we're going to go on to her so if Death Grips actually went on tour and they came back together as a band and assembled post this weird breakup thing I wouldn't be too surprised because they have screwed with their fans in the music industry in the past with the way they broke away from their record label releasing numerous albums out of the blue online being complete no shows as scheduled concerts and sending their fans on completely wild goose chases online even this new project of theirs as reported by chart attack they said that at least a version of Fashion Week had been sitting on Reddit for about four months without anybody really realizing it had been Death Grips or with many people sort of casting it off as just being another person faking pretending to be Death Grips and trying to get their music heard but Death Grips did share a zip of it on their website and have posted all the songs from this record on their YouTube and the track titles are as well and tell another story each one of them being titled something like runway J runway II you know after the whole Fashion Week thing but these letters spell out the phrase Jenny death when and I guess the answer that would be Fashion Week because if you go look online and look up when Fashion Week is at least the New York Fashion Week event coming up is in the second week of February and there have been some credible sources including record stores that have said that the second half of the powers that be or at least the powers that be as a whole project will be completed on February 10th when this album releases now as unpredictable as Death Grips can be it's hard not to see pacification as being the intention behind this record to sort of give them this project let them know when Jenny death is coming out especially since the track titles here spell out the phrase uttered by frustrated fans just waiting in the dark for when Death Grips will release their potentially final album I'm not completely sure as to whether or not the material on this project is new or is it old but there are a lot of similarities between some of the synth Tambor's and the drum Tambor's here I wouldn't be all that surprised if I were to find out that much of the material here was conceived in the same session or creative period fashion week is pretty much a group of interesting beats a lot of which feature verse chorus verse structures occasionally there's a bridge here but for the most part the first half of each track mirrors the second half of each track there are portions that feel like they were just cut and paste from earlier portions and this was the case of some of the tracks on government plates but instead of feeling incessant or kind of obnoxious some of the songs here feel just a little limp like where are we going with this especially some of the toned down more ethereal cuts here even though Death Grips continues to push sonic boundaries and just try new things on this new album rides vocals for me continue to be a selling point for the band so when I hear his role at least in that regard kind of diminished on a Death Grips project it just becomes an overall less exciting experience for me still there are plenty of highlights in the track staying here though like with the song runway II the second runway II which has these squelched pulsating rhythmic synth lines with some very jittery percussion hanging on the background or the first runway II which has all these just stuttering noisy dubstep like synth lines or the first runway n or runway H which feature these bright synthesizers and guitars on runway H that just seems so sweet and so sugary that they're almost inappropriate for a death grip song and these tracks actually kind of sound like something that that battles would do on one of their two LPs except just maybe a little more skeletal strip back and simplified there's the second runway n which feels like a slow sludgy heavy synthetic and electronic piece of 90s grunge like this is something Kurt Cobain could be singing very comfortably over it's so mid-paced it's so depressing the bass e distorted synths on this track just feel like they're coming from a guitar and I love it sounds like glockenspiel samples on runway W and then they are pitched down to these very deep metallic resonant rhythmic melodies and runway a there's something about this track that just the brake beats in the background and the siren like synthesizers that are very dissonant all over this track even though I wish it were a little heavier just wish it wasn't as lightweight there's something about this track that just makes me want to compare it to 90's IDM or jungle even though they're not directly making that style of music it just seems like a really big influence here as much as I like most of the tracks here there's not really a single track that I hate there is just kind of an element of this doesn't feel totally finished finished finished or if there were vocals here I just have a feeling they would have layered more details into these beats or they would have you know cut out certain parts added certain parts made the second verse of each one just feel just the least bit different from the first there are some tracks here that are pretty brief maybe some songs were just composed so that they would have enough letters to spell out the phrase Jenny death when I don't know I think overall this served its purpose and I look forward very excitedly to the release of Jenny and occasionally I could see myself returning to a lot of the instrumentals here though I do hope that none of them really turn up on Jenny death because even if I do end up enjoying that record when it is finally released I I think if bulk of the instrumentals landed on this record it would kind of spoil a lot of the surprise I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this LP transition if you've given the salma listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh Death Grips Jenny death forever 
DrhFxbWuW_M,uh hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a final update where I'm basically going to talk about the latest records to make it into my collection over here however in this vinyl update we'll be talking about vinyl and some things that are not very much vinyl but still I do want to talk about them and mention them in this video so let's get started first off I've got a vinyl copy and exclusive pressing a limited pressing of the new perfume genius record tube right um you know just open up the plastic over here didn't slip it out of the plastic this printing are pressing of the record actually came from the people at vinyl me please who are sponsoring this video I reviewed this LP earlier this year as you may already know it turned up on my favorite albums of 2014 list if you are looking for some art pop some singer-songwriter music that is incredibly dreary heartbroken and piano led then look up this album really nice inner sleeve here with the lyrics printed very tiny on there and I believe this is a this pressing as an exclusive color kind of like a very milky Daisy white on there sort of an off-white and eggshell shade and and yeah and I believe this came with a little piece of 12-inch like a little 12 by 12 extra piece of art with just the vinyl me pressing yeah they it's it's sort of a a vinyl the Month Club and you know with every month you know you get a record of their choosing and it could usually comes with a twelve by twelve piece of art and the pressing is usually special in some way either that it's a limited or there's a crazy label or crazy color or something but yeah Matador Records and a vinyl e please got together for this limited pressing of this perfume genius record so there you go that's first coming up after that pop album of the year favorite pop album of the year Arial pink pom-pom gatefold also yeah I just the there's all sorts of crazy funny drawings of like each you know with the track titles as well as the the lyrics sort of scrawled out across this little little gate fold over here um simple straightforward black sleeves on the on the records themselves black records red labeling red labeling and the vinyl itself sounds nice I was over a friend of Mines the the other night and played a few cuts off of this and I've played at least half the record my cell phone on my table and it sounds good sounds good again one of my top 10 favorite albums of of 2014 and yeah alright again pop pop album of the year right there in my opinion this next one comes with a letter hello Senor fantazmo you are receiving a vinyl copy of the experimental hip hop group Dalek album from filthy tongue of gods and griots I hope you enjoy and also check out their other works as well love your videos I apologize about the crease in one corner its how the record originally came best regards Kenny s Thank You Kenny for sending me this vinyl copy of this Dalek record I've been giving it a listen if if you're if you profess to be a hardcore abstract hip-hop fan you're gonna want to give this thing a listen not that I was that impressed with MC Daleks rapping and and lyricism I was much more impressed with the production on this record that's really where I felt my ears gravitating for the majority of this LP really grimy experimental beats all over this album and I believe one of the only hip-hop groups or artists to sign it ipecac records you know who have I believe hosted projects from Mike Patton Melvin's have been on there a lot of experimental music on typical records so if you're not familiar with that label and you are into a experimental rock and pop and just you know just generally strange music look the label up but again you know if you if you professor yo big abstract and industrial hip-hop fan look this album up as well as the album they came out with after this one not the collaborative record with Faust though I do believe these guys are one of the only hip-hop outfits who can our duo's who can uh you know sort of profess to or brag you know have bragging rights to have a collaborative record with one of the greatest bands in german with the german experimental rock alright little death metal little death metal on this one i believe this is a reissue sauna relapse records death leprosy one of the most brutal earliest death metal records out there fantastic record I haven't listened to this album as much as I have deaths other works which is why I picked it up and um it was just as heavy and as gruesome as I would anticipate I was just really solid heavy own there's download card in here yeah there you go nice and it is a reissue but the reissue itself is really nice the the logo is nice and big and sort of seems to have like a bit of a sheen on it it's it's not like there's a foil print on here or anything but there's something about you know sort of the gold parts on the cover itself as sort of a really pop and that's also the case for the labeling on the record itself sort of brown and gold and you know sort of burnt orange over here in the blue and silver on the other side over here and again it's a very heavy record blazing solos the vocals are so guttural they're so brutal it's just a heavy hard-hitting bad-ass death metal record and if you're getting into the genre I've said this numerous times before if you're getting into death metal you can't really go bad with death you can't really go wrong with death can't really go wrong with a like morbid Angels first to help them either but you can't really go wrong with death and after listening to this LP I have to I have to recommend this album to all right let's keep going alright this one a record not in here because it's on the table right now but I just got this record for uh from my significant other Miles Davis on the corner jazz music right here but this album is in the 70s this is when it came out it's in the midst of Miles Davis's avant-garde jazz rock jazz fusion era so there are rock influences on this LP there are jazz there are funk influences on this LP especially funk this album is incredibly funky I can't say the songwriting in my opinion is absolutely amazing as it has been on previous miles records but the jams are certainly good and it's it's nice to hear Miles sort of embrace the funk sound so wholeheartedly it really seems like he didn't hold anything back on this album and really just wanted to emulate that sound and you know just really bring some good solos to and some good improv 's and some great kinetic energy between him the guest musicians on this record but uh yeah you know another gatefold I love a good gatefold just some good performances on here really fiery playing so if you're looking for some jazz funk on the corner can't go wrong all right moving on crashes us this is stations of the crafts is their second full-length album coming after feeding the 5000 been giving this one a listen though it does have my though it does have some of my favorite craft songs on this record and keep in mind this is like some really gruff noisy occasionally incoherent anarcho-punk from the UK in the seventies though this record does have some of my favorite craft songs on it like walls and I think it's - I think it's just a trick oh yeah yeah sorry I didn't find this album to be as fantastic as their debut in terms of you know just like one awesome song subject hitting you after another this record to me a lot of the song just kind of bled together just felt a little Sammy Sammy I suppose and it's it's their next album penis envy where it seems like they're really seem to break out and experiment with you know a different vocalist and different song topics and a different point of view altogether on that album and then there's a Christ the album where they really seem to experiment pretty boldly so this album to me is uh it's it's okay but I'm a fan of crass so I don't really mind owning it and and like I said earlier it does have some of my favorite crap songs on it and one thing I really like about these crafts reissues of these records is let me see it seems like you got a double LP over here yeah we got a double LP over here okay okay okay okay I actually need to double check and see if because this is a relatively short album I don't believe this album has so much on it that it warrants to LPS I need to actually see if there's anything like special or crazy on the second LP because there may in fact maybe because I had that has been the case with a few other crass really issues I believe but one thing I do love about these three issues is just the inserts they pair them with are just so epic it was grim and you know just tons of lyrics printed out scrawls interesting picture collages this I believe was some original art that came with the record back in the day but it was sort of like some of these might have ended up on the cover yeah this is like some heavy some dark heavy but uh but yeah if you're looking to get into some pretty gruesome grim and very nasty unforgiving punk music I recommend crass feeding in the 5000 penis envy and you know who's to say you couldn't like this album either so there you go crafts stations of the crass let's pop this back in there on camera just cuz oh yeah here we go here we go we're doing it we're gonna succeed we need done did it I think I'll fix that later alright got this for Christmas to Outkast ATLiens Atle ends a tail ends excuse me this is their sophomore full-length LP southern hip hop duo big boy Andre 3000 there's some really smooth funky stuff this is their second full-length album like I might have said earlier doesn't feel quite as developed as a criminai that would come out not too long after this album but you know there's some great emceeing on here some thoughtful lyrics and some really Airy ethereal just um for its time I would say sort of otherworldly and kind of mystical instrumentals again smooth funky smokey I would also describe this album as it's it's very apparent and clear how groups like this have influenced artists like Big KRIT and even people like Kendrick Lamar too so yeah there's some there's some fantastic tracks on this thing so let's move on great hip-hop album we're gonna go into Tim Hecker over here harmony and ultraviolet yep there we go I am essentially one step closer to completing the whole Tim Hecker discography in my collection between a handful of CDs and LPS I have only maybe a few more records to go for I own every single Tim Hecker record so yeah if you're looking for some very interesting textured and gorgeous ambient music with a lot of personalities something that can sort of hang in the background and really create a strong mood but is also pretty yeah sorry it's also pretty appropriate for foreground listening as well give a listen to harmony and ultraviolet definitely one of the better records he put out before he seemed to really transcend the ambient genre with records like rave death and as you may know I really love his latest full-length LP virgins but here's another great one from Tim Hecker some more awesome a ambient music over here harmony and ultraviolet again and I guess I just kind of pull this out of another gate fold over here though you know not the most amazing gay father I've ever laid my eyes upon but uh yeah you know we get a little a little bit of a some liner notes over here yeah and as far as the sleeves go you know nothing too amazing very minimal and packaging here with a nice color palette I would say the the packaging itself lends itself to how moody the music is so there we go Tim Hecker and finally finally you know as far as the vinyls in this thing I got a wall yeah I have a copy of Death Grips government plates don't get angry don't get pissed off at me don't be like listen like I said my review they're some of the tracks on this record especially on the first half some of Death Grips best stuff but in the latter half of the record don't really care for a lot of the tracks quite as much but you know I have all the records so far and you know I'm just I'm invested in the progression of the group and and that's all I got to say and yeah so as some of you may already know but I will mention it here again as according to the liner notes here which came bent somebody threw it in here and just bent the liner notes inside of the the record over here according to the liner notes over here mr. Robert Pattinson of Twilight Fame played the guitar on the track birds which is a reason for living in my opinion and then we have you know some other liner notes here and we have a spaceship in the middle here casting down a light that seems to expose the face of a fetus and a cloud in a wine glass which makes absolute sense and then the record itself played it sounds good doesn't sound too bad I love how they were actually able to fit the entirety of the title you might think he loves you for your money but so on and so forth Death Grips longest song title yet and the most important thing as you may already know in the entire vinyl package here of this record is an honest-to-god metal license plate that says CA exempt death which a lot of people were theorizing that this little serial number over here 14 H 1224 was giving some kind of clue as to when jenni death be second half of Death Grips yet to be completed double album was going to come out though that actually didn't ended up that actually didn't end up happening and it seems that now the album is going to be completed somewhere around Fashion Week because that was the title of this new instrumental album from Death Grips that dropped out of nowhere alright so you know which which a lot of people have been asking me to review and I will be listening to it I will be listening to it I will be putting ears on it and yeah that is it for the vinyl portion of this section of the video and now we're gonna get into a few more things before we head out first another fan sent me some more music though it is on CD let me give him a name check right here he's rubbing a note Nico mr. Nico over here you wrote this to me on graph paper which I like it's my favourite piece of it's my favorite kind of paper to read words off of I'm Nico a fan I just wanted to wish you a Happy Birthday and show you my gratitude by giving you this record the Holy Bible it's a 1994 classic I'm not sure if you know it since you haven't talked about it before as far as I remember so on and so forth Nico thank you very much for passing in this CD copy of the Manic Street Preachers the Holy Bible I will be giving this a listen acclimating myself with this record and seeing what all the hubbub is about if anybody down there in the comments has some strong opinions on this record leave them in the comments and you know maybe uh facilitate some kind of discussion over this record and you know sort of enlighten me and let me know I'm about to get into ok and let me see a few more things a few more things this was passed to me by my good buddies over at everything is terrible everything is terrible is one of my favorite websites on the internet right now and they've been so for a while you guys might have seen me wearing the so old school everything is terrible t-shirt a while back in some of the older videos like um I think it was one of the first t-shirts they ever put out and essentially what they do is they find insane videos on VHS they may be how-to videos or internet computer videos or like Christian instructional videos or something like that and you know they make weird mashups and sometimes just simply show the video for the insanity and you know dated a nostalgic hilarity that it is and displays and every once in a while they come out with a DVD and this one right here is on my favorite so there so far though I'm not too crazy about the flip side it's sort of like a bad stand-up comedy compilation I'm really happy I live in a world where most of the people in this compilation are no longer funny but on the a side of this DVD over here we have a mashup a continuous visual video mashup of some of the worst moments in hip-hop history in the 80s and 90s I think with hindsight we readily recognize some of the best moments of hip-hop music during the Golden Age and during the 90s for what they are and you know for how amazing they are but this DVD essentially exposes the dark side of that the commercialism the Christian hip-hop videos the you know hip-hop psays like books check Mau books check Mau you know stuff like that and it's just all strung together in this continuous you know just the beat I guess so it's like this one long non-stop terrible hip hop song that is constantly trying to either get you to be aware of some kind of safety issue or sell you something or you know just generally sounding very dorky and and and horrible so yeah everything is terrible getting a bad rap so you know if you want a kind of hilarious piece of hip-hop history just pulled together into a tapestry of cringe look into this DVD I'm sure there's somewhere online I can throw in the description box where you can see a trailer for this thing but yeah you know as I was watching this with my significant other and we got a  kick out of it but I own every single DVD they put out before this so this type of humor really is in my my wheelhouse but you know check out everything is terrible for yourself if it's funny to you and you are a big hip-hop fan I think you're going to enjoy that DVD and then finally as you guys know I like weird t-shirts and I like to pick up you know just like weird prints of t-shirts so this one is a print made by a past friend of mine Dana Merced who had done a plenty of art for the show but this next one comes from a YouTube channel that I believe is currently down due to hosting a lot of content that I think people found just generally offensive I don't think a lot of people really quite understand and wince very quickly at their sense of humor though I don't think they're hilarious all the time I I do like dark humor I do like offensive humor and you know with with the understanding that you know it's you're just there to kind of shock and just be in bad taste the fact that it is in bad taste is part of what is so funny about you know that type of humor in my opinion and one of the dudes sent me this shirt which is maybe one of the ugliest shirts I've ever seen in my life a million dollar extreme is the name of the YouTube channel aka MDE and this shirt it's like all like glitter print it's like glitter and the everything is on this shirt there's like a bomb looking thing or something I can't quite figure that out it's just like a just a weird face with just like teeth missing you you don't even know there's also not not make sound or something a fist that says cool on the knuckles this is a weird face over here there's a weird face like with a mullet or something I think about bad stuff a lot I don't don't like myself I'm a mess please help me I think I think making this shirt is kind of a cry for help and I think wearing this shirt is a cry for help as well like this is a weird dog with a long tongue or something and the tongue comes out and makes a thumbs up I don't know if you you could see that I don't know if you could see that I can barely make it out myself and I'm looking at the shirt there's a dog paw right there so yeah this is this is a really unique piece this is like a piece of art right here on a shirt and the inside is kind of sticky so I don't I don't know I'm gonna do with that I might just throw that in a frame at some point and yeah that's it I will leave a link down there in the description box to where you can look at their Facebook where I believe they're posting and updating information about how you may be able to help them get their channel back and convince YouTube to I guess sort of reinstated I'm not fully sort of aware or understanding as to why it all came down and why YouTube decided to take it down but I know at least from what I had seen when the channel was up I thought it was funny and you know I thought it had its moments so yeah I'm always sort of disappointed in when stuff gets taken down just because some people find it offensive which a lot of the time what makes for offensive content is pretty subjective and I personally believe that you know something offends you then go look at or watch something else I mean there are plenty of things that offend me and what I don't want to deal with them and what I don't want to see them I don't watch it it doesn't necessarily mean that uh you know other people shouldn't watch it it just means that it's not for me and I'm not into it so I'm gonna avoid it because there are plenty of other things to listen to watch or pay attention to so yeah cool cool Anthony Fantana vinyl update forever 
TcJeD5RqoJM,
DsI6j_egLdo,Babu Babu hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our final installation of classics week wait a second does that mean you're not gonna review the Radiohead kid a and this B I have escaped the kid a for another minster Roland Kirk I talked with the spirits Roland Kirk is a multi-instrumentalist a jazz composer and one of the genres true anomalies and original artists unfortunately for much of his life he was not in the the best of health he succumbed to blindness at a very early age and he passed away in 1975 due to a stroke and a stroke he had a few years prior had left him partially paralyzed and early on in his music career Kirk was met with misunderstanding as well musicians and music listeners alike had sort of cast him off as a gimmick for the fact that he would play numerous reed instruments at once you can't see images of this on the covers of his earliest records and of course over the years he has amassed quite a few recordings audio recordings of him performing this way and there's video of it too doing this would allow Kirk to play double solos harmonize with the theme melody he might have been playing create a counterpoint to that theme melody or even play chords and he would not just do this with saxophones though but numerous reed and wind instruments one of which was a really weird tiny nose flute there were whistles some of these instruments were actually of his own design a lack of personal boundaries allowed Kirk to explore some very unconventional sounds in his live performances and in his records but simultaneously he also wasn't afraid to embrace more conventional ideas from classical music pop music and pre-war jazz but mostly he kept up with his contemporaries as a fierce pop jazz soloist and bandleader tragically Kirk didn't really appear on many other records other than his own there are loads of jazz players that are half his salt that have appeared on hundreds of LPS but the very short series of collaborations and connections the Kirk did make were pretty significant he played in recordings with Charles Mingus drummer Roy Haynes and bandleader composer infamous producer Quincy Jones you actually might have heard Kirk's playing before on the opening track to Quincy Jones big band bossa nova record because this song had been popularized as the intro music to the Austin Powers film series it's groovy baby oh sure dad so Kirk most definitely had the chops and the melodic sense to play it straight but he advanced himself as an avant-gardist and an explorer and in the long run this made him very influential and admirable two artists who just a few years down the road had the hindsight to see his genius people like Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull however here on his 1964 album I talk with the spirits we're going to hear Kirk playing it kind of straight a little safe relatively anyway because even at his most accessible Kirk is pretty strange his bold playing style and his quirks still come through on this entirely flute centric album no saxophones none of that biz on this LP it's just a flute record jazz flute Kirk purposefully decided to forego what people categorized as gimmicks and came together with a really solid series of tracks that makes for one of the best records in his discography the LP opens up with serenade to a cuckoo an original track and one of my favorite jazz compositions of all time have you ever heard a melody dance nimbly the melody on this track is so playful it's whimsical it just trots around so charismatic leading this fantastic theme melody is supplemented with some gray solos and the backing instrumentation pianos drums upright bass brought by horace Parlin Michael Fleming and Walter Perkins their performances on this album are supportive that's really only how they could be described there's nothing too flashy about what's going on in the background other than that they do an amazing job of keeping up with Kirk's antics on this LP which can be tough considering how many strange directions he pulls this album in they really shadow him on this record in a wonderful way that creates dynamic performances and a lot of interplay Kirk really is the star on this record and his talents most definitely command that spotlight position from the gentle detours on the record like ruined castles where we have Kirk playing flute against a music box really beautifully and the Harmonized ascending woodwinds of the title track which are just absolutely gorgeous then we have some of the harder cuts on this thing like business ain't nothing but the Blues which is a pretty fiery Jam where Kirk sustains one of the longest notes I'm sure have been layed on to a jazz record in the 60s which he was able to deliver using a continual breathing method which him and other jazz players over the years have utilized if you're looking for a more contemporary example listen to the two recent columns Stetson records there's even a point on this track where Kirk using the keys of the flute is tapping out the notes of a solo as he interacts intimately with what sounds like a little bit of hi-hat percussion there are even moments on this record where Kirk is singing or reciting lyrics in between bursts of flute notes even with just one instrument in his hands Kirk makes so much noise even going as far as to hum as he plays the flute whether that be humming the exact melody he's playing or humming in harmony or in dissonance there's also very mild but the very charming rendition of one of my favorite jazz songs Django which was written by the pianist and bandleader of the modern jazz and there are a few charming very soothing renditions of music from the film funny girl as well as the musical lady in the dark but even at this album's most toned down moments Kirk's playing is still all very eccentric either that or mind-blowing ly gorgeous and tender overall fantastic album not a long album but some really strong cuts from beginning to end and quite a bit of diversity - I think Kirk sort of limits himself to one instrument on this album but still comes through with a variety of sounds and styles on this thing even in limitation what Kirk can do with this instrument seems almost limitless and when it comes to jazz flute albums there aren't many others that come to mind that can go toe-to-toe with this one like I don't know some Eric Dolphy or use of what teef if you're looking to get into jazz flute or just some really fantastic jazz music in general especially with the opening track on this thing give this record I'll listen plus you'll also be exposing yourself to one of music's true ingenious oddballs so yeah I love you it's been a good classics week really has you're the best transition have you given this record - listen I hope you have and I hope you have a nice day 2015 forever 
wuE3plpz5Ho,hi everyone triumphs in a car tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of a classic album because classic sweet Kate Bush is an English singer-songwriter and producer who has been dropping albums since the late 70s and has seen incredible success across the length of her career from her debut single weathering Heights which was a number-one single in the UK and dropped when Kate was still a teen - her latest full-length album fifty words for snow which was very well received and came out not too long ago kate is one of those artists whose miraculously been able to attain mainstream success while also pleasing very discerning music fans and on top of all of it crafting a distinct sound that has made her one of modern music's most praised voices her music is highly influential even today thanks to her fantastic songwriting as well as her pioneering in art pop and baroque pop and some of her greatest and most timeless ideas turn up here on her 1985 album hounds of love a record loaded with lofty and dramatic ideas but surprisingly the songs still stay very direct instantaneous visceral catchy much of the material on this record is incredibly pleasing on first listen this isn't really a record you need to sit with and repeat time and time again in order to good though more lessons do reveal more beautiful details and the lyrics and the instrumentation but this album's explosive love ability is thanks in part to the first half's immense singles Big Sky the title track running up that hill as well as cloud busting but the second half of this LP titled something else entirely the ninth wave feels like a different project entirely and what begins this suite of songs is sort of like a musical dream sequence Kate even says in the lyrics she can't be left alone with her imagination nation nations because it seems like she's haunted by lingering memories and pretty disturbing nightmares in the following tracks a lot of the songs on this half of the record are kind of stirring occasionally surreal lyrically and sonically some of the experimentation here is quite jarring and in my opinion kind of a precursor to a lot of what would occur on records from Bjork and the knife years down the road K even pulls from Celtic music on the incredibly lush jig of life so not only his hounds of love a strange diverse and beautiful record but it's also a payoff that came after an initial risk from Kate Kate's previous LP the dreaming an enjoyable album but not really her most successful commercially was the first time she tried to take on production duties all on her own some of the mixing on this record was a little odd Kate's vocals were incredibly loud on some songs and instrumentally this set of songs was a little more skeletal than her previous work less extravagant than some of the music on her previous record especially considering on that album landed songs like babushka and the song violin to another Kate Bush song I'm just head over heels for especially due to the progressive rock influence on that track which isn't too big of a surprise considering that David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was an early and huge supporter of Kate's music career so taking the experience from the Dreaming and now working with a series of engineers and fantastic session musicians one of which is her brother Kate really comes through with an undeniable hit commercially and artistically and she also makes sure to embrace the blossoming world of synth pop on this record - with some really bold hooks and very prominent keyboards on a lot of the cuts here there is more arranged instrumentation - in comparison with the dreaming this LP is so much more lush take into account all the multi-tracked vocals on the song big sky which makes that track just feel huge hounds of love really helped Kate gain that international audience that she still maintains today even with incredibly minimal touring and live performances because in the case of Kay Bush the music is really all you need running up that hill incredible opener for this record epic galloping rhythm that kicks this song off the kind of a rhythm that wouldn't be too unfamiliar to someone who was listening to new wave and synth pop a cave really does this rhythm one better with some really thunderous percussion on the hook and I love the way Kate's voice just juts into the instrumental as if she's attacking as she's singing and from what I can hear in this track she seems to be singing about two lovers one of whom the protagonist here really wishes to make a deal with God in order to have the other the significant other sort of understand our protagonists point of view what she is going through just to come to some kind of better understanding which seems like a very simple desire but the way Kate approaches the song lyrically with such poetic words and instrumentally she makes this wish seem so grand and so urgent so huge on the title track of the selfie Kate's voice just sticks out once again there's kind of a very sharp reverb as if she recorded her vocals in like a stone hallway or something she's like a vocal ray of light just shining brightly right in your face in the midst of very urgent string sections Airy sense and a very spacious expressive drumbeat but my favorite single on side a of this LP has to be cloud busting which is hands down one of the best baroque pop songs ever just some simple strings playing the chords of the song a very strict back drumbeat and vocal melody this track doesn't need much more to make it fantastic because the writing is just that good the vocal melody is so amazing Kate singing is incredibly dramatic but she doesn't take away from the the catchiness of the song by just overdoing and even while holding back her singing is still a very emotional experience and the lyrics of the song there's a real sense of anticipation the second half of this record as I said earlier really is its own beast it's a very abstract and what I interpret to be a kind of personal set of tracks starting with a very dreamy reflective intro and the following track under the ice feels like the initial entrance into the dreamscape later down the line the jig of life has some really boisterous strings I really determined drum be it's not a single but every bit as thrilling as many of the cuts on the first half I love the acoustic direction the instrumental takes on this track and Kate's singing on this song is just definition of conviction then there's the sonically disturbing waking which very few musicians and lusts Mort is one of them create sounds that to me are literally frightening and Kate Bush is one of those artists in this case the loud sound effects and the choppy weird vocals that enter into the track at one point and seem to be kind of a theme on this half of the record which might seem like another memory calling her to another part of this dream state or maybe even real-life trying to pull her out of this dream state entirely I'm not totally sure but it's you know really a weird disturbing thing other voices and singers actually play a pretty significant role on this half of the record as if K is playing the lead role in some kind of inception like musical journey one of the final tracks on this half of the record hello earth actually seems kind of musical theatre inspired with its huge group chorus and pit orchestra inspired instrumentation that kind of segues the song from one part to another and Kate unlike some other people who also try to go down this direction can give that musical theatre like presentation while also maintaining that intimate passion that you should feel with with a singer/songwriter this track really coasts down fades out and disintegrates very slowly it kind of feels like the very end of the movie on this half of the album and then the closing track the morning fog kind of feels like Kate waking up from all of these dreams with some very sensual soft vocals what sounds like some some slinky fretless bass and some violins 2k seems to be kind of frightened by what happened and talking about telling her loved ones that she loves them the song ends a little abruptly and I think that's because there's really not that much more to say it seems kind of like a Wizard of Oz Judy Garland kind of waking up from the fantasy land kind of moment and you were there and you were there and no you weren't there you weren't there at all but you were there hounds of love ninth wave really a fantastic set of songs great detail great writing incredibly catchy especially on the first half and then the second half on here a little more long-winded but Kate makes use of the space to create something really beautiful and sometimes disturbing in a few cases and no matter what sight of that she's exploring you're always going to be in for something that is loaded with immense emotion I think should give this record listen if you haven't already but if you have good on you and I hope you enjoy this album as much as me and I love you transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Kate Bush hounds of love classics week forever 
Xqg8mMorzYM,hi everyone deadly tornado here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another installment of class six week 2014 yay and in this latest review here we're going to be talking about iron maidens number of the beast iron maiden English rock band metal band one of the most infamous and celebrated bands in heavy metal ever they formed in the 70s but didn't actually release their full-length debut until 1980 which is when England began to see this new breed of heavy metal bands cropping up and a great deal of these bands were underground and stayed that way but nevertheless the sound that these bands brought to the table was pretty pivotal to metals progression in this decade not too long ago in the 70s bands like deep purple and Black Sabbath had given metal a pretty great kick start but still the sound of Sabbath's and Purple's early were carrying a lot of hard rock and blues influence which even Sabbath itself would eventually strip away in the midst of its 80s output on albums like mob rules and Heaven and Hell when the band was being fronted by vocalist Ronnie James Dio as opposed to Ozzy Osbourne and do had just come over from fronting the band rainbow for a few years which was kind of a vanity project for Ritchie Blackmore of deep purple so there were some pretty significant connections going on between the handful of very significant metal bands that there were around this time plus I should also note that it's not like it's just 70s metal and then 80s metal there were quite a few groups that thrived in both decades like Judas Priest for one from the record Rocka Rolla in the mid 70s which had quite a bit of Blues influence on it too their biggest and most notorious records in the 80s like screaming for vengeance and British steel which had a more pure heavy metal sound and then there was also Motorhead who had a much gruffer style than their contemporaries at the time and then when you consider underground groups like venom at this time despite being such a young Jean rrah metal had a pretty diverse array of voices and across the pond America was making the effort to contribute with groups like Blue Oyster cult's and it was Cooper - hey don't forget about my favorite hair rock band Halen the band Halen yes that album - sort of so late 70s early 80s metal is in a transitionary phase as is Iron Maiden because before they can even put out a record they are just picking up and dropping band members like Jax the only person not dropping out is bassist Steve Harris who has written the bulk of ironmans material over the years even though the band's songwriting process has become more collaborative as they've continued much of Iron Maiden's early work can be attributed to Steve's compositional abilities and there's also dave murray who rejoined the band just in time to appear on every single Iron Maiden album the only other member besides Steve who has done so still maybe these years of evolution formation and Reformation were a benefit because by the time Iron Maiden came out with their first album they had a pretty defined sound the speed the soaring guitars the vocals that are harmonized but also delivered with quite a bit of swagger they weren't quite the sleek performance studio machine that they would be later on albums like powerslave but a lot of the core elements of Iron Maiden's style were there and the band would follow this album up with one of my favourite Iron Maiden records killers however with Paul Di'Anno on vocals who actually wasn't a bad vocalist for Iron Maiden at the time the band wasn't quite at that classic lineup that they're known for just yet which is part of what makes a number of the Beast so significant because they take one more step forward toward creating that classic lineup Nicko McBrain would join the band on drums later down the road but here on this album is the first appearance of singer Bruce Dickinson who previously had been singing for another English heavy metal band named Samson and Bruce coming into the fold essentially helped Iron Maiden solidify that epic grand and kinda can't be metal style that they're known for known for known for and Bruce didn't just bring personality to the table but a lot of technical ability to be power and sustain of his voice the range is fantastic and you can tell that for him singing is is very much like acting as well he really seems to ache over the expression and inflection of every single word because a lot of the time Bruce is not just singing but telling a story right from the start of this record on the song invaders Bruce's voice is absolutely commanding he sounds like a heavy metal General Patton getting his soldiers all whipped up for war while also giving some very grim depictions of battle and the aftermath of and even on a slow burner like children of the Damned the next track on here which has a very gloomy opening but gets more intense progressively as the song plods along Bruce sounds even more urgent and impassion on this track really making use of the space made by the slow instrumentation to create a very dramatic performance however there aren't too many slow moments on this LP and that's partially because on this record Iron Maiden starts to master the craft of the single by writing ever that would forever create ripples in the rock world that would make them one of the greatest bands of all time the title track of this album as well as run to the hills' which is one of the catchiest and also most sobering metal songs ever when it comes to the cover art on this record iron main liked a lot of other heavy metal bands around that time newer heavy metal bands we're taking from some of the occult imagery and vibes that heavy metal bands and hard rock bands and traditional doom metal bands in the 70s we're toying with but bands like Maiden and and Satan too were so much more straightforward with their blasphemy number of the Beast featuring their trademark mascot Eddie playing puppeteer to Satan himself and even the single art to run to the hills has Eddie in a battle with the devil with a crowd of demons or mutant serve just weird lumpy things watching for it's time you have to kind of consider how an Orthodox something like this was especially since not too far down the road was that whole Judas Priest suicide civil suit though the title track and run to the hills' are fantastic songs this record also has some just utterly infectious deep cuts as well like the closing track which is incredibly melodic and one of the Iron Maiden's most epic finishes on any album and then there is the prisoner and Freeman just top-notch vocals and vocal harmonies all over the I love the triumphant melody on the chorus here just a really head-banging riff and groove the track starts off with which eventually glides into some throttling guitars and tempos like many other songs on this album and other Iron Maiden albums do and then with 22 acacia Ave we have iron maiden sort of giving a really dreary depiction of an average English street talking about a place that's that's very dark where everyone has their Vice Dickinson on the song sings specifically about prostitution one in particular who suffers an unfortunate fate is sort of thrown into the meat grinder of the underground sex industry there are moments on this record and other maiden records where the band lyrically will toy with the idea of evil from a mythical or a or a figurative standpoint but some of the Bands most gritty and hard-hitting songs display that the biggest evils of all just can't be made up because they are in fact real-life case in point run to the hills which is a metal song quite literally about the genocide of Native Americans by European settlers still the title track on this LP seems to be a little more spiritual in nature in that we have a protagonist who is suffering from memories or or visions of what I think is a satanic ritual of some sort and at the end of the song he seems to have been possessed and gangland seems to be some kind of weirdly violent and exaggerated world of mercenaries where just killing is completely legal and just rampant it's complete chaos so Iron Maiden on this record really does present us with a series of pretty trying and very morbid subject matters some of them feel like food for thought others are a little more gory for the sake of being gory regardless on this record iron means solidify themselves as not just great musical song writers but storytellers too as far as the sound of the music on this LP goes it's not quite as hellish as I'm sure it once was when it originally dropped but it certainly was for its time and in retrospect even with loads of bands today being heavier louder faster more aggressive I don't think this album has really lost any of its flavor I still find this album to incredibly grim and kind of extravagant melodically and a little operatic in the way that it dramatizes The Situation's discussed in the lyrics and I still think a lot of the blazing guitar solos and the kind of trebly distorted brittle tone and the pounding drums and the prominent bass and the very tight performances have all held up pretty well in my opinion this is a stellar album it's a significant LP for the musical movement it was a part of at this time it is a pivotal album in the Iron Maiden discography and contains some of metal music's most important and enjoyable songs ever I think you should give this Recker to listen if you haven't already definitely a metal classic worth talking about and revisiting if you haven't heard it in a long time and yeah that's it you're the best anthony Fantana our maiden transition I love you and have a nice day forever 
uqpCalgg6Sk,hi everyone water filter here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another installment of classics week where I talk a little about a essential musical album that is significant historically is influential and has some great music on it as well okay and in this latest installment of 2014 classics week classics we will be talking about the craft work album trans-europe Express craft work is a German electronic music group formed in 1970 by mr. Ralf hütter and Florian Schneider however they wouldn't hit their classic lineup shown here until the mid 1970s with wolfgang flür and karl bartos but before they would put out this LP and radio activity an autobahn Kraftwerk was very much a part of what the British music press called the kraut rock scene or the German progressive and experimental rock music scene in the late 60s early 70s and this musical movement consisted mostly of rock bands that were inspired by minimalist music and psychedelic rock and improvisational music some of these groups though experimental like Faust and kin had a pretty straightforward rock vibe others that had more jazz leanings to them like embryo there were some that were incredibly raw and aggressive like know their album noise 75 is one of my all-time favorites in the band's drummer Klaus dinger actually played in craft work early on in the band's history and there were other groups coming out of the scene that had more electronic leanings like cluster and craft work however it would take several records and some custom-built instrumentation for them to become the electronic music Godfather's they are now when it comes to pushing the boundaries of music artistically and technologically craft work is a pretty essential group they helped advance the kind of sounds we could make and then showed us some really creative and interesting ways to apply them and in that sense they couldn't really help but be influential since the future of music is just so closely entwined with the future of Technology and as a result there are a lot of very successful well known artists out there that are deeply influenced by and appreciative of craft works music in a very open way considering their impact on electronic music it's kind of strange that craft work would be at their least active in the 80s when new wave groups and synthesizer pop were essentially at their mainstream peak and then you have the birth and popularity of house music coming just a little while later however by the release of computer world in 1981 Kraftwerk probably couldn't have contributed anymore to modern music than they already had the damage had already been done I I guess you could say they sort of handed musicians this new musical world to toy in and then they just kind of turned around and ended up embracing pop music with it anyway not that artists needed a copy craft work not that they couldn't help but copy craft work and not that craft work hated pop music listen to tracks like dasa model or pocket calculator and you can see that craft work has a very healthy appetite for pop music but even that there Poppaea scrapped work maintained a level of quirk that never really would have floated in the American mainstream however they still managed to gain a notorious status in the long run and their name carries a lot of weight even today for people who are in the know for me this record is kind of a happy medium and craft works to sky rafi they have advanced past the previous two albums and have kind of cast off completely the rock influence that was hanging in the air on their previous records and this LP isn't quite as poppy or as detailed as the following two albums and trans-europe Express is really craftworks biggest single so the seven cuts on my copy of this album begin with the very charming and lovely whimsical Europe endless a song that features all these really bouncy candy-coated synthesizers a very upbeat bass drum hi-hat rhythmic pattern instance students there's a little vocoder mixed in there some soaring lead melodies from some analog synthesizers analog electronics just have a different flavor to them and listening to this record is just a perfect way to celebrate that in a lot of ways the music on this album might be kind of rudimentary but there's a very organic feel to the compositions and the performances on this record that make up for that I think it's seriously joyous music and the repetition in the song here only just works to hold that in place however immediately after the song the record kind of turns dark the song the Hall of Mirrors has these swirling synthesizer leads some very icy echoed chords distant percussion and it's a song of sadness and vanity talking about how even the greatest stars hate that look at themselves or wish to change their looks in the looking-glass talking about the artists scene echoes of himself in the mirror there's some kind of just very dreary inand surreal imagery in the sparse lyrics on this track and at this point I should know I am listening to an English version of this album of course Kraftwerk being German there is a German version of this record which around this time in the music industry if an artist got popular or if they wanted their music to translate to another market it wasn't too unorthodox a practice to just re-record the song in a different language there are cuts of the Beatles singing in German David Bowie singing in French you can also look online and find a recording of Johnny Cash singing Ring of Fire in Spanish the song showroom dummies is almost as chilling also has kind of a strange narrative to it to the percussion on this track sounds like the inner workings of a clock or something like that and this track a lot like Kraftwerk itself is very fitting when it comes to the story being told here Kraftwerk in a lot of ways is sort of like the marriage of man and machine when it comes to the musical medium and this song is quite literally about mannequins or showroom dummies breaking through the showroom window of I guess a department store wherever they're being displayed to end up at a club dancing with everyone and the instrumental here is kind of a weird eerie dark tone to it like many tracks off Kraftwerk's previous album radioactivity but a lot of the songs on this LP by contrast are just so much more direct and then we come to the title track on this album which has one of the most infamous chord progressions so epic and so grande of any song ever in the pace on this song is so steady and the song itself just feel so massive I feel like I'm listening to a giant industrialized transit system there's a David Bowie and Iggy Pop reference in the lyrics here and the overall vibe of this track just sounds so futuristic or at least what we construe as futurism this album still just kind of functions on its own plane and it's weird to think of the music here existing in the same world as as David Bowie and it gets even weirder when you consider this album came out in 1977 disco was in full swing Punk just broke in that sense this album is just a little bit anachronistic it's like this is music people wish they could have made during the whole Art Deco movement in the 20s and the 30s and the 40s I mean there's there's even kind of an art deco thing going on with the cover art here the next track on the record is kind of a continuation of the same groove but with really heavy metallic percussion and it just makes the theme of the original title track just feel so much more real and tangible it's just beautiful and the final two moments of the record Franz Schubert into endless endless let the album off in just a really wonderful beautiful gentle way it's like I'm just kind of waking up from this dream world of a futuristic land that never happened well it was a lie dream the glorious P IP it was uh I love this record it's fantastic I think it's a classic I think it's great I think you should listen to it as well you should put it out here ears and I love you my transition have you given this album listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantana Kraftwerk trans europe express forever 
mvesWVSlyw0,hi everyone choppin each aptana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another classic review of A Tribe Called Quest's low in theory a tripod quest one of my favourite bands they say all my favourite ramps you don't know yes I do I can name all the guys in the band queue tab fight furnace dog and Le chamois my ever those are not an there is er and the juicer and the Space Ghost killer and a con a chief now he's a glutton member inspector ug as well as dancer and prancer dopey a try conquest good rap band a Tribe Called Quest is at the time of this album a hip hop trio once a quartet but at the time of this album a trio and they dropped this album in 1991 and it's their sophomore LP and featured on this record our MCM producer q-tip and mc5 dog and Ali Shaheed Muhammad the group's DJ and also a producer - and on this LP and much of their other work as well a Tribe Called Quest had a very smooth thoughtful approach to hip hop that sets them apart from other hip hop artists even today there are loads of jazz and funk and soul samples all over this record hypnotically head bobbing percussion and some really deep heavy bass e double bass grooves very fat lots of low-end and all of these things together gave A Tribe Called Quest a pretty distinct sound which is incredible for a few reasons it's 1991 again and there have been quite a few albums in the jazz rap genre already from KMD main source Gang Starr and let's not also forget that a tribe called quest with their debut album as well as the music being put out by their fellow Native Tongues posse members De La Soul and jungle brothers who all together we're taking a decidedly different approach from a lot of the hard hip-hop in gangsta rap that was on the come-up at this time this is something De La Soul actually breaks balls over on the record De La Soul is dead on the song afro connection at a high five where they opened the song up with this is dedicated all those hardcore acts poking fun at what they saw as commercialism and senseless violence and aggression but it's interesting to think of the context of this record right here because only a few years later this album as well as artists like DJ Premier and the RZA would change the sonic landscape of hip-hop at least when it came to East Coast and just a few years ago the kind of rudimentary very bombastic cluttered and noisy production from artists like Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy as well as Run DMC was the gold standard in comparison the instrumentals that A Tribe Called Quest carry on the low-end Theory are prettier they have more finesse to them the details are more subtle because some of the beats here are deceptively simple despite having a number of sample spread across the tracks run time the beats on this LP are rich melodic and chocolaty they just have fantastic grooves song for song for song and some of the beats here led to some of A Tribe Called Quest's biggest singles ever like check the rhyme and the song jazz which is pretty much jazz raps mission statement you can even say that this album is sort of like the cool jazz of hip hop kind of like a Bill Evans or Miles Davis or Dave Brubeck a kind of obvious and cliche comparison for this album but an apt one all the same and something that must be said considering the appearance of jazz bassist Ron Carter on this record on the song verses from the abstract this record overall is just very organic and silky but still carries that very concrete gritty down-to-earth and urban vibe that a lot of great hip-hop albums have and as far as the flows go on this record q-tip and five dog with the past ten years of hip-hop fresh in their minds build on some familiar flows fine tune them and bring some flows of their own to and with these flows they deliver a series of verses that are poetic they're clever they're relatable and socially aware the narratives in the lyrics on this record usually jump around jump around I'm sorry a lot of the songs on this LP feature what seemed to be just q-tip and and five dog tossing out one philosophical nugget after another and a lot of what is said in the grooves on this record might be seen as common sense but given that this common sense isn't really actually taken to heart by many people this album is kind of a really entertaining reminder of good natured ideas for living life some of this record statements are just incredibly simple like be honest and true to the next or that things move in cycles both of which are said on the song excursions the opening track to this LP which has one of the most killer instrumentals on the entire album but this song also features just two very dense tone down smooth verses from q-tip which is the formula that leads to a lot of good cuts on this record but conversely Fife dog on the song buggin out comes across as way more animated playful goofy talking about everything on the song from the mentality behind bugging out to mentioning that he is a big soda drinker and he's never gotten a cavity good for him five dog and q-tip even makes sure to end their verses similarly right after one another on this track they make a really good pair of course there are tracks on this record that are more conceptual and thematic in nature like rap promoter or the song butter where five dog basically tells a tale of love and heartbreak you're essentially hearing a player's ego get crushed and then with the song show business a pretty interesting track that is very sharp it's clever it's a shot at show business in general in the way that hip hop works in the music industry together with Diamond D and Lord Jamar Brand Nubian Sadat X as well they make some pretty burning observations that are even true today when it comes to the music industry's relationship with hip hop and what's even funnier is that this song wasn't even what it was intended to be originally the songs original version georgie-porgie which there are online is utterly homophobic this original demo is even more close-minded than that one DMX verse the ones like what what I don't want to touch a man's hand cuz I'm silly you know that that one and over the years a Tribe Called Quest has really gained a reputation for open-mindedness which would have been a hard sell if that song had managed to stay on their most celebrated album right here even still q-tip and five dog don't shy away from controversy on the song the infamous date rape a song where q-tip basically talks about being led on by a woman and when it comes that time to I guess sort of copy late she loses interest and he kind of says that it's not really worth it to pursue because of the unnecessary drama and assault that would occur in going against her wishes meanwhile five dogs verse deals with getting a false rape accusation after numerous rounds of consensual sex the song sky pager is a bit of an ode to some dated technology that was once a status symbol the song what is a really interesting and dense verse from q-tip that is a series of questions and is one of my favorite rap verses of all time and the closing track on here scenario is a stellar piece of hardcore hip-hop one of the most iconic hip-hop singles of all time with a great feature from Busta Rhymes stylistically it doesn't really fit into the smooth tone down nature of the rest of this album but it's such a significant hip hop track it's just hard not to like at the end of the day hands down this is one of the best collections of hip hop songs ever in the history of the genre it is a record that helped the new sound and displays so much creativity personality and talent it's enjoy ability transcends the hip-hop genre people across musical preferences can enjoy at the very least the stellar singles off of this album I think this album is a classic and it's really good and you should listen to it if you haven't already and you're the best transition have you given this album a listen if you have what do you think of it and um I hope you're doing well Anthony Fantana Tribe Called Quest forever

Flying Lotus with Kendrick Lamar on the song never catch me very fantastic hip hop jazz fusion there with a great verse from Kendrick and at number 18 young thug ASAP ferg and Freddie Gibbs with Old English 100 capsules a money oh that Freddie verse on that track arrow at number 17 we have tune-yards with no water in the water fountain and at 16 we get Death Grips with good Adam motor so Sean tune-yards very creative well-traveled and unorthodox pop music as usual very fun very colorful but with an interesting message in the lyrics and Death Grips coming through with one of the hardest tracks of this year a song that just it got my blood pumping as if it was one of the first times I had ever heard the band then at number 15 we have Sun Kil moon with the very expansive single the possum which was a another really interesting and very morbid subtext filled song with just a lot of very personal moments and anecdotes running throughout the track and um this spot is also just like a tiny subtle just like just sub shout out to the war on drugs suck my cock song at number 14 we have the beautiful gorgeous lush and dense track from the new fka twigs record two weeks and at number thirteen one of the most booming hard-hitting hardcore hip-hop tracks of the year with run the jewels oh my darling don't cry number 12 is in my opinion one of the most moving chillin ballads of the year I love the poetry in the lyrics of this song and the simplicity of the chord structure too and the way that this woman sings on the track as well is just heartbreaking Lykke lis love me like I'm not made of stone and at number 11 this is one of my favorite rap songs of the year mostly because of just how simple and straightforward it is and how it really engages with a topic in such a clever and and I guess charismatic way even though this guy has gotten slagged for sounding very much like Naz which even kind of kept me from loving the EP that he got so hot off earlier this year I am going to be diving into his new album very soon but this single right here that features prodigy of Mobb Deep again I think is one of the more clever hip-hop songs I've heard this year hoody weather of course from your old drew at number 10 we are in the top 10 now okay we're in the top 10 hold contain time well this is one of my favorite pop tunes of the year it comes from a man who has a very interesting production style usually very playful silly lyrics dealing with love occasionally and just just a really a strong personality which does rub some people the wrong way mister Ariel pink with put your number in my phone after that comes a single from the new st. vincent record digital witness I love this track even though I wasn't just totally head over heels for her new LP there are so many clever songs on this album and to me the song is the smartest not only the smartest but the Poppaea stand the catchiest to the horn groove on this thing is just nasty and i love the lyrics of this track to annie clark brings a lot on this song we have great melody great groove interesting lyrics it's just a total package great production - just a great tune following that up ice age with the Lords favorite fantastic post-punk noise rock rockabilly fusion with some really downtrodden and just soul-crushing vocals I love how on this track and many others on Ice Ages new album the band was able to embrace melody more harmonious chords but also remained just kind of a very visceral chaotic mess you get the mess with the finesse at number seven one of the more heartbreaking and soulful tracks on this collaborative hip hop projects new LP Freddie gives an ad-lib shame with bj the chicago kid I just love Freddie's flow on this track the beat is fantastic one of my favorite instrumentals on the entire LP and just the story of the song - some of the things Freddie says in this song might be a little offensive to some people but me personally I do love the shit out of this song at number six we have another hip-hop single it comes from a group that came out with one of my favorite hip-hop records of this year however this track does not land on that record this is actually an amazingly creative and interesting track that these guys came out with in light of what had recently happened in Ferguson Missouri at the time of course I am talking about the clipping single for knees on the ground what just a vivid effecting and intense way to explore what is going on in Ferguson right now very few artists no matter what the medium are able to approach such an urgent situation in its moment of urgency and create a piece of art that so strongly resonates with with me anyway and I hope if you give this song a chance yourself it also resonates with you at number five on my list another amazing pop song from earlier this year however this track comes from one of the bigger albums to drop in in this song on YouTube has millions and millions of views very popular track and while I didn't love this woman's full-length album all the way through this really was a standout for me and remains one of my favorite songs mostly because of just how powerful and amazing the vocal performances and even though the production on this track is a little commercial it doesn't really affect the quality of the song in my opinion I'm talking about Sia's chandelier it's just a very well orchestrated pop tune and and well written too although for my pop song of the year I do kinda have to give it to what was the favorite pop song of the year for many people and that of course was future Islands seas instead it sang gives me this Tiffy's such a catchy track and even though I was really really disappointed by the lack of great production the kind of overall flat sound of future Island's recent record I hope that with future releases they can just get a little more ambitious with how they approach their albums instrumentally and production wise too and simultaneously continue to pump out fantastically written songs like this one after that timber timber with hot dreams one of the most lovely songs I've heard this year with some kind of dark and very sexual lyrics there are a few songs in my opinion that lyrically really in a beautiful way portray the need or the desire for lust and just physical attraction in a relationship not only do you want to love someone who you are with on a mental level but on a physical level too and I feel like this song puts that into words so well I want to wake from hot dreams of you and then at number two we have swans with oxygen one of the most killer tracks on the new full-length LP - be kind I step out EXE jig experimental rock right here on this track really repetitive just rides a groove it just gets more and more and more intense as it moves along from one phase to another but this track unlike many other songs on this record to be kind starts off hard-hitting and swans just only gets more insane as they go along it's not like they really just you know bring it to a boil it starts at a boil and then by the end of the songs the water is just flying everywhere and the entire apartments on fire so yeah that is that is my number two spot fantastic performance from mr. jeera and company on that cut and my number one spot favorite single of the year my favourite song of the year Meghan Trainor all about that I'm kidding it's liars mess on a mission oh he's a liar I get it I will spoil it right now and say that liars new album mess is not my favorite album of the year there are a few tracks on there that did under well me but in the middle of this record Liars dished out one of the best songs of 2014 one of the best songs of their career in my opinion it's really catchy just pop electronic music post-punk fusion with deadpan vocals a killer explosive just chilling chorus with some weird background vocals animation it's tracks like this that really make me excited to hear whatever Liars is going to be doing in the future so yeah that's my that's my favorite song of the year those are my fifty favorite songs of the year with a few honorable mentions that I will drop down there in the description box as well let me know what your favorite songs of the year were give me a top five top ten top 20 just share them down there in the comments let me know what your favorite singles or tracks were of 2014 and yeah album's coming up next your awesome hugs and kisses Anthony Fantana transition but do be to be big be you just click on one of these things around my head subscribe go on the website click on one of these videos over here yeah forever 
oxXR2JnK6CU,hi everyone sleepytime tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's another installment of last week where I'm going through my favorites my musical highlights of the year just talked about my favorite music videos of the year and now in this video right here I'm going to be listing out my 15 top 15 favorite EPS of the year VP's extended plays not quite as long as albums I'm going to you know sort of speed through the the initial chunk of this list but as we get closer to the number one spot I will talk a little bit more in detail about these EPS I will also leave some music you can listen to from these releases down in the description box cool cool starting at number 15 I want to give a shout out to the og MACO EPS that dropped this year the breathe EP that dropped very recently where he puts out quite a bit of conscious raps on on these on these tracks on this three song EP and also the much longer self-titled EP he put out earlier this year which is almost like the length of an album but he still titles it as an EP they were most definitely two very interesting hip hop releases for me this year one because it was incredibly experimental and aggressive and the other because it sort of showed a more thoughtful side of Mac o at number fourteen I have to give it to the gorilla toss EP smack the brick this is like a noise rock art Punk post-punk EP if you're looking for something really abrasive fun lively and in-your-face seek this release out the new Evie in Christ EP waterfall that I reviewed earlier this year then comes the new God flesh EP that preceded their return with a new full-length studio album after over a decade of studio records silence at number 11 we have Hellfire Club member Milo rapping under another alias with Safari al on this new EP of his under the name red wall it's sort of one long 20 minute piece of music made up of a bunch of individual songs features from open mike eagle and bus driver on this thing and there's some interesting tracks on this release not only is Milo really lowing on this EP but he's kind of sounding like an old-school MC maybe taking a little bit of influence from Ishmael Butler of Shabazz Palaces and diggable planets on this thing while it isn't a full-length this is the kind of change and experimentation I was hoping would have showed up on Milo's last full-length album and if he continues to vary things up and just engage in different projects and different rap styles I think he's gonna come out with some interesting material and this is certainly an example of that at number 10 the new lil ugly Mane EP the weeping worms certainly a really interesting dark tortured southern hip-hop flavored wrap release a handful of tracks on this thing Antoine is featured as well as DJ dog dick if that isn't a motivator to listen to this thing I don't know it is with number 9 the French metal black metal specifically band piston war with and yeah this is essentially two tracks drawn out to ten minutes really dramatic rough harsh and beautiful I think this EP is a little bit of a teaser to a full-length album they're going to be putting out next year and if they continue down this road I think they're gonna have a great release on their hands I wish I've given their their earlier stuff a bit more of a spotlight on the channel but uh with music like this I'm going to consider that also at number eight the new food man EP this guy is one of the nuttiest craziest electronic music producers I have come across in the past few years to sporadically releases insane little Juke and hip hop and Glitch inspired instrumentals all over SoundCloud and VanCamp and this EP right here is one of his most dense EPS that he's released this year a load of strange instrumentals on this thing that make food man one of the most colorful underground electronic music producers today next is number 17 ooh Vince staples EP Vince staples kind of going down the gangster rapper Road on a few cuts here with some conscious hip-hop as well and some banger instrumentals he really tries to write some hooks on these tracks too on the CP and I think he comes through with some of his most cohesive and catchy material yet and I think Vince staples as a rappers finally at that point where he's really someone to watch out for after that the big crate week of crit EP the series of songs that he released one track after another with features from rick ross ASAP ferg among others and it's just a really great collection of songs from crit which a lot of them were much stronger than the material he put on his subsequent album this year but still good set of tracks nonetheless at number five the gazelle twin antibody EP sort of an art pop experimental pop album her LP that she dropped this year unflushed Willy just breathed fever ray the knife Holly Herndon but the two tracks featured on this EP are two of the more original and just strange songs in the mix and definitely two of the more promising pieces of music she's come out with this year even though I do think she wears her influences on her sleeve she really is experimenting and trying to do something odd which makes this EP worth listening to and at number four the new Armand Hammer EP mr. Billy woods and it lucid come together for another collaborative project that came out with a fantastic album titled race music last year and this little collection of tracks over here is you know a handful of songs some of them are short some of them are longer and really awesome original material there's a remix on here as well a lot of production a lucid is handling on this thing as well and yeah it's just some great tracks so I guess hold this over until they come out with another full-length project or mixtape next the new Clockwork Indigo EP a collaborative EP between Flatbush zombies and the underachievers reviewed this earlier this year really enjoyed it gave it a positive review and at number two the new big hema 'the EP the follow-up EP to their fantastic Satanist record they drop earlier this year which is my favorite metal record of the year and much of the material on this new EP is just as brooding heavy and ambitious with a range instrumentation usually just post album EPS feel like kind of afterthought sand and not much more but there really is some great material in this Shore collection of songs so kudos to behemoth for coming out with another great set of songs and finally my favorite EP of the year the most cohesive EP of the year killer features on this thing killer songs some of my favorite hip-hop tracks of the year period Greg Gillis aka Girl Talk and freeway come together for the broken ankles EP goddamn I love the CEP I could just play it from front to back over and over and over and over and I've just like so many verses on this thing have been ingrained into my head because of just how much I've been replaying this BEP it's addictive not only does freeway just bring some really mean verses to the table but Girl Talk just does some fantastic production on this thing bringing together some great hip-hop rhythms with his typically eccentric and very playful and pop oriented style of sampling and those are my 15 favorite EPS of 2014 let me know what are your favorite EPS of the year top 5 what are the best ones let me know again just totally just typing just chill a bit alright transition if you've given any of these EPS a listen what did you think of them did you love them would you hate them why what do you think I should bluhh and also how is this EP year for you did you find as many EPS as usually enjoy or was this EP year kind of just a junkie EP year for you let me know okay and I hope I hope you have a good holiday Anthony Fantana EPS forever 
Q3x4SX9Uu_4,hi everyone listen e-list a know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for list week 2014 where I'm going to be listing out my favorite music videos EPS singles and albums of the year and like usual with list week I'm going to be kicking things off with my top 20 favorite music videos of the year we are going to speed through the first half of the list and then get into a little bit more tiny bit more detail with the top ten of the list I'm also going to be listing down in the lower half of the video right here the song titles and the artist names affiliated with these videos as well as the director names too you can find more info about the directors down in the description box listing their names and whatever websites and other information I could find about them cool so kicking things off at number 20 we have Weird Al's handy not one of Weird Al's funniest videos of all time but definitely one of the funnier music videos of this year for the best single on his latest full-length album after that we have the perfume genius video for Queen which is very all over the place and strange then Step Brothers with step masters one of the funnier hip-hop videos of this year Action Bronson with Easy Rider that video is a totally insane trip we have also fka twigs with video girl a very chilling black and white stark video ASAP ferg with let it go easily one of the most ridiculous videos i've seen this year and bad bad not good with can't leave the night which is easily one of the most smart funny meta music videos I've caught this year clipping with the video for inside out which is a bunch of very funny silly like eye candy Dizzee Rascal with the karate themed music video for pagans at number 12 and at 11 we have tune-yards with water fountain which is kind of like merrill Garbus programming her own episode of pee-wee's Playhouse if it was only going to last like three minutes number 10 the bleachers video for I want to get better I thought this video was hilarious featuring the main brain of bleach are sort of playing a psychiatrist to a bunch of couples and individuals too and he's kind of going on and on listening to their problems and as they are talking to him they're lip-syncing with the words of the song and just the way the couples interact with him and the way they interact with each other as well as a lot of the set design and the cinematography and the color palettes in this video make it really nice to look at and overall I just thought the the comedy of it was very light it was very humorous it was clever next a plus films and peer pictures do a video for the new trash talk and Flatbush zombies collaborative single 97-90 - this is one of the most insane and creative uses of the fish-eye lens effect I've ever seen it's like the guys in Flatbush zombies are just dancing around a bunch of globes it's so trippy everything is just so just melty and bendy it's a visually pleasing video moving on to number eight eight eight Lee Lords favorite these guys are a Danish post-punk noise rock band and it was kind of insane to see these guys not only take the plunge into rockabilly on this track but do what seemed like a video that really put them on a stage we had each member of the band just in our faces and just looking at us really clearly whereas in previous visuals they were kind of obscured or hidden away you really didn't know who was who was just like a a really self affirming moment for the band and kind of showed that you know the music video can also be a way of making someone intimate with a musical group and I think that was kind of the intention of this video and I most definitely succeeded next one of the freakiest and strangest videos brought to us by mr. Eric Wareheim of Tim and Eric Fame he did a video for the tobacco single streaker this music video is absolutely disturbing I would expect no less from mr. Wareheim and yeah it was it was interesting to see him sort of push the envelope a little bit just make something a kind of stomach-churning visually and sonically I think Eric and into back gorgeous kind of a match made in heaven the SIA single chandelier I love the dance sync ones in this video I was moved by it I think a lot of you were I just love the way that this girl who I've seen previously on Dance Moms her name escapes my memory unfortunately let's put it right here oh thank god for post-production anyway just her dance moves the choreography the dirty room the way the camera was just moving throughout the room following her as well as the way that she was dressed the the blonde wig that really pops I just thought the way that the dancing matched the music was really powerful in this video and and yeah I'm no choreography or dance expert which to me is is really what drove a lot of the emotion of this video all I can tell you is that it did move me and I thought the video was great as our Flying Lotus and hero Mirai who also did that spoon video I gave an honorable mention to although they are coming together here for the never catch me single from flying lotuses new full-length LP with Kendrick Lamar the sequence the story here is is very sad but strange at the same time it's kind of building off of a previous Flying Lotus video that also features somebody that looks like they died they were gunned down but then they wake up in death with everyone around them sort of you know still stunned looking down as if as if they died but the figure that we as the audience are seeing as Dead has now risen and is dancing around just very provocatively and in this video it's kind of like the same concept except here we are at a funeral for two children but these two kids a boy and a girl proceeded to give one of the most technical flashy and just fun-loving dance performances I've seen in a music video in a while my number four pick is easily one of my most favorite music video concepts of the year Liars with mess on a mission we see the guys and Liars stepping backwards up a flight of stairs in this constant loop sort of looking left and right in fear and the stairs are green-screen just everything around them is edited out they seem to be holding various apparatus with them and using post-production technology people are able to sort of superimpose various things in their hands whether that be swords or video cameras or signs and with this little bit of footage of which we get numerous angles and we are just played this footage over and over and over the surroundings of these guys are just taken out and replaced with what looks like war footage or like protest footage just a series of really hectic situations it's like just a way of taking one just bit a video and doing something incredibly creative with it making that same loop of video playing again and again and again seem interesting and as the video continues along it gets glitchy err weirder stranger you're getting sort of out of place figures that don't make sense with the backgrounds or context that they're being placed within it's an insane video and every single time I watch it I just pick up something new at my number three spot Chino Moya with the st. Vincent video Digital witness I thought this video was one of the most visually pleasing videos I came across this year it's just beautiful to watch and miss Annie Clark st. Vincent figurehead has a lot of just a very strange looks I guess she just seems very emotionless and that's kind of the theme of this whole world that we see her in throughout the entirety of this video I love the color palettes of this video they're just absolutely gorgeous the cinematography is fantastic too and I think with all the colour and just all the very sterile environments and just blank faces we are essentially being told a story which have to do with just apathy modern life just the the boredom and sterility of modern living at number 2 we have clipping with work work mr. Carlos Estrada did this video for them as well and we have Davi Diggs frontman of clipping essentially playing a leading role in this video where much of the time is just laying face down on the ground with his teeth up against a curb that you would see like in a parking spot sort of like American History X style if any of you have seen that movie and above him we have cocked pistol Kree who is going to stomp his head and and I believe just this entire video is done in one shot and the way the camera spins occasionally just sort of focusing in on different things is completely insane it's just really tense tense situation and it's not really the way you see rappers portray themselves typically not only of clipping come out with one of the best hip-hop albums of the year but I think they've come out with some of the most artful music videos - and I think work work topped them all and finally we have Flying Lotus again teaming up with one of my favorite visual artists from years ago who seems to have come out of the woodwork to work with Flying Lotus here mr. David Firth of salad fingers Fame who for the Halloween holiday came together with one of the most bloody gory vile twisted stomach-churning music videos I've ever seen in my life this video is absolutely weird the visuals are so gruesome but yet like most David Firth projects there's an element of just play to it it's kind of silly it's kind of funny this video to me is just a light humor with some incredibly dark undertones and and that's what makes it the most interesting video of the year for me really no other video quite left the impact on me that this video did easily this is one of the most memorable sets of visuals I came across this year and yeah those are my favorite music videos of 2014 and maybe also too many cooks if you can even count that as a music video cybernetic operational optimized nights of science if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about end up yeah let me know down there in the comments what you're ready for music videos of the year 2014 let me know let me know I'm curious I want to see everybody's top 5 what are your top 5 favorite music videos of the year cool cool transition you're the best I love you I hope you have a nice day and yeah Anthony Fantana music videos 2014 forever 
GmzkeqZ3AW8,"hi everyone a funny joke tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new D'Angelo record and the Vanguard black Messiah D'Angelo is a multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter producer that hails from Virginia and with this record right here he is releasing his first album in just about 15 years his previous two LP is brown sugar and voodoo are credited as being two of the most artful and significant records in contemporary R&B and with his debut LP brown sugar like many R&B artists in the mid 90s D'Angelo was taking a lot of production cues from modern hip-hop whether that be conscious hip hop jazz rap hardcore hip hop his second full-length album voodoo even featured production from DJ premier and features from Redman and Method Man other R&B artists that picked up sounds from hip hop included are Kelly Aaliyah Lauryn Hill artists like this were drifting away from the live instrumentation and the blatant funk and rock influences that dominated a lot of R&B music in the 70s and some of the recent hit makers music in the 80s - people like Rick James and Michael Jackson and Prince again all of whom released great music in the 80s which there were still R&B artists that were working with drum machines and samples and since sequences then - like Keith Sweat Janet Jackson but what this crop of newer R&B artists in the 90s represented was something smoother something sleeker sexier the grooves alone on a record like brown sugar make it auditory erotica this feeling was enhanced on D'Angelo's next record voodoo especially when it came to singles and music videos for tracks like untitled how does it feel but simultaneously D'Angelo delivered tracks that moved beyond the baby-making stereotypes that were usually tagged on to R&B music and that's because he was just a generally good songwriter if you observed his compositions outside of the style that he was writing them in now aside from some collaborations and live performances D'Angelo has been pretty silent in the years between this album and his last full-length LP which could have to do with some personal problems not really being able to navigate his newfound Fame after voodoo came out for years there have been rumors of a new album coming down the pipe and from what I understand some of the recordings or writing on this new LP here might date back as far as the early 2000s but the time frame of the creation of this record really seems kind of meaningless because the music itself just feels like it's coming from such a different place than voodoo and consistently so there is a lot more live instrumentation on this record the instrumentation feels really loose the vocals are way freakier on D'Angelo's previous stuff especially his first full-length LP I saw his singing style very much as being in the archetype of 90s R&B but on this new LP here he is just using some wild inflections and really playing up the kind of nasally tone his voices always had for some pretty weird but usually sweet and soulful results and there are some incredibly strange grooves on this record too especially on tracks like 1,000 deaths which features some really oddly mixed instrumentation booming drums really tense bassline to mash together with some drowned out synthesizers stack vocals buzzing guitar leads all coming together in a really beautiful cacophony this track feels kind of fuzzy lo-fi sleazy and psychedelic a feeling that also moves on two tracks like the charade this kind of vibe I'm surprised more of these alternative R&B artists today haven't sort of gone down this road and it's like D'Angelo is also spitting in the face of the very synthetic feel that R&B has taken on over the past few decades as it's drifted away from greats like Stevie Wonder so there are some experimental characteristics of this new record but there's something kind of old-school about it too as D'Angelo embraces more live instrumentation on this LP the more he also embraces a big influence from people like Prince and as he wears this influence on his sleeve D'Angelo reaches new levels of eccentricity and I think creativity there are some interesting lyrics on this LP songs that deal with love maybe some more personal issues and back history like Back to the Future other songs that speak more in terms of religion or societal issues existential ISM and there are a lot of very great musical moments across this LP - a lot of highlights like the album's very rough and gutsy opening tracks or the fantastic lead single from this thing sugar-daddy a track that groove wise is very smooth and funky like a cut off of Voodoo but the kind of freaky backing vocals should you be needed a B DB and just the overall peppy nosov the instrumentation really set this song apart and with this track D'Angelo essentially establishes the idea of the song and then together with the backing instrumentation explores the the groove of the track and this is the formula of many a song on this record which isn't too odd considering that D'Angelo in the past has been no stranger to five six or seven minute tracks occasionally there's a track on here or two that feels more like just a groove or a motif or just some funk than it is a song kind of like tracks like Back to the Future parts 1 & 2 and prayer but these songs are still enjoyable for the most part I also love other tracks on here like the door which feels like this acoustic backwater blues funk fusion and the song another life which is the closer of the record and has this really grand instrumental presentation and feels like it pulls a lot from gospel music and I got to mention the intro to really love which has this amazing Spanish guitar performance some really somber strings but the track eventually settles into some really soft gentle balladry and I love how much this song and other songs on here to do with so little volume this track and many others on here aren't really going to seem like a lot on the surface because they're either going to be a little messy cacophonous just mixed really strangely instrumentation - sort of drowning itself out or they're going to be incredibly subtle but if you push beyond that with either some headphones or a great stereo system because this is not a laptop speakers record you're going to be doing this album in injustice if you just listen to it on your laptop speakers once you move beyond the surface groove of each track there are some great instrument details and melodies and lyrics on this thing - overall I think this is a fantastic record I think this album was worth the wait I wish we didn't have to wait for it as long as we did I wish there were people like D'Angelo people who are as artful and as creative and as eccentric and as adventurous as he is just a little more active in the current state of R&B and I think the fact that people respond to this record so positively once it just sort of dropped out of the blue is sort of proof of how much we need people like him in the genre right now and on top of all that it's it's a fantastic finish for the year of 2014 I'm feeling a strongly - a light 9 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it lists are coming up right after this video had to review this album because I wanted to put into my favorite albums list cool cool Anthony Fantana D'Angelo black Messiah forever "
k6VCr9etAi8,hi everyone wreath and he mixed an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new why you know review it's our monthly segment where we talk about a series of Records that I didn't get a chance to review over the past month or so and that I just want to mention in brief here starting with the new beyond creation record these guys are a Canadian technical death metal band with ties to infamous and amazing groups like gorgets they dropped their debut full-length LP in about 2011 it got reissued afterwards which brought up this like new wave of hype and very quickly after that reissue they have dropped this sophomore record and one thing that sets this band apart from many other technical death metal bands is that they use fretless bass so not as only kind of unique to hear the bass so prominent in a technical death metal record but it sounds much different than most bases in this style of music - just the very kind of smooth slinky feel of the bass on this record does give it some unique characteristics which made their debut album worth celebrating but on this new record of theirs I can't really say they're doing anything all that different than what they already did on their debut for people who really love that record maybe that's a good thing but for me personally not only is this album just a little redundant overall but the way they write their songs and compose their songs as well just kind of feels a little one-dimensional I don't really care for the performance production style on this record so rigid robotic clean just overly flawless though if you are a technical death metal fan I do recommend you check this record out these guys definitely do stand out in a sea of bands in a genre that is increasingly becoming more and more saturated with groups that sound very much alike next the new parquet courts record these guys are a Brooklyn indie rock post-punk bit of an art rock band - their album light up gold really liked that LP but the follow-up sunbathing animal didn't really care for it and this is their second release that they put out this year and I actually think they bounced back a little bit with this album even though there are a few forgettable original tracks there are few kind of uncreated and uninspired covers on here including Nancy Sinatra's these boots there are a couple of fantastic songs on here especially the very long closer where I think Andrew Savage really ups his poetry game but content nausea the title track of this record just the way that song lyrically goes at the internet and information age that we're in the midst of right now I think is really funny clever and exciting so there are some great tracks on here in some ways I do think this album is better than their last but maybe it was more intended to be for hardcore fans or something like that I think the band gets a little just looser sillier more ridiculous and maybe a little bit more political on this record and even though I don't love every song here it's rendered some interesting results the new neighborhood mixtape black and white hosted by DJ Drama and Don Cannon these guys are a California pop rock band and they are putting out a mixtape which kind of just sounds like I'm listening to the weekend with a lot of rap features it's okay you know it's it's it's not terrible especially the the cuts where you do get good emcees like Casey Veggies and and Danny Brown but a lot of the cuts that don't feature other MCS or some of the you know very um I guess atmospheric whimper II hooks in between these rappers do feel kind of run-of-the-mill the new Taylor Swift record 1989 a lot of people been asking me why I have not reviewed what is essentially 2014's first platinum album not a single pop album has gone platinum thus far this year which i think is kind of an interesting thing when it comes to the current state of pop music but anyway this new Taylor Swift record what do I think about it in short this album feels like 80 synth-pop redone by 2000s era indie pop and indie tronic artists and then taylor swift building off of that so it feels like a reinterpretation of a reinterpretation in my opinion there's nothing really all that interesting or special about this in the greater scheme of things it just kind of feels like they are taking some pre-established sounds and ideas and then just elevating them to a mainstream level with pop music darling that everybody seems to love Taylor Swift is just really not that interesting to me she does have some catchy hooks on this record but there's there's just really nothing that compelling about this album it just feels really borrowed focus-grouped cleaned up and just made safe so that it'll appeal to the widest crowd of people possible and that's it the ripples of hype we're seeing over this record are not because it's tide changing original just mind blowing music it's because there's nothing at all adventurous or risk-taking about it this album is is is about as palatable as vanilla ice cream and about as exciting too next the new Charli XCX record sucker you might remember I didn't really care for her last full-length LP and I did look into the writers and Co writers on this new album of hers and I was surprised to see people like Ariel pink and even Rivers Cuomo of Weezer credited as writing some of the songs on this LP and bringing in people like them and Greg Kurstin too has given this new album of hers kind of a rock and pop punk flavor whereas her last LP had so much more of a synth pop vibe so while I do appreciate in a sense Charlie trying to grab for a bit more edginess on this new record of hers still I just kind of feel like I'm listening to a more commercially watered-down sky ferreira and at times lyrically and musically this record shows a level of immaturity that even rivals that of sleighbells this record is the epitome of safe bubblegum pop and and and that's about it you know you chew it it's sweet you spit it out when you lose the flavor this album is essentially the soundtrack to too much makeup and underage drinking next the new blockhead album blockhead infamous underground experimental and a very adventurous hip hop producer has produced fantastic music over the years for emcees like ASAP Rocky has a new instrumental album out if you're an underground hip hop fan try it out recommended even though there are some redundant beats in the tracklisting here there are a lot of interesting moments next to new Bhutto's band record these guys are a funk band a jazz funk band and they have made nearly this the same album again and again and again and again and again even though they have found many different compositions to work with in this very limited style they compose music in to me it's it's just sort of lost its its flavor a little bit their first few records they have an EP as well that I love and that I own but but this newer stuff of theirs it's not that they've gotten worse or anything like that though I didn't really care for their third album it's it's just sort of you know lost its excitement for me but if you are hardcore into that style and into that sound do check this band out you know because there are some British saxophones on this thing some decent drumbeats - and for whatever reason the the record cover does kind of look like that of a stoner metal band if you are new to these guys and you're new to funk and new to jazz funk in general this is not a bad place to start but as someone who has been listening to their music for a while it's it's not that this album is terrible but considering what I know and have said about their previous work there's not really anything to say about about this new album other than that it's it's a jazz funk album and it's a Buddhist band album they're just kind of doing what they've done since forever and the new savages collaborative album which I haven't heard a lot of people in the comments of make that much of a buzz about but savages are very interesting punk and post-punk band from the UK right now and they are collaborating with who I can only assume the name is pronounced bone Indian and together they essentially create this one long 38 minute piece which is just noise rock experimental rock it's just very long-winded even like for the first 8 minutes or 10 minutes or so the song is just really building up tension it's not like there's you know any sort of clear composition coming through or anything like that and then once you get toward the the middle and the end of the track even then it's not like we get any clarity it just becomes this monolith of noise and just chaos so if you're looking for something that is just very very abrasive and freewheeling check this piece out but maybe if you're looking for more of a song structure or something just a little catchy or maybe something with a bit of a groove you might want to wait until savages drop something a little more commercial on their next record next the new gazelle twin record which for a while did intrigue me a little bit there are some interesting vocal experiments on this record and I find the strip back in minimal electronics and glitches in the instrumentals here very odd and and and very hard to categorize too though I do think at its core this album is very much like a record though in the vocals I do hear some elements of the knife and Fever Ray and the instrumentals are incredibly just strange and off-putting and very synthetic and glitchy reminding me of Holly Herndon at some points it's almost as if Holly collaborated with Karen jury or Anderson of the knife and then this record came out except it's a different artist entirely if you know those two artists names excite you because you're fans of their stuff I would say check this album out but this record personally for me just wasn't sticking with me because of just how in the shadows it felt of its influences and the new mono albums these guys are a Japanese post rock band who have come out with a new couple of albums this year and right now I feel like we are at a point where just the third wave of post rock has kind of just crested and fallen and bands like mono who sort of came up in the midst of that are in a position where listeners and sort of people who might have just sort of been following that trend need to be convinced that mono has relevance and mono has importance outside of that trend they are in a position in in my opinion where they need to be showing us their versatility and their ability to change with the times and of doing that they're just kind of handing us more of the same with an interesting envied collaboration on one of the tracks here but still again you know no surprises same old dog same old tricks from what I was able to get from these couple of Records that was certainly nothing terrible but again just you know nothing really exciting coming from the mono camp and the new bent-knee album shiny hi babies a lot of you might remember that I had this album streaming on the channel a little while ago these guys are an art rock band progressive rock band hailing from Massachusetts I believe and this record instrumentally and vocally appoints isn't really bad but as I sort of douve into the album because initially I was just listening to a few tracks here and there but as I dove into the album I just kind of found the vocals just turning me off a little bit and not really because they don't carry pitch or that's it's not a decent performance or anything like that but there's something about the inflection that really reminds me of like a musical theater you know just the vocals seem very very over-the-top and maybe just a little overpowering on a lot of these instrumentals and while I think this band is ambitious and it seems like they're in a very good way channeling some awesome influences some progressive rock and maybe even Bjork at some points I just feel like the balance of the vocals and the instrumentation just could have been done so much better but still you know I think this band has some interesting things to offer and I will be looking forward to whatever their next project is and you know again if you are into the artists that I mentioned as well as progressive rock art rock that sort of thing do check this record out the new PR Rhyme primo DJ Premier and Royce two five nine coming together for a collaborative mini album it's about 30 minutes or so has some very good features with schoolboy q absol killer Mike - and yeah I mean it's it's a decent collection of tracks DJ Premier style beats except you know you you're getting those updated versions of those boom bap flavors he's been working with for so many years and words to 5/9 he's a good emcee and I feel like the fact that he is so close to mmm and Shady Records right now it's it's very rare that we actually see him kind of step out on his own proving the talent level he can work up to at this point his career and at this age and yeah I mean that there's there's nothing awful about this record I just think I don't know it's it could have been longer I think some of the songs could have been better for certainly the rapping was great but you know some of the themes some of the hooks were just okay and for such a short album you can't really afford to be having any kind of just math songs but still not a bad LP and and not a bad record to finish off 2014's year of hip-hop and finally the new Theophilus London album vibes which oddly enough was executive produced by Kanye West Theophilus London when he first dropped with tracks and EPS like lovers holiday I thought he was pretty fantastic it wasn't the greatest rapper on the planet but he had some flow and he knew how to spit some catchy bars and he rode some really interesting hip hop synth pop new wave fusion instrumentals that I thought simultaneously felt modern but also kind of old-school too and on this new LP of his it's like all of these characteristics of his that I liked are manifesting in the ugliest of ways the instrumentals here just kind of feel like the worst of the worst the bottom of the barrel when it comes to New Wave revivalism it's like he heard a blood-orange record and decided to just Drudge up the ugliest sounds and the most cliche ideas that 80s had to offer and of course Devante hines a blood orange is credited as taking part in this album at one point so i'm not surprised and on top of that he is no longer rapping as much as he was on his previous stuff and instead is singing and Theophilus London is not that fantastic of a singer the singing on his previous material made for some of the weakest points on his records and now we have an album here where he is singing for nearly the entire LP so the fact that he is not really that good of a singer and we get even worse instrumentals and worst songs on this LP to me Theophilus London is just tumbling downward and it's kind of unfortunate because for a moment there it seemed like he was going to be a sort of Stane figure in this new wave of kind of artsy progressive and left-field rappers and songwriters that were kind of coming up post 2010 and that's it those are all the album's I'm going to touch down on right now cool cool transition what did you think of these LPS did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music by an overview forever 
zS4mavnAaiQ,hi everyone no thony Pantano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the hail Mary Mallon record bestiary hail Mary Mallon is a hip-hop duo consisting of rapper producers Rob Sonic and Aesop Rock on their last LP they had a lot more input from DJ big wiz where a lot of people were considering them a trio then I'm just sort of pairing them down to a duo assuming that maybe big Wiz wasn't just sort of a big part of this record or maybe isn't as in with them as he used to be in terms of just being a part of this project now if you are unfamiliar with mr. Aesop Rock he is pretty much the reason a few things were invented the dictionary and the rewind button he has always been an emcee whose verses you need to revisit time and time again in order to get the full scope of what he's saying and if you put in the work to understand his words can kind of be like a timed mind explosion and despite his very dense lofty verbiage rock can come through with a sense of humor that can be sort of dark twisted maybe even a little immature which a lot of the time is good because it shows you there is a real person hiding underneath the very alien language he is speaking the other side of this coin Rob sonic I'm not as familiar with as Aesop Rock but he has been at it about as long as Aesop has also has a history with definitive Jux records he has a number of solo LPS himself he's also dropped music with the Sonics come trio and even though he doesn't have the most electrifying voice and delivery he can most definitely go toe to toe with Aesop he has lyrics he has flow now him and Aesop are teaming up once again for the sophomore record something I was kind of looking forward to because I hadn't given their first album a chance when it initially came out which is something I kind of regretted given how good a saps last record turned out along with his Kimya Dawson collaboration Aesop is a creative mind and together with Rob sonic as evidenced by their last album and the name of this project they can come together with some pretty weird concepts and occasion robbing rock do that on this LP they come together with the song whales which is a despite its title really about money I love lines from this track like cop five haircuts at the same time there are references to gold pants and busts made of foie gras there's mention of filling a house with Van Gogh's twice and there are some other silly funny things this help he has to offer like this weird subplot about a fundraiser concert to save a bowling alley that has a very hilarious twist ending that I will not spoil here there are some conceptual tracks on here and even on some of the cuts that don't really come through with a clear concept Robin Rock has some great chemistry like on the opening track Jonathan where Robin rocker just trading these mini verses and bars just lightning quick one after another back referencing what each other is saying as they just bounce off of one another and progress through the track and of course they do this with some really hilarious metaphors and and similes one line in particular that stuck with me said that they were a machine cleaner than three Marines mothers bedrooms however I feel like sometimes the chemistry these guys have together almost go so deep that it's to a fault it's like they embark on some incredibly esoteric lyricism I feel like I'm sort of in that scene of Monty Python and the Holy Grail and I'm just like standing at the bottom of the wall of the castle and I really want in but I can't find a door I can't find an entrance anywhere and Robin rocker just at the at the top of it making very mocking hand gestures down at me not that I think these guys are intentionally teasing their listeners but the frustration can be pretty intensive if you're really focused on what exactly they're on about on these tracks however on other songs like krill and used cars and Dollywood there are recurring themes like a dog-eat-dog world and a lot of animal references the food chain occasionally there are some very strange character portraits in this thing too though I give these guys a lot of respect on lyrics even though I'm not really enjoying the density of them sometimes I wouldn't say they're consistently dishing out good beats and killer hooks especially when it comes to tracks like the soup and the four last songs on this record right after the the series of interlude tracks that this album serves up the album really kind of takes a nosedive in terms of just cringe-worthy choruses and just some very mild underwhelming beats plus by this point in the album the formula of a lot of these instrumentals becomes very very apparent a lot of deep bass bustling drum loops maybe some strange synthesizers and Atmospheric synthesizers and some mid-tempo grooves not a lot of variation here aside from the song Dollywood which I really do enjoy because of its 3/4 time signature so not only does this LP not really hit hard for me there's not like a lot of instantaneous gratification to it but when it comes to replay value I'm not really getting a lot from it either usually with Aesop rocks music there's a digestion period and the more you listen to it the more you get out of it in regards to bestiary the more I listen to it the more I felt like this album was just kind of abstractions for abstraction sake almost as if Rob and rocker just locked into this nonsensical reference contest where neither of them are the victor because they're both so good at it it's kind of like watching a boxing match where absolutely no punches are landed overall in my opinion I think this record is really just for hardcore fans of Rob and rock or maybe people who are really into the abstract hip hop genre to me this album is self-indulgent without really going so far as to be aught inspiringly experimental there were just a lot of weak hooks on this thing some mild beats not a lot in terms of quotables to my ear and a lot of the themes presented didn't add up to much Robyn rocker most definitely one of a kind talented MCS but I think that talent is kind of unfocused on this record and that's what makes it so boring sometimes I'm feeling a decent too strong 5 on this thing transition if you give them this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review and that's it Anthony Fantana hail Mary Mallon forever 
mlRsRQQ_zsw,you have had the the most disgusting attitude all day what what is your problem huh you know what just just just be that way I don't give a shit um hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new agey mac OEE p from from og MACO this guy is in atlanta rapper who is kind of hot right now off some buzz that he got on a viral single titled you guessed it a track that ended up catching so much traction that Terrans hopped on the remix and this song was kind of a weird stand out track like a combination of trap rap and Death Grips guillotine the instrumental with some synth piano and some sub bass is incredibly simple and minimal and over this very skeletal be Mack OH just goes insane I get that from a lyrical and a Content perspective the song doesn't have too much to offer it's about as deep as a me ghost record but to me this song was just too weird to completely count out very soon after you guessed it got hot Macca put out the live life 2 mixtape which was kind of underwhelming to me there were some very over-the-top tracks on this project but much of it in my opinion felt kind of run-of-the-mill and ran at a very normal energy level I was hoping Macko would bring just something stranger to the table by this point I was kind of feeling like you guess it might be a little bit of a fluke and if Mack o did end up putting out anything else in the future it might just end up being kind of intense but sort of one-dimensional to kind of like that Z loopers mixtape help that dropped away earlier this year however before 2014 came to a close he decided to put out an EP which isn't really in ep as much as it is a 15 track hour long almost project regardless this is the project I was looking for for Mack oh it's pretty much a mixtape that feels like an album it's got some pretty strong production on it lex luger appears on this thing Zaytoven among who are close to Mac oh this thing is not a random array of tracks on the whole it flows pretty well and when he's at his best lyrically and and delivery wise Mac o is twisted he's wild he's threatening intense there are some cuts on this project whose instrumentals are very minimal very stripped back a lot like you guessed it and the song twelve bricks - which is kind of an odd song it's not really a single or that catchy of a track it's just a very strip back beat with Mac Oh going nuts vocally all over the song and in the track listing here it kind of feels like a weird dream sequence in the middle of the record and there are some instrumentals that are kind of a reverb Ian and very atmospheric kind of going for a cloud wrap vibe like the opening cut here which feels very nightmarish and introduces us to Mac Oh being hit with the fact that he's just gotten popular and now he has to give these people more in order to continue in the rap game and even though he sounds very ready from his delivery there's something about the tone of the instrumental that brings an element of worry or sadness to this story the song fuck'em times three to a single Mac go put out earlier this year bird with me goes although they don't seem to be credited in the actual tracklist itself don't know why but this track - with it's very dreary harpsichords is kind of depressing as Mac o talks about hang around and haters and just the song human nature as well as it has an instrumental that kind of feels like inspired by a clams casino there are some songs on this LP that follow more of a trap style but are still strange a lot like the song seizure which has an instrumental that is a complete whirlwind really overwhelming it feels like on this track between Mac O's screaming his brains out and the beat I'm just being grabbed and and shaken violently there are a few smoother cuts in the track listing here - like the song Road Runner dig this track it's very laid-back it's very intoxicating but a lot of these tone down songs tend to have kind of a me ghost vibe to them and when Mako isn't going completely bonkers on the mic the fact that he's not really that great of a writer is very much exposed I don't think his lyrics are total garbage but but but he tends to kind of circle around a lot of the same themes and there's not really much here in terms of word play or subtlety or subtext and even though I think Mako is kind of eccentric in a sense there's a lien anthem on this record a really heavy-handed auto-tune chorus at times he does succumbs to some kind of stale trends now to go back to the elephant in the room and that has to be the lyrics again there's not really much to dive into lyrically on this record occasionally maca will deliver a line talking about thuggin drug dealing violence that seems kind of self-aware and acknowledges the fact that this lifestyle is insane it's dark it's not for everyone it's not something to be glorified or worshipped in fact I think a lot of the dark mournful strip back and sometimes noisy instrumentals bring that message home to however the few issues I do have with this help you don't really lion its philosophy but really its lyricism there isn't much appealing about MCOs lyrics not in a clever or funny way not in a conscious way not even in a catchy way I think if maca is going to continue to grow and put out better projects he needs to think a little bit more about whether or not his lyrics are memorable and for what reason they're going to be memorable I'm feeling a light 2ds in seven on this thing Tran no you know what silence no longer you'll hear you're not good review with the hip hop because you right now you're talking about just not good hip hop not really impact you gave this a seven and then you gave the the Jade cult the a for you you're a jerk face you're a big jerk and you don't know real raps 
XzBUvxTZfEo,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review a real quick track review of the new death-grip single inanimate sensation Death Grips West Coast experimental hip hop trio have done numerous reviews on these guys thus far I'll drop a few reviews down in the description box of Records like the Money Store now they have a new record out on the way it's titled Jenny death it's part of a two-part record that wholly is going to be titled the powers that be they dropped the first half of this double album earlier this year gave that a review but I didn't you know score it or anything like that because I feel like it's a part of a larger whole and I think I want to hear both of these albums together before I make my final decision but I did like what Death Grips had brought to the table so far on that record I thought that record had some interesting tracks on it I thought I had some of their best songs on it I loved how a lot of the tracks sort of segue into one another felt like one long song with multiple phases to it and Bjork gave them some vocals to sample throughout this project which they kind of use like an instrument throughout the album and it had some pretty strange and very intriguing results intriguing good word to use with Death Grips music and good word to use with this new track ok so now with this next record Jenny death on the way and the band saying this is going to be their last record because they're broken up but who knows if that's really the case personally I wouldn't be all that surprised of Death Grips continued to be a band after this record because it always seems like they're totally willing to just violently smash our expectations whenever they tell us one thing they do another it's just this constant game of bait-and-switch but the band is is usually pretty consistent and very happy to deliver when it comes to music and materials so I mean I I think we're gonna get this record a lot of people seem to be doubting it but I think we're gonna get Jenny death I think we're gonna get Jenny death soon and this first single from it for me is one of the biggest what-the-fuck moments of not because I don't like it but it's easily one of the strangest tracks in the Death Grips Canon so far especially with how the song starts this track starts unlike any track of her this year unlike many songs I've ever heard really I mean it it begins with this synthesizer revving up intensely against this rumbling drumbeat what feels like live drums it's nice to hear you know sort of just some booming live drums coming back into the fold on a new death grip song because many of the drums appearing on their latest LPS have been sort of synthetic electronic in flavor and now to hear some just booming live drums it kind of feels like I'm hearing a combination of ex-military coming together with what the band did on their last full-length LP so with these synthesizers rubbing up you're getting all these vocals multi-tracked and layer going song is aggressive it's it's it's overwhelming and the track is six minutes long it features four different verses totally killer chorus blown out rubber bars and the four verses all have different flavors the first one kind of has MC ride doing his usual straightforward screamed shouted delivery and flow the next verse is kind of subdued whispered I guess by MC ride standards whispered and then on the third verse we're getting his voice pitched down like an octave so it's really deep like you've heard on a lot of modern rap tracks these days that are influenced by southern hip hop and chopped and screwed this is the one part in the song I don't really care for all that much because it makes it hard to read into rides lyrics and it just seems like a little bit much like it just goes on too long but then the track finishes off with more screen than shouted verses lyrically there's a lot going on with this track in the third verse it seems like we're dealing with materialism here there's a verse where we're getting a lot of references to rock musicians or names and popular music like there's an ac/dc reference a jimi hendrix reference Axl Rose Guns N'Roses reference a Rick James reference some of these references dealing with violence toward these figures almost as if Death Grips hates this era of music or something or they see some kind of machoism in it that's kind of a turn-off or maybe that's how they kind of see culture treating these figures or just this era of music or just culture in general there's a lot of references toward information overload and culture overload in Death Grips music with them talking about things like Max and iPods on this track for a lot of people these things are kind of our windows to the world and in this song inanimate sensation I think they're making kind of a statement talking about how we get sensations from some of the things that Wright is referencing on this track but sort of in this information overload age our experiences are kind of static there through screens they are fake they're inanimate they're counterfeit in a way or you know at least that's how I'm reading into it I'm really loving this track and I'm excited for Jenni death I think with this song being as awesome as it is when this record comes out and pairs together with the first half of the powers-that-be I'm going to hear a great double album but what do you think of this track let me know I really all transition please do give this single listen and yeah again if you haven't caught any of those earlier Death Grips reviews I've done again down there in the description box or right here in this end slate check them out over there and yeah you're the best anthony Fantana Death Grips inanimate sensation forever

Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Foo Fighters record sonic highways Foo Fighters are an American alternative rock band known for their frontman Dave Grohl who is very famous for the years he put in as the drummer of Nirvana and also kind of very well known for the numerous hits Foo Fighters had dished out over the years on the radio great records like the color in the shape the band also has very rarely mentioned connections to bands like the germs and Sunny Day Real Estate 2 now personally I do enjoy my rock music to be a little more raw and aggressive than Foo Fighters usual combination of driving riffs and rockin hooks but with that being said I think they are aging more gracefully in an artistic manner than most bands who came up with them in the 90s now the band's last LP was a pretty big record for them wasting light this album saw the return of Pat smear in the band and also Butch Vig producing and there were some pretty explosive surprises on this record too with tracks like bridge burning and white limo and also on the selfie there were some arena rock nightmares and a few cliche lyrics but at the end of the day the message for me coming from this record is that Foo Fighters are here to stay in terms of artistic relevance and commercial relevance and now just a couple of years later we're getting this new Foo Fighters LP which the band has been promoting with some singles and an HBO documentary series where the band goes from one amazing historical music studio to another kind of telling the story about that studio and interviewing musicians who recorded in that studio there is eight episodes of this show there are eight different locations featured in that show eight different music studios and there are eight tracks on this record each song on this LP being recorded in a different studio and featuring different collaborators so you have this album this musical album and you also have this documentary series two different projects two different mediums but they are very deeply intertwined and I hope you've had the opportunity to experience both sides of sonic highways because this this project is really more interesting as a total package then it is just an album itself Foo Fighters are sounding even more mild than usual on this new set of songs as the band tries to construct these really grand elongated ballads that have some kind of boring instrumental interludes in them some of these songs last up to six or seven minutes and they're completely sentimental intentions can be seen from a mile away and for me the most disappointing thing about this project as a whole is that I don't really think the music reflects the diversity of the locations or the studios or the collaborators honestly occasionally you get like a buried in the background guest vocalist on this thing there's one track that features kind of a ritzy horn line playing a melody that is already being mirrored by a lead guitar there's one track on this thing that features kind of a backwater guitar riff that feels like an unreciprocated crush on Creedence Clearwater Revival going on Foo Fighters try to write softer music on this LP but the the finesse and the passion and just the the heartbreak isn't really there there are most definitely some old-school influences flowing throughout this record but there are a few tracks that feel like a bit more contemporary kind of like Dave Grohl is getting some inspiration from his buddies over at Queens of the Stone Age especially with the opening cut which kind of feels like a Beatle style melody and chord progression applied to Josh Ami's usual just weary vocal and then we have the song subterranean which just sounds just like a track that could have come off of like clockwork but Foo Fighters is performing it miraculously the guitars and the drums on this LP really dominate the mix don't leave too much room for for anything else which is fine I mean it's a rock record but the way they are performed and played is so straight and predictable just tuning into the guitars just riding their groove is about as exciting as writing the groove of like a second hand on a watch what little fire Foo Fighters managed to bring back on wasting light has just completely just died out and dissipated on this record with the exception of the only song in the tracklist that I think I loved and that is a feast and the famine it was a piece of the betta the grouping bass on this track the fractured guitar Peggy owes as well as Dave girls and passion vocals really make this track feel like to some classic Foo Fighters straightforward high-energy catchy and kick-ass all in all this this is certainly a coherent record there are a few catching moments on it but it's just kind of a letdown given the backstory of this thing which was used pretty heavily to promote this album it just seems like Foo Fighters in the face of immense collaborative opportunities have opted to just kind of make a record that they could have put together by going to just one studio at one location I wish the creativity and the ambition in the idea behind this project and and bringing the guests in and so on and so forth reflected in the performances and and the songwriting as well the thing is that it just it just doesn't it's not a terrible album but the most interesting things about it are just the pieces of context orbiting it I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Foo Fighters sonic highways forever 
ieHgriwZvJ4,kache the couch a no here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new wu-tang record a better tomorrow the wu-tang clan is an infamous New York hip-hop outfit they have put out classic records over the years 36 chambers wu-tang forever numerous solo efforts put out by numerous members of the band collectively wu-tang has contributed more to hardcore hip-hop than a lot of people out there now despite what Ang's immense impact on hip-hop as a genre there are quite a few duds in the wu-tang clan discography especially as a group which you know is kind of bound to happen due to them having nine members each of them with their own personal styles personalities ambitions tastes preferences and as a group whoo tang over the years has just kind of parted ways for a few years at a time only to reconvene to come out with another group record and this plan this way of doing things was working pretty much up until the point of 8 diagrams which is a pretty polarizing record in the wu-tang discography not only was there a very sudden change in instrumental style on this record but when it comes to lyricism and delivery it was very clear that whoo tang was not really the band of ninjas that they once were not just because many of them are sort of reaching different peaks in their careers at this point in skill levels individually but there was definitely something kind of creating a rift in creativity between the group members that kind of kept this album from feeling cohesive though still I do think this album marks an interesting point in wu-tang's discography the extremity and the aggression of the group kind of melts away into the past back into their heyday whereas now we're kind of left with this way more adventurous and experimental wu-tang clan now since eight diagrams wu-tang has kind of followed with a series of records that have been kind of underwhelming especially legendary weapons we're not even every member of the group up to appear on this thing but transitioning from that record to this new album we seem to have a lot more group participation and as a result hopefully a more eventful record - of course I'm not going to be talking about this record by myself I'm going to be discussing this LP with rap critic Darren Jackson of that guy with the glasses you can find information about him down in the description over there and I'm going to be changing my shirt as well as soon as I transition and here we are now with mr. Darren Jackson coming to talk with me via the internet about this new wu-tang record and being the longtime Wu fan that you are what did you go into this record expecting uh I would say you know I uh I guess I was kind of pessimistic a little bit because you know with the basically the way the wu-tang clan had kind of been going with concerning like joint ventures like you know what I'm saying like the last five albums from wu-tang you know I've been like the wu-tang is the indie culture you know like uh uh eight diagrams whoo Tech versus the Shaolin and they've always like it seems like lately they've been kind of disjointed they haven't really been clicking as well I know when I like everyone that comes record we're not even all of them even showed up yeah yeah I know and so like when it came to this when I was like I don't really know how I'm gonna feel about this like you know they say they got everyone for this one and they're all in sync and all you know doing stuff live now but I just felt like no I feel like I feel like for this album to really work they have to really be able to click on a level that elevates the overall project and so I was kind of like you know I there's always a bit of optimism but it just felt like they've been just on this roll of like not really being as fully formed as they sort of used to be so I was like I don't really know how this is going to be in and I was thinking like in order for them to really like make it pop they have to really switch it up that you can't just be dusty drums and old samples like they after they have to really do something big you know so you went into this sort of hoping for like something new yeah because I mean you know that's that's kind of the direction they tried to go in with eight diagrams but you know that record can be so polarizing for some people because of how many sort of experiments and new ideas were you know Rizal was trying to employ on that record well I feel like with eight diagrams they weren't in sync like they were still kind of like I'm trying to do this really wild out sound over here and meanwhile they're just like well we're gonna do the gritty rap so and then they just kind of mashed it together I gotta make this really it didn't feel it didn't come off like they were like do you guys know what I'm doing okay you know what I'm doing we're gonna put this together you know it's like yeah we want to hear something new but they all have to kind of be on the same page to for exactly exactly and so it felt like the ridge was trying to pull them and meanwhile they're like nowhere we got this hardcore sound we got to do that you know do you feel like you got something new out of this album I I feel like yes I did I feel like with this album it was sort of eight diagrams but with them more in sync now I feel like that's that's what I got out of this I think it's prefect or assessment and in a lot of ways yeah yeah because you have the it goes out there musically like there's a whole sound palette that's not just do to do to do gritty drum sort of thing you know it has the samples it has like the you know it goes to all these weird places and then it but then it incorporates it with the uh with their rhymes a case in point the the was it preacher's daughter yeah that was another thing just like in general there there was a lot more storytelling um more precise storytelling going on with Iran and so like you know with preacher's daughter there was actually had like this lined narrative like it started off with Method Man's verse you know talking about how you met this girl and then you know Massa kill said oh I knew that girls you know she's a skeezer and it's luck so like you know there's the concepts are together they're strung together and and then the music comes with that it's like they work the the son of a preacher man saw the the one downfall for me of that track is that it has the ugliest hook of any song on the album like the singing of Everest is like absolutely hideous there is a singing freak like it's not like it's slightly too far away from the mic I felt like there could have been more ways to recreate the section of mesmerize song sounded better you know but there was other there's some other pretty good concept tracks on here as well did you like the song um felt uh actually I I felt like that should have I felt like that should have been like later on in the album it felt a little too like like okay we start with ruckus and be martyred witches oh my god pretty hard hitting track but we go into it you know you hit you get this hardening song and then it just kind of feels like felt kind of like is a little too you know I don't know it felt like slightly too soft for like for all of her early on in the record it's kind of a subdued track yeah sure but I mean I but but lyrically I mean I thought they came through the concept that was like I don't know it wasn't that strong of a concept it was kind of like rap about feelings and content and wreck um but like it was it was interesting to kind of see the four of them try to take on that challenge I always content like input off when someone when they try to make a song based around having this in every line with a word yeah well I think you know you hear songs like that were just like we have to lead it a bit early to this word my favorite concept track on here you know in terms of like I think the concepts cool I think the verses are cool I think they came through on the instrumental to is maybe necklace I think um for for one I just love how anti chorus that song is it's slavery is everyone called you too much struggle fuck yes right it's such a memorable moment like it's so absurd yeah it's so absurd that that would stand out is the hook comes with a great verse on on this track - um yeah I mean uh there's that track there's also um another concept a story track mistaken identity that I now turned out not too bad except for masta killa I feel like I feel like the people who have gotten better really better and the people who are like you know they're all right they County are bad but they haven't like they haven't like punched it out the Box you know like like Cappadonna has always felt kind of lyrically sort of weak to me like it feels like like his flow especially it feels like he just adds in just three too many words and it's just like it just kind of makes it like really couldn't have like cut out something more like where does that bet you know like with everyone as persons I can't help but feel like okay can we do that take again you know times am i home I I think the most obvious example of that was maybe on a 40th Street uh because flies he's not even really on up in the pocket on that track that there's there's that track then there's also um you know then he uh he also dropped this one line on the never let go track we're just in the midst of like a series of never let go lines he just says uh never let go of the soap you know my god yeah I was was that yeah was that him let me check uh I remember it being you guys I was like what the hell uh it's so weird cuz it starts off with like you know a Martin Luther King quote and then it felt like they were trying to do the concept song again and all they told you God was just never let go that's the name of the song just just you know what I'm saying and eat cuz it he's like eyes on the prize never let go of the scope when I'm in jail never let go of the soap hold on boy never let go there was also another line that he dropped uh where was saying uh I think something was thrilling like the ride called The Buccaneer and I was like that's kind of forcing it a little bit you know yeah that could have been worded differently it's through that like the water and they go run it differently and like your standard for thrill is a roller coaster you know and it's like you know you usually I expect woo to like push the being is rugged in as raw as they are so like push push the metaphors in the similes a little ardor well ease see that that's though I mean like you gods always had kind of had that like he words things weirdly and it's kind of hard to like put it together and it feels like you know that's still there and it feels like you know 20 years like why you know what I'm saying like together they should they should be like boom this verse needs to be hot his mercies be fully together and it feels like the shortcomings are still there yeah but you know the songs all around a good but it feels like individually like the shortcomings are still kind of around like oh I feel like we haven't mentioned inspected deck yet though he's still good yeah he said you still had it together you know but you mentioned GZA earlier and on the same track hold the heater where he says that his verse was kind of unenthusiastic well whatever hundred Izzi a stick on that particular track I mean there were moments where he shined on this record but for me that was one track where he just kind of sounded like I don't know just um uh I I guess I guess it was sort of that moment where hip-hop is finally coming to that age where you have to come to terms with the Great's are now aging you know and they don't sound the way that they used to you know um rocks been in that position for a few decades now you know several decades um hip hop's just now getting there and you know and this was one of those moments for me you know and and to me overall this album is kind of one of those moments for me even if there are parts that really stand out in it yeah like they with the genius there definitely is an element like you can hear it in his voice like this you know this isn't 1993 the genius well I guess I still feel like with every song his verses like the concepts push far beyond it like I remember listening to um um what's the name of the album with pencil uh and uh firehouse ProTools that was that where he sounded the most like he was just fuckin asleep and I feel like I so I hear the improvement from that and I'm like ok I'm seeing that's better um I will say I feel kind of the same way with Raekwon though I feel like for some reason he doesn't like you know Rick Juan's always been kind of chill but if you listen to uh only built 4 Cuban Linx as I just did a couple of hours ago uh you know you still hear that sort of fire with his voice and it kind of feels like he's relaxed but like to his detriment you know um like especially in songs like that one short track um crushed egos like in the middle of the LP it's like a two-minute song um it felt like it was only that song I will say felt like it was only there for the purpose of showing look the risen Raekwon are cool again yeah I felt like they were trying to sort of take people back a little bit you know by doing by doing that track you know um uh conceptually but like you know it was a highlight for me can I say a really good motif that I loved um was the usage of ol Dirty Bastard vocals yeah that was actually one thing that ahead of all the fat out of all the things that bugged me about this record when when they used his voice it was incorporated in a really natural way like it sounded like it was tasteful and that he was there you know um it could have been a lot worse considering that you know I've heard like some awful tracks where he's just constantly sampled again and again and again and like woot in the chorus of songs and just goes overboard Oh come here just like it really made sense and it was it was more than just a 28 diagrams who stood like here's the ol Dirty Bastard tribute it felt like no he's still here and he's like you know his spirit was still pervading around this valve but like the spirit of the album had him in it you know he was ingrained in it instead of just kind of like here's the one tribute it's like no this isn't just a tribute this isn't just our uh here's one moment we dedicate him now back to the AMA it's like no he is still with us you know so I really like that feel there was that verse and maybe one of my favorite just sort of single standalone verses on the UM on the LP was um when Ghost Face appeared right at the end of miracle hook are not miracle yeah just saw miracle um when the production switched out uh sounded like it sounded like some kind of crazy like imagine dragons shit and then he's like sounding like super duper emotional and passion and just like in the moment on on that part of the song can we talk a bit yeah yeah I come on miracle okay look I love so much I love some of the verses on this track but I think you're going to talk about the chorus right now if this ain't some Disney sound and shit right here it was like listening to frozen I thought that someone had popped in a sample from Fievel goes west or something hey I was like if America goes what the fuckin yeah he was it was some wacky musical theater shit anything happen like it didn't even fit um that was one of those moments where I felt like we kind of jumped back to a diagrams it was like things weren't syncing up until the end where you kind of just had that crazy thing where go space killin the beat kind of breaks down and that was like some wheels insect that beat was like in its in its own way that was like some weird Kanye shit like that's some shit Kanye would like you know sort of like on the UM don't like remix like you know all of a sudden when he comes in like the P changes up and like you know it sounds like there's this you know really epic rising action and everything like it sound like that was you know very much like a Kanye West move um and it was executed well but like man the hook on this track is God but I think I think from that we need to talk about just the production of the hooks in general because you know we've been talking about a lot the the verses we like the conceptual tracks for the most part you know it sounds like theme-wise everybody is on the same page a lot of the time you know which I think gives this album a lot of credit even if some verses are better than others even if some performances are more lively than others but I mean as far as the instrumentals go what was your con on this LP um I thought the instrument the in some instrumentals I felt that they were definitely I felt they were alive I think that mainly came from them using the live bands and like it pushes that like for example two of my favorite songs where and this is funny because I had heard these songs before keep watch I had heard that before and I didn't maybe just wasn't finished yet but I feel like here it popped more and so I I just dug the UH the drive of the song and the chorus and everything you know just coming together um I thought that a better tomorrow and wu-tang reunion were some of the most beautiful songs on the whole damn album well you take the wu-tang reunion singles been out a long time and when this record came out I wasn't expecting that song to land on it I mean maybe there was maybe maybe they had said publicly that that was going to be the case and I didn't read it and I didn't remember but um but when that song came out I was like we have heard this oh yeah that's right that came out like you know well over a year ago and when everyone liked it yeah and at the end of the album it was just the perfect time like they they placed that one perfectly at the end yeah yeah he comes in with possibly one of my favorite verses yeah uh just just the way he described the whole scene it was just I I felt like I was in that damn moment you know there are a lot of I don't know that there are a lot of spots on this record where some weird stuff goes on with the production um you know like suddenly there will be this like strange blaring simply that just like makes no sense yeah with anything that's going on um you know despite the fact that you know you just a second ago you might have been hearing just a very kind of clean R&B style chorus so there are elements of the production here where it just seems like really odd and unpredictable and experimental but then again there are moments where it just seems like you know super commercial and clean sort of like on miracle yeah I agree make me to get the day of Grammys next year I feel like lyrically everybody's very much on the same page on this record but I feel like for the weirdest reason instrumentally the record is very much not on the same page with itself so with Wu tacky the acronym is witty unpredictable talent and natural game and I feel like the unpredictable has been kind of missing from their element for a while you know like we know if when the new wu-tang clan comes out it's gonna be a dusty drumbeat so I feel like he was like no we are predictable and we're gonna hit you with the fucking miracle course again so I feel like I felt like okay I might not be gravitating towards everything but I see how they're trying to you know swipe the dust off and be like no we are still coming to you with that shit you're not expected you know so I understand its purpose and I respect it I think it's cool in a lot of parts miracle bow I came out um like and quite a bit of this album honestly like it started off kind of rocky for me um but I thought maybe the last third of the record was like incredibly solid um you know even though there were some good concept tracks toward the beginning you know with songs like felt I wasn't really feeling that same level of intensity you know that I would usually expect from wu-tang are you saying the intensity wasn't oh you know I thought they came out swinging with records and b-minor but then you know just kind of like hit a bit of a lull for me but then with wu-tang reunion and the necklace track and you know much of what else was on the last third of the record it really started to come together for me you know as as sort of unlikable as some of the parts on this record are you know most notably the preacher's daughter chorus in the miracle chorus and um you know aside from that I think this record has like a lot of interesting things going on and a lot of tracks that I like I don't think it necessarily signals like though however like a bright future for wu-tang I don't think this record necessarily like makes me like super excited for whatever they're going to do as a group next you know even though I do like tracks on here I still kind of feel like I hear a group in disarray and I don't know if you feel that way I feel like I'm really looking forward to the genius and Method Man's next albums like I'll say that damn much um although I do feel like if this was their last album I would be okay with that it does kind of feel like a swan song in some of the weapons yeah is that a great last track yeah eight diagrams I was like oh please don't let that be there you know the last big album veto but this would I feel like especially with the way it ends it feels like the end they could end up here and I would be fine you know uh I I personally being super big leuphana that I am I still wanted to keep going I want to see the you know the Bobby digital movie whenever that happens like I wanted I wanted to see shit keep happening with the bootleg plan but like if it was like here's the end of the story we got to put the book away uh if we ended here I would be happy with that you know um I personally would say out of out of five I would give it a 4 out of 5 and we're rating it um because I do believe it has those great moments um great lyrics uh it has the experimentalism but with with that experimenting there's going to be parts where you falter but I don't think it's to the point where it's like what the fuck is this I never would hear this again it's like it still has that sort of what was that actually I want to show people this you know so yeah it's still good I personally am feeling like strong six on this thing I came out liking it and I think we agree on much of what makes this album good and you know the the highlight tracks and you know the best tracks but I think a great deal the experiments didn't go over well for me and maybe they were bigger turn offs for me um and uh and there and there were you know some standout verses for me in terms of just being kind of underwhelming and some of the vocal mixing from MCMC was just like um kind of wonky and like I said earlier it's a it's definitely an interesting record to talk about told because there's just so many odd things going on well III think that I think that works - it's uh - its benefit you know instead of just being here's the normal you know beats you expect it's like it gives you those things that make you want to check it out again you know and so it's like I think that was the sort of aim like we need to bring wu-tang into something new we can't just be you know the same sort of the boom boom boom Dubi to do the time you know what I'm saying like we can't just be that and I feel like that if that was what their aim was I think that's good um I think that's what is gonna push them forward maybe not in the mainstream direction like oh this is gonna be a number one hit song you know but it's just pushing them forward as in like beans making themselves uh relevant in the sense that we are moving forward we are doing new things you know like illnesses like Kanye if he was still doing the exact same beats of 2005 I don't think he'd be relevant you know it's like he had to do something he had to do the 808 heartbreaks that people might not have agreed with but it pushed him forward as an artist you know so I'd like to see this push them forward forward as an artist and maybe you know later we may get this perfect piece but you know this is that moment where they're like okay let's step out with that I mean we're gonna close this up Darren thanks for thanks for coming on and talking to this fucking record with me dude for sure right um I'm gonna leave a link down there in the description box where you can check out Darren's videos and you know this one really well I'm sure a lot of you agree and you know we'll sure we'll have a Darren on again in the future to talk about some more action and and that's it so there we go Anthony Fantana Darren Jackson wu-tang clan a better tomorrow forever 
oOhcHU0AoWs,hi everyone big city gains tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new full of Hell album full of hell and MERS doe this is the latest full-length LP I believe the third full-length LP from extreme metal and punk act full of hell this is the first time I'm reviewing them however I am well aware of their previous LPS and I didn't really review these albums in their own videos because I didn't really have that much to say about them I like that the band creates a really chaotic blend of hardcore punk and sludge metal grindcore as well as power violence but I never found their sound to be that bold memorable or distinct even though it is hellishly loud there riff writing never really stuck with me either though personally I do admire the band for being consistent and prolific and sticking to their guns but what grabbed my attention about this new record is that they seem to be taking a pretty ambitious risk with the collaboration they name this album after full of hell and MERS Bhau infamous Japanese noise artist whose output is relentlessly abrasive and prolific and full of hell are big fans of noise they have a series of EPs they've dropped over the years where they indulge in Noise music a bit and this is one of their shirts it's just a Murs bow album cover given that their experimentations with noise thus far have been on the shorter side and they are big fans of the artists that they are collaborating with on this record I thought it would be interesting to see how things kind of panned out on this release in this record is essentially 11 tracks 24 minutes of Sonic hell ear drum scraping fury this thing has a great recording and mix the best recording and mix I think bullet hell's work with thus far the guitars are really heavy the bass is nice and the vocals are absolutely gruesome and upfront in your face the drums are just clear as a bell very punchy and the performances all over this LP are so precise yet they don't feel mechanical or robotic or anything like that there's just a lot of kinetic energy to the playing on this thing it's so visceral it's so lively even before we talk about MERS vows inclusion on this album full of hell is sounding better as a band the playing is more intense and they find some interesting ways to work dissonance into their riffs to add just like a subtle layer of melody to make things just a little bit catchy they manage to create some pretty memorable moments in tracks that even just have a 30 second or a 40 second runtime but even the longer tracks do have their stickier spots like thrumming the deep which has the most killer riff of any track on this entire LP or blue litmus I love the slowed down crushing riffs at the end of this track as well as the kind of noisy freak outs in the midst of the hard-hitting riffs at the start of the song Jin Jin Jin Jin Chen in the closing track on this LP along with another one earlier in the tracklist managed to incorporate horns into the blast beats and the heavy riffs on this thing and not really in so much of a beautiful way though these ones do compliment the chord progression of an earlier track in this track listing on this particular song horns really just contribute to the extremity of the song MERS boughs contributions to this record sound much of the time incredibly subtle and I think that's going to end up disappointing some people going into this LP since it does feel like full of hell is making a big deal of this collaboration just naming the album after the collaboration itself the truth is while MERS boughs input is there on a lot of these songs and is audible it's not like full of Hell relies on him like a crutch to really make these tracks a lot of the time what MERS bout does just feels kind of like a side dish or a contribution which is fine full of Hell songs move is such a frantic pace and they are so chaotic already that much of what MERS Bao does just feels like it's it's just subtly placed within these flurries of drums and guitars and vocals you may hear some subtly placed feedback shots or distortion walls or weird noisy loops laced into these songs and even though it's not really up front in your face it does contribute to the intensity of these tracks overall and I think just adds a little bit more density a bit more detail and makes full of hell's music a bit more interesting than it usually is in my opinion there are moments where merged vows contributions really stick out like on the song blue litmus where I can only assume that some of the just noisy distorted feedback shots on that track are brought by him there are tracks where maybe the riffs are slower there's a lot more space to fill and you hear MERS bow just bringing forward some shrill ear piercing noise just to make the song just even more abrasive there's the track raise the Great Wall which really just kind of seems like a two-minute brittle harsh noise piece that transitions the album from one track to another and even though it just kind of feels like an interlude I think it adds to the personality of the record the character of the record and I think the song does a good job of just making full of hell's vocals and drums contribute to that stagnant challenging torturous vibe that you get from some good Noise music this track affects the flow of the album in a big way as do some of the longer tracks on the back end of this LP truth be told even though this album is heavy its extreme its noisy its kind of varied there are songs that really just test patience there are tracks that fly by in 30 seconds and are maybe some of the most disgusting music I've heard this year full of helvis piles on the blood and the guts and the entrails on numerous tracks here though I do like some of the slower tracks on here like high fells because the horn flutters on that song the very epic heavy guitar chords just are our note of accessibility that I think the album needed just for the sake of diversity and just a nice change of pace and even though there are songs in this tracklist here that I think sort of defy recollection and there are tracks that just quickly segue into others as if they're one cohesive song just social songs going by in a flash much of this record is sticking with me pretty hard again full of hell is sounding better and more creative as a band themselves and Murs bow together with them even though his contributions may seem very simple they are incredibly effective and I think helpful of he'll do what they've already done pretty well better I'm feeling a strong seven to a late eighth on this thing Tran Shin if you've given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh full of hell murse pal forever 
gZDyjNRDu_c,kristan across town oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new J Cole album 2014 Forest Hills Drive J Cole is a New York via North Carolina via Germany rap Minh and producer featured on jay-z's infamous Roc Nation label J Cole sidesteps a lot of your average hip-hop stereotypes by being more emotional and relatable than your usual mainstream lyricist he is not a drug kingpin or an egotistical limelight hog or a gangsta he's more like that dude you went to high school with who had a good head on his shoulders and Cole is not afraid of of sharing what troubles him even if it means dishing out something that is kind of embarrassing or just cringe-worthy and over his numerous projects he's put himself into a few peculiar situations most notably rapping from the standpoint of a girl that he got knocked up now on Cole sophomore full-length LP born sinner which I thought was even less interesting than his debut which did have its shining moments this album was just bland nothing stuck out to me the really muddy distorted kind of colorless production Cole's delivery to me on this LP was was a little more unenthusiastic than usual and the food-for-thought tracks were just so incredibly middlebrow and the most boring parts of this record and Cole's career are when he can't stop referencing or rapping about his incredibly incremental impact and progress within the rap industry as a whole at one point J Cole was known as that guy that jay-z signed and rather than overcoming that label and progressing pastin coming into his own he is quick to remind us of that now I do appreciate that J Cole is more emotive than your average rapper right now but I don't think he's really the songwriter or the hook crafter that a guy like Drake can be when he's really focused on making a good chorus and as far as the conscious side of J Cole's music goes he doesn't exactly display the the overwhelming passion or the flow or the logic or the knowledge of a guy like Ken Lemar in my opinion there is nothing on J Cole's first two records that would make him a poignant voice on really any topic and even when Cole does pen a really focused heartfelt track with a lot of passion behind it like let NAS down when you go back and dwell on that track the lyrics in that track and just the the sentiment and the subject matter of that track isn't the whole thing just ever so slightly pathetic so now out of the blue with absolutely no single promotion whatsoever we have a new Jay Cole album 2014 Forest Hills Drive it's a 12 track record and it has a one more elongated credit track worried kind of just thanks everybody who might have been involved in the record whether it be a direct way or just kind of through inspiring him and um as far as a guests on this record it's pretty much all quiet on that front this album is Jay Cole's quietest record yet it's his most stripped back record yet and it's really all about him there's very crystal clear open easygoing production all over many of the tracks here that really spotlights the vocals even the hardest track here on the song firing squad keeps a pretty cool head as Jay Cole fires some shots in the lyrics even the hooks on this record kind of take a backseat to the verses either by just being sort of simple and a little toned down or maybe they feature some guest vocals and they're kind of smooth and very pleasant light on the ears there's nothing really on this record that screams a radio single this is a radio track which could in fact be a really exciting thing for Jay Cole because maybe with the beats and the commercial pressures just having no influence over the flavor of this record we are finally going to get that heavy wordplay that conscious food-for-thought that Cole has always implied that he's giving us but maybe hasn't fully delivered on there's the song January 28th which kicks the record off it's a very smooth start instrumentally and some of the lyrics here I'm kind of disappointed by because Cole seems to be continually astounded by how far he's come in rap music he brags on his worthiness his intelligence level and every once in a while he drops a reality bomb one line in particular that sticks out to me is uh asking what is the price on a black man's life and he looks at the toe tag and there's not a zero in sight the momentum on the record picks up on the song wet dreams which is basically hip-hop's biggest virginity anthem and I dig the sole sample on this track I dig the flow and Jay Cole does do a good job with his lyrics of kind of catching the anticipation of that first time that you have sex but for some people this is going to be another moment in Jake holes discography where he is just uncomfortably revealing on another track on this LP he kind of steps over that line again when he says I came fast like 900 white neighborhoods there has to be someone out there who when they hear Cole drop lines like this they feel like he's sharing something personal and they feel closer to him or they feel like that's relatable that's cool and I had no problem with rappers sharing personal information or coming off like just a real everyday human being who is you know totally relatable but the way that Cole shares personal information to me is kind of manipulative sometimes usually it serves some kind of self-deprecating end like he wants to tell you something that normally would make you think he's a total wimp and a loser but he's just going to turn around and be like but but I'm not embarrassed by it rather than drawing me in closer to him like oh you came fast I'm interested it just makes me kind of wince and just think why do I care although I did find the song Oh three adolescence a little bit more compelling this is a track where Jay Cole is just on the edge of graduating high school he knows a kid in his school who is basically a dealer an up-and-coming street hustler and he wants to know how he can get in that position how he can kind of play that game and get involved in that life but this kid sort of laughs at him as dude you have so many opportunities laying out in front of you right now I'm looking up to you why would you want to do what I'm doing you have a chance to better yourself it's a great track that seems to sort of display a fork in Jay Cole's life and sort of puts things in perspective like college and love and and family although right on the next track we kind of have a song talking about robbing people stickups not that Jay Cole says personally he indulged in this kind of behavior but maybe this track is kind of a Jay Cole saying that some people don't necessarily choose the right path even when it is pointed out to them it is an interesting and gritty song I just wish the hook popped a little bit more on this track then we move on to firing squad a really classic boom bap beat on this thing just vintage groove this track is 90s through and through and it is not a fiery delivery but we do have some hard truth rhymes especially when Jay Cole kind of jokes a little tongue-in-cheek about white people stealing the sound in regards to Macklemore mm Justin Timberlake Iggy Azalea after saying this he kind of Pat's the listener on the head a little bit saying I'm just joking but you know there is a truth to it even though I do have my reservations about the first half of this record it's actually pretty solid it has a good flow and the songs consistently do have a pretty high quality to them but after a somewhat consistent and in listenable first half the record just kind of all of a sudden just buries its face into a frilly pastel pillow so that it can start moaning these really weak melodic just go nowhere songs like the song st. ropes where Cole is trying to croon throughout the whole track and it does not go well the song thematically might be trying to bring Cole from like one personality to another sort of talking about Hollywood in this Hollywood life in this Hollywood mentality but it's it's just not that enjoyable of a track and the song hello which is a track I can't even really figure out I do like the instrument on this track and cold does seem to be making a love song here whether he is in love or falling out of love or just kind of missing that person being away from that person I can't totally figure out because the lyrics are so vague on this thing and just like anybody's relationship at some point could be applied to this track it's on songs like this I'm getting kind of like a nothing was the same vibe and it's just so uninteresting and even some of the more direct tracks on the back end of this LP are just okay - there's the song no role models which seems like it could have been a really interesting concept just from the title alone but the track itself lyrically cold just kind of catches a feel over the lack of dateable women at his b-list celebrity level of fame saying that he doesn't want to date someone from a reality show because those people are shallow but there are numerous points all over this record where Cole himself displays a somewhat shallow mentality like on the song apparently where Cole does more singing which again is a turn-off and he's rapping about just you know writing alone and being in his zone and there's like a line that kind of slips through the verses it's not the most notable set of lines but there's a moment on this track where he is saying that he was kind of screwing around in New York as his mother's house was being foreclosed on even though Cole acknowledges this astronomically crappy situation the way he addresses it in this song so briefly just seems kind of flipping almost as if what he said in this song hit me harder than it did him as soon as he has passed that moment in the track I'm thinking what that happened what their other cuts here as well where it seems like Cole has a kind of juicy song idea on his hands but he doesn't follow through and build it out into anything interesting like get off my dick where he's rapping about how his fame has kind of changed his relationship with his hometown the only song on the back end here that I think really hit me hard was love yours which while there is a line on this record that that kind of turns me off where he's talking directly to people who are impoverished saying hey listen it's it's sort of better where you are listen I I know I'm rich I know what it's like to be rich and famous but believe me you don't want to be here it's a pain in the butt or at least to me that's how I was interpreting what he was saying for sure I do like the general philosophy of the song where he is saying hey listen there's no life out there that's better than yours your life is great if there are people you love in your life if you have health if you have happiness if you have you know whatever he is basically saying you have you have those things then learn to love them if you can't learn to love what you have you'll never really appreciate it there's always going to be something out there that's more expensive nicer looking so on and so forth but you're never even going to be happy with that if you can't learn to love what you currently have and the sentiment of the track would have been great if he had left it right there but it's almost as if he heard in his head someone saying well Cole what about people who can't afford to eat which is a great question but then when he goes on to defend that argument in the wake of that realization his logic just crumbles overall even though I do have my issues with this record I do think Forest Hills Drive is Cole's most consistent project yet the production certainly pulls things together really well Cole's kind of subdued and kind of mild flow and delivery throughout much of the album leaves a lot of these songs just kind of having very similar vibe to them this is not a record that unpredictably jumps all over the place and there are some very personal themes on this LP however even on his most no b.s album so far there are a lot of lackluster songs and just kind of again cringe-worthy lines especially on the back end of this LP as Cole starts singing more and more and more there are some things about this LP that are most definitely worth celebrating but I feel like the more commercial projects I hear from J Cole the question of what makes him special becomes harder to answer I'm feeling a strong 5 - lights six on this thing transition have you given the Salomon listen if you did what did you think of it did you let it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana J Cole Forest Hills Drive forever 
Ib0KEfPQQ7I,hi everyone Ruffini tan tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick review of the new Ghostface Killah album 36 seasons Ghostface Killah is a famous new york-based rapper who is very well known for his lifetime membership in the wu-tang clan and in my opinion Ghostface Killah is the most consistent member of the wu-tang clan when it comes to solo material he puts it out on a regular basis and it's usually of a pretty good quality the dude has numerous classics under his belt ironman supreme clientele fish-scale you can also maybe count his involvement in Raekwon's only built 4 Cuban Linx and I think he had a pretty amazing recent success as well with the album 12 reasons to die a collaborative concept LP he did with Adrian young composer multi-instrumentalist and his band and in the concept of this record Ghostface Killah is a mob boss he's in the midst of a rival is betrayed killed then he comes back from the dead to get revenge it's a coherent story it's kind of creative its ambitious and it has killer instrumentals that enhance the narrative and now it's like those faced killers trying to relive the very recent success of that album with a new record that is like of the same flavor but a little more watered down it's got maybe about half of the magic of 12 reasons to die there is a story a narrative a concept here there are instrumentals which are of a kind of vintage soul and funk flavor Ghostface Killah also casts other rappers to play roles on this record most notably on this LP new york veterans such as Kool G Rap and AZ however in the case of 36 seasons even though guys like a Z play pretty pivotal roles in the storyline of this record especially when it comes to the betrayal part of the record it's like the features just way this album down for sure Ghostface Killah and the other rappers on this LP are all acting out but there's very little in the way of drama or tension or excitement thrills danger like there was on 12 reasons to die and there are some tracks here where Ghostface Killah doesn't even really show up to rap either other people are rapping or you just kind of have a singer singing and it's a more of a tuneful track though these songs don't really add up much to me as anything more than interludes in the track listing here I mean in my opinion Adrian young and his band caught that sort of very old-school vibe of the music being played on this album the soul and the funk music so much better and the storyline of this thing is is just okay and a little just parallel to the storyline of 12 reasons to die you have a street kingpin who returns to his hometown or his neighborhood after nine years it's worse off than when he left it he doesn't get any more respect there are drugs everywhere children are in danger his ex-lover is not interested in him anymore he basically arrives he attacks the people and tries to fight the evil and the corruption that ruined his home neighborhood then he is hurt he is rebuilt into this strange gas mask monster and he gets his revenge there's even a track on this record called blood on the streets and there was a track on 12 reasons to die called blood on the cobblestone so not only is the rapping just not as intense and a lot of the more old-school flavored instrumentals here just aren't as I guess enchanting or as intoxicating I don't really get that sense of nostalgia that beautiful nostalgia like from an old exploitation movie soundtrack that I would normally get from these kinds of instrumentals here they just kind of sound like new reenactments that just aren't as I guess romantic in my opinion this record is really just for the hardcore fans especially given just everything that comes along with this album with the deluxe edition just all the visuals and the comic book that comes with this thing it's for sure another kind of ambitious project from Ghost Face but it just seems so alike to what he just did on his last album plus with the full-length collaborative LP as coming down the pipe with bad bad not good I think he has more exciting things just around the corner honestly I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Ghostface Killah 36 seasons forever 
frlWC9ptkX8,cool drinkin h2o here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new witches album Annabelle dream reader these guys are a uk-based rock band this is their full-length debut album came out on heavenly Recordings earlier this year they built up to the release of this album with some singles and some EPS a lot of that material appears on this record and this album to me is the sound of a band that gave themselves adequate time to hone a sound and craft their songs this is the first time I'm hearing of this band but it doesn't feel like I'm listening to a group in the midst of the incubator stage which I think happens all too often in the Internet age where we are exposed very early on in an artist's artistic evolution not only are there great songs on this record in my opinion but to me witches come through with a more interesting cross-section of influences than most bands putting out their debut album especially in the garage rock world and at its roots this record is a garage rock record recording wise it's a bit of a throwback the sound of the guitars the drums the vocals it's all very distorted very brittle it's somewhat low Phi there are some surf guitar style solos on here some very overwhelming noisy psychedelic rock guitar solos the vocals switch back and forth between this sort of haunting chilling vibrato and then screams that wouldn't feel too uncomfortable on like a hardcore punk record and then occasionally through the guitars we get these sort of eerie chilling horror movie theme melodies that would fit very nicely on like a cramps record or a misfits record which leaves a lot of these songs feeling kind of dark and depressing but also can't be an theatrical and fun - the playing is a little sloppy which occasionally leaves these guys feeling like a very loose and wild Cage the Elephant or maybe like screaming females or the OCS but it does add to the rough and gritty appeal of the music and it's not like it gets so loose and so messy that the song just kind of lose their flavor and their coherence and even though I understand the appeal of low fine music I do think this band could get a lot of its points across with a better recording with just a better balance of the vocals and the guitars and the drums and just some more low-end but despite that a lot of great moments still shine through in the track listing here thanks to the very ghoulish riffs and lyrics and very sinister tunes even the stay list and most familiar of riffs on this record being pulled from that 60s garage rock era are played with this electrifying youthful exuberance as if they're being laid to tape for the very first time like with the song burn out the bruise this track is like listening to a sort of goth doubt halloween-themed extreme in-your-face punk version of the white stripes in their earliest years or the song dig saw which has this amazingly badass explosive chorus riff psychobilly surf rock guitar leads vocals that are very pained and distant it's like listening to Black Lips but just sadder and kind of more wild-eyed and freakier but the band proves that they have some finesse to behind the very hard dark exterior like with the song white at midnight which has one of the most chilling guitar passages to open up any track on this LP it's just bats it's moonlight its cobwebs it really creeps in and the vocal harmonies over these guitars are wonderful as well some cuts on this record really are more dismal than others kind of like the song fragile male for sale which takes this classic hendrix groove and just sort of Punk's it out a little bit or the song part time model but as the album progresses which is really shows that they have a softer side the songs really just kind of slowed down a little bit the guitars the vocals go a little easier with the song weights and ties the band plays in three-four it's a bit of a waltz it's like they're playing for a zombie themed prom night and the melody on this track is dreamy it's lovely it's like listening to an Everly Brothers song but the shrill guitars and the kind of wild vocals still give it some edge and the song summer again which starts off like a really pretty track it feels very summery it's soft it's whimsical it's got a bit of a familiar vocal melody too it's very relaxing synthesizers but then the songs sadness really starts to pour through as it progresses the song just very slowly becomes more depressing and the closing track on this LP track 13 is in the style of an English folk tune maybe not the best song in the entire LP but it was nice for the band to take on an acoustic ballad it's kind of stereotypical for a rock band to put their softer songs toward the middle and the end of their record but it's a formula that these guys adhered to pretty well you know they went from hard to soft with highlights on both ends of this record my only issue really is that there are some songs in the second half that are a little more aggressive and just kind of feel not only unnecessary during this phase of the album but also a little redundant too when you consider that there are songs that sound kind of alike and the first half of the record in tone and delivery you know because the the lo-fi recording of these songs really does make a lot of these Tunes feel a little uniform at times still I think witches came through with an incredibly solid album with a lot of likeable tracks good playing good writing just overall again electrifying album with a strong strong dark horror theme to it there's something very occults about this band's approach to garage rock and punk that I find very appealing I'm feeling a strong 72 a light 8 on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music music music music music forever 
AOhs5HQdYkU,hi everyone hair thinning hair tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new shady records compilation shady XV shady 15 this is a collection of tracks from the 15 year old record label Shady Records spearheaded by hip hop phenom Eminem Marshall Mathers Slim Shady who I mean if you don't know who Eminem is at this point who for 15 years now Eminem and Shady Records have been a powerhouse in the music industry churning out numerous hits most of which are all over the second disc of this compilation however there is a first disc of this comp that is nothing but new material sort of looking at the present day and the future of Shady Records and sort of giving us a projection of what the label could hope to achieve and release into the future now I'm not going to be talking about this first disc of material all by myself I'm going to be talking about it with young up-and-coming reviewer the record spins aka mr. Stephen Francis him and I are going to talk about what we feel about the artists on this compilation that tracks the production all of that I will also be changing my shirt over here and putting on a hat as soon as we transition hey everyone here we are through the magic of the Internet with the record spins aka mr. Stephen Francis we have totally buried the hatchet with with the beef we had that one time we had some yeah that was really fun and I really appreciate it but I was fun yeah it was it got semi dangerous for a second there like I thought it was going to be some bloodshed yeah there might have been but we we decided to put our differences aside I mean here we are now you know yeah you know we credit ironmen we decided that there's enough room on YouTube for the both of us yeah and now we've come together to talk about this new Shady Records a compilation so it being the Eminem fan that you are I mean how do you feel about you know 15 years of shady and sort of the new material on this compilation because we're just going to talk about the new stuff alright I'm just I mean you know obviously the the hits are the the hits on the second disc and we're familiar with most of them but what do you feel about this newer material well I love what I was doing now and I mean I'm a younger viewer of Eminem because you know of my age so I wasn't around for like his prime but I love what he's doing and if I can compare him to the newer artists that are out here he's still the best to me mm-hmm you you be comparison in terms of like technical ability yeah I mean just his verses and I know some people say his courses aren't the best which I kind of agree with but his verses and just the way he can do what he does flow lyrically it's better than then the people right now and I can I can speak best for the other rappers out right now mm-hmm I mean I I agree to an extent and that's and that's the reason that I liked Marshall Mathers LP to uh so much and you know to the point where some people are like you know screw you Anthony you know I can't believe that you like this record um but I love that by the way while we're on that flow block there isn't much in terms of comparison with Eminem because Eminem is just of a different cloth you know he's just a different style um yeah you can see he has her technical ability than a lot of newer rappers out there right now um but I feel like he's not really trying to keep up with a lot of them in terms of sound or even songwriting which I feel he's got a vacuum obviously I mean he he doesn't have to I guess by his own standards but like for my taste I mean for me the opening track on this on this compilation was kind of a letdown uh in my opinion mostly because it's like he kind of throws out these really fast dizzying bars which I mean are totally cool if you're a battle rapper you know and that's and that's the kind of background that he comes from but it feels like he's just completely ignoring the l of songwriting and it feels like any instrumental could have been underneath him and it wouldn't have mattered you know on this particular track you know it's not like there's any kind of structure or anything to this song the only semblance of structures really just the beat which kind of goes through one phase after another but ours Eminem's rhyming on this track while his wordplay is detailed his rhymes are kooky and you know he's got the same personality that usually does uh I I guess I was just kind of like left out in the cold on this song he was kind of like to me a battle rapper going into the studio and trying to make a song for the first time it's like he completely ignored the LP structure and just like I don't know just just made for a really kind of an interesting song not uninteresting bars but like you said like you said that the beat doesn't matter when it when it comes to is Lear like that on this particular track you know especially with how the instrumental was mixed solo as almost as if the the beat was kind of a second thought right right well I well I felt like if he has a stronger B or something that was more yeah progressive or hard-hitting that it would have made the track a little bit better you know it was this a highlight for you on the record no definitely not no something that it passable for me yeah and that that's how I felt about a lot of tracks on the LP honestly I mean passable I didn't really care for the opener but um I thought psychopath killer was alright with yeah with them slaughter Harry Yelawolf was on there um the course of all melodramatic on this track but you know we got some good bars on this thing yeah I loved the course that was my favorite I love the darkness I'm like ah that's some of my favorite music is the darker instrumentation and just like the eeriness is was so sick to me I love that yeah the UM I thought the chorus could have been a little nastier but like the the topic and the rhymes on the track were so um they were so like murderous and you know Devia and and that's um that's a road that when Eminem goes down and now still do it with some really vivid um I guess uh imagery and you know it still feels kind of thrilling yeah well fine boy wolf on the course at this track I think he was a perfect fit for it um sometimes I feel like yellow wolf could get even a little annoying I love him on a feature typically and actually didn't mind him on the track on this record even though it wasn't like one of his bolder tracks I mean to me some of the solo tracks on this record the the d12 track the slaughterhouse track the yellow wolf track um to me they weren't bad moments on the compilation mostly because they felt a little bit more updated than a lot of what eminem was trying to do either on the tracks that he was featured on or on his solo tracks which I mean either kind of felt like he was sort of stuck in that battle rat mentality or he was kind of just trying to recreate past glories like with you know radio powerhouses that he had with them a monster and love the way my and Skylar Grey and Dido um I don't know if he really cared for that uh SIA track oh I do I love that fan yeah I mean to me that was just kind of like Eminem doing his usual radio hit formula again and you know without like you know like wow me any for any further than he has before I felt like but the radio is usually too poppy for me when heat it when he puts Rihanna on a track that's when it's too much for me but cioud it's is more raw to me yeah I mean she does have her own voice you know yeah so I liked that distinctiveness to her voice and that kind of tone down the radio kind of feel to it for me and that's why I was able to enjoy more I agree to an extent I mean she's definitely a rar singer like you said and her chorus is on this track were I I think they they were a little bit more um so you know it's not like they felt really dumbed down and straightforward you know she really had space to kind of do what she does vocal it didn't really feel like there was any pressure for rush through and create an ultra infectious chorus um but to me again it just kind of felt like Eminem trying to just plug a different singer into that usual formula he has for a radio it yeah but what would your take on them Vegas um you know the back the bad meets evil track it's it's kind of a track of sort of torn on I disliked it very much really yeah i I think that the lyrics were just cringe-worthy because of how just inappropriate I mean and the the effects that was put on Eminem's vocals that I got was one of those one of the biggest turn offs for me oh yeah why would you do shatter I just I don't understand why you look it just seemed like a little much for mm and considering its a bad meets evil cut I didn't really get the same level of chemistry that I did from some of the better cuts off of the EP the him and Roy stood together you know it didn't really seem like exciting to have them both on the same track and um uh yeah again with the distortion on the vocals on this track it was really just distracting and didn't really compliment Eminem's fast flow and to me the only saving grace about the song was that it had a concept although it did fall apart a little bit when Royce came in I guess it had a theme to it but I mean there wasn't really much else about it that you know uh made me enjoy it but I actually enjoyed Royce's verse better even though you're saying that he may not have held the theme together as well as you would have liked to have I I just liked what he did better than Eminem which is rare for me I mean obviously I would pick Eminem over anybody but I just thought he did better I don't know if you feel anything else on this compilation was a highlight but um the only other track that really stuck out to me was Detroit vs everybody yeah well that's an obvious one it didn't even stick out to me besides the fact that it was just Detroit artists right I mean and like if you really listen to him without all the background to it and the hype that it was Big Sean with Eminem for the first time and everything the transition from the verse verses to the chorus was just mixed up and everything I thought I didn't think that was smoother healthier because it was not that good of a chorus and um although although I did like the fact that the beat sort of changed flavors would have moved from one artist to another yeah I mean yeah I enjoy the verses but yeah I'm you know the rest of that song was then there for me yeah I mean um Eminem's versed where the end was pretty good I Royce kicked off the track really well a lot of my favorite again Big John Big Sean was tolerable and Danny Browns verse was awesome um I was awesome to hear Danny Brown know you were gonna say that oh I mean I thought I thought he was great on the track it was one of the better features he's done in a while I think you know I mean I think it really um did his best on that track and you know he came with a slightly different flow and I thought the be um complimented him in a really interesting way you know you got this really awesome break be as soon as he introduces and is introduced into the track and um you know he just says some really nasty ass shit about Detroit and it goes over really well uh but you know again I mean you know the the beat switches up super melodramatic when M&M comes in again with chorus that I don't really care for um it just seems like there are some moments of the track that are hyper aggressive and there are other moments of the track that are just kind of like I don't know um softer more emotional and and given the title of the track and all the names you have on it and sort of the theme of the track you know you want it to be frickin just a barnburner from beginning and you know it just felt like Detroit Detroit could have gone could have gone harder yeah you know plus I'm sure there are numerous Detroit artists who have killed to uh turn up on that track oh yeah the only other thing that I can think of is um hmm like to write for me I just want to throw that in there yeah that was one of Eminem solo cuts and that was one of my favorites probably behind psychopath killer yeah I think that that showed his battle flow a little bit but in a more um you know acceptable way with about like a better tune felt like a better track you know better song um you know I think my my least favorite pick you know not not my least favorite but but but the thing is what constantly kills some of these tracks for me is the production you know I really like the track die alone for example Eminem is like fantastic rapper when it comes to addressing introspective emotional personal issues mom especially on this track you know he's he's a really passionate rapper um but he for this song he just got a hold of like the corniest instrumental that he could have gotten his hands on and there's a moment in the middle of the track where like the guest vocals and the synths are mixed together so badly that you'd like person to it just comes together in a really noisy ugly way that I was not feeling that at all that instrumental and you know with with the the the new world of amazing producers we have out there right now really creative producers who I mean not only would you know uh do really well getting a guy like Eminem to endorse them um but also uh you know they could potentially bring Eminem a new sound and possibly breathe new life in his music um but instead he's picking beats like this that are literally awful to listen to oh yeah you know Eminem for his talented as he is in certain degrees um there are things that it just feels like because he cares so much about his flow um there are other elements to song creation that he just completely just throws out the window because he knows a people really want to hear his bars he knows people really really want to hear his flow and um he completely underestimates what he does on the instrumental side of things and I feel like maybe this is something he was a little more conscious of on math on Marshall Mathers LP 2 because he would not want to fuck that up right you know and he and he wanted to deliver the best project that he could it was cleared it yeah yeah and you know any any most definitely did but I feel like now that the sequel pressure is gone he's kind of fallen back to just putting out a lot of songs that are just kind of okay yeah and what's up with that well I I don't know I mean I think mmm is he has his own style he has his own I hope has a way that he likes to do things and um you know as a result um it kind of makes him set his ways sometimes you know um and where else you get the best producers in the game yeah you know I mean to me somebody like Kanye for example is always open to change always open to doing what's trendy always open to experimenting and doing something different and you know that has its pitfalls too um you know whereas Eminem is kind of the opposite I mean as far as rap standards go right now he's kind of old-fashioned Oh mm and I really can I appreciate that the fact that I does that what are you feeling on this on this track I'm this a compilation you know score wise well yeah we're gonna have to discuss the rating system I like this please do your rating system by ratings list the hunger rating system here okay on my rating system I do the you know the a B or C grades I mean I feel an a-minus on this day - you're really you're really loving it yeah well yeah I mean yes there are skippable tracks you know the amount of tracks that I would go back to listen to outweighs the ones that I would pass yeah I I mean that the ones I feel that I would go back and listen to our psychopath killer yeah a few of the tracks between you know d12 slaughterhouse yellow wolf and um as much as I don't care for for all of it um I still thought that Detroit versus everybody was a standout uh but other than that there were tons of tracks on here that I didn't like at all and they were just um you know a lot of passable tracks - you know songs that to me just felt like this compilation is supposed to be a celebration of shady as a brand in the current state of hip-hop and also sort of celebrating it as something that has been kind of a force with all these great hit tracks that we remember from the past and um to me like this newer material pales in comparison weh-weh just just so much in comparison to the old stuff and it just kind of seems like to me there's a lot of inconsistency here and like you know the the current state of Shady doesn't like sound that fantastic to me it's not like this compilation uh gets me excited for the future this record label when given how much new material is on here you know really should it kind of seems like that's the message that they're trying to sell you know it's like we've been here for this long and here's what we're selling like now here's a reason to be excited here's what we're going to be doing in the future and to me a lot of this newer material kind of just sounds like you know either just forgettable stuff or things Eminem has already done in the past but better so I mean I'm really feeling like a strong forward to a high five on this thing oh no oh yeah it's completely fine we got different perspectives on this thing and that's why I brought you over here because that's what I wanted um I'm gonna leave a link in the description where you can check out Stephen Francis's YouTube channel and see his reviews for yourself and yeah that's it Anthony Pantano the needle drop the record spins shady 15 compilation review forever 
okO1JmqEIUU,hi everyone don't say hate Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and now that it's the beginning of December it's time to look back on November and talk about some great albums some great music that was released this past month and yeah just gonna be discussing my favorite releases we are not going to do a great albums and songs of December obviously because the music industry is winding down this month thanks to this week coming up which is going to be later this month going to be talking about my favorite EPS albums singles of this year and yeah after that we're gonna be doing classics week I'm gonna be talking about classic records gonna be doing classic reviews let's get into it handful of Records here first the new full of hell and MERS vow collaboration it's titled after their collaboration a grueling combination of hardcore punk metal sludge metal doom metal some grindcore to power violence and noise this thing is as fast and and and and then brutal as it is abrasive it's really grating on the ears but also visceral exciting invigorating pummeling crushing it's pretty short but a very memorable experience even though it is brief very head bashing brick to face next in my opinion pop album of the year Ariel Pink's pom-pom lo-fi synth pop very I guess shiny pretty catchy but also kind of goofy and silly and playful as well it's a very well crafted well put together detailed pop album that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't have an overly produced commercial sound that totally sucks the soul out of the equation next I have to give it to the new dean Blunt album black metal one of the most interesting quirky varied and kind of off-the-wall singer/songwriter records I've heard this year it's kind of minimal kind of simplistic in its build and it's instrumentation a few songs on here are based off of samples of other songs and despite its skeletal nature its simplicity its straightforwardness it's really beautiful it's a beautiful record even though it is kind of just amateurish in its performance and it's just delivery there's something kind of alluring and odd about this record and there's most definitely a theme coming through with a lot of the lyrics referencing loneliness and isolation and finally wild birds and peace drums come back with another fantastic record the album rhythm it is mostly just vocals and drums which may seem odd to you if you've never heard of this group before but they are incredibly talented musicians and managed to fill a lot of that open space with some great singing and some great percussion and even without a lot of backing instrumentation this manages to be a great art pop record that embraces the tenants of soul and jazz and blues among other things I also want to give it up to the mr. wazoo album and the new Deerhoof record as well and those are pretty much my album picks for the month of November down there in the description box I will also be putting an updated list of my favorite songs of this year so far - so you can see my favorite albums and my favorite songs so far this year and yeah transition if you've given any of these albums listen what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it what are some of your favorite albums from November and what are you looking forward to then December and are you excited for the list week forever 
D9SbjbFwaek,I'm in love with the cold gold I like to drink it source all the stories where I bad it it's a hundred percent chat click oh hi everyone company co'tin oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new a Safford mixtape Ferg forever ASAP ferg is a New York rapper and a completely unexpected rising star within the ASAP mob an East Coast hip-hop outfit led by rapper ASAP rocky whose career totally took off after the release of singles that would later land on his Live Love ASAP mixtape which I reviewed very positively but one of my least favorite tracks on this tape was the song that ASAP ferg appeared on and it was my least favorite song on the tape because of his appearance he turned in what was easily the worst feature on the entire project so of course not being able to escape the irony of my own opinion ASAP ferg would be the first member of the ASAP mob outside of ASAP rocky to drop a solo project after the popularity rise of the ASAP mob and not only would ASAP ferg be the first to drop a project after ASAP rocky but I liked it there was great production on trapped Lord and even though ASAP ferg had some terrible tracks on this thing and he's not really a serious serious lyricist I do find his rhymes entertaining I think he has flow I think he has a lot of versatility he has a sense of humor and personality which is more than I can say for many rappers out there right now for sure singles like work and Shaba may be dumb infectious fun but there's also something kind of creative and weird and playful about these songs too now after the release of trap Lord forgave through in the next year with a rush of features on a load of different albums artists like subtract and the new ariana grande LP he appeared on a Higham remix as well as in the new chromeo music video he did a track with Big KRIT onyx now this coming year seems like Berg is going to be amping up for another album cycle and he's teasing toward that album cycle with the release of a new DJ drama hosted gangsta grillz mixtape Ferg forever now if you've heard ASAP Ferg's music and I recommend that that you try it you know he's on some weird shit and with Ferg forever I'm kind of wondering and slightly worried how weird Ferg is going to get with even less pressure to turn in a commercial project there are 19 tracks on this thing and in the run time there are bangers there are oddities there are duds and there are some meaningful moments - personally I wasn't that hyped on the singles leading up to this project we had this side with yg whose feature on that track was just totally throwaway and the hook on this thing was kind of boring as well the only saving grace of the song was Ferg's kind of schizophrenic two-faced flow and the theme of the track which was gang violence and sort of growing up around that and the song dough active which found Ferg on top of an electro trap fusion instrumental but the lyrics make absolutely no sense they're completely incoherent which Ferg readily admits in the lyrics themselves I do like his energetic flow and and the instrumental does bang but it's just not the kind of flavor I look for in a Ferg track however the very next track on this LP which is segwayed into by doe active dope walk is produced by the same producer and I think it's a better track mostly because of it being the weirdest thing I've heard on a rap record this year there are these weird noisy sped-up rhythms that just cut into the track suddenly that just feel like they're straight out of an Atari Teenage Riot record ASAP ferg is reaching like old dirty bastard levels of insanity on these two tracks this project features a pretty diverse array of producers we have Big KRIT claims casino Mike will among many others and we get a series of beats that are eerie and sort of dark and reverb and trap flavored like many instrumentals off of trap Lord than other tracks just feel like underground club hits there's a dancehall flavored track it's nice to hear that Ferg isn't completely abandoning that genre outside of Shaba his love for this genre isn't just a one-night stand of course with crate in the mix there are some southern hip hop flavored tracks some cloud wrap on here as well and there's a pretty impressive feature list to yg like I said earlier whose feature I don't care for but his name is going to grab eyes we also have m.i.a on here ASAP nast scissor Twista Tina Shea as well as underground rapper Marty baller and rapper songwriter producer Krystal Keynes who is all over this project now this tape has a pretty inconspicuous start with song perfume it's a hard-hitting instrumental but a recycled flow and some recycled lyrics and references that we've already heard on trappler it's kind of like a bit of a musical chop suey but then the tape really bounces back with the track jungle which features a hard-hitting massive beat just huge sub bass and Ferg comes through with those schizophrenic flows giving the impression that he's not just one but two three four five different rappers it's a visceral song it's kind of catchy not really a game-changer or anything like that but decent for a piece of mixtape music but then we get Fergus omneya favorite track on the tape weird squeaky synth loop going over and over and over bird goes in st. natural high a familiar flow but a new level of energy and twist his feature on this thing is killer I wouldn't say there's anything incredibly deep or sort of different or new from Ferg Larrick Lee on this track though he does continue to be a funny sort of entertaining personality but then on the song Bonnaroo he gets kind of serious and introspective and reflective though I'm not really that big of a fan usually of tour tracks performance songs this one is pretty good it's got a decent beat from Big KRIT which feels like a sort of slightly revised version of an instrumental I'm already very familiar with from him Ferg brings a pretty relaxed floo and proves that he can spin a narrative just like any other rapper can and he tells a pretty vivid story of his performance at Bonnaroo referencing songs that he thinks are fantastic referencing artists that he looks up to and it's pretty compelling even if it is just an account of a performance and then with the song uncle fantastic track it features a clams casino beat that samples Bjork's pagan poetry and it's got a pretty moving story even if some of Ferg's lyrics on this track are kind of crude as he describes this very toxic relationship he has with his uncle and there are some other tracks on here as well that dive deep into personal problems and narratives like commitment issues as well as thug cry and the song this side too even if I do think the yg feature and the hook on that track are pretty weak in the closing track to takut which does have one of the weaker flows on the entire mixtape but fur does try to do his best to give his feelings on the whole Ferguson thing going on right now there are a few middle-of-the-road tracks in the track listing here kind of like the song now or the track weaves which has a pretty hefty reference to back that ass up my favorite parts on this tape are when the tape is is going overboard like I said earlier like on the song reloaded which is kind of a revision of one of my favorite tracks off trap Lord let it go but the whole tape gets completely ridiculous on the last few tracks especially with the ja Rule track with Big Sean don't care for that Big Sean feature you already know how I feel about Big Sean da but it's almost like they're kind of breaking ja rules balls a little bit on this track I can't completely like put my finger on it but just the way the hook is sung it just seems really comedic and silly and I feel like on this track more than any other track on this mixtape Ferg's crush on little B is is very much showing and as obvious as that is I do like the fact that we do have a commercial artist out there who is very much indebted and and very much a fan of the bass God and the song real thing with sizzurp horrible singing this track it is a love song but but like little b4 it's amateurish feel there is something kind of endearing about it too and the beat is like Chromeo and little dragon collaborating and then sort of travelling back to the 80s overall I really like this tape although I can't say I came into it really expecting a whole lot to me this project was a taster it was a taste of what is to come and it's definitely a good taste it's not blowing my mind it's not you know sort of making me rethink Ferg or anything like that I guess if I was worried about anything going into first next record I was thinking man is he going to continue to be weird is he going to continue to be out there and kind of push that insanity and this tape was basically confirmation that he is in a genre where people are constantly portraying themselves as confident confident confident Ferg seems to be one of the few MCS out there right now who is not self-conscious and that is what I think continues to make him one of the most exciting new faces in hip-hop right now I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing Tran 
5QhXTgpazuI,hi everyone come at me bro tano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new self-titled Clark album Clark is the last name / kind of pseudonym of a UK electronic music producer who has been at it releasing full-length LP is originally under his full name in the early 2000s and he's had some decent creative notable releases over the years through Warp Records like body riddle and totems Flair and turning dragon albums that feature a pretty diverse collection of tracks indulging in techno and house and Glitch IDM on Clark's last full-length LP which was not a favorite of mine but still on this record he creatively fused his typical synthetic electronic style with folk music acoustic instrumentation but with this latest LP of his he seems to be heading back into more familiar territory again we are getting IDM we are getting techno and tech house we are getting numerous styles of underground electronic music influencing Clark's sounds here both overtly and subtly and even though Clark can be a great emulator and his talents are unquestionably varied he's never really struck me as the most bold or distinct producer and and that can sometimes inspire some sort of nondescript tracks and that occurs on this new album as well like with song winter Lynne one of the opening tracks on this LP this track has some great drum Tambor's and some fantastic synth Tambor's as well something that would fit really nicely behind a new wave anthem but the chord progression to this track the chord progression that this song just cycles through again and again and again is so tedious it's like watching grass grow the mixing and the Soundcraft on this record overall are pretty above-average it's just sometimes the compositional component of this record that ends up feeling a little drab there are loads of tracks on this LP that meet with abrupt endings or there some segue tracks on this thing that don't really inspire much of anything except a breather in between songs that were only mildly interesting to begin with for example the song unfurl o which starts with really good intentions it's got these really quick nimble distant reverb melodies just bouncing against a driving house B it's the stuff IBM fantasies and dreams are made of but the song doesn't really wow me until its second half where Clarke introduces these just booming huge massive Orchestra sized bass leads that kind of sound like horns and there's some really sleek counterpoint coming through with some additional synthesizers it's a beautiful moment conversely the song sodium trimmers grips me right from the start it's like some cold hard nosed leather clad tech house with a mean look on its face the driving rhythms are awesome it's all about business and then at the halfway point I get these string loops that sound like the moans of a diseased animal on its last breath which at the start of its introduction seems like an interesting idea but with repetition it just gets more and more stale the song banjo moves in a similar direction but actually stays pretty tasteful and completely opts out of a goofy loop but easily one of the best tracks on this entire LP is grit in the Pearl this track is pretty imaginative I think it's got a driving 4/4 beat and this oddly grooved synth lead that just defies logic and once the low-end the base of this track kicks in it's just so oh and what's the bass the low end kicks in on this track it's just like a sonic orgasm it's so hard and it's just blissful and the way the song ends is incredibly interesting it just everything loses touch with itself in terms of just tempo and lockstep and everything like that it's just you're listening to the music disintegrate before your very ears it's like the song itself is broken apart into 600 pieces and yet it's still existing it's still pulsating it's still alive toward the back end of the LP there's also a very valiant seven-minute techno Odyssey that leaves the album off on a pretty good note even if the album's closer is a kind of underwhelming electronic ambient piece overall this this album is decent there are tracks on here that I loved their tracks on here that I just thought were all right there Maxon here that just did nothing for me whatsoever it's not that Clark isn't talented it's not that he doesn't have ideas it's that everything on this record in terms of potential just seems to be sacrificed in the name of variety let's do a little bit of this a little bit of that a little bit of this other thing a little bit the other thing uh no two tracks in the track listing here sound exactly alike for sure but there are tracks on here that severely seemed outweigh others in terms of quality in an entertainment value I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it you have to be Fantana music music music music music forever 
Zfwb4JxJU7M,hi everyone here can Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new and e-stat record VPP faith in strangers Andy Scott is a uk-based electronic music producer this I believe is his third full-length album under this name he has been releasing records since the mid-2000s but it hasn't been until recently that his very minimal atmospheric textured and moody approach to techno music has caught on through EPS like stay together and passed me by and his full length album that dropped in 2012 luxury problems and I really dug the haunting melodies and the hypnotic rhythms off of this LP and even though Andy was making techno music I like the fact that he came through with a very clear appreciation for ambient music - now since the release of this record Andy has remained relatively silent musically outside of a one-off collaboration with Myles Whitaker under the pseudonym Millie and Andrea we're together they not only made techno music but they explored into other genres like Juke and jungle songs with much peppier and busier beats than we are used to hearing from Andy at least from his new stuff anyway and now that Andy is going back to putting out soul material I expected him to go back into dark bleak territory with his music and he does do that but I think he continues to explore as well in some ways Andy's music on this record is darker it's cloudier it's more subterranean but he continues to genre Bend as well with a few exceptions the very driving hypnotic rhythms of luxury problems are kind of melting away faith in strangers is a slower base your record sometimes a Trippier record it's like listening to Andy Scott as you've known him thus far on cough syrup take the intro track on this LP for example it really sets up the tone of the album if you're not a patient music listener if you're not someone who values atmosphere and mood over energy and viscera you might be turned off by this track and just want to head back in the other direction it's just a series of very slow-moving Basie kind of sludgy synth chords they're beautiful but they're very gargantuan when and weighty - it's like listening to uh just a monolith of sonic movement occur at a very molasses-like pace then comes the song violence I love this track I'll the very icy burnt fuzzy and kind distorted lead melody that plays throughout this song they're these disembodied female vocals all over the track that sound kind of gorgeous but also very eerie and just choked and held back a little bit and the song seems influenced by dubstep music and I'm not talking about burial though I do think the atmospheric vocals and just kind of the spaciousness of these productions will most definitely make people compare this to some of his reason EPS I'm talking about contemporary popular dubstep with the heavy bass the noisy drops in a way this song reminds me of that with it's very slow pace and it's just massive distorted subterranean tones it's kind of like listening to a dubstep drop slowed down 500% slathered in reverb and then complemented with some kick drums that feel like they're being pulled out of the industrial music side of things it's a real amalgamation of ideas but it just sounds like one cohesive thing and I love it then we get an oath and equally patient song but stylistically I feel like Andy is going in a little bit more of a downtempo direction on this track reminding me of Portishead during some moments I like the instrumental it's beautiful it's ultra subtle constantly progressing and ascending at just a snail's pace and just with very very minor tweaks as it goes along although I'm not really sure if I love the vocals on this track as much as on the previous song they don't really seem to carry the track quite as well stay entertaining from the beginning to the end of the song Andy goes a lot bolder in the middle of this LP with tracks like no surrender attractive feature some really distorted synthesizer arpeggios and some really grimy sampled percussion and kick drums though it is kind of a disjointed track that takes a while to get going then we get Science and Industry which has the fastest rhythm and even though Andy is showing that he has more variety on this record than he did on luxury problems which one of my main issues with that record I'm not really sure I'm into these songs as anything more than just changes of pace in the tracklist of this album there's not really all that much in terms of replayability for me in these songs while I like andis really minimal and skeletal approach to producing music the thing about that is there's really nothing to hide behind so if nothing interesting is going on pretty much everything that one of these songs has to offer is already out there right in front of you there isn't that much to explore through but even when the composition or the structure of one of these tracks isn't really doing that much for me I still come through these songs loving the sound and the aesthetic just the atmosphere around these tracks faith and strangers is is beautifully desolate then we get the song how it was which is maybe kind of a self reference here we see Andy going back to techno on this song but with maybe a thicker layer of distortion that some of his fans may be used to which might be a bit of a turn-off if you like his more ethereal material the song feels aged and tattered and in primal it feels like an artefact that came from a very far away place far in distance and in time we have an ambient song that ends the record off we get a bit of ambient techno too in the tracklist here in the song damage is a legit track banger even if it is kind of syrupy and slowed down and loaded with distortion it's kind of like listening to a an ultra oblique stark version of a tonight song but the copious amounts of distortion compiled with Stotts trend towards simplicity doesn't really leave that much in terms of detail on this track so if you want your banger here just very simple and burnt to a crisp that's what you're going to get this album is is almost an hour in length but it feels so much shorter for some reason and it's not a bad record it's a decent follow-up to luxury problems as I mentioned earlier most definitely solves that issue of feeling one-dimensional and he explores a number of different genres on this record and he finds that in the process of doing that he can apply his reverb he can apply his minimalism just about anywhere and come through with a record that feels pretty cohesive the issue is some of Andy's experiments into various genres work better than others and when that happens the tracks do get a little underwhelming they don't really turn awful but it does keep every moment of this record from feeling like a highlight I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should give you next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh and you stop dog barking forever 
yfLG6UBCSEU,
mAR0nohgf_k,hi everyone Hudson II kissed Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new TV on the radio record seats these guys are a fantastically talented New York indie rock outfit they've been at it for years some of their best stuff dropped in the 2000s and they put out another record in 2011 I believe nine types of light reviewed that not a favorite of mine in their discography certainly likeable good singles on this thing some highlights and the deep cuts but a lot of songs on this thing paled in comparison to others just some generally uninspiring songs in my opinion on this record not quite as electrifying as their two previous albums a bit of a smoother album if you will and on this latest record of theirs they seem to be undergoing yet another change the music on this new record of theirs takes a kind of electronic direction however I will not be exploring my opinion and the music on this record by myself in this particular review I have invited Joel of the daily guru a fellow music critic and music fan music observer to talk with me about this album I will be changing my shirt and the screen as soon as I transition here we are Anthony Fantana with Joel of The Daily Guru and we are we are gonna chop it up here about this new TV on the radio album seeds via the magic of the internet you know what was your first impression of this album when when quartz came on opening track of this record the first very first second of this record I said to myself that is one of the most abrasively annoying album openers ever just the sound has nothing to do with the song but just those opening notes I just like the synthesizers they're just the barrage of noise that is the first 10 seconds of this record I was I I was very mad at it and I said wow starting an album like that is kind of like it's kind of like a kid throwing a temper tantrum just so you'll notice that he's there and I felt like that's what they trying to do I thought it was an unnecessary opening and then went into a song that kind of had nothing to do with that opening it did and it was a weird opening but the song itself was pretty easygoing yeah yeah it it slides and then the whole you know a majority of the album is kind of more restrained if you will it's not as in your face until you get to a couple tracks on the second half that they're like oh we're gonna plug in and rock for a bit ya know it's it's it's true in comparison with their last record and their best stuff in the 2000s this album is kinda toned down which when I first started listening to it was sort of a huge turnoff I don't know if it kind of made it hard for you on the first few listens I mean it wasn't that's not what was a turn-off for me I I didn't mind it I said okay you know clearly they have a lot of reasons they're gonna go in a slightly different direction and for no other reason than they're creative guys I'm totally fine with it and know the fact that it was a different sound wasn't what turned me off initially it was actually the sound itself that turned me off III felt that and and let's just jump into possibly my biggest issue with the record the vocals are way out in front of everything else to a point where I felt they almost dulled the rest of you know everything they were doing under it all the synth work all the sampling everything you almost couldn't access it because the vocals were so in-your-face I I think it's maybe more in-your-face for a TV on the radio record and I think that's mostly because their instrumentation typically is pumped up a little bit more and on these tracks not quite as much and we're getting a lot more synthesizers and electronic drums on these songs and a lot of these songs melodically and structurally I do like but sometimes these electronic sounds that they're bringing it to the table instead the song courts the opener is an example and the following track careful you as well the choruses are so anemic it's like when they switch from the verse to the chorus the the the drums don't change or the since don't really get any louder it's like a lot of the time with the exception of those hard rocking tracks for the backend that you mentioned the instrumentation is just so drab and just hanging in the background and I mean the vocals being up so from I don't really mind as long as I like the tune you know I like the song at the core of courts but there are some tracks that it seems like the vocal melody and the song itself is just so dumbed down and so like insipid I guess for TV on the radio yeah you know I'm used to them having a really good overall balance I think that's what it is you know whether whether whichever of those great kind of mid mid career if you will albums you want to look at the balance is always there you can you can spend a little time sonically with each instrument order or the vocals nothing really overpowers it I felt like everything just kind of blended together and like a giant pile of and you know it just it was it just became noise to me and the the way that the tracks kind of flow into one another is usually a good thing that cohesive a flow where you can't tell where one track ends in the next begins but in this one it was like one really long boring song I I think but as I listen deeper to the record it didn't so much feel like that to me not because it felt like all the songs were the same but because there wasn't much about these tracks sort of like demanding my attention from the beginning to the end I mean I guess it sort of felt like a long boring song in that link by the time the next song started you had forgotten the previous one had been playing the whole time at least that's how it was on my first listen but I mean the next few tracks on here do make a change could you and one of the big singles from this day happy idiot do feature more lively instrumentation especially happy idiot although these tracks to me aren't really great song wise they kind of fix what the issue I'm having is with some of the newer some of the more electronically driven tracks but the song underneath this more lively rock instrumentation isn't really doing anything for me I mean happy idiot to me seems like something TV on the radio or even black party would have done better in the mid-2000s you know what I kept writing down was where are the hooks because there were things that were supposed to be hooks but they didn't do it they didn't actually like you know get me say no yeah that's a really cool progression or like singing along or taking interest in what they were doing they were trying but they just didn't work I I agree you know and I think it has mostly to do with the aesthetic of this record and it just seems like they consciously tried to make a stiffer record like they wanted to go in a more electronic direction they wanted to pull the live instrumentation out of the equation for what benefit I don't know you know that and that's the thing I haven't figured out the benefit of that yet you know because the thing is the electronics that they provide instead of this more lively instrumentation a lot of the time it's just really like bland and really stereotypical for a lot of these indie acts that try to fuse electronics into their music in the 2000s and in the past four years as well and the results weren't that great like rah rah riot or something like that you know just like really middle-of-the-road stuff was there anything positively or negatively about this album in terms of like a specific song and just like stuck out to you is like a highlight or I I think it was the second and third songs together that I was like okay like I kind of dig those and then I think it was was it winter way way at the end when they when they actually start turning things up I think it was I think it was the track winter yeah well they put that nice classic fuzz sound on the guitars I was like okay yeah I can I like this more than what you were doing before and and you know they they they dig in for two tracks but then they're like okay that was fun let's let's go back to what we really want to do and if this is the direction they want to go in you know I have nothing to say there I just I don't think it's a very smart idea if they want to have a successful career from here on out yeah I mean winter is definitely a part where they turn it up I'm not in love with the song there but I think the song laser ray right after that track is so much better it's like a really great just clean-cut sort of electronically tension power pop tune there are some other tracks that I think are really interesting I like the song ride which had like a lot of songs on here seem to function on this idea that hey we're going to come up with a really simple idea and kind of like progressively intensify it very subtly as the song moves along as opposed to verse explosion on the chorus verse another explosion there and ride is definitely one of those songs that I think did that positively like instrumental you remind me of tracks from like David Bowie's heroes or lo where you have these repetitive songs and then by the end of the track it just you know it just feels kind of massive and yeah I know like sort of an ambitious you know comparison but that's where you know either in that or krautrock is sort of where the room of that sense you know did they directly look at Bowie to do it I don't know but I thought that that was at least one of the better executions and that was a song test pilot that track I didn't really mind either some of the things that underwhelmed me on the back end of this record were a few of the balance because it just felt like was bringing the electronics into the fold you didn't get the subtlety or the finesse that you would want in a ballad you know but to me test pilot was one of the few moments where that ended up happening where you had these like really sour sharp shrill distorted chords placed together with the very mournful vocals and I thought it kind of created a very desolate sort of a soundscape kind of lenka when Radiohead and Thom Yorke had been doing lately with with some of their stuff although there was something this is this is another ridiculous comparison but there was something about the vocal melody on that track they kind of reminded me of Lisa Loeb stay like it just reminded me of something like sad dreary 9ds acoustic ballad or something I can't explain it I totally can't explain it it was probably like just the the flow of the dead in it you know sort of the flow of the the melody the vocal melody but just something about stay just just it just felt like those these songs are like kindred spirits in some way well I'll let you have your early 90s moment with whatever reason you know I think you know there there is a mood here and they get that mood and that mood does stick the entire time that kind of you know like you said desolate you know that most these tracks are pretty cold and that's not a bad thing for me I don't feel a lot of oriented what was it a lot of them feel romance yeah you know and obviously there there are strong undertones to this album you know you know death in the band and obviously they're trying to figure out their new direction and everything and and that's why I give this album a bit of a break because I think you do have a band in transition trying to figure out their new identity and maybe this is just them stepping up to the plate swing and just saying look we want to get something out we'll see where this sound ends up as this you know I'm hoping that this is more of a starting point of discovering this is a band i genuinely enjoy and you know overall it was just like I felt like it a lot of points are saying hey look at what we just did where were they're like oh did you see that hear that cool sound we just made happen and they were trying to force the issue a bit too much I I suppose you know it's it's not really for me that I think this is a bad direction and I think it's that way for you either but it just feels like it's so many parts it could have been better just really it could have been more interesting because you know when when the album isn't doing something interesting it kind of feels like just a lesser than or an offshoot of another indie tronic act that's bringing guitars into the fold or like summer in rainbows era Radiohead the only track on here that like struck me as being like irredeemably awful was love stained I don't know if that song stuck out to you as well this album actually I I hate to say it most of this album actually fell into that category for me irredeemably bad I just I it is a rare occasion that I have this much difficulty getting through a dozen spins of a record because I I so so much just did not enjoy it but really any extended period of time there were you know a minute here a minute there but I really had to endure this record I did not like it at all well personally I could say was that bad for me you know I mean the a great deal of the songs here I just felt like maybe the worst thing about them is that they would start off very minimally and it would be a very simple sound and it would seem decent for an introduction but then as it went along and failed to introduce some newer or more interesting ideas the the baths would just get cold you know love stain was a track I couldn't tolerate from beginning to end it not only started off sounding like a track from the last Muse record but then once the chorus kicked in which is one of the few explosive courses on the record the drums the since and the vocals don't even line up like not even in terms of just the tempo but it doesn't even feel like the vocals are on pitch with what's going on with the synthesizers and the vocal melody is absolutely terrible I have no idea what was going on with that track it's it's just like a really ugly song there's there's no other way to to look at it other than that like you know it's it's just something to gawk out like you know something kind of deformed you're like oh my god what is happening here you know but but of the songs that I didn't like the I just kind of felt like that they would just fall into the background for me not really stir up any negative emotions or anything like that but just you know merely just fall to the wayside and in my head yeah you know no none of the tracks you really engaged me like you said but we're at where it got frustrating for me it's because since none of them did you know I was like I'd rather be listening to something else right now yeah and because you know I try and find that silver lining in this cloud of turds I'm just gonna hope that the fact that this album is called seeds is jealous I'm gonna go ahead and read a ton into the title of this album that they're just saying look this is our new starting point we are we are going to put these out there and and water them in whatever metaphorical way you want and they will grow into what the band is going to sound like in subsequent records that this is really this is what's in the dirt that they want to bury and wait for something better to come out of i I'm gonna hope for the same thing personally I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing I don't know where you are I'm gonna go ahead and give him a I'm gonna give him a three because I'm gonna give him a point because I like the album cover no I'm gonna give them a point because they play their instruments well yeah I'm gonna give them a point because I think they're genuinely good people so I'll give them a three and and there we are anthony Fantana and joel of the daily guru we just hash it out on the new TV on the radio album seeds what did you think of this album did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and let me know also head over to youtube.com/scishow daily guru and check out Joel's channel as well and we'll be talking about more albums in the future not sure when but it'll be here the question aware is is no longer question it's right here it's gonna happen right here alright cool TV on the radio seeds forever

ZyzFR9bCT_E,hi everyone Gwang ffunny Fantana MoBay here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Pink Floyd album the endless river this is the latest full-length album from seminal art rock psychedelic rock progressive rock band Pink Floyd few artists have contributed as many seminal albums to the pantheon of rock music as Pink Floyd Piper at the Gates of Dawn metal Saucerful of Secrets animals the wall atom heart mother wish you were here Dark Side of the Moon I would just recommend you listen to some if not all of these albums because in a single video it's impossible to do justice the immense artistic impact the music here has had however artistically Pink Floyd kind to hit the skids in the 80s which is nothing to be ashamed of because it's something that many progressive rock acts suffered through as they transitioned into that decade from the 60s and 70s and I wouldn't say Pink Floyd's descent was as hard as some other bands we have the final cut where we saw Roger Waters really sort of stepping forward as a singer-songwriter it was a much larger symphonic element to some of the songs on this record but by the time Pink Floyd came out with a momentary lapse of reason new wave and synth pop was in full swing and hair metal hard rock too and this showed up in the drum sounds the grooves Richard Wright's keyboards the very springy thin echoes laid onto numerous pieces of instrumentation in the mix Plus this album also saw the departure of Roger Waters and unlike Syd Barrett leaving Pink Floyd in the late 60s this was a lineup change that the band never really bounced back from artistically though I do give credit to Gilmour right in Mason for dropping a better record with Division Bell some of the production here was a little too clean some of the big voiced choruses were kind of a turn-off but sonically and stylistically this was the closest the band ever got to their 70s sound once again which is nice if you like that sound it's certainly a better alternative than what the band was doing throughout much of the 80s but still Pink Floyd has always been one of those fantastic bands that has progressed and progressed and progressed and for them to just kind of do a 180 and decide that well we're just going to go back as good as some of the moments on Division Bell were it was a little bittersweet in their late era albums Pink Floyd never really sold out or dumbed down their sound or anything like that in my opinion they just really failed to make their sound translate in a new musical era and that's all so with that in mind what hope does Pink Floyd have of coming out with another great album in 2014 especially since the recent and unfortunate passing of Richard Wright and we also have to take into account that much of the material here was recorded during that Division Bell era the foundation of this album is very rocky it's very tattered but the remaining members of Pink Floyd do a somewhat decent job of weaving these varied instrumental parts together into something kind of coherent this album essentially is a four part series consisting of mostly instrumentals one of the few tracks to break that streak is louder than words which is one of the final tracks here and it's apparently the album's big single it's a very gentle slow-moving rock song with the usual chord progressions and guitar flourishes that you would usually catch on a Floyd song it sounds like it would fit very snugly into the Division Bell playlist but it's not really that harrowing or climactic of a song certainly not anything you could Center the album around or call a definitive ending how endless River defines itself mostly is is by its instrumental character you have some tracks on this LP that are three four maybe six minutes in length but that is what is few and far between here most of the songs here are like around one or two minutes and they're all kind of strung together into these sides of the album that sort of sound like they complement each other pretty well maybe there was a point at which all of these various songs were their own separate pieces and kind of scattered maybe rough sketches or ideas for what would become more fully fleshed out song and even if that's the case all the shorter than two minutes tracks on side three of the cell P actually come together pretty well I would say there are only a few moments where the segues from one track to another aren't really that smooth and some of the songs here kind of feel like they're building up to a climax that never really occurs maybe it would have been written if Pink Floyd as the quartet that they were in the 70s pulled it together and really try to finish these songs off but we don't get that instead we get these kind of short instrumental tidbits some of which feel like kind of vast explorative synth escapes that are kissed with kind of mournful guitar leads these instrumentals have kind of a new-age s vibe to them and then there are other songs here that are just really straightforward late 70s rock grooves that would have fit in as a good segue or building point on a Floyd album some of the tiny instrumental tidbits here feel like just classic Pink Floyd others are just very ambient and explorative and are very dark kind of like the song skins which oddly enough feels maybe just a little bit like post rock but then there are songs on here like a nice Eno which is sort of like a sax led piano Jam that kind of feels like it would be on a Vangelis soundtrack or something like that Chariots of Fire but with kind of a bright heavenly modern Christian gospel rock thing going on overall I came out enjoying a vast majority of what was going on here even knowing that yeah it was just kind of maybe a mess at some point and maybe at one point there was a bit of a debate as to whether to leave these tapes as is and just release into the public or maybe turn them into something like this and I think doing the former would have just been not that interesting because there's not much on this album in terms of like a new or fresh idea if you're familiar with lay 70's 80's and 90's Pink Floyd you've heard nearly everything they have to offer on this record but as a cohesive well segwayed and put together album this experience isn't that bad it's kind of just like peering in into the final instrumental ideas of one of progressive rocks greatest bands I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what did you think what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Pink Floyd endless River forever 
1vBkD8S8kNU,shut up I'm a shark hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music shark and it's time for a review of the new mega ton Leviathan record past 21 beyond the Arctic cell Thunder dome of doom Megaton Leviathan is a Portland based metal band this is their second full-length LP and just gonna cover this record I anticipated doom metal or at least just something that is slow and brooding and kind of dreary and Atmospheric and I did certainly get that when I gave this album a listen proof that you can sort of judge things by their cover sort of however I did not expect this record to have such good production and brings such passionate melodies to the table and a wall of extra instrumentation backing up those heavy guitars and drums this record is for songs that number up to 40 minutes altogether so there are some lengthy tracks here 13 minute songs eight minute songs for some people the lengths of these tracks if you're not familiar with new metal might be a little taxing but personally I found a lot of these songs clicking with me instantly take the opening track here past 21 it starts with this really slow eerie kind of creepy twangy guitar melody it felt like something of a throwback to the traditional world of doom metal but there was just something about the way it sounded something kind of weird that just intrigued me and made me want to stick with it and as the song progressed we got these droning guitars and cymbals some glistening synthesizers what sounds like synthesizers and then once the bass guitar and the drum groove comes through there are these really heavenly chorus vocals that sound gorgeous even though they're playing with a lot of the same instrumentation and are playing at the same space the band's mood shifts instantly from kind of mournful to really heavenly this track sounds like death and then beyond there being just lifted up into the heavens the afterlife it was true the bright light on this track I get the really grand guitar melodies of a band like Paul Bearer and the strings hanging in the background really thickening up the wall of guitars from a band like Subrosa and then there are some horns and just kind of an eerie gritty atmosphere to this music - that actually reminds me of God's speed you black Emperor or maybe a band like ohm or Grails and even though this is a longer track for me there's not really a moment where it lulls or feels boring because the band is really great just pacing the instrumentation house so there's something interesting is always happening even though this band is very heavy there's a lot of finesse to how this track comes together the Godspeed vibe intensifies on the next track the foolish man which begins with a bit of sitar with some strange reverb fluttering tones and then a guitar riff drops in that kind of sounds like it could have been lifted off the new earth record but then beyond this riff being introduced the band continues to build and build and build until they've reached yet another god speed esque wall of sound as obvious as their influences maybe I really do like the crossroads of influences that come together on this record vocals get introduced on this track and they're incredibly deadpan they are devoid of any semblance of joy whatsoever and even though I could see people getting kind of turned off by these vocals just how unpleasant they are I do think they add a lot to the emotional heaviness of the song but overall I don't feel like the vocals are as skilled in execution as much of the instrumentation here which is incredibly apparent on the closing track here here come the tears even though I do love the refrain of that song here come the singing takes a really weird dissonant ly harmonized approach on the song arctic cell and it doesn't really offer too much beyond that a really heavy riff and a kind of ham-fisted guitar solo right in the middle of the track unfortunately the progression on this track is really not quite as riveting as it was on the previous two songs the song really doesn't start getting exciting until the last third where we're getting these chugging guitars these metallic pings and then out of nowhere the heaviest deepest most grimy distorted riff on the entire album is introduced and it's just head bang city overall I thought this was a pretty good record I thoroughly enjoyed about half of the album and the spots that I wasn't totally head-over-heels for were alright I love the guitar tone I love the heavy production I like the melodies for the most part I like the arranged instrumentation that has worked into these tracks it's just really the vocals that I think need to get kind of cleaned up a little bit and even though I think the collection of influences they have thus far is is really impressive I think the potential for all these sounds coming together goes a little deeper than where the band is currently pushing it still I'm feeling you strong sticks to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Megaton Leviathan forever 
cNoSHuF5mac,hi everyone wife Annie sustained out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new sterilizer record its self-titled this is the debut full-length album sort of the mini album really it just lasts 25 minutes of this one-man musical project from Kansas City Missouri spearheaded by a mr. Brandon Duncan who is a busy little musical be if you reach beyond the recently released music of sterilizer you will find that Brandon has put out much music in the past under a plethora of different names and under some of these projects he is solo as well or has released multiple albums like in Cho Tin Man Cuba Saku Zia row blow not the sequence of prime and in these projects Brandon has experimented with everything from thrash metal to do metal to sci-fi tinged soundtrack music electronica and while not a horror soundtrack itself this new sterilizer album certainly is horrifying with its very ominous symbol its male/female album covers and its track titles which sort of tell a story of forced mandatory sexual sterilization a drop in population the music on this record is violent it is like watching grainy footage of a riot going on shot by a cheapo security camera this album is the sound of napalm of bottles getting thrown of Tanks of shields of police sirens smashed out storefront windows and all of this is done within the genre of industrial metal with just maybe a little bit of experimental and noise rock on the side there are loads of brittle yet booming guitars on this record just ear searing Distortion it's very lean and muscular recording with pummeling drums which are kind of a mix of live drums and electronic the cymbals are very very distorted and sharp it's kind of like I'm listening to some early God flesh except even more nihilistic to a degree and maybe a little shorter and to the point because with this album being 25 minutes and just having about eight tracks that doesn't really overstay its welcome but it still manages to leave a pretty lasting impression with the crushing sort of militaristic riffs and drums of the opening track vasectomy it's gruesome but it's simple and I love the grooves on this track and how they're constantly intensifying as the song progresses the song sterilizers even more crushing with these thudding double bass drums and these kind of metallic percussive sounds hanging in the background that are quite eerie there isn't much musically melodically to this composition and that's kind of the same thing with every other track here these songs are more about I guess the vibe the feel the noise the viscera and the groove then they are about being catchy either melodically or lyrically because there's nothing in the way of lyrics on this record the song discontent actually has one of the most legitimately catchy riffs on the entire record and domination kind of brings a very much needed change of pace to this very short album with it being on the back end and it is really more subdued than any other track here and just goes in more of an electronic music direction with some pitter-patter percussion and some very unsettling samples I like this record a lot overall but it is very short and a lot of the songs here just kind of feel like motifs again even though this record isn't a soundtrack it still feels very much that Brandon is in that state of mind when he wrote these tracks because even though they are heavy and very loud they're not that catchy or not as catchy as I think they could be and maybe that's because he's kind of scaling back the melody scaling back and he he could lay onto these tracks just because he just wants them to be sort of evocative of just a very destructive ugly imagery almost as if he just wants these songs to accompany some very horrifying visuals at some point if Brandon does decide to get more ambitious with this project into the future I could see it turning out a little more interesting though as is I do think this record is pretty thrilling and is pretty just blood pumping I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what do you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana sterilizer 
gqmSyACe8do,hi everyone Kathy Manzano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ariel pink album pom pom Ariel pink is a multi-instrumentalist a producer a songwriter he has been self recording music for years and in the process has pulled a massive amount of influence from other amazing eccentric mastermind do-it-yourselfers like our Stevie Moore but genre wise he also pulls quite a bit of influence from synthesizer pop and disco hard rock glam rock rock and roll listening to an aerial pink or an Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti record is a lot like dining on a buffet of vintage rock and pop genres but they're all fed through this kind of silly playful and kind of eccentric lens his music is occasionally really ridiculous whether it be because of the tambour of some of the instrumentation or his vocals or his lyrics his melodies occasionally even the cover art to his releases are kind of weird but he backs up a lot of this oddball activity with legitimately good songwriting Ariel Pink's music may be lo-fi it may be difficult to digest for your average mainstream radio pop listener but he has an incredible amount of personality and talent too in my opinion however his last few albums have been a little bittersweet for me his previous record mature themes I did like this record overall but for me the songs on this LP were far more straightforward than I am used to from Ariel there were some tracks that were a little long-winded and kind of experimental but the over-the-top personality just wasn't there for me on these tracks and with the recording of these tracks not really being that low Phi or noisier loaded with instrumentation it kind of felt like Ariel's playful streak was kind of out to lunch on this record and then before today which is Ariel's breakout album his most successful record so far I loved this record myself and I understand why other people might enjoy it too but for someone who had been enjoying his music casually a few years prior it was kind of disappointing to hear a bunch of cleaned up versions of songs that he had already written and recorded on this album so now we have the album pomme which honestly since I found out about Ariel pink is the record I have been waiting for him to release it's loaded with new material or at least material that is is new to me aesthetically it is low-five but it feels more detailed and dense than a lot of his older low fidelity material but this album still maintains a strong pop sensibility in the way that before today and mature themes did plus on many of these tracks we get Ariel Pink's eccentricity in full color this is the kookiest he has sounded in years we have legitimately great pop anthems on this record clashing with absurdist detours that have a sense of humor that rivals Zappos and there are other songs here the kind of land somewhere in the middle like nude beach a go-go or Exile on frog Street this record kicks off with a bit of sunshine pop straight out of the 60s with a kind of freakish twist I love the twinkly silly instrumentation on this record what sounds like a glockenspiel some kind of crazy colorful synthesizers backing up those drums and guitars the title of this track is plastic raincoats in the pig parade and lyrically to me the song is all about just flying your freak flag and not falling into conformity with the mannequins that he mentions on numerous occasions on this track at least that's again how I interpret it and to me that's a vibe that's a theme that runs through many of the tracks here maybe that even plays into the title of this record which again is pom pom pom pom being something that a cheerleader holds somebody who is yelling screaming cheering something on celebrating something and this album is celebratory in a sense it's bombastic it's gregarious especially with this opening track here that just has all these weird hard pans sound effects and instrumental bells and whistles popping up in every direction sort of like in a revolver kind of sense and then Ariel pink is quick to change genres right on the very next track as if this album were some kind of weird mixtape whose origin and creator is completely unknown but all the songs are completely fantastic on the song white freckles we get this smooth low-five synthesizer pop with a really great refrain and I'm not sure if you notice but the song in many parts is actually in 7/8 yet the groove is fantastic and the song remains completely catchy I love an artist that can make a song in an odd time signature but just play it off as if it's just a normal everyday pop song the song for shadows is kind of like a semi tongue-in-cheek fusion of gothic rock old-school heavy metal and what sounds like an instrumental off of an old 80's 90's Halloween novelty tape Arial pink actually toys with metal riffs once again on the songs gothic bomb or sexual athletics which maybe is like the worst song on the entire record it just pulls riffs straight out of the Black Sabbath playbook and just toys with it in a very silly way it's obviously a bit of satire the comedy sort of took precedent over the song being good however this is really the only moment on the record where this happens because in a day and age where pop music is designed to just appeal to as many people as quickly as possible and not engage them and not move them we have the song lipstick which is a fantastic reminder that pop music can do more than just be radio fodder or car commercial music a sentiment that I think Arial pink has some fun with on the song jello which is kind of a satirical tongue-in-cheek jingle for the famous food product and there are other fantastic pop songs on this record like number in my phone songs that are short they're concise they're lovely lyrically and melodically but there are some longer tracks on here too and these songs show that Ariel pink can do a longer track and keep it engaging as he introduces maybe new musical passages or interludes solos or just changes up the track completely introducing an entirely new instrumental shift or even like some spoken word or just vocal cuts of people who might be just building up the narrative of the story like on not enough violence or dinosaur carebears which opens up with this really weird foreign melody it turns into a freakish piece of polka pop and then later down the line it seems to shift into like this police s reggae jam and yet it all just kind of works we have the song black ballerina which is sort of strange kind of hilarious features a very wimpy protagonist who falls in love with a exotic dancer he only seems to have $10 on his person it's kind of like listening to a funny lo-fi pop version of American Pie or Porky's and with ballads like one summer night which is this really charming piece of 50s pop it's so clear the aerial pink is is just so influenced by music from across the vintage pop spectrum and he just knows all the right ways to subvert it and just make it weird make it odd it's like he's taking all these old black-and-white photos of pop music and just coloring over them in pinks and neon greens vibrant purples and sky blues and blood reds and the closer on this album is absolutely heart-wrenching just harrowing it's it's such a powerful finish for this record even without analyzing the lyrics vocally and instrumentally it's such a melodic ly moving song with with over an hour of material on this album this to me really feels like aerial pink getting back to his roots giving us tons of tracks some of them weird detours some of them diamonds in the rough some of them visceral rockers but now he's doing that with a stronger pop sensibility a better recording more detail and some really funny jokes I'm feeling a strong eight to a late nine on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Ariel pink pom pom forever 
SnGDdI4hkLE,
vqVPKmx39TU,oh hi everyone Ethan Ilan Chano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly segment why you know review where I talk about a series of albums that have come out over the past few months that I didn't make the time to or didn't get a chance to review just by itself in a solo album review so I'm just going to talk about it and address it quickly in brief in this video here the new killjoy club record reindeer games which effectively is a full-length album collaboration between Psychopathic Records artists namely ICP and demacia six sort of the afterbirth side kind of side project of three 6 mafia members DJ paul and company although now they have less members and they did when they started but in regards to this record right here this is one of the strangest hip-hop collaborations of 2014 and not just because of the names here but also because it's not like ICP and Damacio 6 come to some kind of middle ground here where all the songs sound cohesive and it's just kind of a meld of their styles quite literally there are parts that sound like they would be on adamah via six tape and parts that sound like they would be on an ICP album the album goes or the songs here go from really great parts to really awful parts in a split second from great gritty aggressive verses to just cheesy as hell choruses with chugging guitars and some vocals personally I didn't care for it and I wouldn't recommend you listen to it unless you're either a hardcore fan of one or both of these groups or you've just got some kind of morbid curiosity next the new group or album ruins grouper if you didn't know is Liz Harris singer-songwriter ambient artists one of the most interesting artists in ambient music currently she has come out with fantastic records in the past like dragging a dead deer up a hill as well as the AI a double album which is my favorite release in her discography she came out with a kind of underwhelming album in my opinion after that and now with this latest record of hers it kind of comes with a sound and a style change rather than dealing mostly in guitar and reverb and the kind of lo-fi and somewhat distorted recording aesthetic liz Harris's stepping forward past the loaf I passed the distortion past the reverb and giving us songs that are pretty much vocals and piano but still these songs managed to be incredibly quiet because her playing is so gentle and she is singing at the volume of a whisper and in my opinion aside from the kind of experimental closing track on this record I was pretty underwhelmed by this thing it's just not that compelling to me I like Liz just so much more when she's experimenting with sound and she's finding way to make very beautiful and gentle songs that kind of hang in the walls of sounds that she creates I don't think these walls of sound are so amazing that they would stand well on their own nor do I think these songs are so amazing that they would stand that well on their own but together they make a fantastic combo this is Liz essentially subtracting one of those things from the equation and in my opinion the results are just a little mixed next we have the new Wiley album snakes and ladders prolific uk-based grime artist grime figurehead really he's been dropping music for years this is his latest he had some pretty good singles leading up to this thing which I enjoyed but the album as a whole while I do love the instrumentals I think they hit really hard I do think Wiley has a good flow he sounds great on a beat but we already knew that but as far as his lyrics go it's it's just really the same old Wiley nothing really all that new or fantastic to report while he's never been the greatest lyricist on the planet and at least on this album anyway he doesn't dive that deeply into things like storytelling or themes or narratives it just seems to be some just basic braggadocio a lot of the time without any lines or wordplay or punch lines sticking out that much or really Wow me but still if you are searching for a grime record this year to listen to I would give this thing a listen as well is the new Getz album to definitely give the new gets album oh listen if you're dying to hear some more grime next they knew this will destroy you record another language these guys are a post rock outfit this is their third full-length LP their debut album is their most celebrated if you enjoy post rock I encourage you to listen to that record however here with this album I feel like they've just painted themselves into a stylistic corner a little bit there's not that much in the way of surprises or anything here on their sophomore record I enjoyed some of the noisier and sort of odder tracks they did on that record even though wasn't amazing to me as much as their debut album at least I kind of felt they were going into a different direction they had me feeling like I could look forward whatever they were doing in the future but here on this new record it seems that they've just moved into a safe direction and are just kind of dishing out post rock cliches in every direction and it's it's just not that compelling to me these guys have become a post rock band a band that you can only expect post rock from versus a group that just happens to be playing post rock like swans or godspeed you black Emperor or sigur rós groups that are constantly labeled with that genre but you can always expect them to work outside of the blueprint of that genre I can't really say as much for this will destroy you at this point or the new Jacob record to that that underwhelmed me quite a bit as well for the very same reason the new Cannibal Corpse record a skeletal domain classic death metal band brutal death metal band cannibal corpse and this is just kind of a another record from Cannibal Corpse there's not really all that much you can say about it if you want just kind of just brutal bloody gross lyrics and guttural vocals and Cannibal Corpse infamously are one of the most straightforward death metal bands of all time ever their sound is as basic and as plain as day as a knife to the throat they are just kind of continuing that tradition here if for any reason you are just morbidly curious and want to give your ears to a death metal record that isn't necessarily going to challenge you or confuse you maybe just try to get into some of the more brutal sounds in death metal I would encourage you to check this record out or some other earlier stuff like the bleeding next the new Gerard Way record featuring the famed frontman of My Chemical Romance although he was the frontman there disbanded now well and now he's doing solo stuff here hesitant alien is the title of this thing and the sound overall it's just some kind of blurry reverb alternative rock and pop rock not quite as bold and as fast-paced and as energetic as my Chemical Romance's earlier stuff but I do like the fact that it is a little bit more raw and low-five than the band's last few albums it's a decent release if you're just looking for a solid pop rock record with a kind of hazy aesthetic and mystique to it then I would encourage you to try this thing out next the new Twin Peaks record wild onion I don't have anything to say about this album it's like the most nondescript garage rock I've heard all year period and the new knock miss tiem album is well world left behind this is an American black metal project you might have seen your review there silencing machine record a little while ago gave that album quite a bit of praise and from what I understand this is the project's farewell album which is kind of strange to me given that they are fronted by Blake Judd who is one of the few if not the only constant members across the Bands career they've had a rotating cast of guest musicians many over the years and it's kind of a mediocre record it's just alright it's not quite the highpoint the silencing machine and some of their stuff in the 2000s was and what makes this record taste even more bitter is that it's kind of mired in a bunch of drama having to do with the band not doing right by fans who are getting merch or by other people who happen to be doing business with them and this has been covered pretty generously on numerous metal websites Stereogum as well but I would say if you're not familiar with these guys don't let that drama deter you you can hit up the hit up a streaming service or you know get a CD from a record store you know has a copy of that CD or whatever if you're interested in trying out their music because they are one of the more notable American black metal bands out there or at least they were before they disbanded next they knew at the gates record these guys are a Swedish mellow death and they are back yes they disbanded in the 90s and there is almost a 20-year gap between this record and the band's last record which is easily their most celebrated in their entire discography so I was looking forward to giving this thing a listen but this album it just underwhelmed me a little bit just because of the production sound it's just got a sort of generic punchy modern metal production sound to it that just feels so by-the-numbers much in the same way that the sound on the last Black Sabbath album felt kind of by the numbers the distinct sound that at the gates had back in the 90s has sort of been stripped away by this embrace of what is sort of new and in fashion as far as metal goes but don't get me wrong as far as the technicals of this album the vocal performances they're most definitely on point the writing isn't that bad either if you are an at the gates fan you probably already heard this record but if you are a fan of the sound of 90s death metal this is most certainly not a bad return for one of the classic groups in that decade next the new contortionist record language this record is essentially a big progressive metal turn-off for me with some ghent influences some deathcore influences to the sound of this record just completely deters me the springing guitars the sometimes clean guitar leads and chords the cleanly sung vocals that are so anemic and so dreadfully boring and then how the band suddenly transitions to these chugging guitars with just brittle distortion on them and these deathcore vocals I'm essentially getting two flavours of metal here that I have zero interest in coming together to make an album that I have negative five interest in in its pursuit for flawlessness all this does is destroys the mystique in the danger that made metal music so appealing in the first place and finally the new Jessie ware record tough love Jessie where is a pop singer hailing from the UK this is her sophomore full-length LP you might have seen you review her last album devotion didn't really care for it though I loved the singles off of this record especially while this moment's still a fantastic song baby in a while his mum adds and this record in my opinion is essentially a sequel to that album which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how much of a fan you are of that record but to me it's it's not necessarily the best thing because the deep cuts off devotion were just incredibly underwhelming and not that interesting it seemed like every piece of instrumentation was just trying to bland out the mix and just try to be as unintrusive as possible and Jessie while I do love her voice on wildest moments and some of the guest tracks that she's done over the years she doesn't really come off as that bold of a singer on all the tracks on that record and on this record too this album is well I just feel like I get a gauntlet of songs that would make for great background music at a clothing store in the mall while reverb and soft instrumentation are not necessarily a bad thing for every melody and for every beat and every piece of instrumentation to sound so impeccably soft that the overall song structurally melodically texturally just sounds like a blob or just a bunch of mush there's nothing that gripping to me about that unless the music is explicitly dream pop and is going for just a really serene aesthetic but this album isn't really that it's just kind of middle-of-the-road it's a little reverb II it's just kind of soft not so soft that it's being ambient or experimental but too soft to be gripping sharp colorful compelling body rocking and just ear warming pop music I do like that she seems to be carrying that torch though for 80s R&B music and a synthesizer pop music and that whole so fisting however I think she is yet to come through as a bold timeless voice in the genres and those are my thoughts on these records transition if you've given any of these albums listen what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh why you know review forever 
ue5sLcwJpyU,hi everyone raisins in Brandt anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dean Blunt album black metal Dean Blunt is a uk-based singer-songwriter who is mostly known for his collaborations with fellow musical eccentric Inga Copeland under the pseudonym hype Williams and they actually build the most recent of their collaborations together under their own names black is beautiful now under the hype Williams name together Dean and Inga create this strange lo-fi kind of beautiful abstract explorations into pop music and ever since the release of black is beautiful Dean has been focusing more though on his solo stuff his narcissist series EPS his 2013 album the Redeemer which features a lot of the same post modern pop isms as black is beautiful but with just like a note of accessibility it's sweeter it's catchy er Dean's vocals may be kind of rough at times but Dean songs are so much more direct and enjoyable and there's some stylistic variety on the Redeemer to their tracks that beautiful lush strings on them sort of a baroque pop flavor others have a synth pop style maybe some R&B a little bit of art pop too and on the Redeemer all of these genres are stripped back to their most bare of essentials then they're flipped on their head and they deliver them with just this overbearing sadness and melancholy however none of this really dawned on me at the time that the Redeemer actually came out I felt that a lot of the performances were just way too sloppy to really praise on this record and not the Dean has really cleaned up his act on this newest record of his here black metal however I find this album to be so much more compelling and for a variety of reasons for one I think his songwriting has improved even though he's been able to keep things just so incredibly simple on one track after another and just overall it's harder to deny the kind of amateurish and very eccentric charm that this record has as far as songwriters go Dean is undeniably an oddball and I think he's done a lot on this record to cut the fat around that oddity and just bring you some of his weirdest and sweetest ideas starting with just leaving a lot of the strange interludes that were all throughout Black is beautiful and the Redeemer and just giving us the songs this record kicks off with the song lush which is this gorgeous little piece of baroque pop just heavy heavy strings opening this record up just like the redeemer and it is such a catchy melody even after first listen this string part was just ingrained into my head the guitars are pretty jangly the drum beat very simple and Dean's vocals are much louder much cleaner than they've been in the past and even though his delivery is very deadpan the melody that he backs these strings up with very simple but also pretty and killer too and Dean's kind of subdued delivery his messy singing is kind of vague and esoteric lyrics can be kind of off-putting it's actually deceptively simple but if you consider lines like stay out of it and the line you never saw me right at the end of this track there are quite a few lines on this record that wish for desire and demand isolation take the song blow for example which features more lyrics about running away and asking someone not to get involved instrumentally in vocally this track kind of feels like I'm listening to a very forlorn version of the silver Jews and on the song 100 we're also getting more jangly guitars and really punchy beat with a very beautiful sheen on it and instrumentally the track just feels like something the Pixies or magnetic fields would do and to get back into the lyrics also on the song 100 we have Dean wanting to be excited to meet someone I think like in sort of a romantic capacity however seems that everyone around him put in very simple terms doesn't approve of this meeting or maybe this coupling at all and maybe some of these dicey situations with other people or ex-lovers just like on the song 50 cent where I think there's kind of like a lover's altercation going on here which ends in a call to the police maybe some of the bad vibes flowing off of these situations are what fueled a lot of these leave me alone kind of feelings all over this record which maybe feeds into the title of black metal of this album black metal typically a very insular genre whose core artists don't really make it their business to cater to outsiders of that culture and there are other kind of strange out-of-place ridiculous pop culture references throughout this record to like on the song X where toward the very back end of the song we have somebody saying when Beyonce was singing about someone being a soldier she was saying about me there's a song titled Punk on this record although it is a reggae song there's a song called country although it is kind of a weird James Ferraro esque styled noise piece which isn't that surprising considering Ferraro has collaborated with blunt before in the past this track also comes complete with the sound of the volume going up and down on a Macbook or iMac or whatever Mac product you happen to be using we also have song titles like 50 cent or 100 which within the context of dean's obvious fandom toward hip hop also means something too and we also have references to Molly on this record or phrases like strapped up with my Nina so not only does Dean have kind of a weird approach sonically to the role of singer/songwriter but he sings and speaks in a different vernacular - now the halfway point of this record is really where Dean starts to show how varied black metal is we have the 13 minute near instrumental track forever a sort of expansive Jam that involves drum machine and guitar and some saxophone and synthesizers and as rudimentary and as sloppy as this Jam is the instrumental shifts throughout the track are quite nice and overall just the emotional vibe of this instrumental fits the very sad down kind of slow druggie melancholy feelings of nearly every track here which is really what pulls so many of the songs together even though stylistically and sometimes topically and and lyrically we have Dean jumping all over the place with different modes of expression this album is kind of like just a a weird series of musical vignettes I really came out of this record loving what I heard overall I think this is a very good album I think it's an intriguing album I think it's an interesting album like I said earlier not only vocally lyrically instrumentally I think this record is deceptively simple but conceptually too many lilies here there's a lot going on here it has a lot going for it if you're into strange just out there musical personalities like your are Stevie Moore's or your Ariel Pink's to a lesser extent your Daniel Johnston's or your tone Etta's or your very very early sort of lo-fi tape recorder era mountain goats or maybe even some smog from the low fire of smaug's music I think Dean Blunt is going to have things that appeal to you most definitely he's really marching to the beat of his own drum and I think it gives this record a lot of character there are some tracks that pale in comparison to others a few songs I do wish were a bit longer namely lush which I think is maybe one of the most stellar openings of any record this year but you know that's besides the point I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Dean Blunt black metal forever
