3rSfhouI9oQ,hi everyone falsity start tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new quality Chris record innocent country quali Chris is a Detroit rapper producer with a very calm demeanor a sort of oddball delivery that's a very clever sharp satirical lyrics and while I would say Chris is definitely a serious artist quite a bit of comedy and satire came through in his inflection you can sometimes pick it up at the very dry tone of his voice he seems like the kind of guy who who enjoys somewhat just left-field subtle humor and it also plays out really well in a lot of the lyrics that he delivers to and even though Chris occasionally plays the angle of a very low-key clown in his music he's also very capable of some incredibly heart-wrenching and personal stuff to sort of like on tracks such as loop dreams or King is dead from his last album salamis album now Chris has a new full-length record out for mellow music group innocent country and before I even get into the music on this record I think it's kind of worth knowing what exactly is going on with the cover with the cover on this record I mean we kind of have a bunch of wonky badly drawn figures all in a group kind of stabbing each other or even stabbing themselves he's definitely the kind of artist who likes to point out and is most definitely well aware of the follies of mankind which was put forward on the lead single from this LP the song I asked God where Chris is literally having a pretty brief conversation with God asking God hey man what's what's the meaning of life what's the point God says get money he inquires further and God is basically like hey man you know honestly like I don't know the meaning of all this stuff and Chris kind of poses him but you created us don't you know sort of what are our purposes and he's like well will you make all these kids too you know do you know their purpose aren't you God's because you create beings in the same way that I create beings it's an interesting bit of circular logic that we throw our settle into and it's it's interesting for a record like this which tries to bring so many issues to the forefront leaving us with a track that gives us no answers whatsoever just leaves us with frustrating questions which i think is kind of another outlook on life that Chris most definitely has there are no big answers to our big questions oftentimes at least the the philosophical ones now before I go too much deeper into this record I want to say the production on it is handled by one mr. Chris Keyes who actually brings some amazing keys on this record brings quality Chris a certain level of musical finesse that his previous albums had kind of lacked so if you are into some very beautiful piano music it pops up from time to time on this record but don't get it twisted there are most definitely still some great grimy and colorful hip-hop beats all over this album just like with ghosts at the finish line and even though this is a new record new producer new songs new messages this album still shares a lot sigh listicle II in common with quality Chris's previous output there's very little in the way of progression to these instrumentals with the beat sounding very much the same underneath the choruses as it did with the verses and even when Chris does switch to a chorus or a refrain it's usually incredibly subtle low-key and understated Chris's songs often sort of feel very repetitive and meditative and and very very quiet he is a very subdued kind of guy but once he pulls you into his very quiet world he has a lot of funny and interesting things to say even if some of those things are kind of muttered or maybe spoken out of the side of his mouth in such a way that you might not catch them on the first listen but on this record once some of those messages click it becomes clear just how hard-hitting some of these tracks are even if on the surface they might sound slightly goofy like the song Murphy's Law where I mean it's essentially about Murphy's Law what can go wrong well that's not an exact quote but it is an interesting track in that just when things are getting good house gets robbed targets taken away person breaks up with you and the songs we wanted alive as well as where the wild things roam sort of seemed to be about people who have kind of a savage violent mindset and are willing to sort of engage in these acts of desperation in order to maintain what they currently have or advance themselves forward and the track the ones to watch to which is essentially about people from your immediate area who are lying about you and total backstabbers and spreading rumors about you and it's essentially their job to ruin your life and the song madness in the Oasis is pretty dark as well and has these really cartoony deep throated more vocals laughing all over the track very devilish sounds very MF DOOM ish but the whole second half of this track kind of feels like a an overly long outro or skit or something I just wish this song were longer and a little more well-developed had a strong chorus and maybe like another verse even though I like this record and I like Chris's last record I feel like this album still has the same Achilles heel it's kind of disheveled disorganized not that fleshed out sometimes I mean this record is just 30 minutes and some of the songs are so short to the point where I feel like the point could have been so much stronger the punch could have been so much harder if they were just longer and Chris delved into these ideas a little more and there are other tracks on here like drug time the song is actually drug fest 2002 and I think Chris makes some interesting points about drugs and using them for recreation and addiction and sort of what drugs you are using and and so on and so forth but this track kind of feels like a sketch off of a comedy record more than it does an actual song I like that Chris plays with a lot of evocative and cinematic and just weird off-the-wall sounds that people wouldn't usually put into their songs for fear of being so distracting but I think Chris comes through some really awesome sounds he comes through with some awesome concepts but there's like there's like no song here it's an interesting bit of theatre of the mind but it's not really an interesting musical moment on this record and there are other tracks on here as well especially the darker moodier tracks on the first half as well as the song nothing moves that again I just wish were longer in order to make that emotional impact stronger again I kind of feel like I'm caught in a bit of a love/hate thing with a quality Chris record because while I think he brings amazing ideas to the table I think he has a ton of personality his music still kind of comes off a little I don't know lethargic and a slightly funny ambitious which I think takes impact away from some of the great amazing and creative points and and sounds that he brings on this album especially on tracks like the plan and asked God where I think Chris's brings some of his best lyrics yet which is exactly what will probably keep me looking forward to and trying out quality Chris records into the future I just wish he would I don't know just aim a little bit higher in terms of the musical presentation as well as the song structuring aspect of his music other than that I think this record has a lot of great things going for it I'm feeling a decent two strong seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana mr. qual a Chris innocent country make sure to listen to his last record to listen to ghost at the finish line it's a good record it's a good record forever 
znNz2yNBfUo,hi everyone sweaty hot Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the self-titled corpo meant a record this is a French musical duo consisting of these fine musicians who on this record bring on these fine musicians and together they make music with a pretty interesting collection of influences if you give this record a surface level listen you're most likely going to pick up that this is pretty much a rock record but upon closer inspection you should pick up that a lot of the sounds on this album are generated electronically but there is a ton of organic acoustic instrumentation on this album as well acoustic guitars and strings even an accordion on one track so already we have a fusion of rock music and electronic music on here but also folk and neo folk classical music and a touch of metal - that comes through on a few heavy guitar passages and on top of these various musical styles we have vocals from Miss Lauren and neck whose name I'm most likely butchering you might have caught her vocals before on these projects and her voice is fantastic has a lot of pitch volume emotional conviction as well her singing is just great all around and she's also a very versatile singer not only does she sound great over a lot of the rock flavored guitar passages all over this record but for a great deal of this album she takes on a kind of operatic tone I really can't say enough nice things about her singing on this record and it helps that the music underneath her kind of takes this weird fantasyland vibe to it like the singing on this record comes from this magical mystical world and this is the very elaborate music that comes from it unfortunately on occasion the music here can come off a little over produced a little squeaky clean especially when it comes with a drum sounds or like on moments like the loud wall of digitally distorted guitars on the track are sailin which sounded super bland but this feeling of overproduction never really takes over the album entirely because the strings the acoustic instrumentation the accordion do provide enough of an organic feel that things are you know okay I feel like I'm listening to a full band actually feel like I'm listening to a performance not just some synthetically sequenced and generated batch of sounds plus of course the vocals having a very human feel to them also help especially as Laura shows an incredible amount of skill but also the kinds of very intentional cracks and in a way just flaws and the strains in her vocals as well but since this record pulls so much from the world of opera it can be a bit of an overstatement at times especially with just how theatrical it is oddly enough though this record doesn't really borrow that much from operas tendency toward very large grand conceptual themes that carry out throughout the record while I think that this band has a lot of talent when it comes to performance and some of the writing on here is great the instrumentation is arranged well I don't really get anything out of these songs necessarily listening to them as an album I just kind of feel like I'm liking each song just on its own merits as a song not because I think one song on this record is actually enhancing the other in some kind of way I'm not finding a whole lot of musical connections between these tracks especially considering that many of these songs just kind of end or just deflate out of nowhere and the song is just over and then we're getting a gap of silence and then we're on to the next track which may or may not actually complement the song that came before it so there are some endings on this record that do feel super duper effortless and makes me I don't know just a little disappointed because it seems like a lot of their musical ideas are so fantastic and so grand but they're not really complimented with ambitious songwriting and structuring however still there are quite a few highlights and the track listing here like the very folky acoustic guitar passages and the wonderful vocal harmonies on the song Thea which is beautiful or the song or twitch features the most blood-curdling vocal performance on the entire record if there is any song that you go to first to try out to sort of just test the intensity and I guess just how explosive this band can be make it this song and the song Dolson is fantastic as well which is really musically a tearjerker for me at least for the first half and then in the second half things get really heavy with some loud blaring guitars and the track eventually has all these digitally edited stuttering riffs so you kind of get that fusion of rock metal and electronic music once again and this song is actually one of the few instances where we get a track that segues or transitions into the next one nicely the next track on here is actually very nice palate cleanser a little rock instrumental with some awesome strings weaved into it a record like this that pulls on musical ideas that are so grand really could use just a large orchestration or an idea to pull all the songs together the album itself has a fantastic flow which is pointing towards some kind of climax or action or build up or ascension that the entire album itself I mean each song is good but the entire album works towards some kind of payoff I feel like that's the exact kind of thing that this sort of music would be complimented by greatly but there's just really not that much in terms of a larger progression or flow that brings all these tracks together it's just you know some some pretty good songs bringing together rock metal neo folk classical music and opera it's awesome to hear a band bring all of these musical ideas together so nicely and have them not clash in a really ugly tacky way I just think the record itself could have been more conceptual that's all feeling a light a decent seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana corpo meant a forever 
3mw44LC6w08,yeah you're making massage yeah yeah with your Loompa daddy music Taylor switch is the best singer is the best rapper is also the best song person so team Taylor swish hi everyone Taylor sweats here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new RP boo record don't want to mess this up fingers bank pads and a shoe prints legendary producer RP boo often cited as the forefather of Juke and subsequently footwork these are really jittery disorienting styles of electronic music based out of Chicago which several years ago everybody seemed to simultaneously get hip to as the music media was covering more and more of the vets and the godfathers of this genre people like RP boo who had a record around this time type of legacy and tracks man DJ Nate the late DJ Rashad and the rest of the tech life crew and around this time there were actually some decent records coming from people who were outside of Chicago and dabbling in this style of music guys like Jamie vexed under the nickname Kawai though we also had Machinedrum who dropped a few kind of killer records in the style of music and there were a lot of producers from the UK that were getting hip to Juke and footwork as well a lot of these artists fusing Juke and footwork with other styles of music and basically just experimenting with it but boo over here considering his last record in just his relation to Juke and footwork and sort of his place in the genre doesn't really show much in the way of a wish to elevate it with a sweeter more accessible more mainstream or artsy sound on fingers and bang pads boo sticks to the footwork blueprint the quickly cycling vocal and then musical samples which are pulled straight from the ghetto house playbook the very sharp thin tinny drum pads and these samples and these drums just create this tangled complex dizzying web of electronic music it is just non-stop sound coming from so few sounds it's really simple and skeletal and in one breath but in the other it's just so difficult to decipher sometimes and booze approach unlike some other producers is not very melodic either and when melodies are worked into booze music they are often just repeated and cycled and cycled and cycled to the point where in my head i I just often become numb to them by the halfway point of the song and sometimes these melodic ideas don't really sync up completely with the very busy intense percussion I mean not that they're not working at the same tempo but we're talking about maybe just completely different grooves riding the same tempo which sometimes I think is something that boo really emphasizes for a really weird effect just like purposefully throwing together melodic and and and percussive ideas that might not totally fit in a traditionally logical musical theory I'll pull way sort of like on the song sleepy where we're getting this muffled bass these sort of slow cycling tones some operatic vocals which are all fit against these really crisp clap sounds it's a kind of weird and experimental in a way and another track on this record that I think it's even weirder is the song I'm laughing which has one of the most incessant samples samples samples samples and the opening track on here has a pretty confusing approach to the vocal samples I feel like I'm almost listening to two conversations happening at once or then there's the song beware where I'm actually feel like I'm listening to two songs at once with the percussion and the vocal samples which are very melodic not really having a lot of chemistry together I wouldn't really say there's that much chemistry between the percussion and the samples on the song your choice or the song heat from us and there are also moments on this LP where it doesn't really feel like aesthetically the percussion is is really fitting all that much with these samples the melodic samples that are worked into these tracks either the percussion is often again very thin very tinny very crispy and mixed very high just sounding very loud while the samples are off just completely smothered by this very just searing prickly percussion much of the time booze sounds clash more than they converge which again I think is intentional and isn't 100% bad 100% of the time because I think it does give this record a very rudimentary and raw sound sometimes these strange dizzying combinations of sounds actually end up sounding pretty harmonious like on the song freezer-burn where the cacophonous rhythms on this track actually fit very well against the distant somber female vocals that cycle throughout much of this track the vocals on this tracker worked into the percussive mayhem very well and I think on songs like this boo successfully shows that he has like a bit of a softer side but there are plenty of tracks here that do go super hard super aggressive very loud very direct like the song finish line DJ's mother fuck your favorite DJ mother fuck your favorite DJ mother fuck your favorite DJ mother fuck your favorite DJ that is pretty much the vocal sample that plays throughout this track for about four minutes which gets real old real fast but I do like the tense visceral beat behind this vocal sample and in a way this song finds a middle ground between being hypnotic and being hyped and then there are other tracks in the track listing that are also very direct and hard-hitting but I think the beats and the grooves are a little bit more traditional easier to digest and some of the vocal samples are actually pretty catchy the song suicide daddy's home also the song let's dance again which it actually does have a pretty straightforward dance beat but because our PPO is producing it we're getting these like twittering Polly rhythms flying all over the instrumental overall this record was not a bad listen I thought it was really good and in a way it's kind of what I've been looking for in a footwork record for a long time I mean I'm not totally head over heels for it because there are some duds in the track listing here but this record sticks very passionately to the blueprint of footwork but does experiment with it and shows its versatility very nicely and then it doesn't really overstay its welcome like some other larger footwork releases have in the past in my opinion and yeah I mean that's basically the gist of this record for me I mean hopefully RP boo keeps making music and continues to keep footwork interesting I think this record was a good statement I think his last record was a good statement and hopefully sort of pushes on and continues to try new things on his next release I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition have you given this wrecker to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana RP boo boo forever 
nKdHpRBMsG8,listen it's hot out leave me alone couch assesses not even wearing the sweater right now it's like a spicy spicy meat-a-ball in here alright time for a review of the new Chemical Brothers record born in the echos The Chemical Brothers are an electronic music duo hailing from the UK known for their essential contributions to big beat and pop infused electronic music in the 1990s not only through records like surrender and dig your own hole but also a fantastic singles like galvanized and hey boy hey girl Setting Sun black racket baits and even though Chemical Brothers are not as trendy as they used to be even in the wake of EDM oddly enough though I wouldn't really say there was a period where like all of a sudden The Chemical Brothers became old hat like they never really were defined by just one single sound or style I've always thought that each one of their records had a pretty diverse array of sounds on them there are a few Chemical Brothers records that I think stylistically are more focused than the others and their discography but for the most part the duo has always dabbled in a myriad of different styles from house music to a variety of different breakbeat electronic styles of music techno and pop and hip hop - and on this latest record over here I think they've just delivered another very versatile set of bangers with very groovy break beats with thunderous bass and kick drums some ear-piercing synths and builds as well most of the time this record is the definition of explosive which comes through right on the opening track here which has these numerous layers of sound which stack up taller than a mountain and this track is also like wider than a couple city blocks it's a monstrous starter and The Chemical Brothers maintain that larger-than-life sound even on some of the more accessible tracks here like the song go with q-tip which again is one of the catchy ER tracks on here would work great in a club setting or like at a festival or something like that and q-tips performance on here is pretty great I mean the lyrics occasionally especially on the hook are kind of cliche especially as throughout the song he's just mentioning everybody everybody everybody everybody so we're just two tracks into this record and we already have a very direct catchy poppy cut off of this LP as well as a more textured noisy AB stress stress tract song and with each track Chemical Brothers do a great job of just keeping up the energy keeping these songs visceral and many of these songs throughout this record are and they just kind of slide back and forth on that more accessible catchy poppy abstract weird left-field spectrum some of the songs in the track listing here I would say are even more left field than the intro like under neon lights with st. Vincent which features these driving kicks in the instrumental as well as like these little fruity melodies and and when the verse kicks in we're getting even more just kind of colourful very sweet I guess is the word I would use these little cycling tiny little melodic phrases which sound like they might be coming from a guitar and st. Vincent's vocals are very oddly harmonized there's a real sourness to her voice and underneath these vocals she's even giving a bit of a spoken word and even though some of the vocal passages here with all the layers and the spoken word do come off as a bit of a mess I do think this track did make for a good song and a good feature and was a necessary moment for the track listing here we have the song I'll see you there which is a moment of like psychedelic rock like a psych Rock jam that goes harder even harder than some of these new psych rock revivalists that are out there right now kind of crazy but still a good track and an unexpected turn for the tracklisting the song just bang is this hard-nosed very grimy very gritty just tough as nails techno track with a booming huge beat just really pummeling loved that cut and then the song taste of honey is kind of like the salmon dance of the record one of those songs that you hear on a chemical brothers where you know the lyrics are subpar and you know the instrumental is subpar but the song topic is just so weird and funny that it slightly makes up for it in a way though the very slow spacious lumbering beat on this track did make this song a bit of a slog although this track does kind of introduce a series of slightly more toned-down tracks that and the album like the title track on here with Kate Levon who her performance actually fits the very quirky dark nocturnal instrumental here perfectly with these buzzing bass synth leads toward the end of the track that sound fantastic the song is almost post punky in a sense song reflection those a very pretty piece of house music with some glossy synth leads and yeah I I guess I just kind of wished this song went a little harder it was a little more aggressive reminds me of something off the last John Hopkins record in a way the song radiates was a very blissful ascent of a track I mean it really builds up and sounds very heavenly I mean radiate is a very appropriate title on this song and I love the way the song just blossoms after kind of a series of intro beats and kind of a verse and all of a sudden you're getting these fuzz doubt just searing synth leads that are just burning burn my ears but simultaneously they are gorgeous and the song would have made for a pretty nice closer if not for the cut that actually ends this - with a Beck feature on it and I don't know I just kind of found his voice on this track while his singing wasn't terrible I just thought his delivery was a little inconspicuous kind of anonymous if you weren't telling me that this was Beck I would not have guessed it was back but for the most part I wouldn't say there's any one vocal feature that really kind of stands out and steals the show aside from q-tips I think a lot of the vocal guests on this record again while they're not bad they just kind of play second fiddle to Chemical Brothers production which if that's really what you want to hear then maybe that's not really a bad position for these people to be in in one breath I wish that some of the vocal performances here we're just bolder especially when it comes to the guests but then again I guess it's good that no one guest is kind of stealing away from the flavor of the record and the album feels pretty uniform even though we are getting a series of different vocals across the album does feel pretty uniform in a sense even though we are getting a series of different vocalists across the album I mean this is pretty much everything I would want from a modern Chemical Brothers record there were a few duds in the track listing here but I think the duo show that they can still write hits or at least write songs that feel and sound like hits and have that hit quality to them as well as pulling together some very engaging weird more left fielded deep cuts feeling a decent strong seven on this LP transition have you given this record to listen what do you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino Chemical Brothers forever hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and before we close this video out I wanted to say that I have a new website I would like you to visit that I built through Squarespace and I'm very happy with it and you yourself can build a website via Squarespace if you would like through a link I will leap down there in the description box this website is trusted by millions of people and brands including myself and it starts at $8 a month and you get a free domain if you sign up for a year again link to Squarespace a link to build your own website over there down in the description box and while we're here I wanted to tell you that I will also leave a link down there to a little playlist we have put up over there my managing editor Austin who writes quite a bit for the website and has collaborated with me on a lot of different lists and has been a big help to the needle drop over the years he has put up his mid-year favorites list I put out my mid-year favorites now these are his mid-year favorites and his taste is even more left-field than mine a lot of the time so go check out his list you'll probably find some very odd and interesting pics in his playlist of his list of his favorite records of the year so far and that's it you're the best Thank You Anthony Fantino website forever 
ql4NIKTPJOQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd before this review kicks off I want to tell you that we are using testing out a new social media app called symbol there is a link down there in the description box where you can give it a try and you can follow me over there at the needle drop all in word it's a cool new place where I can just kind of share some songs some newer tracks from the album's I'm reviewing it just generally songs that I'm liking and will probably throw up some classic stuff on there too you know just a an app or I can recommend you some songs new and old that I am digging on cool cool see over there and you're the best forever huh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new future album dirty sprite - this is the commercial follow-up to the 2011 mixtape from rapper and singer hailing from Atlanta future who has come a pretty long way in terms of relevance since he first broke in 2012 off the back of some singles like same damn time and the song turn on the lights and the bangers future was coming out with were at least fun but the other tracks he would do that had this weird auto-tune crooning on it were the tracks that I sort of most found unbearable but these were the songs that really would actually make future hot and give him a particular sort of sound that people sought after and recognized him for future usually hops on some pretty good production on his records but I think his warbly moans just don't really sound that good future style seems pretty OneNote especially on his last full-length album honest and it's not that this record didn't have variety it's that there were tracks that seemed like this is futures wheelhouse and then there were other songs on here that maybe didn't go over quite as well futures attempts at being heartfelt on this record were hilarious to me and then there were the other cuts that were a little middle-of-the-road and just kind of boring and I guess unintelligible I mean not only this futures voice just not sound that fantastic which is why it's just slathered in auto-tune but I can hardly make out what you saying most of the time however on this album I I did love move that dope that's a great track however this record got a pretty positive reception from those who like to take their rap hedonistic and future saw that flame he saw that fire building and he continued to feed it directly after the release of this project with a series of very short concise hard-hitting mixtapes with some great producers on them like Mike will made it and Zaytoven and he actually got quite a bit of buzz off these projects and after doing a series of just these shorter high-octane projects he's kind of taking that same approach with this new album over here which the standard version of it is just about 45 minutes 13 tracks it's pretty stingy with the features and there's not really much here in the way of the lust rias production or songwriting or anything like that many of the songs here are relatively straightforward and incredibly simple to the point where the choruses on the instrumental and maybe even in terms of the flow and the melody on the track don't really have that much of a difference from what the verses are doing a lot of the songs here are very similar in sound as well the instrumentals here of course take on a strong trap flavor with those rattling high hats the crispy snares the heavy massive sub bass and there's some pretty glossy pristine synths and melodies laced into this trap style percussion - and there are a few bangers here which are pretty fantastic but many of the songs here are low-key and lyrically I would say that features may be a little bit more intelligible than usual though I don't know his lyrics aren't really anything write home about unless you want to hear I'm talking about sticking his thumb in the butt of some lady's having sexual relations with oh boy I'm sure you can guess what the song freako is about and the intro on here we have future talking about your bitch and some Gucci flip-flops and talking about how he thought it was a drought of a particular type of you know codeine cough medicine sort of drug but hey we got it we got it and that was a relief because I was I was worried I was legitimately worried about um you know with whether we were going to get any lean and this intro track along with many of the other drug themed songs on this record actually take a somewhat dark tone especially on I served the bass which is of a very grimy beat to it even if futures performance on there vocally is a little monotone and flat and again lyrics not really anything too deep going on here but while there's no there's no one deep super deep moment on this record it all kind of blends together into a sort of concept record about inebriation which I think also comes through in the very druggie intoxicated feel that a lot of the instrumentals here have too and in my opinion we haven't had a great rap record or mixtape that placed so heavily on those themes of drugs and inebriation and intoxication since Live Love ASAP and I don't necessarily feel like I'm just listening to club bangers or hits or songs on this record or just listening to future do a performance or hear him on a stage I feel like in a sense I'm really listening into his mind I'm getting a peek in his leaned drenched musical world especially on moments where he says he's going to take a piss and just codeine is coming out huh and I would say there's even a somewhat reflective moment on this record with song blood on the money where future is talking about just counting up all this money but the money that he's counting the money is talking about comes at a price a lot of lives of a lot of people caught up in this black market of codeine & sprite and styrofoam cups but I wouldn't say future always comes off this reflective and I don't know I guess self aware especially on the end of the song slave master where we kind of had this refrain were you saying over and over long live ASAP yams long live ASAP yams which I'm sure in one breath the mob the ASAP mob that is appreciates the shadow' appreciates the tribute but considering the death of ASAP yams the cause of his death and how this album is just one that big lien endorsement um bad idea still most of the time I do think this album comes off very alluring in its own way with its repetitive flows and its kind of hypnotic beats like on the song where you at and the song thought it was a drought and blood on the money and colossal and the song little one which is a really hard-hitting banger on here which samples this woman screaming her brains out and the song groupie which is maybe the most hard-hitting song and the track listing here like a lot of southern hip hop future circles around a lot of very repetitive hooks he repeats phrases over and over and over and over and over unashamedly and while this does cause some songs to fall kind of flat and just not sound that interesting or dynamic it does give this record a really weird feel of just being the musical representation of like in endless hi and while I don't think this is that bad of a sound or a direction for maybe the first four tracks or so this album's vibe its flavor its lack of great flows its lack of lyrical ability it really its lack of songwriting I would say this record in a way is just as song deficient as young thug's barter 6 which really could have used some better writing to come together with some hard-hitting singles like on that rich gang mixtape but young thug with that track you dude with Jamie xx as well as a new single he just drop recently does give me hope for some catch of your songs come down the pipe plus I think vocally he's a little more dynamic than future but that's that's really another discussion the point is futures lack of vocal and lyrical ability starts making this record feel super stale and just boring boring boring boring especially around the point of songs like freako and rotation future just doesn't really have that great of a melodic sense for a guy who tries to sing so often just listen to the song blow a bag where I just wonder dislike he write any of these melodies or does he just kind of go off his head and just whatever notes pop in his head and fit into the instrumental melodically just goes into the minster mental because it just sounds okay and then there are songs like rich sex which can't stay in the lyrics on this song but I don't mind the melody the vocal melody and it's it's cool it's a sweet vocal melody matched with a very tender instrumental but futures lack of a melodic sensibility doesn't allow him to work outside this melody almost at all throughout the duration of the track with maybe the exception of like a moment around the middle point where he kind of does a little vocal improvisation that doesn't sound that good still though I thought a way this project was an improvement on honest and I thought it was at least cohesive sonically and thematically and I again I did think it had an interesting vibe and aesthetic to it and it did have its moments where it subdued me with its lean flavored charms but if you're not into these Atlanta crooners that aren't really saying anything lyrically over these trap's style instrumentals and are subsisting mostly on a diet of lean then you're probably not going to get that much out of this project I however just thought Simmons were really catchy I thought a lot of the instrumentals were very sweet and I thought that it bordered on being an interesting listen from the standpoint of wow this is a really druggie just thick hazy intoxicating record beyond that I don't really think future has much of anything going on this record I heard I heard I heard I'm feeling a strong five to light six on this LP transition have you given this record to listen when you listen to it were you sipping on some lean if you were let me know Anthony Fanta no future ds2 forever 
4ALMxMku924,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a video an essay a talk a think thing comment about leaks when music digitally escapes onto the internet before its projected release date and then people start illegally downloading it Wow a few very highly anticipated indie records have leaked recently and as a result I've been receiving tons of messages where people are saying to me hey man are you going to review these albums early have you listened to these albums yet and what do you think of leaks well I am abstaining from these records and I have no plans on reviewing them early for one because I like my reviews to sort of occur close to the initial point of impact for the record so that my reaction is fresh and raw and bloody like an axe wound and also when I drop the review I would like you guys to be able to have the opportunity to go listen to it and purchase the record in a legal fashion whether I am saying I love the record and I'm recommending it to you or if you just have a different opinion than me and you want to go buy the record because you have a different opinion from me but what I think about leaks generally is that they are now a fact of music industry life and the damage they've done to the old model of doing things is done and it's not going anywhere leaks have essentially rendered the release date of albums completely useless album release dates less and less are big huge hulking events these days with artists and labels just streaming records digitally online for people to hear weeks before the official digital and the physical release of a record some artists and labels are releasing their music in such a fashion where for a little while you get to stream it and then we're going to get the digital release and then the CD is going to come out then after that you're going to get the vinyl maybe in some kind of deluxe edition packaging in the digital age album releases are a lot more like marathons than they are singular events and on top of that we're all not listening to the same things the same time we're not all listening to albums that are new and are fresh at once not only because of just competition and saturation and we're all just kind of tuned into our own favorite things musically at any given time but there's also the fact that with music being so easy access and so on demand right now there's no real sense of urgency to go listen to whoever's record as soon as it comes out because there's always going to be a leak or a stream or some kind of platform like Spotify where we can just kind of go casually stream it when we feel like listening to it music music is just on demand for us from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep it's not really anything we've really got to go out of our way for make any kind of separate time for because it's just always there happening in the background whenever we need it and then there's the reviews the reception the discourse that would usually orbit around an album release now all of that stuff is kind of thrown all over the map in terms of timing and placement I mean that discourse starts pretty much around the time the leak occurs and a little bit before as well not when the album is being released and the reason that's a problem is that the album release date being a big huge singular event is an essential part of the equation of the traditional music promotion model and as a result a traditional PR campaign seems like less and less and less of a sure investment these days for artists large PR campaigns cost a lot of money and that's not money you're going to be making back if the whole process of building anticipation is derailed by your album getting leaked and the way some artists are opting out of the PR campaigns and the promotion and the hype cycles is just by releasing their album out of the blue I mean Wilco just dropped a free album out of nowhere the fact of the matter is the kind of PR you really want as an artist is not a PR that you can just pay for that kind of genuine excitement that fans have for a record a very special record that causes them to tell their friends about it share it and list into it for months after the release of the album it's pretty much like the old adage that you can bring a horse to water but you can't make the worst drink what a big PR campaign does is brings thousands of horses to the same water but it still has to be up to the horses to drink and what makes the horses drink can kind of be abstract it's this difficult to explain spark that occurs between a very special album and an audience if the spark is there it's there if it's not it's not it's the labels job to try to figure out a way to capitalize on that spark and it's the artists job to make the art and yeah I do realize there's some artists out there that sort of run their own label or sort of play their own promotional game and they've got to kind of wear more than one hat at a time regardless of the popularity of the artist in question I think the measures that should be taken in respect to leaks are the same one the most important measures I think are preventative keep your album from getting leaked treat your album like it is basically a pile of gold bars you would not just leave a pile of gold bars just anywhere or just let anybody borrow it or just let anybody have access to it do I do I do it just be very careful about who you trust and if you have other people kind of doling your album out for you to the press to whoever make sure that they're careful and then there's what happens when your album actually leaks and I think if that occurs it's on you whether you're the label or the artist to react to that situation point people to the pre-order if they're listening to the leak give them the opportunity to buy it and preorder it to support the label or support the artists or do what Bjork did when her last full-length LP leaked put the album out put it out digitally there are people who are going to avoid your album leaking but they're still going to be kind of annoyed and a little peeved that there are all these other fans out there listening to the record while they're just kind of sitting here like dumbasses waiting for the release date just put the album out let people buy it or just point to the pre-order maybe give people a few singles or some extra swag or something when they actually go through the process of pre-ordering the record not acknowledging the leak isn't drawing any less attention to it everybody is already sharing it and talking about it you're the only one who's pretending like it didn't just occur and I think those are all the thoughts that I have on leaks right now until next time y'all transition leaks what you think about these leaks forever 
X5BdcV0HV9Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ghostface Killah in Adrian young record 12 reasons to die part 2 this is the sequel to the 2013 hip hop album 12 reasons to die in a collaborative record between wu-tang legend Ghostface Killah possibly my favorite member of the wu-tang clan and also producer multi-instrumentalist bandleader Adrian young and this record was a creative dramatic gritty hard-nosed story album a tale of betrayal and revenge and this new record over here is essentially the second installment of this storyline now I'm not going to review this record by myself I have brought on the one and only fellow youtuber and critic of many things the granddad Willy and yeah we're just gonna shoot the shit over this record transition and now here we are via the magic of the internet with the grandad Willy himself doing this Ghostface Killah and Adrian young Co review give me please said please your your overall thoughts the record your general thoughts on this record you know what when I when I first heard about the album I was like okay now I love the first album first of all that was amazing hello I'm a big Ghostface Killah fan big Adrian young fan so when I heard they were making - I instantly got fucking high I was like yes motherfuckers another album hell yeah and then I thought okay how are they gonna go with the story are they to continue it is it'd be a different story and when I got into the album and I saw how they kind of you know put a spin on it and they brought in you know Raekwon it as Lester came and they kind of put it a little bit further in the future in the 70s in the 70s in New York and now it's sort of like a smart way to do it word they don't have to hand off the first story so much but they can bring the best parts and maybe that's what they did here whoever wrote it cuz I'm not sure young wrote I think he gave the Vanaras somebody else to write and they just pretty much created a brand new story just parts and I like that that was smart that's what I would have done if I wrote the fucking album so I really did appreciate that they didn't try to take too much from the first album and they try to give this whole album its own essence and its own actual identity which is real dope so I like that and um for the most part like it worked for me like when I listened to the whole project I think in the narrative was more cohesive it was tighter like you know it was a few loose ends or the first album certain certain things that really weren't explained well here I felt like they kind of got the point across a lot better and it didn't seem like they were just trying to I guess for the most part hurry the album up because it's a short out both these out without a short but this one they kind of you know utilize their time a little bit better on the second one I think they kind of I remember the first record I needed to listen to it a few times sort of piece every bit of the story together because you really needed to listen in to all the verses right right through single verse advance the storyline which was even more so the case on that souls of mischief record that Adrienne Young had done with them mm-hmm that was even more like a seamlessly flowing story album than 12 reasons to die would but with Toad reasons that I really needed to read into those verses whereas I feel like on this record over here not so much mostly because of the way that they kind of brought the RZA into the fold a lot more and it seems like every single step forward the storyline takes you get this risen interlude where he's just like you know in a very somber tone for saying everything that just happened giving you a little extra and then giving you a taste of what's just about to happen right and I don't like that you know it brought me back to UM you know he had that that sort of man with the iron fists type narration going on here but I really like picked up on but on the narration here like you said he really kind of filled a hole that they couldn't probably make in the form of a song where they could wrap it so I really like Riddler on here he really really had more of a more of an impact with the story actually you know reveal more important parts of the story that kind of really set up the tone for the next year record the next couple of records actually so his his presence on here was actually more felt than the first time I feel so yeah most definitely was but I mean you know I feel like in a way it was kind of at the sacrifice of like the songs on this record are a little short yeah and maybe some of those details if they really worked on it could have been worked into these tracks although I think sometimes RZA was use effectively in terms of just like dramatic kind of this cinematic tone that I feel like previously sort of came mostly through the instrumentals the instrumentals just felt so big and so lavish and I feel like on this new record over here they've got that same kind of old-school 70s exploitation film Mack dropped to them but you don't have like these big vocal moments like you did on the last record with all the harmonized female vocals where they kind of be setting the stage of the story and sort of swapping that out instead for you know these narrative moments that kind of paint the picture just as well but in a different way yeah I agree I do like though in the beginning of this one where they had the they do have the the the vocals in the beginning to set it up it's not like the first one where you know you get the Ghostface Killah it was a lot bigger but I did like when he got into returned the savage and then I think it was I'm gonna get her name right Brooke burrows she's the opera singer on there she the sample that young use for her was really really good it kind of you know really give it that you know real I'm not not as big as in the first one but it does have you know that same vibe I got that same vibe it sounded like a real Kill Bill is in intro 3 and I do agree we could have used some more of that on this one and probably you know swap that out with some of the narration or like he liked Adrian young did with the actual instrumentals when RZA was doing the narration he kind of like crafted the the backdrop with the sound while he was talking to his tone and I think if he would add it in some of those vocals - it would've made it more bitter but I mean there's nothing that really like really made me like you know put me off of it but I think that is something that could have been added but it is a small thing to me from most part yeah it didn't really ruin the record or anything like that I thought it was just another example of this record taking a very just just being able to carry on the style of the last album but in a slightly different way where it doesn't feel like a carbon copy and it feels just still enjoyable which you know is is great considering uh I mean that that's that's kind of what I feel like we were getting on that album that Ghostface did not too long ago it was it 36 seasons yeah but I feel like he he basically starred in a ripoff of his own album yeah and that's the clinical I actually actually like 36 seasons not as much as 12 reason inside but I think it's because he did put her with herself off and you have the audacity to do that and he's still made for the most part a decent album out of it I mean that kind of just you know I mean I didn't and I don't hold it as high as of course this out for reasons our fish-scale or anything like that but you know the fact that he was able to pretty much take the same story put it in a different setting and still pull off I have them pretty damn good it just shows what kind of artist goes there so it can't be too bad a time for that one so the most part I mean I did I did think this record had just a lot of the same flavors as the previous track I mean the previous record but just things done in a slightly different way I mean I loved the RZA interludes I thought the instrumentals while not as show-stopping as the instrumentals from the last record we're still well put together they still had that Bulls full sound they still had just great combinations of guitar and bass and drums and flute and a little bit of vocals occasionally too they sounded with Franta they sounded a refined and sad when stuff was like emotional they sounded hard-hitting and greedy when there was like a lot of gunplay going on and a lot of action the characters the the inclusion of Raekwon was pretty good although I wish some of the side characters that popped up via the features occasionally on the record were a little bit more well developed I agree I agree um especially uh scarab and Chino XL it took me a while to get into who they actually were as far as like what characters they're trying to play it really wasn't fully explained as far as with less decay even been staples I mean I know he was a henchman but they didn't really give him his own we just don't miss henchmen for Lester came Joe's saying that they just came in to do a verse and kind of narrate a certain part of the story but they really didn't get a grasp of who this character was the way they made it kind of forgettable for the most part as far as the character development is their verses were finally I think she know Excel did a good job i'm vince staples had a great verse I liked his versatile and get the money I'm scare up I liked on rise up I didn't like him that much on the other track he was on I feel like he didn't gel on that track to me personally that's invitation yeah that's contamination yeah I felt like he didn't really fit on that one as much it may be because Chino XL blew him out of the water problem when he took over but even with those characters though you just don't get a grasp like you said who that it really are and it really just focuses on the host the whole island pretty much just focuses on Lester Kane and Ghostface for the most part those are the two people you know you really only get to really find out and know about yeah it's definitely and and I don't know if you feel this way but uh I think on this track is about this record as opposed to the last one I just don't think there was I don't know enough Ghostface while I do realize this is a collaborative project between Ghostface and Adrian young they're kind of coming together for this you know creative thing being that though space for a good part of this record is kind of a ghost literal rank not really incarnated in any kind of way where you can do any sort of major action alright focus is sort of on Raekwon and the DeLuca's mob and sort of what Raekwon's henchmen are doing right and as a result you do have fewer verses from ghosts and tracks where just ghost doesn't pop up at all sort of like on that track you know we were just talking about deaths invitation well I did like that song I mean that song was interesting not only in how it advance the storyline but also just that they just put the most top-notch spitters on the entire record all on that one track and it made it eventful you know it definitely gave that song a flavor that no other song on the record had it brought some variety mm-hmm yeah I agree with that so I think Raekwon to me personally the Raekwon stole the shown is that maybe because he was the visible on this album and he's sort of pretty much I think I mean it's not even that he performs super well it's almost that like the storyline just handed the show over right exactly and you know I honestly you know even though this is nothing new from what Raekwon as far as skill and talent lies I think after the Feli mishap with that album this is sort of a little bit of a redemption for it and you know it's sort of like it made me think like okay you know when all this you know Raekwon on here needing that ghosting that Adrian young it kind of sort of the wheel spinning of maybe what would a ragout out I'm sound like if Adrian young did it all the way because that's pretty much what this album is is the Raekwon Ghostface album done by we put some features on it which was promising if they decide to go full fledged with that but I think you know Rick wine is probably some of the strongest on this album is on tracks like blackouts my favorite track on here with him going back and forth with the Ghostface also you know king New York even though returning to savage but I think he's really I was impressed with how consistent he stayed on this whole album and throughout the whole way and he really didn't I really got the most out of Raekwon out of anybody on this album which makes sense cuz he's the most low on this album so makes fuck it stands for you know he really if they handed him over to show then he fuckin put on a 5-star performance as far as what he had to work with yeah I mean I feel like the first half of the record was really Raekwon centric and and and having listened to that with multiple times I enjoy that portion of the record for what it is I for my first listen I kind of spent a good chunk of this record just being like man like what you know once there'd be more go space but then you know it seems like the second half sort of involves ghosts a little bit more in terms of at least like advancing storyline Lord right and and I don't think you want to spoil the ending of the record but sort of what Ghostface decides to do at the very end this album this is a super like cold blooded moment what he did when I listened to it I was like no way that's kind of fucked up but I mean it's his persona it's his character and actually it really it was like that twist ending that you get it at a really good movie and it also opens up possibly more of these albums you never know what they're gonna do with this but slap like that they whip that route with because it made a lot more sense because there's way more to build off with that so I'm not gonna give away to anything either but just know if you're listening to this shit that's a fucking crazy anything that they did an album that was whoever wrote that shit fucking go get a Hollywood job that's cliff I'm sure I mean it's you know you know even even in like a lot of mainstream radio movies you don't really get an ending quite that cold-blooded right exactly exactly and the only thing about it bill like I say my gonna give it away but one thing that kind of irked me about it is going back to the Rizzo's narration there were parts where it wasn't really they weren't honest they weren't pretty much linear as far as like the RZA would say one sort of detail about the setup but then within the song you know a different event the same event with a different way it would go down and I caught that about two times in this album and I'm not sure if that's like based on the fact that the songs were written and then RZA came in and wrote it or said it differently or vice versa but I felt like that was one small detail that should have been picked up on and probably rework going because I pick on those types of things because if you're gonna tell a story make sure that all of the seams are tying everything is in there because you know if I think the bone that twice I'm if I listen to it again I may pick up on something else but that's just around the end it's not a killer for the album but it made me go like oh you should have probably you know kept on the same story with the narration and it's really important because this is such a story album you know write the story about everything you know should be super well hammered out especially considering like you know the the the songwriting a lot of these tracks are short and the hooks aren't super strong or anything like that so you're mostly tuning into the verses in order to sort of get tease out what the album is supposed to be delivering to you yeah you know I mean I think there are moments like the the hook on the song get the money within staples where ghost is like keys he started doing this he's rapping but it kind of sounds more like talking over the hook and he's talking at the Shirley beard speed we've done double his vocals up or through yeah at first when I heard I thought it was like probably just like something wrong with my headphones at first but then when I went back to list it's just an effect that they put on it but I think it wasn't it's not strong and it kind of like makes the hook sound really really weak for the most it's not that well written and on top of it you could barely make out with the vocals are saying you know it's like that I mean I gloss over a little bit because Vince staples was good the storyline is good the you know the twist was good you know there are a lot of good things about this record but you know when stuff like that is it's going to be on the back burner and you know it's gonna be on the back burner the story's got to be watertight right exactly especially because if you want to look at this from assembly it's a sequel it's a sequel album and then you know the the dreaded sequels are always worse aren't than the first movie this had the potential to be better cuz the story itself was way better story if they would have just hammered out those details like you said and also tighten up with the actual songwriting making sure everything sounds really good then I think this album would it clearly clearly took the first 12 reasons to die chain no problem because I think that the features are better on here on it's less wu-tang on here of course but when you when the features come in here even though you don't know the characters they still fit the story more and actually more believable then you know some of the some of the features on the previous album so I like that about it and also I just like I think the production here I actually enjoy a little bit more it's not dropping it but I think with the narrative that they had it fit perfectly especially like tracks like blackout in and get them up pretty much every track fit what the tone of the song was supposed to be so Adrian young actually I think he was more detailed and we're focused on the production standpoint as far as trying to find the perfect silencer to compliment ghost and Raekwon and anybody else and make sure that this story sounds believable because listening to it it sounds like a movie like you can play it as a movie just from the sonic feel of it just about how Adrian crafted it around these characters so I think he improved on that from the first one for them for me that's not to say alright what's a you know let's let's get this wrapped up would you recommend this record did you like it more than the last record you know in brief you know what it took me a while to determine but I'm actually on the same level I like this album for different reasons but overall for the same reasons too the same amount so I have to say just like the first one I gave it a grand at approve little things aside this is a great album great story productions good features are great so I got to give it a granddad approved Anthony I got I like it the shit's dope ok overall yes it's fucking amazing still even after all those things and I'm waiting for 3 I think there's gonna be a three and if there is I'm all over it because I want to know what's gonna happen next I'm liking it too I think it's really great I don't love it as much as 12 reasons to die one but this album was enjoyable from front to back there's a lot of great characteristics put together well good rap performances - good production and it does leave it cliffhanger for the third one and I think while this does feel like a little bit of a lull for me now you know it could really be tied together with a third record it's just like you know a really great trilogy and hopefully that great third part comes sooner rather than later and without any other attempts to try to make a story album without a dream too far to beaten out it can't but it can't change the formula now so like for all we know they're probably working on it right now cuz this one came out fairly soon from the last one so they cuz they already said there's gonna be three or more so we'll keep an eye on I'll keep an eye on it but it's good I mean yeah I would probably play if you wanna put a number on it I give 12 reasons one at ten I'll give this a nine based on things but I still enjoy the same and I'm a play - shit - fucking probably twelve reasons back three I mean as far as this record I mean I gave I gave 12 reasons to die I think like a strong eight or something I would probably get this one a seven it's a very good record I recommend it - it's not quite as standalone I think as for you I won but I mean that's that's not necessarily a bad thing because if you haven't heard the first one take this opportunity to go with the first one and then back-to-back they know you really sound like you're watching the fucking movie it's in the one and then I listen there to right after and I got popcorn and I sat there and listen to that shit and it's like a fucking movie if you close your eyes it's fucking dope it's like you really get it now I want to know I mean it's like a cliffhanger and it's like eyes like the greatest it's like Adrian young just as a general is a great producer Ghostface of course is a legend and this story that they created even though it's nothing really new from the whole wu-tang things like that but it's just an awesome story and awesome concept and I like it and I hope they build on it and really close it out properly because it deserves that with how great it's already going it deserves proper clothes out so that's what I'm looking forward to now as far as this the politic trilogy is gonna be that's one calling it alright that's the that's the review this record again I want to thank Willie for coming on to this review with me thank you for having me I will put a link down in the description box to his youtube

V6cbfRfO67s,hi everyone blue theny Pinkerton Oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ratatat record magnifique Ratatat is a New York electronic music duo featuring mr. Evan mast and Mike Stroud they've been making albums for years now well over a decade and they're pretty well known for their very lavish synth work and tightly harmonized guitar leads a trademark style that they have delivered on one record after another up until this point where they are now on their fifth full-length LP their first album in five years I did like their last full-length LP even though to some critics it might have seemed like the duo shtick was getting old at this point still though on LP for I think Ratatat prove themselves to still be pretty proficient when it came to creating little Pleasant pieces of electro rock ear candy the issue I occasionally have with ratchet ATS music though is that sometimes it comes off maybe a little bit too easygoing and mild the occasional issue I do have with Ratatat music though is that sometimes their music can kind of read like very mild-mannered instrumental pop not too showstopping or anything like that which to me is exactly how this album kicks off with the song cream on Chrome which has a sweet little groove kind of disco inspired but the dance beat here is just too polite to actually grab my attention and even elicit any kind of physical bobbing or moving from me and the song abrasive is really anything but the track does feature some pretty nice strokes ish guitar leads but the track really just ends up sounding like a music bed to a car commercial whereas I'm listening to I just envision a new Nissan Altima turning corners and turning heads as well with its sleek design in very low gas mileage that's right Cal head to your nearest Nissan dealer today and for no money down go home with a brand-new 2015 Nissan Altima and a complimentary copy of the new ratchet add record this is not a serious advertisement if you lease a new Nissan you will not be getting a new copy of the right to tie records Nissan did not pay me to do this this was a joke don't be a freaking idiot this was a joke and there are actually a few other tracks in the track listing here that I think kind of read like just music beds as well like the song compound tak and the track cold fingers - I mean at least the previous record had these spots where Ratatat took some risks with some foreign instrumentation or percussion to kind of just give a variety of different flavors across the the span of the record I wouldn't say there's as much diversity on magnific though Ratatat does at least an okay job of delivering some different sounds flavours styles here for one there are actually quite a few low-key tracks in the track listing here like the title track for the classical music influenced introduction on this album which is pretty beautiful I mean pretty stunning for the introduction of this album and the song drift - which features these beautiful sliding melodies could be slide guitar or some lap steel either way it's gorgeous the melodies on this track they're sweet they're precious they're soft they're they're tender they have a beautiful sort of echo or reverb on them and they sound sort of nostalgic in a way - like the referencing that that old Hawaiian music that there was a pretty big obsession with in popular culture and when when when when Hawaii became a state in the 1950s and these shimmering sliding nostalgic melodies come back on the song supreme as well with a bit of a Motown flavor sounds really great although the the quiet beauty of this song is ruined by like this very loud audible guitar or amplifier buzz that they didn't get rid of in posts really ruins the ambiance they were trying to put into this song I do like the song pricks of brightness as well although this track is is not a low-key song it's actually one of the more upbeat tracks and one of the few songs here where Ratatat goes for just more of a straightforward rock style with tons of harmonized guitar heroism laced in and it's a pretty well put together track and really feel good the song Rome than just more of a straightforward rock direction as well and succeeds in the process there's also the song nightclub amnesia here where we're getting a bit of grime ear dance beats which are actually like these dance beats are actually hard-hitting in comparison with the other dance beats on this record and kind of the grimy crunchy guitars on this track give this song a bit of grit - it reminds me a little bit of a human after all era Daft Punk this song is also one of the longer tracks in the track listing here and features a pretty nice melodic and sweet smoother second half and aside from the all too short song prime time this record ends off relatively strong - it features a sweet little peppy outro track which is just as gorgeous as the intro track here in rear entry and the song I will return brings in yet another series of kind of sad sliding lead melodies and even though in a sense I am kind of tired at this point of this album's lack of variation and versatility and just new fresh ideas for the Ratatat Canon this is a well-put-together instrumental and the very slow sad melodies do feel like a teary-eyed farewell which is very fitting not only for the title of this track but the end of this record overall not at all a bad effort from Ratatat nothing in the track listing here that I thought was truly awful a handful of mild tracks but for the most part they do come together with some great peppy songs a handful of great peppy songs and several sweet slower sadder tracks with these sliding lap steel esque melodies which are actually pretty moving I would love to hear these guys not only come out with another record sooner than five years down the road but a record where they take a few more risks or at least come out with other songs like nightclub amnesia where they're not only branching out of the simple verse chorus verse structure by kind of branching things off into another musical passage but also tracks that just have a bit more punch and a bit more bite to them none of them either that or just more subtle and moving like they were doing on some of the sadder and slower tracks and the track listing here feeling a light - decent seven on this thing Tran have you given this wrecker to listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Ratatat forever 
HF9GqC65Wjo,hi everyone nasally falsetto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new everything-everything record get to heaven let's get this over here because this makes sense everything everything is a UK music group and I've been wanting to review their music for a little while now specifically since their last full-length album released in 2013 arc these singles on this record caught my ear I thought they had a lot of potential thought they sound great thought they were really catchy had a really sort of fruity eccentric flavor to them but alas I could not review this album for it like wasn't really seeing a US release which was kind of disappointing it wasn't until recently that I actually realized I can I can stream this record on Spotify I mean you know finally I was impressed with the fact that this band seemed like they had a pretty eclectic approach to pop music pulling elements from pop music of course but also electronic music and rock music as well it was kind of progressive in a sense and had a weird left-field artsy Flair but was very immediate and ear wormy and there's some strong playing to and everything everything's arsenal especially coming from the very powerful rhythms and bustling percussion all over this record and I think the band features some pretty powerful vocals as well though they do have a really weird offbeat twang to them that I don't think is going to be for everybody it's it's not going to be for everybody but anybody but if you can appreciate the vocals of a band like alt-j I don't see why you can't dig on some of everything everything's vocals the singing on it everything everything record involves a lot of falsettos weird yelps and jumps and range from highs to lows in a sense it's a little an Co ish but I think it's a also very tune-yards ish as well and while we're making comparisons I think instrumentally though everything everything has something completely different going on than tune-yards or Animal Collective what they've got going on I think this this really tight groovy progressive indie rock music reminds me a lot of what bands who are taking quite a bit of headway in the 2000s were doing groups like battles their debut record or TV on the radio or even foals debut LP but I think everything-everything takes a sleeker sweeter maybe more accessible and modern approach not to put these guys above battles because I do love some battles come out with a new record please even though everything everything can get a little weird and left-field on this LP though at its core this is a pop record with very bright catchy memorable melodies and hooks the creative instrumentation in the kind of eccentric vocal style are just an added bonus and the very punchy clear and in heavy production as well is a nice touch maybe a little over compressed two points but every instrument is just super loud super clear very vivid and I would actually say the songs are pretty fantastic as well I mean the first half of this record is an incredible run with the opening song to the blade which features this blazing theme melody played out on guitar right after the very vulnerable falsettos that kick the song off very sad very moving I love the fact that the vocal on this record can be so quirky but convey so much emotion as well and I love the song distant pass which has this house ish build-up to the chorus with these very punchy Dancy piano stabs and also that that refrain to baby do the distant past of the title track on here is fantastic features this irresistible groove this kind of fruity Island from the future instrumentation the song regret is great as well right from the get-go the vocal hook on this track is just super super memorable just hooks me right in regret regret dad bail regret regret little bit and the song spring summer winter dread damn they just keep bringing the heat the I don't want to get older lyrics coming out of the refrain here very again some some sad wee you're kind of coming out on this record this is such a peppy record especially on this song with the keyboards but there's just a lot of sadness revealed in these lyrics and I wouldn't say that the album necessarily takes a nosedive past this point but maybe things start getting a little mild with the song the wheel while I do like the very fluttering colorful keyboards on the verses on this track and the really hard-hitting drum groove on this track too I guess my gripe with this track release its with the chorus where I think for a moment the groove the melody the pushing driving chords the writing is just so basic that it just kind of feels like a lesser more average band could have written it or delivered it whereas up until this point everything everything had been doing a really great job of balancing complexity but also catchy and for a band that is as overwhelming and colorful and as intricate as everything everything I think oversimplifying things can make stuff a little mild boring and the kind of fizzled finish on this song isn't really that fantastic either with the subdued throbbing electronics and the just very sad moaning vocals set against those it in a sense kind of reminded me a little bit of the King of Limbs but that might actually be a great thing for you if you really like that record more than me which was you know basically everybody on the planet still this very somber ending does glide into the very somber following track fortune-500 this is one of the moodier cuts on the record but it does have a big climactic horn finish it's a very patient slow burner and these two songs kind of create a lull in the album but the band does bounce back with song blasts doors and in a way they really come back hard super hard to the point where I think maybe they overdo it a little bit with these very urgent in-your-face spoken-word almost rapped vocals on the verses which trade off with maybe some of the most overbearing falsettos on the entire album they're just so difficult to put into words I mean they are just so this is an ear grabbing song even if it's not always grabbing my ear for the right reasons I think the record smoothes out mellows out a little bit after this point but still retains its kind of left-field flavor but also pop accessibility the song zero Ferro is a very interesting tune not only does it have this irresistible low-key groove to it but also these moments trade off with these spots that I suppose are a chorus in a sense but the instrumentation behind it just builds in tension until the band switches back off into these grooves and the final moments of this song just kind of build this tension to a really nice tight climax which is a formula the band revisits on a actually a handful of tracks here on the ending - they kind of love to incorporate these moments where they just draw these songs out into these little electronic odyssey's with these pulsating beats and blossoming synthesizers and while I'm not against this blueprint in theory they do overuse it a little bit on this LP and I think not every synth odyssey or sort of electronic Odyssey on this record is as necessary as the next especially on the ending track where it kind of leaves this album with a bit of a cold uneventful finish that's not to say that the song doesn't start off well it does I mean it has this fantastic groove which rides an odd time signature and the song preceding this one no reptiles is maybe one of my favorite tunes here and has one of the most hilarious refrains on the entire record about being a fat child in a pushchair who can buy a gun I just fear that once I understand this song it will in fact just be making fun of me because sometimes I do feel like a fat child in a pushchair and that is sort of this album in a nutshell I think this record has a lot of good things going for it I do think again my issues sometimes those falsettos can be a little bit much they're a little over the top they're not lazy glazed-over falsettos they are just in your face I like kind of you know wacky stuff but they carry a good melody and off what they are singing what they are saying is very catchy it's just again a weird twang e high-pitched vocal might take a little getting used to if you're not usually into these types of vocals but beyond that I think a lot of what everything everything is doing is very sweet is very accessible and is very fun and if you love strong intricate instrumentals with a lot of layers and a lot of color I think beyond the vocals everything everything has a lot going on for them as well and again catchy tunes as well I give this record kudos I think it has a lot of great things going for it I'm feeling a strong seven to like eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why but me do they taste it oh man did you what do you think I should review next I'm really curious we'll talk soon forever 
_ASR7i5RPKM,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new tame impala record currents tame impala is the recording project of producer multi-instrumentalist and songwriter mr. Kevin Parker who burst onto the scene with this band just about 5 years or so ago with the debut full-length LP inner speaker an album which at the time received plenty of acclaim though I personally wasn't that crazy about it mostly because it kind of sounded like a Beatles cover band for the indie generation I did not see the hype behind this LP but tame impalas 2nd full-length LP loner ISM that was another story this album in my opinion was an improvement of everything Tama Paulo had been doing just on all fronts better songs better writing and melodies and guitar parts better production with just more varied colorful guitar tones just a wider fuller more panoramic sound thought the vocals were a little better as well great drum sounds on this LP great bass lines on this LP and over time tame impala sort of grew to sit atop this psych pop throne they were the crown prince's of the modern psych pop revival however they seemed to be kind of passing the torch on this new record over here because what Kevin Parker and company deliver on this album is not just simply or purely psychedelic pop they have a more synthetic sound this time around there are more since on this record then there are lead guitars what I think changed and like things changing and a leg things to know changes and I know Jason know like this nothing he'll like nothing changes no bigs Tim I should change quite seems like things changing well it's not really that huge of a change guitar still plays a pretty significant role on this LP some key melodies and riffs are delivered via a guitar but guitars are no guitars I think Kevin's production style is still incredibly colorful lavish full and really psychedelic I think Kevin's use of synthesizers all over this record is really creative there are all sorts of glitches and effects and knob twisting that makes the sense on this LP sound really dynamic and just live in the moment organic and just like with tame Impala's previous full-length LP the bass lines on here or warm the groovy the drums are really Bumi and crispy I think overall Kevin continues to grow his craft as a songwriter - like with songs on here such as the very sensual ethereal ballad yes I'm changing or the song eventually where I love the way this tracks really booming heavy lead guitar melody contrasts very nicely with the very sweet soft subdued verses which are very dreamy mostly the synths on this LP are kind of an aesthetic change in a good aesthetic change I think throughout this record Kevin Parker pulls together he conjures a pretty wide array of sounds with these keyboards if there are any deeper changes to the songwriting style of tame impala it's on some cuts here where I'm hearing Kevin Parker incorporate like some New Wave isms here and there take for example the song the moment where the beat and the keyboards on here sound like a weird slightly musically altered version of Tears for Fears everybody wants to rule the world but it's an incredibly catchy song in its own right and I love the refrain on this track here that the disco tinged track the less I know the better is pretty great - and there are a few cuts in the track listing here that are short little dreamy psychedelic palate cleansers that bring us from one hulking track to the next I even liked some of the extended cuts on this record like the opening track which goes through one musical phase after another even one bit in the middle of the track where Kevin Parker just takes one loop and he just copies and pastes it into this groove that repeats over and over and over he throws a low-pass filter on it and it kind of sounds like I'm listening to an electronic dance music song a lot of different genres in forming this record I think it's in a way tame and Pallas most stylistically diverse project yet and even as Kevin Parker is just stretching these songs out into one phase after another I think things stay really engaging blissful colorful and fun mostly because the instrumentals are great and the production is just again fantastic this album I think has Kevin Parker's best production yet kudos but I do have my issue with this album and it's not really with the fact that things change stylistically on this record I think things in a way change for the better on this project I'm not against the way that Kevin changed his sound on this project my issue with the album is the vocals really on this record track for track Parker sings in the same nasal passive falsetto every new indie band these days does because they think it'll get them spot on the summer festival circuit and of course these vocals are washed out in effects because in what other way would they be listenable now it's not so bad that it makes me real back from just one single listen to this album or one single listen to a song from this album but it is so bad that it makes the album a little unbearable as it plods along and it does make tracks like cuz I'm kind of exhausting as Kevin sort of pushes the bear ability of his falsetto he does this as well on the song past life against some really weird lowly pitched spoken word which doesn't really feel like a great song as much as it is just a weird kind of filler moment so there are moments on here where the vocals get kind of hard to swallow where spots like realities in motion where the vocals are just so I don't know passionless flavorless just hanging in the background it's not really that engaging and then we have the song disciples around this same point in the tracklist which is like this one minute and change song which just kind of feels like an unfinished song just got a toss in the middle of the tracklist thing there's just a really weird spot right after the halfway point of this record where almost every song feels really lackluster thankfully the record ends semi strong though I was kind of disappointed that the last song just kind of low-key faded out out of nowhere and that's just how this record says goodbye this strange record definitely one of the more perplexing records of this year and and not because I think it's super experimental or super out there or anything like that I'm just a little torn because there are moments of serious psyche pop bliss on this album mostly in the first half which I think are fantastic some of tame Impala's best material yet and again I don't really mind the stylistic change here and I think the synth sound fantastic Kevin Parker some of the best production he's ever done but then the record quickly loses focus just out of nowhere and not only deliver some very weak vocals some overbearing vocals but also a few just weird unfinished moments and a really strange experiment and the record does redeem itself quite a bit after this point but it's not exactly fireworks or anything like that it's just a strange slightly inconsistent listen but I mostly came out of this thing liking what I heard and while I don't love this record as much as loner ISM I think I'm more excited for tame Impala's future because it's just great to see Kevin Parker taking risks Kevin Parker has shown me that this project has more within it then I think we gave it credit for even the fans some of whom are not giving this change of pace here any credit whatsoever so yeah while I do see it as a flawed album I thought it was pretty decent I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it you might hate it and if you do why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana tame impala forever 
_id0tOI2Z2Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review over here of the new nicolas jar soundtrack pomegranates electronic music producer songwriter DJ label head over at other people music i believe and formerly one half of darkseid mr. Nicolas jar he's easily one of my favorite modern artists but this year for whatever reason most likely because I suck I've been doing a bad job of keeping up with his latest exploits his latest nymphs EP was just okay seem like a more abstract version of a lot of the art pop and micro house that I typically expect from Nicolas and then we have this soundtrack over here which he released earlier this year but now it's available via a free download didn't really make the time to catch up with it up until this point and figured because it's a free download it's out there on the internet now just now isn't the time why not again this is a soundtrack for a film but it's not like Nicolas Jar was commissioned to compose a bunch of incidental music for a new movie he took it upon himself to go back and soundtrack an older film a 1969 avant-garde Soviet film by the name of the color of pomegranates of course the title of this project references the title of that film and the various titles of these songs reference the titles of the various vignettes throughout this movie you kind of get a bunch of small strange difficult to interpret scenes throughout this film I'm not an expert on the movie I haven't watched it a million times I'm not going to give you a synopsis or a bunch of spoilers here though I will leave a link down there in the description box where you can actually watch the film set to the soundtrack that Nicolas created for it you can sort of decide for yourself whether or not the music actually enhances the visuals but I'm here to just sort of talk about the music and being that this is a soundtrack Nicolas isn't really delivering these clear concise structured songs as much as he is kind of setting a mood creating motifs and moments that feel like settings and and places which is fitting considering the project but it makes this album soundtrack sort of difficult to enjoy just like any other normal commercial record I'd say my number one issue with this record is really the pacing of these songs but again the thing about these tracks is that they don't really follow any kind of logical pacing or length or structure as according to what would just sound good on its own they have to follow whatever amount of time they have given to them by a certain length of a scene so some tracks do feel a little too long other tracks are sort of short and I wish developed a bit more but I don't think that keeps this album from being interesting or at least enjoyable what I would call this record is a bit of a mood album something that I would really only enjoy if I had some time to kill and I was just specifically in the mood to hear this kind of strange experimental and ambient electronic music this is not the kind of music I grapple with in any kind of physical way at least not on most of the tracks there are a few cuts here that are kind of loud and one song in particular that has a very strong backing be the very cacophonous and glitchy Club Capitao pomegranates is way more like a framed painting that you've just kind of got to be very patient and be sitting there and staring at it in order to see the beauty that it has to offer and there is quite a bit of that there's no question in my mind that Nicolas jar dropped something of quality with this project for one the sounds on this record are heavy they are dynamic they're vivid when I put this record onto my stereo the songs here just fill the room there are some amazing sound crafting and mixing on this record not only with just the original bass sounds that you get out of these tracks but also with the very subtle and and wonderful effects Nick lays into a lot of these tracks even though there are some purely and and very clearly electronic elements running throughout all these tracks pretty much every song here feels really organic the keyboards the eerie vocals the very strange small clicky just noisy percussion all over this thing that is very sharp but also subtle too and the noise on this project and all the you completely undefinable sounds as well this project is the definition of what I would call a sound rich record and all the tracks here are really evocative even the quietest and most abstract of the tracks in the track listing here like the song past the time which is like whisper quiet with the exception of this one lone sad what sounds like a moaned vocal melody and with each song here feel like I'm just transported to a different place a different setting marble hallways dirt roads rolling green hills under moonlit skies or mountaintops and city streets too but no matter what the setting is there is a strong feeling of loneliness that runs throughout every single one of these songs and sad kind of beauty that is communicated through the wonderful melodies and also the endless atmospheres on a lot of these songs - again I do think the pacing on some of these songs can be kind of slow or other tracks do and sort of abruptly before they even hit the two-minute mark but again because Nick has to kind of follow what is going on in the film because the music here is obviously inspired by the film so significantly that he would create this project out of the blue completely based around it I did enjoy it I did love it but I wouldn't say I liked it in the same way that I do just a typical commercial release in the same way that I've enjoyed NICs space is only noise or even Darkseid's record from a little while ago however I would recommend this thing and it's easy to do so because it's it's a free download it's out there on the internet there's not really anything for you to lose by trying out this release it's the soundtrack I don't typically recommend or review soundtracks again for the reason of pacing and the fact that it's supposed to enhance the visuals of the film and that maybe a lot of the time I personally feel and maybe this is just my personal feeling I do feel like I'm missing a bit of something in the equation of just listening to the soundtrack by itself but once again I did enjoy listening to this it's just a very still very patient very subdued listen and you put this record on but it's really gonna be upon you to sort of wander its hallowed sonic halls and kind of pull any kind of meaning out of it for yourself personally because this is not a very strong physical catchy emotional record you're just like looking at a series of very desolate still lifes with these songs again I'm recommending this give it a download not scoring you're going anything crazy like that with it I just kind of have my reservations sometimes with soundtracks just thought I would talk about this record because you know I've listened to it I felt something and I thought that I should communicate it to you you're the best love you Anthony Fantan Oh Nicholas Jar Tran if you've listened what did you think of it you love it you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Nicholas jar pomegranates forever 
UabYjGe6xSo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little Wayne mixtape slash album thing the free Weezy album infamous rapper little Wayne I would like to think at this point that we don't need too much of an introduction of Wayne's history up until this point but it should be noted that Wayne's drama with his record label his current record label Cash Money Records has been making way more headlines this year than his actual music as Cash Money Records has put what was supposed to be his latest full-length commercial project on hold for the foreseeable future and it seems the little Wayne is kind of locked into a contract with Cash Money Records and he can't really put out a commercial record unless they put out for him but he wants released music commercially but they're kind of refusing to and now as a result little Wayne has gone back into mixtape mode earlier this year he dropped sorry for the wait - and now he seems be following that project up with the free wayne album which isn't sort of a commercially available record or a free downloadable mixtape it was introduced to the world as an exclusive title streamable project album tape thing which regardless of the quality of this project little Wayne has kind of a loud title to use his new album and his name like a pawn in the midst of this ongoing chess battle that they have going on with other music streaming services where they're all kind of you know trying to edge in on one another proving I'm more relevant than you I'm trying to be more relevant than you all we have this exclusive from this artist as places like title and Apple music and Spotify are fighting for music streaming supremacy artists are kind of getting caught in the crossfire and I think the relevancy is being hurt in the process of releasing exclusively streamable albums like this and for a second I thought that this album kind of being behind that exclusive title wall would make it so that I didn't really have to worry about it but of course people wanted to hear this project a vast majority of people that wanted to hear this project weren't necessarily going to pay for a title subscription and I had people messaging me right away saying oh hey have you heard the new Wayne I downloaded it it leaked I'm listening to it so obviously paid exclusive streaming is is not necessarily going to be a solution to piracy however I don't think anybody sort of anticipated that was going to be the case and even though little Wayne did make this move which I don't necessarily endorse I do understand his position given that he wants to put out a commercial project he wants to be paid for his music as far as we can tell cash money is just kind of refusing to allow that to happen so again I understand the situation however the free wayne album doesn't exactly make a case for Wayne to be allowed to start dropping commercial projects again for one the reception of this project has not been that strong and to the music isn't really that great I feel like track for track for track on this thing little Wayne is essentially just taking a lyrical piss on an assortment of instrumentals some of which kind of go hard they're aggressive their trap flavored in terms of the percussion and get the sub bass the rattling high hats there are some pop flavored instrumentals here with little piano and just some sweeter melodies there are some slow jams that tend to get a little emotional a little melodramatic and I like some of the beats in the track listing here a lot for one the song pull up is great though I'm mostly into this track just because the beat go so freaking hard it's a banger and euro who has a pretty good feature on this track as well keeps the energy of this song up I can't say if this song was just a little Wayne by himself I would love it as much as I do with Wayne and euro together I also love the really grand chorus vocals and the really refined strings in the heavy hitting percussion on the song glory that kicks this project off and the weird James Brown sample of the song I feel good on the song I feel good makes for a pretty great instrumental but as far as little Wayne song Wayne's verses are just kind of okay and the song actually becomes pretty unbearable as he is just I don't know what you would call it but with auto-tune he is just crying happy and there's some other very direct songs in the tracklisting here like I'm mad man hmm this song is like insultingly dumbed down like little Wayne thinks that the only way that I would enjoy a song from him is that if he makes it so simple and just so stupid that I don't know I guess even in the midst of some kind of horrible brain damage I could still understand what's going on of course in the tracklisting here they're slower tracks they're softer tracks songs that feature choruses that are incredibly melodramatic and corny featuring just the kind of singing that is like on some of the worst Eminem singles of the 2000s the song psycho for example there's also the song living right with Wiz Khalifa where the Bee is just so toned down Wiz Khalifa is just so smoked out of his brain and laid back and little Wayne isn't really going that aggressively either where the songs just lose pace they lose momentum they don't really pick up momentum at the start of the track I just think they grow very boring at maybe the halfway point because they didn't start off that strong to begin with and then we've got the song my heart races which features these really beautiful plinky pianos and a male singer reminds me kind of something that might have been on macklemore's big breakout record except little Wayne doesn't really sound that fantastic over this type of instrumental I think on a lot of the tracks here little Wayne isn't really coming through with any fantastic songs nor an original or captivating sound he's playing a lot of catch-up with recent trends and pop and rap even the song white girl with Jeezy while it is one of the more hard-hitting songs Lil Wayne's performance kind of just makes me wish I was listening to young thug I'm sorry but it's true and while Wayne can't flow on this record he's definitely got something going in terms of just staying on tempo but I feel like he's just on autopilot at this point I feel like there's no appreciation or focus whatsoever on what he's saying or even just pronouncing it so that you can pick up a lot of the lyrics properly but when I do pick up a lot of what's going on here lyrically I'm not really that impressed or surprised or really even entertained or interested it's just another round of those typical little Wayne punchlines some of them are okay but the most standout ones are standing out because they just make me go really there are a few tracks on here it feels like little Wayne is like a little focused on something like the song post bail ballin or even the track thinking about you but even here even in these spots when it doesn't sound like he's just saying anything that comes to the top of his head I feel like he's just kind of fooling around and doesn't come off that focus doesn't come off that did it it determined there's just really no ambition going for much of little Wayne's latest output I feel I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing did not like it I don't really think has much of anything going on for it and I'm not really sure what there is to say at this point again I feel like little Wayne flows on this project and I think he delivers some semblance of energy on some of these songs but lyrically there's just a complete lack of focus and little Wayne unless he's working with a writer I think he's just not coming through with coherent songs at least not coherent captivating songs the closest thing to what you could call songs on this record just kind of sound like bland pop rap runoffs like you could basically plug any rapper into these instrumentals and you would just get yet another generic pop rap song I think Wayne is running on fumes on this project and on is his most recent output in general unless he comes through with some kind of smash that's going to take him to the top of relevancy again or some kind of novel idea or approach or direction that's going to make us turn our heads in his direction again I don't really think there's any reason to look forward to another little Wayne project if he just keeps dropping unfocused verses on top of a bunch of trendy instrumentals then what's the point honestly transition have you given this record to listen if you did did you listen to it on title and what you think of it did you love it did you hate it and why

DjLOULyrVZs,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new internet record egodeath the Internet is a West coast-based neo-soul outfit affiliated with the now-defunct Odd Future Wolfgang kill them all their debut record was sort of one of the initial kind of run or hype records that a lot of people were just really excited about when Odd Future really came out and said okay we're going to start just dropping albums from our other members and of course the two people affiliated with this project most notably were vocalist Sid the Kid and producer Matt Martians but musically this project really got off to a rocky start as most odd future discographies did on the Internet's debut record not only was their incredibly weak singing and production but some awful songs as well easily some of the worst songs of the year this record dropped like the track cocaine and just when I thought the Internet could not get any more amateur and unlistenable then came their next record feelgood where SIDS vocals continued to feel flat passionless and also on this album the internet did try to take a risk here with a larger instrumental presence not quite feeling so synthetic as the debut album so the internet was bringing on some live instrumentation however this instrumentation a lot of the time was not mixed nor was it performed all that well like the really oddly and just terribly mixed drums on the song the pupil I the patients or the song cloud of our own which kind of sounded like this really jumbled live demo and not only that but the internet also brought on other people to sing not good with them like Mac Miller huh so we have a new internet record here a few changes have been made we actually have a full band here we have a band there is quite a bit of live instrumentation on this new project here and the most important thing is that it's it's mixed kind of good and it sounds like we practiced and the drums and the keyboards and the guitar the bay guitar they actually like fit together well compositionally this record is listenable and that's great that's good listenable is good and what's also great is that there are no songs on here that are so horribly tasteless that they make me flip backwards in my chair like cocaine so the internet i give them kudos I applaud the strides they made on this record however still Sid the kid is very far from being a captivating vocalist I think she hits her marks more often now especially when it comes to pitch it doesn't sound like she is pushing herself out of her range too much as she was on the Internet's earlier stuff and when she does reach into that upper range of her sometimes it sounds pretty decent there are tracks on this LP like go with it where I'm actually kind of surprised she really pulls through with some passionate vocals and the instrumentals here they're not bad I mean I you could say they're lightly funky and very pleasant to listen to I just think they could use a more captivating singer to really make them come alive and feel like more than just a lightly painted canvas because some of the decent grooves on this LP go a little stale because there's not really anything that interesting going on vocally I think often a lot of the songs here just fall into the background but I will say some of the tracks here do legitimately come through with some head bobbing grooves like on the second half of the song Gaby which features a kind of elusive Janelle Monae feature where where's she on this track I don't know is she on the songs kind of filler like ending that comes through out of nowhere and they're just guides the song out abruptly and the song with Vic mint on here had a great beat as well the track go with it to mention that song again there was a time for the internet where at activating groove seemed like an impossibility and now there are numerous tracks here where that's just what they're doing good good but there's still some stiff moments on this album like on the song I tried and I think that some of these moments could have been overcome if it weren't for the fact that some of the drum programming on this LP gets a little old and flavorless the the percussion the sequenced drums sound kind of flat I just wish there was more live percussion on this thing that's all it most likely would have fit the very smooth and funky tone of the keys the bass and the guitar a lot better because the song special affair does not groove as hard as it could or the song something is missing where I think the thing that is missing is really a groove especially during the instrumental transition in the middle of the track and there are low two moments on here I'm not really all that enthralled with the songwriting going on here there's very few tracks or actually come away thinking oh wow this is a great hook or well this is a great vocal melody right here here's some fantastic you know lyrics or this song has a great structure or something like that I think there are a lot of respects where the Internet still has a lot to learn but I still think this record over here is a vast improvement upon the past - in terms of just sound quality and instrumental quality and at least the vocals are you know falling off pitch left and right or sounding just so amateurish that I can't even sit through this record and so yeah I mean I could sit through this record it's cool to see so many young artists embracing the the neo-soul sound right now I mean it's it's definitely a genre worth resurrecting or I guess rather keeping the torch lit but the vocal bar is just so much higher than where this band is currently reaching if we're looking at a great neo-soul record as is the songwriting bar honestly I'm feeling a light 5 on this LP transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantan oh the internet forever 
RO9DZXtFGk4,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for my least favorite segment on this channel the why you know review where I discuss in brief a series of records I have not touched down upon in a full review this past month so I'm just going to talk about them a little bit brief Li here sometimes very briefly other times a little briefly but you know just just abridged this is a sweet little neo soul record from Bilal Kendrick Lamar collaborator he is also a solo artist obviously he has numerous albums under his belt at this point had one record in the early 2000s but I guess didn't really sort of continue his solo career for a while past that point has been releasing albums again recently some of which have been kind of I don't know just plainly or cleanly produced wasn't really seeing the hubbub or anything around his solo material but then he teams up with none other than Adrian young on this new project over here who you might remember also produced music for Ghostface Killah x' album 12 reasons to die produced that record with his band and coming together with Bilal on this record was a really great move for both of them I mean the instrumentals are great Bilal's performances are good as well I'm not so crazy about some of the songs but this is a good neo-soul record with some great production a lot of personality a lot of color and some impressive features as well big crits on here and Kendrick has a fantastic feature too didn't want to you know wait too long to talk about this thing didn't want to wait several weeks in order to sort of get a review out for it this month so I figured I would just talk about at the top of this video and just let you know you should check this out if you heard that Kendrick Lamar record and you loved it you should check this out if you heard Adrien Young's production if you love vintage old school just rock and funk and soul instrumental sounds you should check out this record cool cool all right this one Norwegian band for a while now they've been fusing jazz funk electronic music and dance music a little bit too on their last record they kind of departed in in this direction it didn't come together too well but I those sounds and those styles are fused together much better on this new project over here if you'd love to hear those genres sort of pulled together into these lengthy instrumentals please do give this thing a listen but for me personally I do think some of the jams get kind of mild as they continue I think jaga Jazz's has a fantastic way of starting off tracks some of the songs here end well as well but when it comes to just kind of the meet the point of tension the center pieces of these songs it can get a little stale that's all they do it again they really do it again they make hyped just in your face garage punk again shout out to a white Reaper this is a super super nostalgic just heavy old-school stoner rock type record I mean really bringing back the sounds of Sabbath on this project and they definitely do the sound justice there's no denying that but in a way they do kind of sound like a cover band a little bit but they're not covering songs they're just covering a sound which I'm just not too crazy about again they do the sound justice if you really want to hear this sound check out this band because they do the sound justice I was just hoping they would kind of carve out you know a niche for themselves within it and I don't I don't think they do that on this new project sons Greg Anderson and an vocalist Peter Stahl coming together again on another go snake record the band's first LP in like 15 years so I don't know like in a way a comeback album and it definitely gives you what the album title itself says I mean you're getting this really heavy bluesy rock music and I mean I really love the production it's super heavy super thick I mean the great production you would expect from something that Greg Anderson is involved with but Stahl's vocals not not too crazy about them I think he's a little too campy sometimes on these tracks but still a lot of the songs are pretty decent definitely check this out if you're looking for something just with with a strong soulful rock vibe and just some great modern production just really cool mix of the new the old in terms of sounds and aesthetics and just the playing style Oh outside of a couple tracks I'm not I'm really not this album sounds like someone recorded two audio their performance art project that they got accion in in art school okay I get it this record has a different vibe for most hip-hop albums but it's not you know super corny or super like cringe-worthy like you know some of these alternative rappers or anything like that it's it's decent it has some decent moments to it it has personality but just after a while here and somebody try to be so dark and so deep and so just just in a state of just darkness and depth for so long just gets really tiring and really old and makes the record feel like it has a just a just a lack of variation just kind of a one-dimensional personality I just wish this album add you know more gears more just changes I like the darkness on some of the tracks but I just wish it changed up there just just a little bit uh is this okay is this album great no but I mean I I really had no reason to expect it was gonna be great Ludacris he's had some fantastic singles but even his best stuff back in the 2000s was just like okay he's never been like an amazing album artist he's always had great songs great singles boom that's come to the album when it's come to the long game Ludacris has never really been one of those amazing rappers and now on this new project even the singles aren't that great like the very cringy grass is greener like oh I used to do this and now I do this I wanted to do that but now I change my my grass is greener mm-hmm and then other tracks like charge it to the rap game which is just like a really bitter diary like song about just Ludacris's fall and fame in the rap game which like I don't know dude if you want to stay current if you want to stay relevant in hip-hop you've got to keep up with the trends of the genre I mean it's it's not anybody's fault that you collab with Bieber and then fell off the face of the planet what can you say some UK art pop and psych on this record a lot of people may ask me what I think about this LP it's it's okay I like the instrumentals I think that bands songs aren't too bad but I just don't care for the vocals the vocals do absolutely nothing for me whatsoever especially when they're sort of harmonized in this beachboys type way I mean I think django django definitely like shoots for Beach Boys like level talent and songwriting but sort of falls a little short at least in the performance end of things especially on the vocals and to sort of end things off this little Milo side project over here if you're into just alternative left-field abstract stuff over some strange beats and some you know very quirky references but I think Milo emotionally and just what he's trying to say on these songs is way more esoteric way more hard to a wrestle with I've spoken with him before about his love of philosophy and particular rappers not for rappers but philosophers whose works are kind of difficult to read and understand and I kind of feel like that's that's that's a little bit of his approach on this project even though he calls it a plane speaking at least for me anyway it seems a little bit like the opposite and yeah I mean I think he sort of experiments a little sonically and stylistically on this project too there are some rap flows on here that do feel like you know actual direct like tempo riding rap flows which he usually sort of side steps a little bit sort of a in exchange for a flow that sort of borders on spoken word a bit and here I I don't really think it's that cohesive of a project but he's definitely experimenting trying some new things some of which I wouldn't really mind hearing on his next main Milo album when he does see fit to drop another one of those in the future and yeah those are all the records I wanted to touch down in on with at this uh y-you know review thank you for watching transition well I hope you have a good day forever oh and you know subscribe hit the goddamn subscribe button waiting I'm waiting okay there you go there you go good job good job thank you thank you 
7ZXiqlTUHUY,hey everyone Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of let's see looks like the new miguel album Wildheart miguel west coast R&B singer-songwriter who caught a bit of praise a couple of years ago while his breakout album kaleidoscope dreams and miguel was kind of angled by PR as well as the music press as this R&B artist who not only had pop and chart appeal but simultaneously somebody who had an artistic flair that garnered just a load of very positive reviews but personally I just kind of found his stuff a little middle-of-the-road it wasn't quite left-field and alternative and I guess sort of trailblazing in the way that I might see fka twigs LP one such a good record but on the flip side I didn't really find his stuff all that catchy or poppy either I mean it was certainly pleasant to listen to but nothing so bold an earworm like that I would catch myself singing it or even remember it and I think part of what kept this album from really being tangible and catchy is that I thought that Miguel often was kind of swallowed his vocals anyway in the very ethereal production on this thing so remembering that I was looking forward to this new LP hoping Miguel would go into something just bigger bolder just just I could really grab on this new project but then look at the cover the album are on this thing should tell you that Miguel isn't really all that interested in doing a down to earth project here I mean he looks like a naked yoga instructor in the middle of some kind of nocturnal blue red pink cloud dreamland but there are some spots on this new project where Miguel really comes through with some very upfront Frank song topics with vocals that don't feel at all a wash in reverb take the song what's normal anyway for example this track has a kind of a plane instrumental behind it but the message of the song is really endearing Miguel is an artist and I guess somebody who sees the world in a different way as well as a man of color sort of having a hard time finding a groove per click or I guess 'sir a culture to really totally feel in touch with and feel accepted by it's cute song and we have the song the valley as well which is maybe the most upfront track on the entire LP in terms of its message and Miguel's voice the track has this in-your-face sexuality going on in the lyrics which is totally fine love a dirty record but there's nothing really all that sexy to me about this song nothing sexy about it's just really synthetic redundant instrumental that loses its flavor after a few bars and nothing sexy about its lyrics either I mean just the blatant mention of fucking isn't really all that titillating or interesting to me nor is it all that interesting to sort of say hey let's fuck like we're filming in the valley you know sort of saying let's have sex like we're on a porno set which I don't know I mean I don't really see the poetry in that or the beauty in that or even really I guess the the temptation of that I mean you want to have sex like it's your job in front of a bunch of light maybe sweaty dudes with cameras and lights hat sexy and then we have the song NWA which is a freaky little number on this LP where we get a lot of falsetto vocals from Miguel and he essentially channels his inner prince so while I do appreciate the Miguel is a little more up front on some of these tracks many of the other songs here are mired in the same veil of sonic muddiness with a lot of lololo just quietly mixed vocals Miguel just seems obscured once again but this time he is set against some toothless instrumentals some of which are kind of I don't know messy I wouldn't say lo-fi they don't seem like distorted or anything like that but the production doesn't really seem that great take for example the song deal the first time I heard this track my reaction was whoa hey I didn't know we were getting tore my demos on this album so wait and those whoa-oh-oh-oh vocals floating in the background those do not at all sound like a shortest thing at least not as much a chore as they are to listen to hearing Miguel pump out these incredibly mediocre add vocals is perplexing because there are other tracks on here where he sings very well like at the very end of coffee it's moments like this where Miguel is really just pushing out the energy pushing out the passion reaching into his upper range that makes me feel like I'm listening to two different vocalists on this LP and sometimes on this LP even when Miguel is being charismatic he is set against a kind of low Phi and muddy instrumental like on the song waves which definitely is one of the funkier tracks in the track listing here but this sound this instrumental sound is so bland it's a little demo ish and the song Hollywood dreams has a kind of diamond in the rough quality to it too and I'm not against low fine music but Miguel and fisticuffs on this track they don't really do anything interesting with this aesthetic it just kind of feels like again a bit of a in the rough song and the instrumentals on this LP are not just weak sometimes in sound but in the way they're put together musically as well like the really boring three note guitar line and sub base hits and drums and vocals on the song going to hell which don't really sync up together that well sometimes and then there's the song flesh which thinks it's way more sensual than it actually is I mean just because your song is ethereal does not necessarily make it you know an emotional dramatic sensual experience I actually found this track to be kind of chilly less like a warm fleshy sweaty smooth embrace and more like a plunge into the Arctic waters again I think Miguel comes through with a pretty atmosphere with his producers on this record but musically it's so Hollow and just doesn't really leave me with much to munch on again I hate to bring it up but the fka twigs are record I think is a fantastic example of an alternative R&B album that while subtle and while quiet and while just very toned down has a lot going on compositionally and you've really got to dive into it and listen closely to here and just eat up all those minor there pretty very beautiful details whereas here we're getting a lot of atmosphere we're getting a lot of just ethereal waves just cavernous reverbs but all of this space is mostly left empty it's very hollow for me overall this LP was a very weak follow-up for Miguel didn't like it did not like it didn't even think it was decent in the way his last album was and though I do give him some semblance of kudos because I think he took some stylistic risks on this LP like on the song leaves where we're essentially getting a rock song in a sense with some driving drums and a lone guitar being strummed but here again I kind of feel like we're not really getting a whole complete fantastic song it's just sort of Miguel riffing vocally off the top of his head and delivering some kind of redundant lyrics over just a very light hollow Rock instrumental there's just nothing about this LP this is all that consistent some of the instrumentals are really clear and sound fantastic a lot of them don't some of the vocals are upfront they're well performed the lyrics aren't too bad either but that's not the case for most of the LP Miguel sounds fine approaching some genres he sounds weaker on others just not really that excited with this LP honestly I'm finding this even less memorable than the last project and I can't say with this album just having heard this album I'm that excited to hear what Miguel is going to be doing next in a way it's it's pleasant it certainly can can play in the background but as far as like foreground listening there's really not much interesting going on I mean and I don't even really find this record to be as sexy as some people are charging it to be I mean I wouldn't even think of this as being a soundtrack for that I mean I'm getting you know chills and just stuttering thinking about that just being filled with fear filled with fear feeling a light too decent five on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantan Oh Miguel forever 
XfiJ9qQxsA0,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Meek Mill album dreams are worth more than money can't can't put a price on dreams meek Millz he's my favorite rats not plural you can't even PluralEyes mill because it's his name but you gotta call him meals cuz he makes the mills Meek Mill Philly rapper this is his sophomore commercial project for the Maybach Music Group and to be honest I never really cared for his work that much previously didn't care for those dream chasers mixtapes and his debut commercial album didn't really stop me in my tracks either even though I did like the more hyped tracks that Meek had put onto that record regardless I thought I would give this new project a try and let's pleasantly summarize in a sense I kind of got what I expected from this thing I mean I got a series of just trap flavored trap inspired instrumentals with those rattling high hats those really just crispy snares the heavy sub bass and of course on top of these instrumentals meek delivers a series of verses about crime sex money violence and the lavish lifestyle mr. Meek Mill leads there are a few instrumental surprises in the track listing here like on the Bangladesh B which backs the song classic which has this just booming choppy drum be a weird quirky piano line and meek just rides the groove of this track like a star and his energy is charisma on this track and buyeth just how weird and just left-field the instrumental is easily makes it one of my favorite cuts on the entire record but you know don't don't make any mistake I mean even though there are a few oddball tracks here that are enjoyable this is very much like a trendy sort of chart focused release everything from the pop rap style choruses on this record to a lot of the features that are here like future on on a cut on this record where he didn't really overstep his boundaries on this track Meek Mill really sort of remained the focus of this track for me but the Sun wasn't structured all that well and sort of when one artist should be featuring and when the other should as well as just the song kind of ending out of nowhere just kind of left it feeling like a bit of filler in the tracklisting here it's kind of a shame that you know future wasn't utilized a little bit better to sort of come through with a smash chorus we have Chris Brown on here who whenever I see him I groan but you know his singing wasn't too bad on this LP Nicki Minaj appears on this project twice if you're not aware maybe you're not but Nicki Minaj and mr. mill are together so it's cool to actually see her coming through and supporting him on this project not only delivering a verse on one track but singing on another and even though I'm not crazy about each of these artists individually I can't really deny that there is some kind of semblance of chemistry the verses they delivered on the first track definitely complemented one another and sort of weaved in together a bit which was a nice touch and meek and Nicki came together with a you know a bit of a love song concept on the latter half of this record - which is cool Drake appears on here his feature was okay kind of average for him didn't really stick out too much but Rick Ross actually came through with a really catchy flow when he appeared on this project so that's great the weekend didn't really blow me away either he kind of had a you know sort of an average feature for him as well it was fine you know just wasn't really anything unexpected I guess and then puffy P Diddy sort of comes through on the latter half of this record doesn't really rap or anything like that just kind of does this weird monologue interlude thing where he's kind of talking to Meek Mill in a very fatherly way about money and Swizz Beatz man he just you just could not stop they need a bit goddammit maybe at this point some of you aren't really that excited to listen to this record from all those people that I just named but I think me actually does some interesting things with these trendy names and instrumentals and formulas for sure on this record even though you do have some traps style percussion and the drums we have the opener here Lord knows which samples this just huge huge cut of Mozart's lacrimosa which is incredibly epic something that I in theory I would have thought was just a little - I don't know just presumptuous or just like you really want to sound like you know big with a classical sample but it actually goes over really well there's also the really awesome plucked strings on the song Rico and the very smooth synth funk playing in the background on the song stand up as well as the awesome gorgeous pianos on the closing track here which create just this really emotional sound bed for the stuff that meek is saying about just the way money and fame has kind of changed his friend and family dynamic at this point in his career I guess I'm trying to say is while this record does seem familiar style wise in terms of just the modern hip-hop soundscape it's really extravagant it's really pretty to listen to there are even some tracks and instrumentals here that have kind of an eerie atmosphere surrounding them like on the song I got the juice it's very trapped Lord Ian and what I also have to know on here and a lot of Meek Mill fans already know about this but you know I have to say that meek Mill's delivery on this record is super impassioned and over-the-top and charismatic he is just so energetic and some of his best tracks in the past have featured this characteristic but he brings it so consistently on this new album here that it's kind of hard to deny especially on tracks like lord knows and ambitions which is like maybe the most whip worthy rap song I've heard this year this song must play in the whip it bumps in the whip shout-out to FIFO if there is a downside to Meeks delivery it's that his lyrics are very blunt they're very direct not a whole lot of subtext or wordplay or anything like that so after he's done rapping he doesn't really leave you with too much to contemplate or kind of you know munch on and occasionally you know there's the line here there where it's a little questionable sort of like I'm a song the trillest we're in the midst of talking about all the money that he makes and spends he refers to himself as the hungriest hippo we kick Liu Kang I think it's pretty you know I guess safe to say that generally on this project Meek Mill does not come off that deep but he does come through on this album occasionally with a few introspective moments again on the track the trillest where he's not only talking about the money he makes and the money that he spends but kind of spending it frivolously or maybe just I guess wrongfully where he should be spending time and spending money on his kid or his family it's a statement on greed and also being blinded by the light being shined at you because you are famous and the closing track here is also a bit about that as well like I mentioned earlier sort of affecting that family dynamic the money the fame etc so these emotional moments do at least provide some semblance of balance to this very you know get money get money get money album which admittedly is really when this album is is at its most entertaining anyway like on the song bin that bin that and the song check I love the instrumental on bin that has this awesome just siren synthesizer very ear grabbing very loud in your face a lot like Meek Mill in general front to back this is a pretty solid album there wasn't really any one track I thought was like awful or horrible or anything like that just kind of a series of songs that just felt a little more I guess unoriginal than others and again there is kind of that track with future which just feels like a bit of a I don't know an unorganized mess there's also the really clumsily auto-tuned or like talked boxed chorus on the song stand up that does not sound good at all and maybe Puffy's interlude or monologue just lasted I don't know a little too long there's also the fact that even though meek isn't really you know a rapper whose lyrics just blow me away I didn't really come away from this album with that much in the way of quotables I mean even rappers who tend to be sort of more direct more blunt more simplistic at least come through with something just you know really cutthroat or savage or even funny this album didn't really seem to have much in the way of that meek isn't garbage lyrically but I feel like given his passion given his flow given his taste his fantastic taste and instrumentals on this project he could be doing a bit more that's all I'm feeling a strong 7 to late 8 on this thing you 
wkvfJbW31Pg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd sick of looking at myself and it's time for a review of the new refused album freedom yep that's how we're gonna save the world reduce refuse and recycle you know you just you just don't understand the things I say you don't understand this isn't this is a music review show that these are just band names and I'm just gonna let it slide this time because um you just seem like a simple guy you seem nice and I'm just not gonna get mad it's not gonna get mad I appreciate that I appreciate you not acting toward anger I refused is a Swedish rock band who back in the late 90s released a full-length LP that did exactly what its title said it would do it in fact influenced and kind of set the stage for a lot of the rhythmically complex hardcore an art Punk that would be released throughout the 2000s but after the release of this help he refused essentially put things on hold kind of broke up for all intensive purposes and they've been in a state of studio albums silence for over 15 years oh my god long time now a few years ago the band has been getting back together for live performances didn't really know a full-length album was in the works but here we go it's here freedom it's here the band tees toward the cell peen not too long ago with a lead single Elektra that opens this album up it was a pretty mild track not terrible but also not quite as exciting or blood pumping or I guess technically complex as a lot of the Bands old stuff their last album specifically but they were still hope for this album for me because this song you know sounded like it was in refused style they weren't gonna be throwing us a left hook not really delivering what people would expect can kind of be a nail in the coffin for a comeback record but comeback records in general are just like a recipe for disappointment either people want you to make the sound you used to make but you sound too different now or maybe you sound too much like the old days I mean that there's there's just no pleasing people on the comeback I mean just as the the margin of success for comeback record is just so low expectations are just so high meeting them becomes a near impossibility and I don't know I just don't really feel like this new comeback record really lives up to what I was hoping for it to be quality wise either and I don't really think this album even lived up to refused expectations I mean they certainly seemed to give up pretty easy as soon as the first track of this album rolls by where it kind of feels like they've said to themselves alright so that was sort of in our usual style but there's no way we're gonna be besting ourselves when it comes to that so let's just completely change pace let's just completely start incorporating elements into our music that no way our fans are gonna like and I think that is exactly what happens on the second track here where we start getting some weird deeply pitched vocals on the course of this track as well as some hard rock guitars and drums but there's something kind of weird and left-field about this song and I think that in a way kind of reminds me of like the weird stuff Faith No More used to do and even though there is a really clear hardrock influence on this track refuse still maintains its really aggressive production style their screamed vocals it still sounds like a refuse track refused really takes a risk on this track they do something weird with this hard rock style and I think it turns out into a pretty interesting song I feel the same way about the song destroy the man as well which has these just hard rocking guitars these really cool background vocals it just feels like I'm listening to hard rock and rock and roll from another weird dimension and I think the band could have come through the refreshing record if they continued to work this angle but I feel like the hard rock influences the glam rock and the gland metal influences on this record lose their novelty at about the fourth track into this album because the band stops experimenting with them they stop warping them and I think they just almost literally start just delivering some cheesy hard rock especially with the kids chorus on this track and this bluesy guitar riffs I kind of feel like I'm listening to like an Aerosmith song or something the sound of this track is really shallow meanwhile the lyrics are trying to make the sensationalist statement about violence and murder and genocide and the slower tracks and the track listing here the ones that have more melodic vocals like the next song on here the very long-winded closing track I feel like refused push themselves in the territory where is the lyrics and the vocal delivery just sounds so so melodramatic and the way the band incorporates horns into some of these songs as well like war on the palaces just so overblown this track specifically just like reeks of hairspray and and headbands and Flying V guitars it's not really a sound I want to hear from any band much less refused Plus on top of it the fact that this record is just like a very brief 10 tracks it just feels like refused didn't really fold under the pressure of coming together with a comeback record rather it feels like they just saw the pressure there and they're like you know let's just not even wrestle with that who cares whatever there were definitely a few moments on this LP where the addition of the hard rock riffs made things kind of interesting but for the most part it just kind of feels like it's this element the band switched in for just kind of a songwriting crutch like oh you know we could do this though I do like the drumming on this LP I do like the vocals for the most part I do think the production is pretty good it just kind of feels like songwriting was the band got SuperDuper complacent as well as hokey with the way they were just aping all of these eighties hard rock riffs which really just create a dry spell of enjoyability in about the midpoint of the record the album starts off okay and it ends alright too but just getting through that middle part is really just a chore my god I'm feeling a decent strong four on this thing transition have you given this record of listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana refused forever 
vAielISeWPg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick list Oh a list a list of my favorite records in 2015 thus far no promises on these records making it into my top ten of the year because what if 10 amazing records come out between now and the end of the year and it's completely blow all these albums away hey it could happen it could totally happen but yeah what so let's just you know talk about these records man 15 of my favorite albums of 2015 so far starting with Bjork's latest full-length LP volnek era art pop artist singer producer fantastic singer björk has come through with eight heartbreaking and very personal record with volnek here a bit of a breakup record of sorts with some very just heart-wrenching lyrics on some of these tracks not only just one of her sadder records but one of her most conceptual to definitely give this thing a listen and has a very you know kind of wispy whimsical very string heavy sound that reminds me quite a bit of my favorite Bjork record Vespertine so it's kind of cool to sort of see Brewer go back to that sonic era of her career on this project next the Newsies record zzs is an experimental rock band sort of jazz ish group and this is a pretty perplexing hypnotic repetitive and very textured album one of their simplest albums - with just some drums on here a bit of guitar some sax some you know sort of other sounds flying around this bass instrumentation but these guys go into some just intense and hypnotic performances on this album next one of the best singer-songwriter records I've heard this year something with just a lot of hutzpah a lot of humor just a good sense of humor on this album as well as some very well written songs and some great vocals too and some lavish instrumentation of course I'm talking about the new father John misty record I love you honey bear easily some of my favorite songs of this year landing on album do not miss out on this one and also on this list we have the comeback record of one of the most fearsome bands in post-punk the pop group with citizens aam be very colorful weird odd but catchy and poppy at points record let's go straight into a bit of pop punk with the new Jeff Rossen stock album we cool an album that is very reflective contemplative but still has I don't know this kind of self-deprecating sense of humor to it that uh you know really helps me get through the pain suffering the suburban suffering it's it's it's it's it's a fun record but has kind of a very dark sense of humor and a very strong sense of I guess depression flowing throughout some of these very just rowdy and catchy and fun songs next the new Clarence clarity album no now fantastic R&B and pop record from this year easily my favorite pop record of the year so far yeah I would have to say definitely my favorite pop record and R&B record of the year I mean there's a lot of alternative R&B out there right now a lot of it is very moody and Atmospheric and very spacious but Clarence clarity took the opposite approach on this project and just overloaded his songs with sounds these are incredibly dense songs and not only are they dense but they are fantastically written a lot of them and Clarence brings over an hour of material on this project and this is his debut project and some of the songs out here still remain some of my favorite tracks of the year I keep going back to this record there are some sick freaking jams on this record if there's one album in my list here that I hope gets more hype before the year is is over it's this one and of course it's on here come on man new Kendrick Lamar record to bend the butterfly oh my god it's it's still great it's it's still great everything that I would need to say about this record is in my review watch my review it's linked in the description box also the new Death Grips LP the powers the beer I guess rather the completion of this double album with the second half Jenny death and I sort of counted the first half and sort of my summation of this record and yeah I mean you know both great interesting sister albums easily one of Death Grips most abstract records and one of Death Grips more catchy and visceral albums bunched together under one umbrella and Death Grips just continues to push the boundaries of modern music between pop and rock and hip hop and just noise I mean it just they continue to just blow me away if you're looking for something fierce if you're looking for something that is gonna just reach into that skull rip it back and just pull all these genres together in ways that you never assume these genres could be pulled with easily one of the most electrifying frontmen in modern music today right there on the mic we have the new that Death Grips record listen to it and this next album here is a jazz monster one of the biggest and most ambitious jazz albums in in in modern music I mean I can't remember the last time there was a jazz record that I was this excited about also a jazz album that in terms of just instrumentation length and performance was so immense of course the new Kumasi washington album the epic fantastic freakin album fantastic freaking album just you know can't say a mean thing about this record it's a little long but it is like a triple album it's like a three-hour album but you know each record is kind of like a record in and of itself so again like I said in my review don't feel obligated to listen to this whole thing like if I can't listen to all of it in one sitting they're not really enjoying it you know enjoy each piece at your own pace it's a fantastic project I would hate for someone to see the length of this project and think Oh listen to that look don't do that to yourself don't do it another album that is pretty hulking but still very interesting is the new Prien record frozen Niagara Falls this is a noise record an ambient record a power electronics record a death industrial record some weird eighties synth sci fi progressive --scent soundtrack music record like horror synth record there is so much eeriness and horrifying stuff going on throughout this double album the Korean does a fantastic job here of making a record that is not just musical but very emotional as well I mean just these just very upfront sad raw angry human emotions that I mean as the listener you have to grapple with them this is not a record that just kind of plays in the background this record brings a strong strong unag nora bewitch is something that you don't often get in abstract music music this abstract usually the intentions and the feelings are a little harder to kind of pull out of the music but Perrine really just shoves them in your face neck neck neck next to the new Algiers album self-titled record this is their debut full-length album on Matador Records this album is an amazing and interesting fusion of post-punk goth rock soul blues and gospel genres that you typically don't see mixing and maybe for obvious reasons because I imagine mixing them isn't really that easy but yet Algiers makes it sound so easy with some really fantastically written songs - I wish the record was sequenced a little bit better or just had a you know a better opener a better closer but man what what is in the middle of these tracks over here this album's core songs are great and I am surely going to be remembering this project come the end of the year next one on this list is my favorite metal record of the year so far I don't see it being surpassed because it's pretty freaking horrifying and just so well performed so well put together so amazingly produced so heavy so I guess what I wanted say is the sounds are so just tangible I just want to grab them but yet I don't want to grab them because they're really scary the new Leviathan records scar sighted fantastic mix of black metal death metal just an amazing production on this album and great vocal performances on this record - the vocal performance is going from one track to another there is quite a bit of variation on here so you're not always getting the same kind of vocal sound on these tracks and some tracks are a little bit more complex than others others are just really straightforward and hard-hitting it's a nice well put together black metal record very heavy very powerful definitely give this thing a listen if you're into metal and for some reason to slip by you I also want to give a she's a shout out for my next favorite metal record of the year in the new high on fire album luminiferous high on fire pulled together some sludge metal some thrash metal on this record with their typically heavy heavy production thunderous riffs and this album is easily one of the catchiest they've come out with in a while - because there's some great melodies not only coming through on the guitars here but a little bit and Matt Pike's vocals especially on these weird slower tracks that are kind of an emic something that you wouldn't typically expect high on fire to do but it goes over so well so definitely want to give a shout out to high on fire on here for coming out with a great record another great record and then discography another favor of the years the new ash Cuccia record good this is an LP that was recently sort of I don't want to say release but I guess reissued through old English spelling bee records you can listen to it over on their Bandcamp and it's an interesting mix of like I guess the complexity of like classical music but kind of the just fun groovy and very textured ear candy vibe that you get from like beat music such as Flying Lotus but there's a bit of an eidm vibe going on here kind of a glitch thing as well there's just a weird genre defying characteristic to this album that I find very intriguing and and really made it a fun listen innocent earnest had this one in my list but I forgot to say when I was shooting the video Joey badass before the money oh my god pretty great uh you know East Coast hip-hop album some good boom-bap revivalism with some catchy songs you know shout out to Joey badass man you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know definitely want to give a shout out to the new little ugly Mane compilation third side of tape loved that recently although you know it just kind of seems like a you know more of a compilation that it does a new record and yeah you know of course shout out to everything else that I loved and gave a very positive review to this year not that any of that wasn't good but you know this to me is definitely the releases that I am most excited about at the halfway point of this year you know definitely take the time to move back through my loved list for the year which I will link you guys to down in the description as well and check out any of those albums that I you know sort of didn't mention in this video and that's it transition have you given any of these albums a listen if you haven't I mean please please listen to them they're my favorite albums of the year sweaty sweaty sweaty no hear you're the best 
Jx1MaLRuVPo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new king louis album god money war king louis is a baltimore rapper this is his commercial full-length debut although for years he has built up to this point with a gauntlet of mixtapes he's actually been putting in work for years now and he actually had a few recent appearances on the new french montana record the new kid ink record maybe i would have paid more close attention to his features have actually liked those artists but given the company he's kept on his recent features it's pretty surprising to sort of see the angle that he's taking on this new album over here god money war for the most part tries to be a pretty thoughtful and reflective hip-hop record and i definitely welcome that kind of angle from a hip hop record especially on an album like this whereas he is tackling topics such as god and violence and money king louis comes through with some pretty decent conceptual tracks tracks like little black boy which is a moving and incredible tribute to his son it's on this track king louis delivers some of the best lyrics on the entire record then there's also the track ghetto boy where obviously king louis lyrically delivers to us some very gritty imagery from where he was raised and on this track Llosa's delivery is just shouted it's screamed at the top of his lungs it's a kind of blood curdling at some points and the track black blood grabbed my attention too not only because of its kind of morbid refrain talking about how black blood helps the grass and the ghetto grow but it's a bit of a statement on gang violence as well although I wish the instrumental on this track hit as hard as the lyrics actually do there's some very lazy breezy singing on this track so I'm kind of in one ear and out the other piano phrasing it's a bit of a poppy instrumental and also I kind of think a very obvious statement on forgiveness kind of being able to break this cycle of violence is a connection that could have been made especially given King his tendency to kind of where God and his religion on his sleeve and while there are some tracks on here that do have some religious talk paying a bit of a I guess religious lip service notably the song with our Kelly in the tracklisting here also this record loses its halo pretty fast in the second half like on the song blame it on the money where we get some quirky synth bleeps and the instrumental here a banger club beat and some vocal phrasing just a flow that reminds me a lot of tipsy that was that was a throwback and I don't really mind it it's a pretty fun track maybe not as catchy but I love the beat and I like the flow on it it just doesn't really fit into the attitude set by the first half of this record especially with the very lyrical and very tender intro track even though this record does have a semblance of flow to it where you know we are getting songs of a certain flavor in the first half and songs of a certain flavor in the second half it still doesn't keep this song from sticking out like a sore thumb and just kind of feel like King Louis was following some kind of quota where he had to have some kind of track that had club appeal and there are other cuts on here where I kind of feel like king lows even though there are a handful of songs on here that do feel like they have a strong personality he quickly starts biting the styles of other contemporary artists there is an ethereal trap ballad on the song to be honest with a bit of R&B vocals on the more conscious songs in the tracklisting here there are some clear flow ideas and just vocal inflections that he's borrowing from Lupe Fiasco from Kendrick Lamar's good kid maad city and even on the eighth track here I believe the song can't fade us King Louis does his best childish gambino impression even with the track slave I mean not only does this track miss an opportunity to make a really bold and upfront statement about being sort of a slave to the industry or just to something but also when he's not sort of double-timing like a fucking badass in the second half of this track King Llosa's inflections remind me a lot of like some old little Wayne this record was okay I mean it had some really great vicious moments in the first half that I thought were great even if a little obviously influenced but then I think the record really kind of lost its focus and its direction and its message around the middle while I think King Louis has flow and he has lyrics and he has some great topical tracks here he hasn't pulled together a project that has a strong sense of direction nor does his personality come through that strongly on every single track here because there are a number of cuts in the track listing where I kind of feel his influences more than I do him and I just kind of lose sight of who he is or what he's trying to tell me or what exactly his sound is supposed to be this was an okay project it's definitely not terrible by any means I see the hype behind I see the appeal behind it but I think Louis has a lot of growth ahead of him if he's going to be blowing me away on his next project I'm feeling a light two DS and six on this thing transition having given this project to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony van tan Oh King lows forever 
OZEDRusC7Cw,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new days of Paris Eidos record Paola desaparecido s' Nebraska band back at it again with a new record after over just a decade of studio albums silence now going into this LP potentially you are already familiar with the band's frontman Conor Oberst aka the bright eyes guy and I guess lately he's been giving the whole brighteyes thing a bit of a rest concentrating on coming together with some singles four days of heresy dose he had a solo album under his own name last year and some of those dayss singles he was dropping back in 2012 a pretty grace so I was pretty psyched and really just kind of sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for him to actually get around to putting together a full-length record for this project and you know here we are now it's like been over ten years since the last full length LP so of course the new album isn't gonna have like the same sound and the same vibe like just just too much time has passed but this group is still making loud visceral in-your-face rock music topped with just impassioned shouted vocals i wouldn't call the music purely punk but it's punk ish and on the debut record you've got your occasional socially aware or politically charged lyric but politics and just the world at large really seems to be the major theme at play from beginning to end with paola pretty much every track on this LP has a point of view to get across or like an angle or an agenda to push but I wouldn't say these lyrics like make me wince or turn around on the other direction or anything like that because a lot of the time I do end up agreeing with what this album philosophically is trying to say or state mostly I like the performances on this record there are some explosive choruses here some really just over-the-top vocal performances some really great drum fills and bright burning loud guitar leads so it's not like the music on this record is necessarily bad or overshadowed by the messages going on in the lyrics this is obviously not the first Road for frontman Conor Oberst so he's used to sort of playing that balancing act between message and music and I suspected going into this new LP he would succeed that once again because of just how well he's done it in the past but even though my fears of the music sort of being overshadowed by just very preachy lyrics weren't confirmed what did kind of end up happening is that I just don't really feel like the lyrics came out that great often they kind of succumbed to the very narrow-minded left-right debate of u.s. politics also I think the album's sound doesn't necessarily lend itself to the rowdiness and the rebellious Ness that it tries to portray its shots at the status quo whether it be racists or the 1% or capitalism a lot of what this album sings about and says just kind of reads like MSNBC the album but to go back to what I was saying about the sound I feel like this albums really aggressive attempts are often kind of usurped by the fact that the production is so cleanly put together there's also a lot of compression thrown onto these drums and guitars just making the music feel louder than I think it really is I mean it all just really leaves the music here feeling anything but raw I wind the Selphy sort of hoping it would be more blood pumping which I think it should have been given the blood-curdling screams at the end of a track like Ralphie's cut and even when the record actually serves up a kind of novel message or point of view on the song slacktivism pletely necessary song in the internet age of activism we have Conor Oberst delivering against these lyrics one of the worst instrumentals on the entire record where the guitars the very lazy group vocals and the keyboards just all kind of smudge together in this really unpleasurable way plus not all the instrumentation here feels like it's completely syncing up in the way it should or the tracks search the search is another moment on this LP where I'm getting some of my favorite lyrics this track is a really funny and clever approach to just writing a song about just spying and just an invasion of privacy but this tracks aggressive guitars and drums are matched with like these really sugary sweet lead melodies that just really throw the vibe of the track off they're just a lot of spots here where the sound just does not completely just match up with the aggression of the lyrics and again the rebellious tone of this album like on the song von Maur Massacre where I kind of feel like we're getting some really bratty arena rock and hard rock and again the compression the flattening compression the oppressive compression on this record kind of comes around to bite the sound of this album in the ass once again as it leaves this song and many others on here just feeling like they have no dynamics or body or flavor whatsoever which is kind of disheartening because a guy like Conor Oberst is usually about finesse and subtlety and dynamics and his songs but he's obviously taking a vacation with that on this new record over here finally the record closes off with a track called Anonymous which when I saw the title I was afraid it might actually be about you know the internet-based group Anonymous and it in fact is and yeah I mean it's it's probably the most lyrically shameful moment on the entire record personally I don't really have anything against the 4chan born activist slash activist group but I feel like this is kind of an example of Oberst and and company on this record just being so desperate to embrace or just acknowledge any kind of counterculture that there is to acknowledge on this record or to sort of hear Conor Oberst singing and chanting the anonymous code as if like he's representing them in some kind of way was just a really cringe-worthy moment on this record if there's anything definitively I could say about anonymous is that they would hate this song now as I said earlier tracks like Maricopa and and back sell there are some great tracks in the track listing here that sort of overcome the the lackluster production I think the track Tiamo Camilo Vallejo is fantastic as well but again I feel like we're just kind of getting an instance of a track overcoming just all the stuff that is just bogging this album down in terms of its enjoyability just a really flat production the lack of actually refreshing political and social perspectives in the tracklisting here on a record that is just trying to be so political and so socially aware on every single track I just wish this album had something just a little bit more out of the box to say and that the guitars and the instrumentation sounded a little bit more organic I think you know these small changes would have made a world of difference in terms of this records enjoyability but as a result of the current state of these things this album just really ended up being a bit of a trudge for me I'm feeling a light a decent 5 on this thing transition if you've given this project to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantana little ugly Mane Trevor are 
mNCB3vj-pfk,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd wanted to do a quick video here sort of continuing the discussion that we've been having on this channel about music streaming all these new music streaming platforms what artists are are doing in the music streaming world as far as like making money and their reactions to it and then and all that stuff I wanted to sort of throw a platform into the ring that isn't often talked about in the music streaming realm although there have been some people who have emailed me angrily asking me why I haven't brought this platform up in the midst of these conversations and you know I understand why a lot of people use the platform it's popular platform I like the platform I actually buy multiple albums off of this platform every year and that platform is Bandcamp which if you haven't heard of it is this website where artists can independently just take the music that they produce themselves and put it up onto the website doesn't matter what the genre it is you can sort of tag it how you like and people can stream it and buy it for whatever price you set for it they can buy digital copies from you physical copies other merchandise as well of course VanCamp takes a cut and reasonably so they kind of limit the amount of free downloads that you can have as the person who runs the band camp you have to sort of purchase downloads for your customers to buy if they are free downloads because you know we're sort of talking about bandwidth being taken up here and you know say what you will about it but I personally like the Bandcamp platform not only do I as a fan find it really easy to use and I'm sort of notified of whenever a label or an artist that I follow comes out with a new record which i think is fantastic that's really great for me but simultaneously my cursory knowledge and experience with the platform because I have sold I guess audio on the platform before I sold audio of a bit of fanfiction that I put up on there like late last year early this year can't exactly remember I'll link you guys down in the description if you want but my experience with Bandcamp thus far via you know sort of this very small experience has been really positive but I mean you know sort of a my positive experience sort of I guess selling something on the platform isn't necessarily why I think it's a great platform I just think in general it's fantastic to have places on the internet that almost anybody can access and sort of just put their art up there I mean in a sense yeah it can be a bit of a headache because that means anybody you can put up any crap that they want even if their music isn't really that great but it allows us to kind of create and sort of democratize the creative process us as music fans it allows us the ability to kind of decide to us what is worthy of making and releasing and what music scenes are actually worthwhile and actually worth continuing and keeping alive despite very little in the way of you know any kind of notable label support there are things like vaporwave for example that are still ongoing in the band camp community there are tons of vaporwave releases coming out every year despite the fact that people were claiming that vaporwave was dead and has been dead for at least a few years and there are tons of different genres of music on this platform but that's not what I think isn't necessarily great about it not just the fact that you can find all sorts of different genres of music from independent artists on this platform it's also that you know band camp gives people kind of a stomping ground and not just band camp but other websites where people who kind of just you know upload the art they want to make SoundCloud is another platform like that that I use quite often although you don't just buy music directly from the artist on there from what I understand they're going to start sort of doing an ad service where after streaming a certain amount of things you know you're planning a commercial played for you maybe I think I would have enjoyed SoundCloud going more the band camp route that you can just buy the music directly from the artist but you know I guess sort of running ads and maybe doing a subscription kind of thing is the way that they want to make money into the future whatever I'm sure there are people have negative opinions about band camp and I have no doubt that they will show up in the comments section which is fine you know I I don't think band camp is without its flaws I guess what I'm trying to say is that I just like the idea that we have platforms like band camp which in a sense are streaming services or people can go and just kind of peruse different albums and different types of music and the artists are just sort of putting it up themselves and even if you know they don't end up making a lot of money off of some record that they threw out there you know not really assuming they would make a lot of money I guess I'm trying to say is it's just great that we have a place where you know it's it's kind of like a bit of a musical community board where you know people can just kind of just share ideas without really having to worry about oh you know is is this going to mark it well it's good to have a bit of a testing ground in places like I said Bandcamp SoundCloud and YouTube as well serve as that and it's through these platforms that we are going to have people sort of decide for themselves which albums which trends which sounds which micros honors are actually entertaining and actually worthwhile so again while band camp isn't necessarily going to be mentioned in the same breath of these larger streaming services I do think that democratized platforms like this are actually you know a really pivotal part of the way that we sort of consume music in the modern age because the fact that you can sort of upload your own music or you know sort of hear the upload of music of some obscure band or artists their DJ or whatever and that person's music is just amazing to you just really blows your mind becomes your you know your Velvet Underground or whatever you want to call it the fact that that can happen in today's day and age is an amazing part of why the Internet is a great place to check out music so yeah while not you know a streaming service that you're going to have the new tyga album streaming exclusively on you're going to have tons of exclusive streams of lots of smaller more obscure and you know even more talented artists so there you go I think these democratize music streaming platforms are an essential part of the Internet today as far as music consumption I would hate to continue listening the music on the internet if platforms like this were to complete we disappear because I mean part of the appeal of listening to music on the Internet is these platforms where you can you know really stumble upon almost anything and yeah that's it just wanted to get that out there and just continue this conversation that we've been having about music streaming let me know what you think about Bandcamp and platforms like this do you think there is essential as I do and what do you think is going to be the future of platforms like this do they have a future yeah that's it you're the best transition uh yeah I mean what do you think of band camp what do you think of SoundCloud what do you think of these websites where people can essentially upload their own auditory art for the world to listen to you know are they a net positive net negative on the music market do they help artists hurt artists do they drive down the price of music do they allow musical creators to have more content roll over their content what do you think let me know Anthony Fantana Bandcamp forever 
eF0CZ1ldn0Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new citizen album everybody is going to heaven which is not just great news but also the sophomore full-length LP from this Toledo Ohio BAM Cal's gonna get to see the Lord praise Jesus it had been at least a few years since I had flirted with the idea of the existence of a god but counter chesta kind of has that funny way of making you rethink whether or not you know the world and if there was a loving the Nevel and God responsible for the universe and all of its beings how could this god responsible for this and could this God be reasoned with I had to find out God if you're listening please kill him hi everyone um yeah we already said hello as I just said this is citizen's sophomore full-length LP hadn't really heard too much of them before the release of this album but this record doesn't really make me too excited to go back I don't know man just gave this record to listen all I really sort of found on it was some grossly nondescript 90s rock revivalism for pretty much one track after another the band delivers these really faint references toward grunge and alternative rock nothing so direct that you could just kind of you know alike in them to one single huge band from the 90s but I think that's mostly because the group's abilities sort of limit them on this record from you know sort of making something as impressive as like a Nirvana or in Alice in Chains or something like that I mean we're not even really talking about Candlebox levels of songwriting ability on this record often on this LP I find the kind of just very drab toothless songwriting that I had already heard not too long ago on the new title fight record and I get that these sounds are Aging in their reaching classic level and therefore they're going to be bands that kind of want to relive them and there are going to be audiences that will line up to eat that up but there's really no reason for kind of bringing those sounds back with such uninteresting songwriting and vocals that are seriously deprived of anything that could be construed as personality there are just dime a dozen vocal performances and guitar tones all over this thing even though I feel that there are most definitely some attempts here at making some kind of emotional appeal sort of like on the song 10 where we're getting these vocals that are so subdued are they trying to be tortured they're super quiet and like mumbled we also get some other subdued vocals on the track weave me into your sin or actually get a bit of a sinister vibe from this track but it actually does not go over very well I think in terms of sinister Ness this song is super flaccid or maybe these vocals are supposed to be overcome by sadness or depression I really have no idea all I really know about these vocals is that they're so quiet I just don't even care about them or care to listen to them or that they just really don't communicate anything to me they just kind of feel like a bit of filler like vocals are there just because we had to have them and not that the instrumental would stand on its own without the vocals because for the most part we're just kind of getting these bland guitar arpeggios combined with just like finger noise sliding up and down the neck emphasized by what sounds like some kind of digital delay this records first legitimately exciting moment comes on the seventh track where some screams and some eerie guitar leads just explode out of the verses of this song and while the track does kind of glide into some vocal harmonies that are sort of forgettable sort of mundane kind of feels like something that would have come out of the post grunge era still though at least this track kind of kicks this album out of its previously mundane state and there are a few other cuts in the track listing here like the opener that kind of gives the tracklisting an uptick something a little more hard-hitting but a lot of the time these harder tracks will switch off into other track that feature this kind of flavorless gloom that is so lacking in characteristics I can't even begin to describe these songs to you tracks like yellow love and Heaviside its tracks like these that make me kind of wonder was the objective of this record to make as little and as unmemorable a statement as possible and even on tracks like the song cement the opener that I mentioned where I feel like they're trying to do something heavy or something a little bit more engaging where they have just just thicker guitars where they have just noisy guitar leads sort of thrown into the mix to kind of added a bit of extra bite things are still kind of mild and middle-of-the-road just really not that in the red I just was not feeling this record it's so devoid of any kind of excitement that I would look for in a rock record typically or any kind of big show of emotion especially for music that is sort of running this soft slow and and sad I'm just really at like a loss for nice things to say about this album that's that's really the way I could put it I am at a loss for nice things to say about this record I can't really say it's the worst worst worst thing in the world but yet when I try to think of the positives of this album it can play in the background things are certainly mixed ok you know and sounds like the band practiced really stretching here I'm feeling decent too strong three on this thing transition if you've given this record of listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino citizen forever 
94U3CZxIsyA,hi there everyone Indian tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Tsar face record every hero needs a villain every hero needs a villain is a collaborative hip-hop project featuring producer 7l MC esoteric and wu-tang wu-tang legend Inspectah deck 7l and esoteric have been making music together for years so seeing these two guys team up on a record isn't too weird but a few years ago when the Tzar face project was originally announced and it was said that they would be coming together with inspected deck on a full-length album it turned some heads and the debut full-length LP out of this project was okay it wasn't amazing but I feel like the opinion of most people when it comes to 7l and esoteric and inspected deck isn't really you know that high to begin with not that they're terrible but I feel like in most people's books they're usually not really rated as like top-tier rappers none of those definitely underrated rappers so I kind of feel like this debut LP it not blowing a lot of people away wasn't necessarily expected but it was kind of accepted but it just seemed like there was so much more potential in this project than was actually capitalized on not just because of the talent level and the experience of the respective artists involved but also because of the kind of cartoony comic-book themed vocal cuts and imagery and album art that was kind of paired with this thing it's all a little MF DOOM ish who is actually a featured guest on this new record over here in the lyrics on this thing in the previous record - there's also talk of wrestling lasers the kind of cartoony cut through violence that is typical of a wu-tang affiliated project and on the debuts our face record all of this was kind of set to a series of boom-bap style instrumentals that were a little dated kind of sounded like somebody from the mid or early 2000's trying to impersonate boom-bap style hip-hop rather than you know like a true blue genuine reinterpretation however I feel like that's what we're actually getting on this new project over here 7l brings the grime he brings the bass there are some fantastic samples worked into these max as well some great grooves some great drum breaks a lot of color a lot of personality a lot of eccentricity in the instrumentals on this record finally I feel like the sound of czar face matches the colorful comic book themed art that comes with this record and that this album is supposed to be kind of setting the soundtrack to this record is mean it's tough as nails but the sound of it there's also an element of like playfulness to it and there's actually a pretty awesome feature list on this thing - I already mentioned MF DOOM we have GZA Method Man large professor among others on here including mayhem lauren and there are actually some risky spots in the track listing here like the eight-minute escape from tsar CIM asylum which is actually really fantastic justifies its very long length thanks to the multiple kind of beat change ups that the song kind of moves through over the course of its length if I could sum this record up in any way it's kind of like this direct fusion of MF DOOM and wu-tang isms together complemented by these really great rap flows and raw ass rhymes and the flows and the deliveries are so energetic there's so much I guess I would say enthusiasm on this record which is a great change of pace because there are a lot of moments on the last our face album where esoteric and Inspectah deck didn't really sound that amped to be making this album and I'm not really sure what about it made it that way but I would say it's it's like a night and day difference on this project over here because like the chemistry is is through the roof especially on the track lumberjack match which is one of the earlier songs in the track listing here we get relentless flows and verses just throughout the song and deck and esoteric transition into some really catchy flows on the very next track over here with this booming jump the up Basie beat that complements Method Man style very well when he pops onto the track there are even moments on here like on the song the great where we get some pretty funny hooks like I'm straight y'all got it twisted I'm great y'all not as gifted this album has a serious sense of humor sometimes - and again I have to emphasize good hooks on this thing even though some of them may be kind of simple I love the sort of eerie subtle tone down approach to the chorus on the song Red Alert red alert Oh Red Alert red alert a song whose instrumental also features one of the sickest grooves on the entire project and as far as what this album is doing in terms of lyricism I mean this album meets the standard that you would typically expect from a guy who was cut from inspected decks cloth and and inspected deck while he does have some of the best verses on wu-tang's projects he's a guy whose talents I don't think have always been showcased that well when it's come to solo efforts but it's on this record over here that I feel like you know after years of just one underappreciated solo record after another he comes through with just a really fire collaborative project him and 7l and esoteric really lit this thing up and the features list isn't only just impressive in name but pretty much every single person here comes through with a great verse and a lot of enthusiasm there's a lot of passion in the guest verses on this project I mean GZA for one his verse is killer and he sounded just almost nearly asleep on the last we album even doom doesn't slouch and you know some of his stuff has been bordering on lazy a little bit lately but easily toward the end of this album re the rugged man had moved what one of my favourite and and I think most hilarious verses on the entire project I mean just his flow is over-the-top vulgarity just totally matched the character of this album he was entertaining and it was it was kind of like you know the big firework explosion to end this album off in terms of features anyway I think my only main complaint about this project is that there are a few tracks on here that are a little short a little short of breath could have slipped easily into the last record you know didn't really feel like ZAR face it had kind of improved on all fronts like they did on most of the songs here it's just a handful of tracks that are kind of like paling in comparison to others really not really anything that's kind of Dee railing the quality of the track listing here for the most part the songs that aren't as great just kind of breezed by and and those moments are really kind of few and far between as I said there's a lot of passion in this project a lot of grit a lot of personality and I think a lot of skill and it's just an added bonus that it's very colorfully and fantastically produced I'm feeling a decent eight on this thing Tran ten have you given this a project to listen if you have what you think of it you'll love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it that's it guys Anthony Fantana czar face forever 
q0Flm7jwj0A,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here in turn as busy as musing and it's time for a review of the new Vince staples record summertime oh six this is the full-length commercial debut of West Coast rapper Vince staples and it has been in a long time coming building up to this thing with a series of mixtapes singles a not too long ago released EP that I thought was pretty good and pretty much all these releases featured a very low-key style of rap music with very subdued beats but the rhymes were super dark super gritty a lot of the times violent and Vince staples had an inflection in a flow style that was very reminiscent of guys like Snoop Dogg but I wouldn't say a party vibe really comes through in his music quite as much a really a pop sensibility Vince instead of being a pop rapper I think he embraces a similar minimalism and eeriness that you might catch on an earl sweatshirt record and you may in fact have heard of Vince from Earle sweatshirts records and now it seems that Vince is trying to stand on his own with this full-length debut just in time for odd futures breakup not too long ago and while I do think Vince is a talented rapper I've never really felt an immense amount of ambition coming through on his previous projects and maybe not on this newest project either though in a way I do think summertime oh six was a pretty huge undertaking for Vince we have two discs of material on this thing numerous beats from Kanye mentor and producer no ID as well as guys like uh DJ dahi Billy Kidd and clams Casino coming out of the woodwork for the track listing here so with the two discs of material on this thing even though each disc is about thirty minutes each and the producers listed on this thing as well as some of the features to it seemed like Vince was going to go big on summertime oh six but I think what kind of ends up biting Vince on this record is sort of the same thing that for me bit him on his previous full-length mixtapes it's that he just doesn't really have that much versatility or oomph to carry an entire project on his own and just sort of keep things interesting and not that there's nothing interesting if out this project I mean the instrumentals are fantastic trunk knocking bass on this thing occasionally it's very noisy and brittle and sharp snares are just kind of noisy a percussion that sucks up the treble in the mix catchy melodies awesome keyboard phrases the beats on summertime oh six are really smooth and low-key but yet they have this heaviness and this really unique kind of color or groove or personality to them that despite the fact that they're quiet they stay at the forefront of my head they are really what I end up focusing on because of how great the production on this record is occasionally these insane vocal harmonies pop up that a lot of you will probably you know sort of catch instantaneous and be like I love it reminds me of Kanye and even though Vince invites other producers onto this project other than no ID each producer here brings a similar vibe to these instrumentals so sonically summertime oh six is a really cohesive project I would actually argue this will be one of the better produced projects you've heard this year and Vince while he can rap and his urban backstory gives him plenty to rap about and he's also capable of these incredibly tender and poetic moments as well like with the closing track on here where he's kind of talking about his mentality his future his mother but then again with some of these courses and some of these refrains the lyrics Vince wrote feel utterly effortless like on lift me up or get paid Vince has flow he has lyrics he has a back story but I don't really think he has that strong of a voice he doesn't have a voice that when I hear it on the mic I just gravitate toward it instantly at least not over the course of a full-length project unfortunately he is the person on this record who is constantly just falling into the background for me especially when he starts whipping out some redundant lyrics or when he's on top of an incredibly loud or really catchy beat in the track listing here like on the song loca or the song birds and bees or the song dope man even on the track let me know with DJ dahi on the hook here as well as Jenaya eco singing sort of rap singing in tandem with Vince it feels like Vince is kind of playing second fiddle on his own track because his voice is the least ear catching on the entire cut though the abrupt end of this track does make me kind of feel like some of this record was a little under written there are some pretty short cuts in the track listing here given that we do have two discs of material ten songs on each disc and each disc is like 30 minutes there going to be some short songs in that track listing but to kind of bring it back to these somewhat weak hooks I was pointing out before I get that Vince is trying to be really direct and sometimes that directness that straightforwardness translates into a hook that is actually catchy like on jump off the roof or north north where we get this bass heavy beat with these howling synthesizers that are actually kind of creepy and the very spacious low-key instrumental here actually complements Vince's really relentless flow very well one of the handful of moments on this record where Vince grabs my attention at the start of the track and has it at the end of the track so even though there is a strong ending at the end of this song the end of this first disc does not have a strong ending with the tracks summertime I believe where Vince is engaging in some really lazy singing which just makes me tune out instantaneously this could and I wouldn't necessarily say that the quality of this project picks up on the second disc either whether it's the subdued vocals on remote a park legend part two or Vince kind of being overpowered by the instrumental on 30 to 30 or the key Lokesh song surf where I just still do not care for her vocals there are so many fleeting tracks in the track listing here tracks that really just kind of feel like detours or just a bit of filler just like it wasn't fleshed out entirely into a fantastic concise song from beginning to end even the song might be wrong just kind of feels like another distraction even though I love how this track is really melodic features some great guest singing on here and I like the social sentiment and message behind the song and I guess Vince staples has a writing credit on this track when I look at the writing credits for this record on the Internet but still Vince doesn't really sort of seem featured on this tract it just kind of feels like another moment where I am distracted away from the guy whose name is on this album which is a bit of a shame because given Vince's last EP I thought he was headed in a direction where just punch here catchy er more direct and more concisely written songs were sort of in Vince's future but now I feel like I'm just getting underwhelming vocals I'm getting some great instrumentals some decent features as well I mean everything that I like about this record doesn't really seem to directly have to do with Vince it's only a handful of moments that I feel like yeah okay I'm excited to hear Vince staples right now I'm listening to a Vince staples record not just like a you know a record where what I'm really attracted to is no IDs production and every once in a while Vince is kind of grabbing my attention I'm like oh yeah yeah that's that's pretty good I thought this project was decent wasn't the worst thing in the world there's only a few tracks on here that I would call bad in any sort of way for the most part the songs on this track listing were likable were easy to listen to and again the instrumentals on here are fantastic I mean no ID really outdid himself and I guess I appreciate how he is kind of endorsing Vince staples on this record because it's been a while I think since he's lent this much production to one single artists album I mean you know even though this project doesn't even really span an hour no ID did you know sort of give a lot of beats to this project we are talking about two discs worth of beats here I felt like this project could have been so much better if the best songs here were just kind of lengthened and added to and just made to be more I guess hard-hitting just leave more of an impression and those cuts that were just more forgettable or where Vince wasn't really truly feeling inspiration just kind of cut them from the list just put them on a bonus disc or like just make them bonus tracks I mean there's a lot of things about this record that I think could have potentially made it more entertaining again I don't think it's the worst thing in the world but I think Vince really could have come harder with the songwriting and you know sort of the hook end of things especially since there were some fantastic and catchy tracks on his last EP I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing Tran you 
N4N5E0yp2EA,hi everyone free theny hugs tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new little ugly main album slash compilation third side of tape lil ugly Mane a Virginia rapper and producer aka Travis Miller who came to widespread Internet attention at about 2012 with the release of the album mr. thug isolation a record or mixtape that kind of got caught up in the buzz that was very strong at the time for cloud wrap and sort of southern hip hop and while Miller's music on this record definitely fit into those trends simultaneously he had a really strange and sort of warped approach to them there was a uniqueness to this record that drew a lot of people to it and some good songwriting and rapping as well but me personally listening to this album I just got this sense of aloofness from it sort of like Travis was just kind of messing around and what he was messing around with just happened to actually be good and not just good but in a way sort of necessary for underground hip-hop at the time and I don't mean to say that Travis isn't talented on this record Edgard what I'm trying to say is that Travis seems like an artist who is more focused on the process of creation than he is any sort of larger ambition for his music into the future sort of its presentation or even just like you know making a career off of his music it seems like at every turn Travis has kind of turned his back on an opportunity to step in the limelight for any extended period of time and this is shown in the lack of interviews he's done his numerous musical projects that dive into other genres he's super prolific hard to kind of keep track of every single release for people who are kind of just getting into him and as I alluded to earlier he quit little ugly Mane pretty much right after the release or not the release but the buzz of mr. thug isolation and ever since Travis has kind of become this elusive musical figure who only kind of communicates with people through his Facebook for the most part and he really means it when he says he rejects the whole internet hype cycle yet mr. Miller here has had an incredibly incredibly active quitting because he has come out with so much music since little ugly means sort of disbanded I mean he even has a box a vinyl box set on the way for this project maybe other projects that he's worked on as well however a lot of these projects that Travis has released aren't just rap music and he swears that pretty much all of it is older material although he has released tracks and verses since he has quit sort of making reference to the fact that he is quitting or just not interested in popularity through the little ugly main name and these compilation projects Travis has put out since he quit little ugly Mane have been these long obtuse just genre hopping collections of moments kind of just fused together into one just overly long track and this right here is essentially the third volume of these two previously released strange compilations and I believe it's his longest compilation yet the majority of this LP or compilation is held within these six monstrous tracks that number up to about 20 minutes each which leads to a project that is just about over two hours long so not really inviting not really an easily digestible project at least looking at it from the outside but once I actually started listening to this thing I actually found this project to be a little bit more determined and purposeful than little ugly main stuff that he was dropping when the project was active to do on this project little ugly Maine does more genre hopping than ever you get filthy twisted hip hop instrumentals in the tracklisting here drones ambient songs electronic music house and techno but kind of just a strange vibe plunder phonics darkwave so a little shoegaze and lo-fi rocks and punk rocks and black metal local yeah on part two side two there is black metal which develops into this kind of hyper rigid electronic Odyssey directly after even though this does I mean it has to be a compilation it has to be a compilation it has to be but still it feels like the way these songs were put together was really purposeful really intentional it flows together really well despite the fact that these genres don't typically pop onto one record but really what holds it all together is just the strange grimy production but there is a lot of talent and finesse to the way that Travis produces on this record don't think that just because some of these songs are lo-fi that there aren't fantastic sounds and textures here there are and even though the track lengths on this project may be 18 or 25 minutes the track lengths don't really matter because you're kind of getting just bunches of little snippets and interludes over the course of these tracks all of which are pretty moderately sized there are a few monstrous length songs and in the track listing here in the midst of these longer tracks but for the most part I mean everything is pretty digestible and bite-sized if you just accept the fact that you're not getting a track listing and that it's all bunched together and that you can't skip to the next song in that sense it's it's kind of quite literally like listening to a cassette tape I think how much you enjoy this project is going to be heavily dependent on whether or not you sort of appreciate the genres that little ugly main is kind of dabbling in on this record although still I do have to kind of acknowledge that I think him bunching all of these genres together on this project continues the sort of anti accessibility narrative that he's got going so far with his music I mean he's just trying to weed out casual listeners just because a record with this variety and of this length doesn't exactly make a concise punchy review easy but still even though this thing was lengthy I found it really enjoyable I found an incredible amount of talent not only in writing but Travis's just production abilities here pretty much every rap instrumental on this record is fantastic it's textured it's like listening to dilla or mad lib like you know living underground in the Sioux were like a mutant just hiding away from the world and even the musical turns that are kind of unexpected on this record sound great as well there are synth interludes that take kind of a soundtrack horror synth direction there are noise rock riffs on this thing there's even an instrumental here that I think it'd pass for chill wave and the level of detail and texture on each rock instrumental on each rap instrumental on each electronic bit here is is great I don't think traps is just aping the sounds on these different musical styles with each musical style he approaches he captures the texture and he captures the grooves and he captures the emotional essence of these genres as well there are a few electronic interludes here in a dark wave track that are a little underwhelming as well as like an industrial drone death metal track on the intro to the a side of part 3 where we're kind of getting these screams over this instrumental as well sounds kind of hurry and ish it's kind of hard to get into given that it's so outside of what the rest of this project is doing but it lasts so long and it's so frightening and it's so strange that I can't help but get into it anyway again I just feel like the way that Travis assembled these tracks was just it just flowed really well despite the fact that it's just jumping from one idea to the next with just no predictability or warning as far as the rap cuts on here which I think that's what people are going to mostly be interested in again the instrumentals I said for the most part are amazing there are a few cuts on here where we're actually getting some rapping and those for the most part are amazing as well with the exception of the few tracks on here that feel very obviously like very old rap demos one track in particular that feels like a bit of amateurish clumsy jazz rap where we're getting this hook where the word legacy is being spelled out not to mention that this track clashes completely with the kind of upbeat poppy lo-fi goth rock that comes in directly after it I could try as hard as possible to go into each one of these individual tracks and talk to you about what makes it but I don't really think this project is about any one great moment or song even though there are a lot of great moments and songs on this thing I think this project is really about an amazing appreciation for songwriting different musical styles and aesthetics also what this album is about is just about diving into the musical mind of Travis Miller he is musically insane or maybe even schizophrenic in a way it's like he's got these different musical voices in his head and this project is him trying to talk or recreate or communicate those voices as well as he possibly can so yeah I mean that might rip through this thing was great uh this is definitely going to be you know a musical highlight for me toward the end of the year with it being so long and with there being so many moments obviously not every moment is as fantastic as the next and you know there isn't too much here that's reinventing the wheel or anything like that but man this thing has an incredible amount of skill and I've heard some people liking it's sort of a soundtracks for the blind and sort of say it's it's hip hop's answer to that and maybe while I think that that comparison is a little overblown I wouldn't say it's too far off you know and yeah I mean I'm really I could say anything else about this thing I think it's great I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this project transition if you get in this project listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana little ugly Mane Trevor ever are 
mpi2qC6htu8,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a bio update where I go through a series of new records that have made their way into my prestigious vine alkaloids it's really not that prestigious alright so let's just get into it you know we pretty much do these for the most part raw so you know I'm just gonna be talking off the dome about these records over here that I have and um let me let me orient myself here for one second okay there we go there we go that's what we want there first okay first um just want to give a quick shout out to the people of vinyl me please they handed me this Hot Chip record this is not their latest record the album that came out with before that in our heads gave it a pretty positive review over on the channel and they just this was their record of the month so you know and not only is this one of my favorite Hot Chip records but it comes in this beautiful double LP set of kind of this uh very pretty orange e yellow and a very nice lavender color right there so yeah really nice packaging good job on the packaging guys good job on the packaging very nice pretty little vinyl colors for this for this double LP package you know not too much else to say about it other than that you know comes with the usual extras that comes with a record from these guys you know like a 12-inch art print a little postcard from the band with a message about the record which is nice which is very nice and there you go sweet little Hot Chip double LP and our heads some synth pop some new wave there some indie tronic music you know if you're looking for some electronically flavored pop music uh look that record up and I also want to give a shout out to the people over at uh Old English spelling bee records they sent me a handful of records you know some of which I'm still kind of sifting through but among them was the James Ferraro album let me I don't want to screw up this title night dolls with Hair Spray this is a weird bit of like lo-fi rock a lot of is a lot of it is instrumental it's very smudgy very muddy but kind of in an interestingly in an interesting aesthetic kind of way I mean it sounds like it was done on a four track of the 70s or the 80s and it's kind of got this just weird 80s rock vibe and there's all these uh you know kind of logos all over the front and the back that kind of mock the MTV logo I mean it sounds like some you know like bad old 80's rock that you would like find on like a VHS tape that somebody was recording off of MTV because you know their favorite 80s rock video came on and they wanted to catch it it's it's a very interesting collection of tracks listen to the first side and it's quirky it's funny it's got a sense of humor and it also rocks and some parts of it are pretty catchy you know it's Ariel pink ish but a you know James Ferrara though is a totally different beast he is you know in a totally different league of weirdness and variety as well I mean he has you know a ton of different records that approach a myriad of different music styles so you know if you don't like this definitely try out some of his other stuff especially is more weird post modern releases that are the people in the vaporwave community seem to sort of be head over heels for alright going into a bit of country a bit of country with mr. David Allan Coe this is some outlaw country right here interesting album title here with sort of these arrows in-between the main words of the title Invictus means unconquered and while it does kind of have that kind of clean glitzy Nashville ish sound to it didn't really look to where it was recorded on though I'm sure it's listed in the the liner notes here you know though it does have that sound David Allan Coe being sort of the outlaw countryman that he was on this record he's got this kind of you know very sour surly personality and demeanor that comes through mostly in his lyrics and you know as far as the first half of this record goes you know some fantastic songs on here Rose knows what was a great ballad ain't it funny the way love can do it was really just like a bitter kind of anti love song if you ever think of me at all the chorus on that one was huge and Purple Heart the song Purple Heart I should get a Purple Heart for loving you was actually pretty hilarious as well but the cherry on top with this record is really this photo on the inside you have David Allan Coe here rhinestones on the suit rhinestones on the Hat surrounded by two lovely ladies one of whom has teeth that are very clearly discolored in this photograph and she is grabbing that David Allen cock right there so you know very very flattering photograph right there for the UH for the insert loving it loving it loving it so you know a classy funny little outlaw country record right here from David Allan Coe Invictus means on Concord don't think it's one of his more well-known records I would have to look into it but you know if if you're completely unfamiliar with him look into other songs like I believe the song has to have long hair redneck which is a really funny track you know David Allan Coe always been known for just his very gritty lyrics and uh you know really strong sense of humor you know and sense of irony that comes through in his songs so you know if you've always kind of been on the fence with country music or you've sort of been wondering you know sort of where to get into country music even though David a lot of his records have not been reprinted a lot of this stuff can be hard to you know come by definitely an artist to look into I'm sure you can find a lot of his stuff you know a streamable online alright we're going to get into a bit of New Wave here it's fitting that we talked about Hot Chip earlier because here here are a few bands that most definitely influenced then we have a 45 12 of 45 rpm 12-inch single of soft cells tainted love was this thing earlier today amazing 12-inch single this thing sounds fantastic on buying the vinyl and the the record here is in fantastic condition was really happy and not only do we get the lead single on here or the main single or one of the biggest singles from this the this this synth pop phenomenon that is soft sell but we get a bit of an extension of this track with the song where did our love go the song kind of you know I don't want to say fades but transitions into where did our love go and then we get memorabilia which is way post-punk e're on the b-side of this and then after that we get tainted dub which is a weird dub revision of the instrumental on tainted love can't really say it was a totally successful dub but it was you know on sire records just you know simple packaging can't really say it was a successful dub you know look into some King Tubby if you want some early scratch Perry if you want some fantastic dub I would I would say it was more of a dub experiment on the b-side of this but very interesting and entertaining a nonetheless and also I picked this up a used record shop in Boston when I was over there not too long ago and it was a little beat up but I hoped it played through and it ended up playing through really nicely no you know skipping or anything like that grabbed a copy of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the dark our tech art architecture and morality known about this bands big singles for a long time never really gotten to this album of theirs and man you know it's it's just one of those times when you grab a record that you've been meaning to pick up for a long time on Epic Records right here although I have a I have the sleeve here it goes with the humble it's it's just one of those instances where you actually end up picking up a record that even mean grab for a long time and then you give it a listen and then you're just like shit what the hell have I been missing this whole time what have I been missing well this is obviously what I've been missing but you know you're you're a little mad at yourself first I can because you're like goddammit should have heard this years ago should have owned this years ago and you know like again known the Bands singles known about this record and and you know was kind of holding off because I'm like you know I'll run across a vinyl copy I'll grab a vinyl copy when it when I see it and you know finally opportunity came a little beat up like I said but it played through beautifully and you know it was just like it was just an amazing moment I was just like god damn it mad at myself but simultaneously so happy I heard this you know if you're looking for some new wave if you're looking for some synth pop that is like some cream of the crop shit give this thing a listen again Orchestral Manoeuvres in the dark architecture and morality just to give you the title again this one not a hard record to come by but a record that when I saw it it was cheap it was used had to get it King Crimson in the Court of the Crimson King I reviewed this four classics week before I had the follow up to this record sittin in the vinyl collection and the record itself is in fantastic condition despite the age of the of the album itself and fantastic condition not a scratch on it not even dusty just cleaned it off a little bit and it sounds pristine it sounds amazing you know like I said not a hard record to come by not saying that owning this record is a feat or anything like that I'll you know it does smell like someone's basement a little bit though smells like a basement but the record itself is a fantastic condition but you know what I'm saying is my reasoning behind getting this record is that this is the medium this stuff was meant to be heard on this is like you know going out to see avatar in the theatres you know like this this is the format this was meant to be on and you know listening to it on this format I think lends a certain kind of magic you know they can't necessarily be explained you know at least not right now in the middle of a vinyl update so you know really happy I picked this up again great condition fantastic record you know must-own progressive rock album and you know the inside looks amazing as well you know no complaints just you know of it so there you go moving along some more progressive rock here but prog rock of the synth rock variety we have some tangerine dream I reviewed these guys in a classic review as well though a previous album I sort of mentioned this record as one of their later records that incorporated more rock elements records like this huge influence on bands like zombie so if you know you're looking for some pulsating drums and and sequences some pretty great bass lines as well look into this record this is actually an Italian pressing of this tangerine Dream album force majeure which you know doesn't really mean anything other than that some of the labeling is in Italian the record itself is still in fantastic condition placed through well sounds amazing again some progressive rock some synth flavoured some synth heavy some synth centric progressive rock right here with tangerine dream force majeure the classic 70s pop right here Fleetwood Mac picked this up for seven bucks you know III I love a lot of people sing vinyls praises for the fact that oh you know you get the big album art and so on and so forth and the sound and all that but I love the fact that I get some great music for cheap seven bucks here man seven bucks fantastic condition and yeah you know it's it's a popular record it's probably not that hard to come by there may in fact be a copy of this in decent condition sitting in your local record shop right now and you know if you're in the mood for some fantastic pop a Fleetwood Mac rumors you know I have this and self-titled I have tusk you know sort of the that trio fantastic records that these guys dropped around this point-in-time right there you know they have other amazing albums as well but you know these are kind of the you know it's a few of the Fleetwood Mac essentials so right here Fleetwood Mac rumors getting funny today there's a lot of pollen outside gross Anthony gross picked up this swans birding world I believe yep the burning world by swans not one of their more celebrated records and I believe that there's even material from this album on a compilation that you could find on Michael Gira's labels website where he puts out you know and reissues a lot of swans material and and I believe in the synopsis for the the record that that is the compilation for the stuff that they were coming out with in this era jira himself kind of says that he's pretty indifferent toward a lot of the stuff that swans was dropping around this time and giving you know the first side of this record of listened sort of have a lyric sheet which this is pretty interesting because jira on this record I could tell he's definitely a little bit more trying to be a little bit more poetic here and a little bit more wordy than he typically is on swans music so so this was a pretty interesting read the record itself is in a pretty great you know condition you know maybe it wasn't played that often but sort of a you know reading into Michael Gira's feelings on this record I could sort of understand why you know he's not a big fan of it in in in retrospect some parts of it kind of reminds me of like I was listening to like a gothic magnetic fields or something and and there were some funky er just kind of more acoustic moments that I don't think went over completely well and we're just maybe a little bit of underwhelming plus on top of that I think Michael jiriz vocals aren't you know the most captivating here as they've been on previous and future efforts as well but simultaneously while you know I sort of understand why this record might not be sort of seen as one of swans bests in in in retrospect having a really hard time getting it back in the sleeve while I understand why this might not be one of swans better records I do kind of see it I guess is a bit of a necessary step that the band needed to take in order to get over to records like the great Annihilator because there are elements of folk music and you know sort of the the the haunting heavy acoustic instrumentation and you know the the the disturbing just very dark lyrical imagery that is you know a pretty prominent characteristic on the great Annihilator and the records that would come after that album so you know burning world if you are a swans fan I think it's worth a listen and I think it's I don't think it's a record that you should necessarily skip out on you know definitely some interesting things here though you know I I would say that this record doesn't do those interesting things as well as swans you know next couple of Records so yeah again swans the burning world decent LP and you know it's cool to have another piece of swans vinyl in the collection and finally this is a reissue you know not not an older record you know but I'm kind of building up my records from this band can-can oh boy here we go egg yeah see you know what the hell is there to say about can that I haven't said in previous vinyl updates where I featured their music I mean you know great experimental funky energetic German rock band I mean a lot of people were just kind of label it as krautrock and one of their best and biggest songs on here vitamin C you know there's not really anything crazy about the packaging I mean you know it's pretty standard for the reissue packet reissue packaging that they've been releasing with all of their you know recent reissues you know you get pictures you get a you know a little bit wider notes in here you know it's just pretty simple just gives you the record and the record sounds fantastic I mean you know again this is the format that this stuff was sort of meant to be listened to on so that's why you know it's a to sort of have this stuff on vinyl and and yeah you know I've got some cheap records got a new record but you know it sounds great on this format yeah you know so that's a that's that's essentially the vinyl that I am updating you with the we have updated with this vinyl this is the vinyl update y'all this is the vinyl update hope you're doing well you know let me know down in the comments if you picked up any fantastic records recently you know as a surprise whoa didn't know that was going to be here and at that price you know let me know any additions to your record

OmCh25XgF9A,hey everyone I finished an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of where the Giants room by Thundercat Thundercat is a West Coast singer-songwriter bass virtuoso and an amazing live performer you might have caught him recently on a few new records flying Lotus's latest record kendrick lamar's latest record Kumasi washington's latest record if you haven't heard these records right now have you bet and this new mini album slash EP over here comes after the release of Thundercats sophomore full-length album apocalypse which I didn't really like as much as I thought I was going to I thought there were some kind of goofy vocals on this LP Thundercats falsettos didn't really go over as well as they typically do I don't think he's the best singer in the world but his falsetto vocals definitely bring some kind of personality to the table and then there was also the production on this record which I thought was kind of lackluster nowhere near is intergalactic and colorful and overwhelming as his debut the Golden Age of Apocalypse I mean I guess if you take those titles literal I mean the the quality of both the albums is a is evident now Thundercats debut record over here which I do recommend you listen to is a pretty fantastic fusion of neo soul and jazz and funk music and synth funk and with Flying Lotus on production on this LP it has a very futuristic vibe to it as well and that sound and style on Thundercats debut still rings through on this latest project over here which is just about 17 minutes in length there's not too much to labor over on this album so let's just get it out of the way the production is pretty great Flying Lotus producing on this thing once again Thundercats falsetto vocals just ring out with just slathered just slather it and reverb kind of a cavernous quality to them especially on the opener here where I feel like I'm listening to Thundercats singing in like a Great Hall of some sort there's quite a bit of layered instrument on this LP some some some of which is brought by a star-studded list of guest performers on here like Herbie Hancock like Kumasi Washington and Miguel Atwood Ferguson who you might remember from the brain feeder roster as well all the instrumentation on this LP is mixed very well it's clear it's otherworldly it's intergalactic in the same way that Golden Age of Apocalypse was but it just feels a little bigger and a little bit more instrumentally fleshed out especially on the cut following the opener here a song for the dead the layers of harmonized vocals the bass the weeping violin on this cut which I believe was brought by Atwood Ferguson is very nice it's a very somber sad cut and shows thundercat taking just an instrumental II denser approach as well especially as Kumasi Washington and Herbie Hancock pop in later on the LP then Thundercat takes a punchy ER and funkier approach on the song them change is definitely the catchiest track and the track listing here although my one reservation about this cut is that it ends kind of early it ends kind of fast it just sort of you know fades out out of nowhere I mean there's just kind of an abrupt ending here and I would say that feels the same way for the closing track the previous song as well there are a few cuts in the track listing here that are kind of short of breath and obviously with this project just being 17 minutes long or so that's how the whole thing feels even though I do love the longest track here the very very patient and gorgeous lone wolf and cub which not only starts off as just a wonderful pretty spacious neo-soul tune but kind of develops into this very tender instrumental Odyssey so much of this record is is dreamy psychedelic funky and complex I just think this is kind of Thunder cap popping in to remind us that he's still here in an artistic sense as far as you know sort of creating music for himself going solo I think that it's been a pretty interesting couple of years for Thundercat given all of the just live performing all the appearances that he's done on some pretty high-profile records and I hope that collaboration and I hope that exposure continues for Thundercat I mean hope people continue to reach out for him I hope I see him on more records into the future and if that ever sort of slows down I just hope that he kind of gets a chance to come together with just a lengthier project act act act there's most definitely talent here in these tracks a level of talent that I think people are going to continue to want on their music as they think about studio musicians to invite onto their projects but as far as like you know this project as a whole it just kind of ends up feeling like loose change a little bit so you know kind of feeling like a strong sticks to light seven on this thing if you've given this a listen what did you think of it Tran and you've given this record of listen what do you think of it you're going to tell me but also what you think I should review next what's what's in your ear holes right now what's that to you I'm curious Anthony Fantana Thundercat forever 
NpyNh4P6wSo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and once again pop song stris pop heavyweight taylor swift breaking music industry hearts saying no in an open letter to the good people at Apple music well maybe not so good because her letter highlights some pretty important things sort of like the 3-month trial that people will be getting with Apple music if they in fact sign up artists will not be getting paid during this point in time as well as Apple music and while I do understand that the company isn't going to be directly making money off of the service during this even though Apple may be giving their service away for free the artists aren't necessarily giving their music away for free their music is still doing the work it's supposed to do they are still entertaining the music that they are making is still entertaining they are entertainers that's their job that's what they're paid to do so they should be getting paid by Apple's music streaming service during this three month free trial interesting development here though interesting development we have Taylor Swift her comments Apple reacting now here are some tweets of somebody in the company telling us that artists are in fact going to be paid now during this three-month trial period Wow but I still kind of wonder though how much longer can somebody like Taylor Swift sort of hold out with these music streaming services she said no to Spotify she has said no to Apple and most definitely the only reason she can sort of continue to turn these big music streaming services down is because she is one of the largest artists in the world she has that power she has that influence where she has maybe a little bit more leeway with her label and she can decide where her music goes and where it doesn't go but no doubt in these situations Taylor may in fact be seeing some pressure coming from her labels on this issue because even though she you know is one single person and has more money than any one single person really needs her label who ultimately owned the rights to her music aren't seeing millions and millions of dollars in potential revenue from these music streaming services and not only that but what happens when Taylor Swift is is really no longer America's Sweetheart as she is right now and I think that her decisions on music streaming services may in fact impact that because there's more to being an entertainer than just making an entertaining piece of art in the medium of your choice part of being an entertainer also means giving your audience access to the things that you are trying to entertain them with and even though Taylor may sort of be butting heads with these music streaming services ultimately or I guess indirectly she's also butting heads with her audience or rather her potential audience especially younger listeners who mostly consists of Taylor Swift's listening demographic people in these younger age ranges have pretty much unanimously decided we like these music streaming services we like listening to music for free even though we might not totally be down with all the morals of these companies and we may like discussing these companies and sort of talking about you know whether or not actually using them as good or bad we we do in fact use them let's say you're an author you can most definitely have more control over the price of your art if you print you know a handful of copies and you put them in just a bunch of dusty old bookstores and you charge each one for a hundred dollars the hundred dollar price tag might seem nice but the fact of the matter is you're not actually making any of that money if people aren't purchasing your book especially if people don't even know your book exists or don't know really where to access your book or if access to your book is difficult and inconvenient putting your art putting the things that you entertain people with in places where they can easily hear them see them read them is part of being an entertainer and again younger audiences have decided that they like these music streaming services so how long can Taylor Swift really say no to them because she's not just rejecting these companies she's also saying to her fans you're not going to have access to my music in this spot where you like listening to music so for me right now it's not really a matter of if it's it's really a matter of when eventually I think we're going to see Taylor Swift's music on these platforms I don't know what kind of deal is going to bring that up out but I think it's going to happen and I'm not saying that because I think Taylor Swift is is morally incorrect I think she makes great points about Apple music and I think that her letter here exposes Apple music kind of in the way that I was talking about in one of my last videos just saying that they've entered the market the music streaming market but they're not going to bring anything new or interesting to the table and here with this sort of three month free subscription not paying artists during this period of time thing they are showing themselves to just be another music streaming service that is going to screw artists over but the thing is the only reason we have all these avenues where we're essentially getting music for free on the internet right now is because that's what audiences want so what do you think about all of this do you think Taylor Swift should get on Apple music should she get on Spotify is she going to and I mean are eventually all artists just going to kind of give in to this demand to just allow their music to be streamed for free by audiences on places where they're either paying for subscriptions or being exposed to advertisements let me know Anthony Fantan Oh Taylor Swift Apple music transition thank you for watching so I'm going to say here thank you for watching get out there today drink some water eat some veggies weather is nice go and enjoy it soaking a little Sun and just push yourself a little bit further to a goal today goal that you've had for yourself something you've been meaning to do you know do it for you do it for you forever 
sS6l2zUu3B8,hi everyone train thony cartan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ken mode record success can't go wrong with a good Kenmore refrigerator nope it was then that I realized that there were very few people in my life that understood me as intimately as couchy chesta yep I knew so little about him what is going on behind it would the eye glare of his at dumb-looking smile and even though his presence can bring some serious aggravation to my life I deeply loved him God did I love him and I just felt right then the need to express it I wish you never came back I wish you were I wish you were still dead ken mode is a winnipeg rock trio they have quite a few albums under their belt and they are known for a pretty interesting and even blend of metal and Punk styles in their music just with like a touch of noise rock thrown into the mix as well and they usually blend these two styles of music so nicely that the band over the years has attracted years from sort of both sides of this aisle I have liked their two previous records entrench in 2013 I reviewed that one and I was impressed with this LP so I didn't really go into this new album over here with too much in the way of expectations just thought I might get a another you know good too decent Ken mode album but this record over here success actually comes with a bit of a stylistic change of pace I could say sludge metal fans would get down with this record but I think Ken mode has sort of phased out the metallic and sort of refined and very fine-tuned and precise style of playing that they've executed on their past two records in favor of something just way more aggressive and chaotic and abrasive and savage something kind of along the lines of unsane or shellac or the Jesus Lizard or fuga or just piling on the names here flipper The Melvins old swans records as well as bands like McCluskey or future of the left if Ken mode wasn't influenced on this record by all of these bands they were at least influenced by some of them and just share some similarities on this record with the others if you are familiar with any of these groups you already sort of have in your mind the visceral just like pounding type of sound that Ken mode is going to bring on this album and this noisier direction they take their music in is complemented with a slightly noisier mix and production style something that on paper I didn't think I would have enjoyed as much as I did when I actually got my ears on this LP just to kind of give you an idea with this LP the bass on this thing is just super resonant its overpowering I mean it really just sucks up the low-end in the mix the drums there's a ton of ambient noise the trumps like they were I don't know recorded in a basement or like in some sheetrocked room or you know and just soca just just some some area with hard walls and just a lot of slap back coming through because of the very very aggressive drum playing on here the vocals are slightly buried in a little distant but the riffs on this record are very chunky there's a lot of space between some of these riffs and the vocals make use of that space or rather the riffs sort of make room for the vocals I mean if the wrists were just constantly just pounding and pounding and always making noise you wouldn't hear just a lick of lyrics on this record and the guitars are shrill they're wailing they are brittle they're distorted their ear piercing they are punishing again definitely nowhere near as cleanly assembled as their previous two records and obviously intentional because the direction that they move in I would say that for the most part ten mode succeeds at coming together with a more animalistic sound with all of these hard hitting sort of noise rock post-hardcore sludge metal grooves with pretty much just all the sounds from each instrument just bleeding into one another violently this album is just like you know the savage beating now if you give this record a listen I swear to you the first riff that kicks this record off will destroy your life be careful the guitars the bass on this thing just had this monstrously thick just punchy tone to them really very destructive and then as far as the lyrics go kind of in the in the vein of flipper we are getting a lot of very snide snarky lyrics not just on this track but throughout the LP and I have kind of a sneaking suspicion that this song the lyrics on the opening track here are a little meta with the the words on here sort of being about being in a band itself and uh there's a moment where the words are sung you know thank you for sort of supporting what we do or rather thank you for humoring it sort of our creative process I guess though you know what we're doing shouldn't be encouraged and there's a similar lyrical direction across the entirety of this LP barking dogs and despite being paired with just these really noisy drums and these heavy monstrous riffs the vocals the way they're recorded and just kind of the the distance of them and the ambient noise around them they feel almost subtracted out of the insanity of the rest of the instrumentation on this LP kind of like they're naked in a way especially during lyrical moments on this thing where it is sung you know I'd like to learn to kill the nicest man in the world and that's another thing the vocal deliveries on on this record border on insanity as well there's something just really kind of off-kilter and just really manic about a lot of the lyrics and the singing the shouting the screaming all over this record even though it does feel like the vocal recording could have been done a little bit better I I think the kind of run-and-gun rough-around-the-edges quality of it complements the kind of completely out of your mind character that's being given to us on the vocal tracks here so for the most part I would say the lyrical risks on this record pay off and there are even a few moments here and there where there are some catchy refrains worked into these incredibly savage instrumentals like we all lose or 36.8% although there are a few cuts in the track listing here like the song management control where the lyrics kind of come off like this crazy completely I guess unorganized rant where no one thought or word seems any more important than any other thought or word there is a great instrumental on this track though and I will say that even though Ken mode sometimes the lyrics can be kind of unfocused and sloppy there is an incredible amount of musical focus on this LP and a little variety to that comes via songs like the owl which has this grimy very very naked bass groove to it and some guitars that are almost very jazzy in quality but very shrill and distorted and punky kind of reminds me of uh some Dead Kennedys East Bay Ray a bit of a thing and they have a song called the howl as well great song and the cello at the end of this track is a nice touch as well just another moment on this LP where Ken mode comes through with a bit of depth and detail and finesse where you might not necessarily expect it which also occurs at the tail end of the opening track on here to where it kind of sounds like some strings some very just manic very tense and disturbing strings are being thrown into the hulking mess of bass and guitars that kind of end this track out in just a mess so you have kind of these softer more varied more dynamic cuts you do have your more extreme tracks on here as well like I just liked fire which features one of the more speedy and catchy guitar lines in the entire LP but for the most part ken mode packs in this variety within a barnburner of a record that lasts just about 37 minutes doesn't really overstay its welcome or anything like that it's just enough variation to keep things interesting keep things from feeling one-dimensional which was a bit of an issue for me with Kenneth's previous two records I especially like the closing track on here where the bass the guitars actually take a bit of a softer approach and the writing on here has it's kind of depressing downward spiral quality to it and the vocals are very I guess a deadpan in a way and I think are a bit Slynt ish most definitely read like something that could have come off of spiderland for a moment there overall um really enjoying this record from ken mode more than I thought I was going to not just when I went into it because I mean you know I really like ken mode seen him live before good band but not one of my favorites and then also the production was a little off-putting for me when I first put my ears onto this LP but Ken mode really came through when it came to volume the extremity of the vocals the extremity of the lyrics as well as just some really catchy riffs I feel like all the things that I liked about the band's previous records were kind of just turned up and even though in a sense the band really kind of wears its influences on their sleeve on this LP I think they blend them so well or it just kind of seems like they're referencing so lightly from a myriad of different bands that it's not really all too distracting for the most part for me and then you know on top of that while Ken modu sort of seemed to be working within a pretty established musical you know underground musical style on this LP I do have to say that the animalistic aggressive just over-the-top delivery and performance though that they do on this record that that is all their own you know that is totally their energy which you know regardless of how much referencing they're doing on this LP is incredibly impressive just how savage they came through as on this record I'm feeling a strong seven to like eight on this thing transition if you've given this record of listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why why the hell would you hate it and what do you think I should do next and that's it Anthony Fantana Ken mode forever 
_uySf429Z7E,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd here to say you decide the value of music you decide the value of music you decide the value of music you decide the value of music did the video not too long ago where I was talking about music streaming services there was a wonderful individual off of Twitter whose name I can't remember off the top of my head I have it right here in my phone and it is Felix J Morgan who felt personally that I brought no ideas or cool concepts or conversation or you know actual thoughts to this discussion and he would much rather me talk about the value of music and I said mr. Felix J Morgan I know that you may think he did sort of go on to say what do I think about these streaming services what do I think about you know sort of all this stuff devaluing music right now and the fact of the matter is is that music streaming services are not devaluing music record labels platforms you can where you can buy digital music all of this stuff is not devaluing music people decide the value of music and always have because music is only worth as much as people are going to pay for it sure artists and record labels they can set the price they could say hey this record is sixteen dollars this record sixteen dollars but that record is actually not going to be sixteen dollars unless somebody actually shells out that sixteen dollars to pay for it these prices have come via an average of just all the musical prices sort of over the course of popular music history and people who work in boardrooms at record labels know that a certain price point on a record is where that record is going to sell the best because they have a bottom line to worry about they have all this sort of sales information that they analyze to death so that they know that their company is running efficiently I know that it kind of seems like they're setting the prices but the fact of the matter is is that you're setting the prices because things again are only worth what you are going to pay for them when you stream music on YouTube free you are deciding the value of music when you stream music via your title subscription you are deciding the value of music when you buy music off iTunes you're deciding the value of music when you go on Bandcamp and somebody is sort of doing a sort of pay what you want for this album sort of deal you are deciding the value of music very apparently there there there you decide the value of music and you decide that more than ever now was not necessarily the case years and years and years ago where the record labels really sort of had control over who had access to music I mean I remember sort of in my teen years there was a very sort of small or maybe it was large to the labels but I remember there was a little class-action suit that came as a result of what people were talking about as a overpriced CDs in the news and I remember with my mother we registered to sort of be a part of this class-action lawsuit and I think you know in the mail we might have gotten back like a dollar in 70 cents or something or just like a few dollars nowadays we have the opposite problem I mean you know we aren't being overcharged for music music is in every direction and is like you know pretty much free to listen to it seems like the only time you really pay for music nowadays is if you want to own the music if you want to own the mp3 or own the CD or own the vinyl or own the tape just sort of listening to it the Internet is your listening booth which is what people used to sort of refer to pirating as like you know the Internet is the listening booth people are pirating records and then they're going to go pay for them and support the artists when you know that's that's actually not the case and when people were doing that they were deciding the value of music they were deciding that you know we would much rather just not pay for this music stuff we like it to be free music is cheap right now because the audience decided that it was cheap the audience decided that they would want to achieve all this free music that we're getting right now in every direction did not come as a result of like some kind of big boardroom meeting at Sony where one guy just stood up and said hey man what if we just start giving away this music stuff so if you don't like right now that music is being devalued the price of music is essentially like dropping through the floor then I mean that's that's the audience's fault man that's the audience's fault the audience decided music was cheap and you know it was sort of an inevitable thing with just us having so much access to music just the click of a mouse so no there isn't some government entity or big corporate office that you could petition and be like raise the prices of music because music deserves to be worth more than what we're currently paying for it what you're going to have to do if you find the falling prices of music problematic is act as if music is valued in a certain way in your own life if you think music is worth a certain price then pay that price that you feel it's worth but you know just let it be known that's that's really what everybody is doing now and the vast majority of people have come to the decision that it's just easier it's more convenient if they just kind of stream it online for free I obviously value owning physical copies of music but I think the digital world is fantastic as well I wouldn't know about a great deal of the music that I do I wouldn't enjoy a great deal of the music that I do if it wasn't for the digital realm and it's the same thing for you too there are a lot of artists that I think are fantastic that never would have been put on had it not been for the internet we are going to have our growing pains through this new world of digital media this is sort of one of them as we kind of adjust to what people actually want what people are actually demanding in terms of what they want from music how they want it to be delivered to them and what they want to pay for it that's it man you decide the value of music you decided forever ition what do you think about all this value of music biz do you feel like you know you're not really deciding the value of music do you just feel like other people companies and youth streaming services are deciding the value and you're just kind of you know accepting that value you're not really deciding and no I mean or do you feel like you're taking a more active role and sort of you know really influencing the value of music today and to you personally what is the value of music do you often find yourself just listening to music for free pirating music paying as little as possible for pay what you want albums or do you kind of find yourself you know purchasing a lot of music and and for what reason do you find yourself doing one or the other do you have no money do you feel like you need to support the artists let me know cool cool Anthony Fantana value of music forever 
sxqtYnLxU0E,everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new me without you record pale horses they are a post-hardcore tan indie outfit known for their incredibly emotive poetic lyricism as well as song structures especially on their last full-length LP that kind of twist and wind along with the storylines that are featured in the lyrics and again the last album was quite literally story like the album was titled ten stories but again I think the enjoy ability of these songs really comes down to the narratives told by frontman Aaron Weiss now with the band's last full-length LP there were some undeniably great tracks in the track listing here that I thought were fantastic but a good chunk of this album just didn't do that much for me I guess the stories that were being told in the lyrics were a little esoteric or alien to me just wasn't really getting anything engaging or riveting or emotional from them and on this latest LP over here I'm having an even harder time believe it or not connecting with the band sort of on those levels and for a handful of different reasons I mean one not only our Aaron Weiss's vocals on this record obscured more than they were on the last one almost as if he's kind of singing through a really cheap speaker or something it's obviously an intentional effect that was thrown on and there's also some reverb on there and it just makes him feel very brittle and thin and distant vocally and I think it really just kind of I don't know has has has the opposite effect of what I think they were shooting for instead of making my ears sort of draw toward the vocals because they have these weird effects thrown on them and they kind of have this sonic quality to them that no other instrument in the mix has I think it actually buries them and makes it easier to sort of throw the vocals into the background often because they're just really not that audible which is a weird thing for the vocals to be when lyrics and storytelling sort of play such a large role in the repertoire of your band and then there's also sort of the vocal delivery which wasn't too bad on the last record but a lot of the time I feel like the vocals are delivered in this manner where they feel kind of hokey [Music] and of course because the songs here instrumentally sort of follow these narratives and enhance these narratives or at least try to you're sort of getting the same long-winded structures that came through on ten stories but here because I feel like I am even farther away from enjoying what's going on lyrically and vocally I'm not really digging these long-winded structures at all I think the instrumentals are really the only thing that are keeping me from really disliking this album but even they sometimes can feel kind of just overly dreary or dull sort of like twinkly thin guitars sort of sparkling throughout the track red crow which sort of interchange with these heavy guitar chords on I guess what you could call the choruses of the song there are tracks like this and the track listing here to feel completely nondescript then there are other cuts like two watermelon ascot that really kick the album off that the the first time the song came out I thought I was listening to like a an Interpol track I thought an Interpol song kind of got mixed in the tracklisting here but then once the the screaming the shouting comes in at the midpoint of the song I feel like the band really kind of I guess in a sense makes this sound there's I mean I guess I no longer feel like I'm listening to Interpol I feel like I'm listening to me without you by the halfway point of this track and I do like the sort of weird surprising groovy passage of drums bass and guitars that this song kind of ends out with and I love how this musical moment sort of glides into the next track if there is one thing that I think is an improvement upon the 10 stories formula there was a few tracks on that record that actually sort of weaved into one another musically so that I kind of felt like I was listening to this cool cohesive musical cinematic experience and on this record I mean that pretty much happens with nearly every track here I mean all the songs really blend together on pale horses so that's a positive and and for the most part I will say that the performances on this record are tight there are some decent you know instrumental performances on this LP but these instrumental performances are really just only backing up and supporting songs I don't really care for and even though these songs do weave and together well I mean just these tracks I don't really care for again are just being weaved together well I mean I don't really care for what's at the core of these tracks the fact that they are performed well and weave in together I mean most definitely improves the quality of the album but it's not exactly making me love it you know I mean these things just kind of seem like a standard cool thing that an album could or should have in its formula you know a listenable album that has these basic technical functions down and occasionally there will be some sweet guitar lines that pop out sort of like during the really intense guitars on the song Mexican War streets or there will be a decent refrain like this is not the first time this is not the first time that God has died definitely a memorable spot on the song D minor on this record it's just strange to me that that that a group like this doesn't really move me that much usually I'm typically into very wordy rock music bands like Velvet Underground and LCD Soundsystem and more recent favorites who are actually you know sort of musical cousins to this band La Dispute or even to che amore but no I mean just me without users completely lost on me for for this record I mean some of their more sort of a I guess brighter more aggressive more anthemic and dramatic stuff that came out years ago I mean I definitely still enjoy it but this album is just really not doing much for me I mean it's certainly well played and it's certainly listenable but it's nowhere near one of their more well written or more emotionally captivating records I actually think I don't know it's it's kind of drab I'm feeling a strong two decent five on this thing tram thoughts on this new me without you LP did you love it did you hate it blind what do you think I should review next that's it gets me Fantana me without you forever 
QvnsZyoxXjY,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd time to do a review of the ash Cuccia album dude oh my gosh st Kutcher my favorite actor man it was at that very moment I realized me and coucher chesta we're not so different we both had hopes dreams and as long as we've stuck together a bright future sure he may look a little silly on the surface but I knew that this friendship was gonna last a long time there was only one thing I could say I hate you - Cuccia is a london-based electronic music producer all I really know about this project is I heard it a little earlier this year it kind of mesmerized me and now it's seeing a little bit of support from the people over at Old English spelling bee records which you know sort of gave me a bit of a reminder to actually revisit this record sort of seeing them throw it up on their Bandcamp and sort of in revisiting I was like you know I should review this this record is 43 minutes and the first time I heard it I thought what is this crazy musical digital sorcery was this record produced by an alien being on intergalactic LSD while flying his spaceship at Lightspeed through an asteroid field because this record is particularly odd there is a cold super cold otherworldly atmosphere to it at times on this LP I am reminded of ARCA and I'm reminded of Flying Lotus as well though I think most people who sort of make experimental beat based music are inevitably going to sort of get a FlyLo comparison or at least you know sort of see some kind of similarities because of how much of a pioneer in the genre he's been but despite those very surface level comparisons I think ash Cuccia has some very different stylistic and musical influences I would say the sound palette on this record is kind of industrial it's glitchy but it's not a glitch hop album and there's almost nothing jazzy about this record and the songs here most definitely groove but when they do it often sort of exhibits this just very rigid techno Vibram even a middle-eastern rhythm and there are tracks in the tracklisting here that feel like they're pulling quite a bit from maybe some progressive synth music or soundtrack music some songs here kind of are ambient soundscapes do keep in mind that across these 43 minutes there are quite a few songs some of which are just a tidbit sized one minute and 50 seconds or so but still come through with an immense amount of detail I mean just dizzying complexity the kind of complexity I would usually associate with like a classical composition so not only are some of these songs very impressive compositionally but I think there is a serious appreciation for sound on this LP which I love like with the very eerie sad and warped lead melodies that kick this album off to the very colorful drum Tambor's that are flowing throughout this record or the subterranean bass tones but these are just kind of I guess little bits of backbone that you can pick up on a lot of tracks here there's a myriad of other completely inexplicable sounds that run throughout this record that it would take me days if not months to sort of describe every single one of them to you and a lot of these sounds fly by at such a fast pace it's hard to take them all in especially on the first listen but ash Cuccia usually makes sure that there is some kind of very strong melodic backbone or chord structure or rhythm some kind of strong memorable sticky catchy unique or interesting pattern or patterns that flow throughout these tracks that kind of guide the clutter and the insanity of these songs also I need to mention that the tracks and the track listen here glide into one another so fluidly you can really just kind of put this record on not even pay attention to the track listing and really just get lost in this LP because all the songs come together in what feels like this one big cohesive piece I don't really feel like I'm listening to a bunch of little tiny unfinished beats or anything like that this isn't one of those beat music albums we're just kind of feels like you're just getting one tidbit after another tidbit after another tidbit and they kind of blend together into this sort of bland smorgasbord of fat that is not the case on this LP when I listen to this LP I feel like I am floating or exploring through an insanely psychedelic electronic dreamland so again this whole project is very cohesive track four track four track I feel like I'm listening to just one little movement after another of a long ongoing piece now as far as going into these tracks individually it's it's super hard it's super duper hard because I can most definitely try to describe the spiraling tones and kind of the fat sputtering base on the song other but again these are just kind of just mere backbone elements of this track while good it's just a fraction of the songs overall detail and isn't you know anywhere near as close as I could come to describing exactly what all of these elements come together and do for me emotionally the way that Cuccia sort of explorers sound on this album in orchestrates it in such a coherent way despite there being so much detail to take into account is really impressive I will say there are a few tracks in the track listing here that do feel a little sort of cluttered or maybe just a little unfocused a lot like the song slam slam slam which maybe this track won't feel like that to you maybe a myriad of other tracks on the track listing here will feel like that to you to you to you there are also a few cuts here that feels so a lien and abstract that I have a hard time sort of connecting with them in any kind of significant way and with the song triple XL this track to me feels like one of the least creative tracks and the track listing here mostly because I just feel like I'm listening to some glitch based computer music whereas with the rest of the cell P for the most part while yeah I mean obviously we're listening to music made through some kind of digital program or interface here but Cuccia does a great job of pushing leaving these digital tools in such a way where I just feel like I'm listening to a musical communication from just somewhere off of this planet or from another dimension there's like things are kind of just you know turned on its head a little bit so this was a really fun refreshing just very engaging cool to listen to album that I loved hearing I'm feeling mmm a light to decent ate on this thing Tran position give this album a listen let me know what you think of it did you love it that you hated why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino ashbey's yeah forever 
oN6a23b1MrI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd time for a review of the new Hudson Mohawke record lantern Hudson Mohawke uk-based electronic music producer very much known for his bright fun banger beats especially the ones he produced with the one and only lunes together under the tonight name they came out with in amazing EP a few years ago I cannot wait for them to come back together and make some more music but in the meantime Hudson Mohawke has been gracing us with a bit of solo material in ep last year which didn't really grab my attention too much it just just did not stick with me I felt the production on this thing was kind of lacking and I thought that because this was a full-length commercial project we might see a little bit more effort on this one but a lot of the issues that I had with Hudson's previous EP chimes I think continue on to this latest album as well it just has a little bit more star power on the vocal gas side of things track 4 track 4 track 4 track 4 track on this record we get some decent ideas that I think are hampered by some kind of weak production shit-shit-shit especially when it comes to the percussion on this LP it sounds so flat bodyless and overblown it sounds like it's either compressed too much or mastered badly I can't really tell but because almost every track here is like that as well as tracks off of Hudson Mohawks last EP I have to imagine it's a purposeful intentional aesthetic choice not totally sure why because it makes the drums sound awful which that's the last thing you want sounding awful in a genre of music like this where the rhythms really are the backbone and the foundation but on Lanterns here we essentially have because of the drum sounds just not sounding pleasurable at all a crack in the foundation again just no dynamics to these drums and that's almost an okay thing when it comes to the harder hitting tracks on this LP but there are also cuts on here that are softer and when it comes to the synthesizers when it comes to just the the chord progressions or even the vocal guests just take a bit of a softer like Anthony of Antony and the Johnsons appears on this LP Miguel as well as jhene aiko and they all sound fine I think their vocal performances as surprising as some of them may be that they show up on this record especially Anton he didn't sort of see Antony coming on this record but her along with the other guests on this record I feel like aren't complemented with Hudson Mohawks production at all there's just nothing in the way of finesse or fluidity to the way this percussion moves it's just super stiff and super flat all over the record and sometimes the vocals on the cell P like on the song warriors sit obnoxiously high in the mix and not only drown out the music but get cluttered in the very loud sort of jewbilee like synthesizers when the course is pop up some of the spots on the selfie instrumentally are immaculate like the orchestral style instrumentation on the song kettles which I imagine is synthetic but it sounds great anyway and this song actually kind of feels like an intro to one of the better cuts on the entire LP here really huge monstrous banger with some epic synthetic instrumentation it kind of sounds like a cheerleader pep rally at the Roman Colosseum however after this high watermark in the middle of the LP I wouldn't say the album exactly picks up or gets better there are some cuts that are kind of short like little de djembe that feel kind of like filler beats in the last quarter of this record or so I do like the song shadows the closer on here is cool I love the song portrait of Lucy it feels like this very bright glossy pretty piece of electronic flavored trap but still the drum issues that I have on this record continue on to these tracks as well and even though I like these songs they really only sort of feel like to me that they could have been decent cuts off of any of Hudson Mohawks past three major projects or so satin Panthers chimes and his debut LP as well so in in that sense it doesn't really feel like he's progressing all that much on this LP to my ears yeah just do not know what happened with this album I mean the I I do I mean it sounds a lot like his previous EP it just feels a little bit bigger but more commercial with some more vocal guest appeal which I mean if you loved the previous EP maybe you liked this LP but I just don't really care for the way Hudson Mohawke has been producing for the past few years life satin Panthers a lot liked his debut felt there was a little bit more clarity there maybe stiff at points but I mean the drum certainly were way more pleasurable to listen to hear again they just feel so burnt and I guess staticky overblown is like the the most accurate word I can use for these drums and just in the most unpleasant uninteresting way possible I'm feeling strong 5 on this record if you've given it a listen what did you think of it let me know Tran you 
x1_LoNDxjJk,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd making a quick video giving a quick opinion on music streaming services as you might know music streaming services been a pretty hot topic in the news lately from title to Apple they made a big announcement recently with Apple music which they will probably be throwing on to all of our devices soon so they could throw tons of u2 songs at us and Spotify I mean they're always in the news for some reason well I think music streaming services we're really not going to see any more competition in this market than we are right now at least not interesting innovative competition I feel like Spotify has already set the tone for how a successful music streaming service is going to work in every new service that we see is essentially going to be just kind of working within that frame of mine in some way or another not just because music streaming service is the way that they make money I mean it's it's pretty straightforward it's pretty obvious pretty limited but also simultaneously what people want music streaming services to do are pretty limited and simple and straightforward your average Internet user is wondering does your music streaming service does your platform have the music I want to hear yeah okay cool is it free if you can have those two boxes checked you may in fact have a customer right there but if you're going to be charging for your service and adding all these bells and whistles bring it in these celebrity endorsements and basically I don't know adding playlists whatever these future companies are going to do in order to sort of hook you in and jump on to their platform it's just going to be angling this very I guess plentiful and ubiquitous product just in a certain way in order for you to go listen to it over there some places are going to be like our music sounds better it's higher quality although there was a recent thing on NPR music where they had people actually try to hear audio quality and the end result was that all of the people who did the test did better slightly better than picking completely at random which is not very encouraging for the companies that are trying be like our sounds better yeah sounds better there are other companies that'll say well you know we pay artists maybe a little bit more or something like that I mean each one is going to have its own sort of backstory and angle but at the end of the day it's just kind of like watching different companies try to compete sell bottled water it's it's all water all I'm saying in this video is I think the competition is pretty much over the big boys have been established unless there's you know some huge lawsuit or there's been you know millions of dollars sort of embezzled behind the scenes I think who is playing in the sandbox right now is just well-established these people aren't going anywhere for sure you know we are going to see more people enter but the amount of variation from company to company is going to be incredibly small of course the people who run these companies are going to tell you that that's not the case but you know they're trying to sell you a product so you know they're not going to be like well you know our streaming services like every other one some people are going to be drinking that Poland Spring that's cool you know you got that Perrier as well you got that Dasani I'm just sort of you know sipping from the tap got that pure water filter on there just that's that's what I'm doing you know might throw it in a Brita let's not forget who the real power players in this situation are you might have companies like Apple sort of hopping in the music streaming service ring but think about how recently we just had title sort of getting threatened by Sony to pull all of Beyonce's music because something wasn't being paid enough for the streams of Beyonce's music according to Sony so these record labels are ultimately the decider of where this music is going to show up on what streaming services so how ambitious or weird or experimental or sort of well-meaning streaming service can be with you know how much money they're going to pay themselves the artists the label that uh in the at the end of the day the labels are kind of you know really pulling the strings so you know the these streaming services you know they're kind of you know at the mercy of the labels in a sense so again you know I kind of feel like we're talking about water here sure you know not all artists albums are the same not all music is the same I'm not trying to say that but you know as far as these major players they have access pretty much to a lot of the same music so as a result in terms of the product that you're getting it's not going to vary that much going from platform to platform sure you know we have artists like Taylor Swift who have decided they're not going to mess with Spotify certainly they're going to be more artists going into the future who might make those same choices might make similar choices to which streaming services they want to work with they want their music to appear on but for the most part your average artist is going to want their music on the platforms that people are going to so that's what I think about music streaming services competitions dead competitions over for

ZzqZViemU9Q,fell back teeny cow back Queenie now back hi everyone and Nathan Tuan Doh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Denzel double-e curry EP music 32 zal planet shrooms mister Denzel curry he is a young Florida rapper I believe he's still affiliated with Space Ghost perps Raider clan don't quote me on that and I've been enjoying his stuff for the past few years ever since I came across his album nostalgic 64 a few years ago denzel's production on this record his flows on this record were a little rough around the edges but he made up for in an incredible amount of energy and aggression on these cuts as well and in the track listing here he managed to toss in a few conceptual tracks as well which were a nice breath of fresh air a side of his writing I wish I saw more on this project and I guess I was hoping to see more of in this new double EP project over here but I can't say I was really anticipating a double EP release maybe an album maybe a mixtape so in a way Denzel has kind of you know thrown me off completely grabbed me by surprise so going into this double EP wasn't really 100% sure what to expect are the sister EPS are they related in some kind of significant or conceptual way does each IP take a different approach musically or lyrically and I guess the answer to that question is both yes and no I mean both EPS feature plenty of lyrics that are very violent or sexual in nature there are plenty of references on both EPS to smoke in that dank bud buddy very dank very very dag but simultaneously the aggressive hard-hitting trap flavored bangers of the to be used surf contrasts pretty clearly to the very psychedelic sort of outcast inspired flavor of a few tracks on the second EP here though the grimy production and denzel's delivery do kind of pull these two projects together feeling a little bit like an album I mean if you didn't know that these were two separate EPS you may as well just assume that this is you know a cohesive full-length record because at the end of the day this is a pretty consistent project but in a way maybe too consistent and too consistent in that we have two eps here bring in a total of fourteen tracks together and I guess I was just hoping for more variety across all these songs and for Denzel to actually kind of stepped forward and and and kind of carve out a sound of his own because while there are tracks on here that do to me in a sense feel uniquely aggressive tracks like chief forever as well as ultimate where Denzel absolutely bodies this instrumental mental or mental but on a lot of other cuts on this LP I feel like the few unique characteristics that Denzel has get sort of drowned out or kind of forgotten in a series of triplet flows or like outcast Andre 3000 inspired flows Bone Thugs and harmony flows and some songs that instrumentally have kind of an eerie three 6 mafia vibe to them there are most definitely some lyrics in the tracklist here that hit hard for their aggression I mean Denzel pulls no punches with people like rich homie Quan for example there are some very darkly and and I guess angrily sexually explicit lyrics on this LP that do make me you know just kind of wince a little bit for a second but it does kind of fit in with the very sinister nature of these two eps on the whole still this is not enough for me anyway to completely set him apart from anybody else and sort of put him in his own lane in the current rap landscape and then on top of that the consistency that I sort of talked about earlier I guess it isn't completely non-existent but the songs where Denzel tries to vary from his more aggressive and standout tracks he gives us these kind of meddling forgettable cloud rap songs that often have some of the worst hooks on these two EPs like smoke 2049 or delusional or captaincy funk tracks like this are where Denzel sort of loses the bite the aggressive bite that made him so interesting in the first place though I do have to give it to him on the closer though for actually coming through with I guess a bit of a story and a concept in the lyrics while also delivering an instrumental that is pretty Spacey and and pretty cloudy as well and if there's another thing that I kind of miss about this new double EP over denzel's last full-length project is that there really doesn't seem to be more if even just as much conceptual tracks here as there were on denzel's last project where when he does kind of focus in on one topic like on smoke 2049 he absolutely you know is kind of indulging or kind of exploring something that's that's you know completely boring in a sense or just isn't really bringing that new or refreshing of a perspective to I mean you know how many weed songs are there at this point how many a lot still though despite my a handful of critiques there were a good series of hard-hitting bangers on these two EPS and some generally good and enjoyable cuts I will say though I did enjoy the first EP much more than the second just less cuts on the second that I thought were good and just a a more generally laid-back feel that didn't hold my attention quite as much averaging these 2 EPS together I'm feeling a strong 6 to Lite 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen these 2 EPS rather if you have what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it or saving Cal next we're saving Cal we're saving them 
qoxjzGypOAA,we're never gonna forget cows now we're never gonna forget gal oh hi everyone temporary change oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new high on fire record gegege luminiferous these guys were a famed metal trio they've been at it for well over a decade now and they have the albums to show for they're also famously known for the ties the band's frontman Matt pike has to the seminal stoner metal band sleep and if you can already guess high on fire is in fact a metal band easily one of the most thunderous in the genre and while over the course of their career high on fire has maintained a heaviness similar to that of sleep their approach compositionally and I guess energy wise has been way more pummelling way more aggressive and this aggressive approach seemed to come to a head on the band's last full-length LP where they reached a point of extremity that I loved but I wasn't really sure as to whether or not they were going to be able to surpass it on their next album even with Kurt blew of converge producing once again on this new album but despite my very slight doubts high on fire actually comes through once again with another quality project and they do so not by getting more extreme than they were on their last record but instead kind of using back a little bit focusing more on their writing on the vocals and actually working some kind of memorable melodies into the tracks here to just sort of get this out of the way the production on this record is great I mean of course it's great it's Kurt Ballou producing it the guitars are just blaring you get these walls of distorted guitar all over this LP the base is really resonant really warm it doesn't feel like it's kind of fused in there with the guitars it really sopped up a lot of those lower frequencies in the mix I mean if you got a big high five when you're listening to this album you're and you hear the bass really prom and very clearly I mean it has this warm resonant tone that's very nice throughout the record the drums I would say get kind of buried in the chaos a lot of the time when the guitars kind of step back a bit and they're soloing and you just kind of get the bass the drums sort of seem to have a bit more prominence or when they're playing fills the drums definitely feel like they're they're they're audible they're just maybe not as punchy as they were on the last record and as far as Matt Pike's vocals they sit atop the chaos very nicely he is coming through with his trademark screamed gargles once again when Matt Pike is singing you you know who it is and surprisingly his vocals work pretty well on this LP over some of the slower instrumentals on here even as he is trying to incorporate some melody into his voice like on the track the cave which is one of the darker and more melodic instrumentals on this LP with a very beautiful bass line on this thing there's something kind of about this track and some of the other melodic cuts on this LP as well that kind of reminds me of the way Metallica was incorporating more melodic elements into their repertoire on records like and justice for all and there's actually quite a few tracks on this LP as well where there is a strong thrash metal influence in the way that the riffs are being delivered and written to but as far as other cuts on this LP that also take a slower and melodic approach one of my favorite tracks in the track listing here the Falcon is your Falcon Baro stirrer one might think high on fire would kind of lose steam going with an approach like this but this is actually fantastic song one of their better written tracks and it's very an FEM ik it's very sticky and a contrast really nicely with the track right before which is maybe the hardest and fastest on the entire LP slave the hive where the band maintains they're very thick heavy production but plays up to a very speedy thrash metal tempo and Matt pikes vocals on this track are frenzied as hell this track is like listening to just every blood vessel in my head burst at once I would say this record ends pretty strong as well with a massive closer though the fade-out it finishes with isn't really you know too fantastic the song the black plot is a barnburner that kicks off the record that has a very melodic hook on it and yeah I mean from front to back I don't really have a whole lot of complaints about this album I mean I will say that maybe there are a few tracks here sort of like dark side of the compass or maybe Carcosa that kind of feel like just you know your average high on fire song as far as their material goes from the past five or six years or so but while there are a few cuts here where it doesn't really feel like high on fire is pushing that far outside of their comfort zone these songs simultaneously do at least work up to the standards of quality when it comes to writing performing and intensity high on fire has been delivering pretty consistently for years and years um you know I would hate to sound like a pushover with this band once again but I mean I I think we got a rack up another would fry had fire this lot of you this is a good metal record I mean this thing was hard hitting it was just pummeling it was again it was it was heavy it was thunderous and and and I think while I do still love their last LP and and and I don't necessarily think this album surpasses it I do think the more melodic approach to some of the tracks here was a nice change of pace and in a way kind of you know sweeten the deal you know if high on fire we're going to come out with another record that didn't really you know I guess challenge the band's usual style all that hard I think you know just to kind of simply incorporate more melodies and just some some some vocals and some riffs that are a bit sticky or a bit catchy er would have been exactly what I needed to kind of sweeten that deal and I got it with this new album over here I recommend this record loving it I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing Tran you 
7jKEYrJTVQI,Gaucho justice favorite lint roller his calzone that was his own his favorite human league record and his favorite fretless bass hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Florence and the Machine record how big how blue how beautiful Florence on the machine is a uk-based art chamber and alternative pop outfit this is their third full-length LP and they are fronted by vocalist and songwriter Florence Welch a woman whose voice I've always admired much more than her music if you're a fan of this group you already know that Florence's voice is bold it's cutting it's got a lot of power it's got a lot of volume to it and and I would say personality as well and I don't think this is the case on her debut the instrumentation on her debut record was actually kind of quirky and had an organic quality to it sometimes but as far as the sophomore record the Florence and the Machine put out the instrumentation on this LP for me was just so overly dramatic and glitzy and sanitized and in a sense bland as well and I most definitely see that the band gives some pretty rousing performances with these sounds as well I definitely see the appeal personally I just prefer Florence in the machines debut LP over the sophomore record but I did have some hope going into the latest album over here because I did like some of the singles I had heard I wouldn't say this new album over here is exactly going back to the old days of Florence in the machine but the instrumentation while it does still have a very clean pristine mainstream appeal to it it doesn't feel like it's trying to get so large and so overbearing that it's actually overshadowing the songs and the songs are actually pretty succinctly and koechli written on this album which was a really pleasant surprise the hooks and the verse on this record actually sting kind of hard sometimes and I would say for the most part the lyrics and the singing are just passionate and interesting enough to actually satisfy somebody who is as picky as me I'm kind of reminded in a way how surprisingly good I thought the Brandon Flowers solo record was from a few years ago with one cut after another on this record we are getting these huge massive just punch early written choruses shipped rec then I build this ship do red or what kind of man loves like this or a queen of peace or Delilah where I especially love the lyrics on the hook of this track or the song mother which closes the whole record out again these big exciting choruses Florence delivering these really impassioned vocal deliveries and they are all on top of these sparkling bass drums guitars occasionally some pianos and horns getting thrown in there as well but again I wouldn't exactly call the instrumentation on this record all that eclectic maybe with the exception of like the closing track here which feels kind of like it has a bit of a classic rock vibe to it or the numerous layers of horns on the title track here I would say that a lot of the time the instrumentation on this record is kind of like this reverb II clean nondescript platform for Florence to kind of do her vocal thing on top of which isn't necessarily a bad thing because when she is just kind of belting out these huge vocal lines it doesn't sound that bad however I think the blind spot on this record is sort of in subtlety and intimacy the subdued quieter slower more slowed down tracks don't really feel that close at all really they are kind of cold and distant and don't really feature songs that are as memorable as a lot of the louder cuts here they for the most part just kind of feel like these quiet intermissions just to provide some semblance a variety to the record I think the only song on this record which comes off remotely intimate would be on the song cot which actually features some of the most lovely instrumentation on the entire record as well as one of Florence's better vocal performance is to I mean she just pulls me in really close on this track and the groove is so easygoing and the guitars on here are so warm not really featuring that same kind of very pristine sheen that they have on a lot of other cuts here this track in a way actually does remind me of the more organic vibe of the debut LP so yeah while there are a handful of very big tracks on here that I think are great I think this record really could have used some variety or maybe just a little bit of restraint on some of these quieter tracks or maybe just some catchy your songwriting or again just more intimate legitimately intimate moments I feel like that's kind of an element that has been lost in Florence and the machines music ever since the sophomore record where the presentation of the instrumentation and Florence's voice seems to have kind of reached up into the stratosphere to the point where they're just so few moments where the music actually feels down to earth in some kind of way and I get that temptation to constantly hang up there because I mean Florence's voice allows her a certain level of emotional and voluminous power that few singers have and it definitely sets her apart but very quiet and intimate moments can be just as emotionally powerful if not more as evidenced on the song caught I just would have liked to have heard more of that side of Florence in the machine on this record still though for the most part this is a very good pop record that I would recommend to anybody looking for a pretty straightforward well produced very clean but well-written set of songs I'm feeling a light decent seven on this thing transition if you'd given this record of listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it have a Fantan Oh Florence and the Machine forever 
QGS7Med4jsA,I'm surrounded by reminders of cow this is a favorite Lionel Richie record there's his old keyboard over here is his favorite Wienermobile piggy bank and over there his favorite circling king of skulls he loved those skulls he loved them so much hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's it's it's time for review of the new Muse record drones Muse is a uk-based alt rock band who is still kicking despite being in the middle of maybe the most polarizing point of their career from the symphonic rock of the resistance to the weirdly dubstep influenced the second law a lot of longtime fans haven't really been that into muses latest output and I wasn't exactly looking forward to this new LP either once I started hearing the initial singles from it especially the song psycho a song that features these really clownish hard rock riffs banan as well as some satirical jabs at the military which in a sense do have a point but sort of feel tasteless and an off base due to the rock riffs and the really bad voice-acting bits and even though this is not really one of muses better singles the rest of this record actually goes in a rock direction as well which ends up making it feel noticeably more focused than the second law but the tracks on this record are sort of delivered in this really large Grand Arena sized hard-hitting presentation a bit of a hard rock vibe on this album not really the grandiose and and gaudy overwrought and sort of you know heavy instrumental presentation of the resistance this record is a little more straightforward I guess a little bit more testosterone and adrenaline fuelled on the first half of the selfie there are some really huge just buzzing blaring compress rock riffs even some shreddy and noodley guitar soloing that seems kind of Eddie Van Halen inspired again there is a strong like 80s hardrock vibe on this record maybe with the exception of the song mercy in the first half which features these just sparkly twinkly piano notes that feel like I'm about to listen into a Coldplay song and for the most part I think Muse uses this hard rock style to their advantage this typically just really excessive and gag-worthy style of music is actually not that bad when they have their hands on it I like the intro track on here dead inside the u2 flavored vocal parts on this track as well as the hard-hitting drum intro here don't sound too bad and I think at the core there is a listenable suitable suitable tune here but what I think ends up ruining this track is the really just Bhoomi smothering just like oppressive production that just buries to death a lot of the background vocals a lot of the guitar work it just really makes the song hard to pull apart and I guess kind of makes sense of and really enjoy the tambour and the tone and just kind of the personality of the instrumentation because the song is just pressed down to be so dense and so impenetrable that it loses flavor pretty quickly which is a pretty sad thing because again there are some songs here that I don't really think are that bad like the track Reapers the really heavy ominous ending on this track and the weird robotic vocal manipulation is thrown into the background seem like pretty nice additions as well and uses symphonic and operatic influences come back in the second half this LP where I think some of the instrumentation the composition gets a little bit more ambitious I love the bustling and driving guitar chords and the chord progression on the song the handler the way the rhythm sort of grooves on this track I think is the most finesse the band has shown thus far on this record and the very meaty chunky riffs on this track seem a lot more balanced in respect to the rest of the instrumentation on the track and actually makes the political intentions in the lyrics on this song a little more intelligible and on the song defector we get a bit of a rock opera track that seems very Queen inspired and I like it but the crown jewel of this album's final moments is easily the 10-minute song the globalist which Muse has written long tracks before that I've enjoyed but maybe this is one of my least favorites of theirs when it comes to this length the track kicks off with this kind of off whistling over this very sound track where the instrumentation the song essentially feels like just another one of muses tireless efforts as of late to just puff their music up to sound bigger more epic more grandiose and the instrumentation goes completely ridiculous when these huge blaring guitars kind of pop in to just pick up the pace of things and then when the song's final crescendo crests and I'm looking at the fact that we are more than halfway into the song at this point the track hasn't even justified its length yet at this point and redemption isn't exactly found in the piano ballad and passage that this crescendo coasts into and the fake intimacy of the multitrack vocal harmonies on the acapella outro of this LP just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and just leaves me with a I guess pretty negative final impression while I think drones brought better writing to the table then the second lauded I think this album is just sort of held back by the fact that the band is constantly trying to sound as big and as booming as possible on a lot of these cuts and the result isn't really that exciting most of the time or I guess adrenaline pumping or epic or grand or just anything else that I that I get that this music is is trying to you know sort of communicate to me in terms of its size and its presentation at its urgency for as loud as it sounds I think a lot of the time the drums and the guitars and the sense and the vocals are just produced in such a way where they are way too sanitized to feel as aggressive and as urgent as I think they're trying to be but again simultaneously this album is much less excruciating of a lesson than the second law at the end of the day I really feeling kind of indifferent on this album I'm feeling a decent of strong five on it transition if you've given this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Muse drones forever 
iUnCdrJFfy0,[Music] still we're gonna bring it back just be patient hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sun Kil moon record universal themes Sun Kil moon is the singer-songwriter project of one mr. Marc kozilek who had a pretty fantastic 2014 with the release of the album Benji a record which I believe was his sixth Under the Sun Kil moon name and has essentially brought his very lengthy career it's second or third wind and Mark is now taking advantage of that wind by releasing this new LP over here just about a year after Benji but with universal themes it doesn't really sound like Marc is trying to give us another Benji even though this new LP does have commonalities with his last album which was a series of fantastically written songs which came off sort of like these casual laid-back stories with a lot of very morbid and sad themes and I guess universal themes is building off of Benji in that we get a series of tracks that sound even casual ER on universal themes kozilek doesn't really seem obsessed with his own mortality the mortality of his loved ones really what we're kind of getting is a peek into the everyday life of mr. Casablancas and that everyday life involves performing seeing friends perform travelling firing bandmates relaxing and watching HBO spitefully responding to detractors and there's also the opening track on here where Mark sort of seems to be focusing on the last moments of a possum that he sees sort of fatally injured with so many mundane details weaved into the stories of these tracks the songs can get kind of lengthy I mean you know you're getting seven eight nine ten minute songs one after another on this LP and there are some almost unpredictable musical shifts in a lot of these songs as well some of which don't really make that much sense from a compositional standpoint but the reason that maybe these sudden shifts in tempo or melody occur might be a little clearer to you if you just pay closer attention to the lyrics usually what occurs on this record is that the music is really just kind of enhancing the storyline or highlighting some kind of shift in emotion or place or focus kind of like on the song the possum where right after the mention of church bells after the possums death we kind of get this very pretty guitar interlude or we have the guitars and the drums going a little harder as well as Mark kozilek screaming his brains out on the verse of that song where he is describing experiencing the God flesh concert so there is most certainly flow to the songs and the narratives on this record but the tracks often obsess over these really minor details get bogged down in them to the point where it's kind of hard to see whatever the bigger picture point of these songs are sometimes I would even argue there isn't really that strong of a point to go back to the song the possum again I mean you do have the song starting to focus on this possum and it's very likely death later in the song but then this narrative is sort of derailed in favor of talking about this God flesh concert and then kind of settling down and relaxing and watching TV at the end of the day and maybe sort of the point of that is to sort of show that even though this thing's death is right around the corner life just kind of continues to go on at least that's how the song reads to me but still even even then I kind of feel like I'm stretching to pull meaning out of this track again I I think the point of a lot of these songs is to not really have that strong of a point and in that respect I actually think this record is kind of experimental I often think a lot of singer-songwriter music is sort of interpreted or portrayed as being way more often and organic and true-to-life than it really is at the end of the day I mean what a lot of singer songwriters are doing are giving us these romanticized or exaggerated or abridged moments of real life set to music what mark kozilek is giving us on this record is you know as much as he can pretty much every unimportant detail within a particular situation Marc spares no details on this record as little tidbits of like a run-in with Jane Fonda and a conversation with her as well as a bit of an exchange with an Indian gas station worker are peppered into narratives that don't really have anything to do with these two moments they are just kind of little detours that occur within the larger picture which i think is where the title of this album comes in universal themes I mean each little section of each song on this album is kind of a point in time a theme a moment and they are universal in that it feels like Mark is just trying to shove every single thing that you can think of into these songs I mean we're talking about just comprehensive accounts of everything that happened between whenever the song starts and whenever the song ends and this lyrical approach is used on pretty much every single track here like birds of films the next track on here where Mark is singing or talking about because there's quite a bit of I guess spoken word over music in the background on this album just kind of working on a movie set where he says in the song I guess he's playing himself and the music on this track it's not terrible but I guess in a sense it's kind of forgettable because it just seems like it's a bit of a side dish or just a background element for mark to just kind of tell a story over it and not necessarily a riveting one at that however there are sonic elements to this track that I think are nice like the numerous layers of fluttering acoustic guitars that kind of bring the song from one section to another as Marc kind of I don't know introduces us to little bits of information like it's been six to eight weeks since he's had iced tea or something the song with a sort of grace know that brings the record to its first big momentous sonic change in that we're getting some strong drumming here and some electric guitars as well and kozilek is aggressively shouting the song's lyrics over this instrumentation and I mean it's a welcome change of pace just to kind of hear something a little bit more upbeat and aggressive but I don't really care for the sound of this track I mean I think the drums and the guitars are recorded a little shoddily it sounds kind of demo ish and mark kozilek shouting doesn't really sound that great and kind of makes the lyrics on this track unintelligible at some points and again just the performance here though just the cracking of his voice and just kind of the the monstrosity that is kozilek trying to scream his vocals just does not go over that well I think a lot on this track musically and lyrically gets a little lost in translation and this isn't the only song that goes aggressive and goes electric on this record we have the track alley slash thanks to where the yell P vocals and the vocal melody as well as the electric guitars which had kind of a twang to them make this track kind of feel like an early Modest Mouse demo and not a particularly good one this was maybe the only track on the record that once it began I just could not wait for it to end and I kind of get a Modest Mouse vibe as well during some of the vocal passages on the closing track - here - yeah - still on the closing track here I think this album dishes out some of its most interesting stories kind of talking about mark in Sweden touring going through a series of just dramatic events but titling the track after this one moment where he meets somebody who works at a gas station which I think highlights again the point and the message of this album just to kind of focus on these otherwise uninteresting moments in situations also in the track listing here I do enjoy the incredible reality check on the song Crimea River Williamsburg sleeve tattoo blues which is not only a hilarious song title but a hilarious song where I think mark is directly taking a shot at everybody who has been talking about him writing think pieces about him over the past year online over his kind of aggressive and offensive stage banter mark essentially responds to people decrying him as being toxic and problematic and horrible by bringing up all of these life experiences from himself from other people things he's seen that are actually like truly horrible I mean you know you're not really gonna be mark kozilek at the depressing game because he's always going to be more depressing and the refrain on this track is actually kind of catchy despite being so bulky and I like the guitar melodies on here too it's one of the few tracks in the track listing here that actually feels pretty focused it's a I guess in a sense a bit of a part too to the war on drugs suck my but even though I do like this song it does highlight a few issues number one how easily music journalists can be trolled by a grumpy old Red House painter and two how easily Mark kozilek can get kind of unfocused on what makes Sun Kil moon good and just get bogged down in tedious squabbling with his detractors I mean it's it's so easy to offend those whose buttons can easily be pushed I mean there's really no challenge in it it's kind of like just shooting fish in a barrel so why mark continues to do it I'm not totally sure because at least you know for me as an outsider who just enjoys music it hasn't really you know led to an entertaining album here as far as what this album is doing at its core with universal themes I most certainly get it and again I think it's a novel and pretty experimental idea but I think this album ends up suffering musically because of it because the songs the melodies just the background instrumentation is so much less interesting than it was on Benjy but really this LP I guess what wrecked it for me were kind of the more aggressive and electric tracks I mean as a result of going down this road this album does dish out at least several lackluster songs and with there just being a very lengthy tracks in the tracklist here mark really put all of his eggs in too few baskets by their just being so few songs here and many of them just being extended far beyond the point of interesting I'm feeling a light 2d6 on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantana Sun Kil moon forever 
2fa2GpSFAJ4,give him back give him back you bastard hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jamie xx record in color yeah Jamie xx uk-based producer mostly known for his role in the XX the indie tronic in the pop dream pop outfit and on this LP he is keeping that xx dream alive with a few collaborative appearances with his fellow band mates but Jamie has actually seen you know a little bit of success with solo work whether it be some single tracks or the relatively well-received Gil scott-heron remixes he did several years ago he also had a recent collaboration with young thug on the track good times and that was pretty hot good damn but now Jamie xx is really stepping out with a full-length LP of solo material some of which we have heard from some previous single releases but Jamie didn't give too much away up to the release of this LP stylistically on this album Jamie is jumping into a series of very stylish smooth atmospheric and reverb e-house tracks with some UK bass and future garage undertones the kind of music that simultaneously pleases anybody easily drawn toward atmospheric nondescript dance music and pisses off people who hate music that sounds like it might get play at Urban Outfitters and I will concede this record is not overly progressive experimental or deep but I don't really see you know disclosure or Crystal Castles is that deep or progressive or anything like that and I like them I just kind of see this LP is some nice catchy well produced dance music with a artsy sort of creative somewhat left-field flair as far as the sounds and the textures and the choppy rhythms go as well as the creative use of vocal samples which you will catch on the opening track here gosh on which the vocal samples all over this track just kind of peppered into it really add a lot of character to the very deep resonant bass the very pretty lead melody and the choppy rhythm riding throughout the track and the sort of growing wall of synthesizers on this song kind of leaves it off feeling like a pretty climactic introduction to the album the track sleep sound has a very smooth house beat to it some more warm bass and all of these twinkly little keyboards cascading over one another creating you know some very intricate in pretty layers it's serene it's pretty and the track kind of glides into the next song as if I'm listening to a DJ set and this song seesaw instrumentally it's one of my favorite tracks on here especially loved the the the melody on this thing how to describe it I mean it's it's it's a melody that I love but it but it's just very jumpy very bouncy but I'm not really too crazy on Romy's vocal Romeo bxx her vocal appearance on this track her voice is so buried in the mix and if there's anything that really kind of gets my goat about the XX it's their drab passionless understated vocals and they just essentially appear here but I wouldn't say this vocal appearance ruins this track entirely it's still passable however the vocals on stranger in a room which come from Oliver of the XX are very unlikable and really just do nothing for me whatsoever probably my least favorite track in the track listing here however I do find Romy's vocals on loud places to be a little bit better they are closer in the mix she seems a little bit more I guess tangible and her lyrics on the song are kind of a saving grace I mean talking about trying to find people to be quiet or romantically involved with in loud places it's a funny little you know ironic observation and I love the beat on this thing great dance rhythm and it kind of feels like the the bass might be mimicking a baseline from an older disco tune as well as the vocals that are sampled throughout this track again if Jamie does anything fantastically on this album and something I wish he did more of it's just grabbing weird quirky vocal samples that you wouldn't typically assume would be in this style of music and just working them into it so well I love the young thug track in the track listing here too not only because of the vocal sampling but I think young thug's appearance his performance is actually pretty great it's it's a very catchy awesome banger and while it does kind of stick out in the track listing here as being a bit of a sore thumb this is the kind of off-the-wall unexpected experimentation that I wish this album did more of my least favorite parts in the track listing here are the shorter moments the track or two that kind of rises to a climax and then just instantly finishes a lot like the intro track but why is the track doing this kind of in the middle of the track listing and the songs in the middle of the record that just kind of feel like an xx track remixed by somebody else who's doing a bit of a house future garage thing the riskier and the more hard-hitting tracks in the track listing here are my favourites and thankfully there are enough of those to keep me relatively satisfied the finishing two tracks in the track listing here are pretty fantastic as well the rest is noise is incredibly overwhelming but colourful and the finisher is really blissful and pretty i think jamie has a lot of potential when it comes to producing solo and I hope that this new album over here even though I'm not totally head over heels for it gives way to another solo album very very soon I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this record listen what did you think of it did you loved it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Jamie xx forever 
f8Cl5FgMsKY,it's like the green screen is just giving way to this this portal to Hell maybe if we can somehow travel into it we can just get the daemon save couch esta hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new oh C's record mutilator defeated at last neo psyche and garage rock band the OCS and this is their one millionth album and they are masterminded by songwriter guitarist singer castle face records co-founder John Dwyer garage rock lo-fi garage punk psych rock whatever you want to call it even though the OCS had a pretty deranged and fun and unique approach to these genres in the late 2000s with records like the Masters bedroom with more albums in their discography as well as the growing trendiness of lo-fi garage rock psych Rock and garage punk their music just started to sound less and less novel and exciting to me not only that but a lot of the songs on their subsequent records didn't really feel like songs as much as they were just in the moment jams which isn't necessarily a bad thing because I love grooves I love just kinetic energy between band members but the lack of variation in the o'seas playing style compiled with the fuzzy brittle production the very varied vocals at least for me were kind of leading to this increasingly one-dimensional sound and catalogue now psy listicle II this new record from the OCS has a lot of the same characteristics as their recent records but if anything is noticeable it's that the production is a little better just kind of more fidelity just clearer there is resonant an audible bass on this album the drums are pretty clear and upfront to now clear does not necessarily mean squeaky-clean though because they're still blaring distorted guitars all over this LP the bass lines just hit real hard the drums are booming and the vocals are still you know kind of smudged but they are louder and they are just drenched in the psychedelic / well eko and the performances on this LP are pretty wild for the most part very aggressive very cacophonous and some of the tracks in the track listing here feature just these very propulsive rhythms and hulking walls of noisy psyche rock sound the opening track on this LP web features easily one of the best bass lines I've heard in an OC song in a while in the track listing here we also have the very relentless track withered hand which kind of sounds like this punked-out motorcycle rock like Steppenwolf on coke although Steppenwolf might have been on coke when they were you know doing those songs and I also think this LP is one of the o'seas more diverse records in a while because there are some tracks that take a noticeably softer approach like the tracks sticky Hulk's which features these very ominous keyboards all over the track which feel a little Jefferson Airplane inspired or the incredibly moody closing track on here or the song Holy Smoke which features these acoustic guitar arpeggios it's an instrumental and it goes down kind of a folky Road however these tracks are kind of mild and they're not really my favorites in the track listing here they're really only highlights because they just divert from the more aggressive tracks on this album and there's also more aggressive tracks like loop pi PI pi PI inácio area as well as poor Queen that while they are hard hitting in a sense they don't really measure up to the intensity of the other cuts here that are loud and blaring overall this is a pretty decent record for the OCS though if you are a hardcore o'seas fan I could see you feeling like it's one of their best it is really loud it is really heavy the OCS make some minor tweaks to their production on this LP and it makes a world of difference in a lot of ways but I still do think they are a little OneNote on the songwriting front and there are tracks like I said that are just more aggressive but they feel kind of redundant because they just pale in comparison to some of the songs the album kicks off with and while I appreciate and enjoy the softer more acoustic detours the band takes on the album it might be another record before I think these more subtle tracks are measuring up quality wise to the more I guess overwhelming cuts that I think are fantastic I'm feeling a decent strong six on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana the OCS forever 
8V0L9Sv18TE,his sacred zone this was his zone his sacred zone this was his zone his sacred zone this was his zone his sacred zone this was his zone his sacred zone this was his zone his sacred zone this was his zone his sacred zone hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Algiers record its self-titled old al cheers it lanta Georgia band recent Matador Records Sinese and this is their debut full-length LP and going into this LP I didn't really know that much about them outside of that I really liked the teaser tracks the band was dropping up hang up hang up in blood black eunuch but she was not flying tracks that featured a strangely satisfying mix of post-punk industrial just a touch of maybe noise rock and goth rock as well as blues music and gospel to all over this LP there are drum machines very shrill reverb cutting guitars warm bass and vocals that are kind of rough around the edges and freakish but also have like a very soulful quality to them or sort of an old Southern Baptist choral group charm these seemingly different worlds are combined on this record Algiers essentially finds a lot of or really makes a lot of fantastic creative common ground between the genres and the results are pretty riveting and chilling for some I guess modern comparisons you might dig this record if you're in the Ice Age or maybe savages or maybe even a little bit of Willis Earle Beale if you loved his just really over-the-top very pronounced bluesy vocal style I think you're going to get down with the singing here but as far as older comparisons people who might be into screamin Jay Hawkins or a little bit of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Bauhaus Tom Waits Leadbelly and Joy Division I think might find some interesting things in this record too so going into this LP I already knew I had great singles and so the question after that once it's released is does the album deliver and the answer to that is yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes frontman Franklin James Fischer's hollers and howls matched the kind of chaotic and cavernous and and tortured production on this record perfectly there are a few moments on this LP especially on the more toned-down tracks where his gospel influence singing style feels like a just a little bit of a put-on which might have something to do with the fact that his singing is kind of rough around the edges but kind of in a you know a self-aware Punk way still though even the softer and subtler tracks in the tracklisting here like blood and games bring some incredibly dark and disturbing lyrics some of which sort of reflect on the current state of racism and violence in society today I mean really sort of observing what's been going on you know in places like Ferguson as well as Baltimore there are a few places I read where Algiers have kind of build themselves as a bit of a protest band and in a sense you know they do live up to that label I also love the song and when you fall in the tracklisting here with the swirls of echo all over this track the fiery vocals the noisy guitars in the drum machine this track sounds like Heaven and Hell at the same time for the song iron utility pretext which is maybe one of the stranger tracks on the track listing here instrumentally because it has this busy bustling drum machine that sounds like it's straight out of the late 80s early 90s like it's supposed to be backing some EBM music you know electric body music not EDM EBM and there's this really really familiar synth hit that pops up in the song repeatedly that you might also remember similar sin theta may be the same synth it from Afrika Bambaataa and the soul sonic force is planet Rock seems like a pretty conscious reference and the song old girl of I never thought post-punk and soul music could be fused so wonderfully in in 2015 and the song black eunuch is one of the more aggressive tracks in the track listing here and has some of the most detailed production just new little bits of instrumentation are constantly popping in and popping out there's some strange hard panning of some of this instrumentation in the left channel and the right channel it's just a really I guess overwhelming track as far as the writing and just the way the instrumentation is assembled and even with all this detail and all the studio trickery the raw percussion and the handclaps and the hollering vocals just feels really low Phi and in the moment and organic and the track but she was not flying is a highlight for me because of sort of what I mentioned earlier the politically charged or socially aware lyrics littered all over this album that are most definitely worth reading into I think the one downside of this LP is that the intro track seems to kind of just I guess a drag on a little too long and it has a bit of an unsatisfying ending to it and the untitled closure just kind of seems like a long-winded sample of another song I feel like the band while it is a pretty track I just feel like the band could have ended the record just a little more strongly but still is as far as music in this style and you know as far as post-punk I guess I'm going to say this is one of the most interesting breakout bands in a while but simply calling them a post-punk group would be a bit of a disservice because I've never quite heard any band in this style fuse these genres together and do it so well this LP is great loving it back to front for the most part but I still think you know Algiers has some hidden potential that they're not fully exposing to us that I think might come out in future records and I'm feeling a like a decent 8 on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino Algiers forever 
XuGxAHOUyIw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I have some pretty exciting news right now so right here in my hand I hold legal documentation of the record contract that couchy chests aside that landed him in hell and now we are essentially going to take a look at it and just kind of try to see if we can find a loophole to break Cowell out of hell something about this deal has to have gone awry Cal yes why did you sign this it says you go to hell on it damn it Cal you're gonna be stuck in there forever so mad at you right now hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Donnie trumpet and the social experiment album surf Donnie trumpet and the social experiment is a musical group hailing from Chicago Illinois and musically the band mixes together hip hop and jazz and soul among some other things and they feature a multitude of producers on this album but at their core we are seeing in this group mr. chance the rapper mr. Nate Foxx mr. Peter Cottontail mr. Jeff giddy mr. Gregg llanfair jr. and of course Donnie trumpet himself formerly of the band kids these days who are now defunct and they mixed together a similar blend of genres although I would say they were a little bit more aggressive on those horns and the guitar distortion I admit that I was never really big kids these days fan and at first I wasn't hugely excited about Donnie trumpet and the social experiment because it kind of seemed like a slight revision of that formula however I heard that that wonderful single Sunday candy which is a fantastic song and has a sound that I was hoping hear more songs like on this full-length album plus I guess another exciting thing about the release of this record is that it would be a chance to hear chance the rapper on another full-length because since the release of acid rap he's been a little quiet on that front however this is not a chance the rapper album I see so many people across the internet hyping this record up and billing it as if it is such it's not though not to say the chance doesn't contribute and that he's not part of the group I mean he plays an integral role on this record and has numerous appearances across the length of this album if you love chances singing if you love his rapping you will most likely find a lot to like about this record because he's all over it all I'm saying is that Donnie trumpet is you know sort of a huge creative force on this record and his role cannot be understated now that being said considering all the live jazzy and and neo-soul styled instrumentation together with the fantastic list of collaborators on this record all of whom were not listed when this album was released for free on iTunes just the other day so fans listening to the record kind of had to figure out for themselves who exactly appeared on it so as I'm trying to say considering the collaborators on this record Donnie trumpets compositional chops as well as the live jazz and neo soul instrumentation how could this record miss I don't know but it it it it does this record has star power it has wonderful musical influences a multitude of instrumentation but it lacks so hard in the performance and the production department there are multiple audible vocal flubs in the singing on this LP especially from chance the rapper who isn't a fantastic singer though he does make the effort to sing a lot in his music although I am glad that his just ever grading ad-libs don't make that many appearances here then we also have the vocal mixing on this record the vocals on this album are very muddy and that becomes even more apparent as they are multi-tracked trying to harmonize on top of one another I feel like I'm listening to vocals mixed for a podcast not like for a musical album and then we also have the matter of the instrumental mixing on this album the live drums are pretty quiet but the synthetic drums the the beats that feel like they are worked in in post are incredibly loud the horns are really super thin and kind of dull and don't have that much body in this lackluster production this lackluster mixing leads to a lot of tracks sounding way less vibrant than you would imagine a track would sound that has such a wide array of instrumentation on it this leaves a lot of the instrumental interludes or the instrumental moments on this record or maybe the more soft and subtle moments leaving a lot to be desired like on the end of the song just wait or the song nothing came to me or the song something came to me or the song miracle which doesn't really have the color and the fidelity in the in the room sonically to impress with just how beautiful and intricate the instrumentation here is trying to be needless to say because of this mixing and because of the production a lot of the incredibly short tracks here and again the instrumental tracks just kind of sound like uninteresting detours as far as the more upbeat moments they are kind of just like a messily orchestrated jubilee where we have questionable vocal performances like on the song slip slide slip side kudos on the Busta Rhymes feature though that was a little nice after that we have the kind of patronizing want to be cool which has this kind of well intentioned be yourself message but chance the rapper and the guests on this track for the most part with the exception of the last verse here kind of show this weird ignorant exactly to how coolness works I mean people certainly vie for coolness and they try to be cool but other people kind of in Mass have to decide whether or not you're cool in order for it to actually be so and you not wanting to be cool or saying you're not cool or sort of turning coolness down doesn't really change that in fact it usually ends up having the opposite effect being a cool popular person and sort of rejecting coolness usually causes more people to think hey you know what that guy he's cool it's a nice message it's sweet hey guys you don't got to be cool just be yourself it is a little corny though but if there is one thing this track highlights it's that this record has a lot of good features I mean not just you know good features in name but when the guests on this album are sort of given the room to shine and are given an interesting song topic they really take the opportunity to deliver a great feature even Big Sean's verse on this record isn't too bad stays on topic and is a cute little personal story about you know sort of reaching for coolness quavo of migos appears on the track familiar and he actually fits into the melodic framework of that track really nicely Jay Cole has a really great verse on here I'm surprised to see Badu's name but she's kind of a unique situation on this record while I think her singing on the back end of this LP is good as soon as she kind of appears and her feature really gets going the song kind of ends a bit of an example of just not making the best use of the people you've brought on to the album so again there is a lot of star power on this album and there are also tracks that seem to overcome the muddy flat production and stand very tall on the merits of good songwriting like Sunday candy which is this fusion of pop music church music and gospel as well as hip hop and it's a bit of a lyrical tribute to chances childhood and his grandmother it's actually really beautiful and moving a lot like the track cocoa butter kisses on his acid rap mixtape really funny observant and personal and the music on this track is just so pretty vibrant I loved the lead melody as well I like the song windows too which is a bit of a warning to someone who might be interested in chance the rapper sort of may be playing himself or a character a bit of an emotional moment saying you know I'm kind of a damaged person I'm not to be trusted I'm not a trustworthy person just stay clear of me it's a genuinely sad moment however the songwriting appeal is not one that this album keeps up for for very many tracks because as soon as the song go hits with the bassline the beat in the verse I think to myself that didn't Estelle do this better with American boy with Kanye West it just feels like an eerily similar song in vibe to me and not only that but at the two-minute mark it's just a vocal train wreck I just can't stress this enough there are a lot of moments on this LP where the performances on the vocal side and the production is so horrific aliy off point that it just should have not been I just feel like this album had so much more potential than it did it's not like the music on this record is is so horrible that I can't stand it it just kind of feels like I'm listening to something that a band might have pulled together recording themselves as a bit of a blueprint or a demo to then take to the studio saying that okay this is what we want to do musically and compositionally we have that down we just need to make it sound good and punchy and clear and just you know mixed well no where are these production shortcomings more disappointing than on the song something came to me which has these synthetic beats that are driving our way way way way way louder than the distant incredibly thin and quiet horns featured on the track you kind of turn the track down so that the beat isn't too loud and it just kind of sounds like background music you turn it up in order to really hear what the horns are doing and the beat is so loud that it's like excruciating the closing track on here has a funny message or sort of turn of phrase with it where it's talking about vibes but also simultaneously talking about a vibraphone which is one of my favorite instruments but it's yet another track in the track listening here that ends kind of short and just leaves me wanting way more even if the track is kind of charming maybe some people are going to be pissed off at this comparison but I don't really care this album reminds me quite a bit of to pimp a butterfly that came out earlier this year and really in style because this album brings together elements some neo-soul of jazz of hip-hop there is also live instrumentation on this record as well there are a lot of lyrical themes of self-love self-improvement love hardship there is a lot of positivity on this record too but the lackluster production mixing and performances and the occasionally abruptly ending songs all of these things leave this album sitting on almost the opposite side of the likability spectrum just listen to the song something that I want the vocals on this tracker audibly peaking in a very ugly unpleasant way sounds like somebody's bad demo again there's some great features on this LP there are a handful of standout tracks but for the most part the amount of potential this album had versus how much of it it actually capitalized on the difference is pretty aggravating in my opinion I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if so did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it epic ain't a no Donnie trumpet and the social experiment surf forever 
615xR8TVbn4,new theny shirt tan oh here the internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new unknown Mortal Orchestra record multi Love unknown moral or past wrong what don't we know Oh cat couch esta it's not the same all right get back back unknown Mortal orchestra is a band currently that I believe hails from Portland Oregon's is their third full-length LP they play a bit of psychedelic rock and pop and in the past I've had my reservations about their music like with the band's debut record which to me had some pretty I guess skeletal half-baked songs on it some weirdly mixed instrumentation and these very booming crispy drums but the band really came through on their sophomore record to where the keys and the guitar work on this LP were much more impressive in the previous album and I would say a lot of the songs on this LP were pretty refined melodically as well some very interesting instrumental passages on this thing and on the cell P I think unknown Mortal orchestras quirky production style really started to work in their favor as their songs were kind of sounding like these quirky unearth demos of fantastic little b-side songs from the 60s and 70s kind of these just lost gems or relics there were a few kind of generic garage rock spots in this LP but going into this new album over here I pretty much just came into it hoping that unknown Mortal Orchestra would continue down that more lush colorful musically melodic but also a very textured road I mean just kind of this place where great psych pop and rock meet with just some creative and weird off-the-wall idiosyncratic production and that's pretty much what I got I mean on multi love the the band really kind of held it on the garage rock and instead went down a road of top and soul as well as funk fusing that together with the psyche rock influences that pop up in their music already unknown Mortal orchestra definitely sounds kind of old school and vintage on this album but their strange production just leaves them sounding kind of new and and modern from the very end crisp drums which a lot of the time kind of sound like hip-hop break beats or something like that to the vocals which are really kind of raspy and quiet hushed like a ghostly kind of like I'm listening to a em Ward from another dimension or something like that and these vocals and drums take up a lot of room in the mix and the keyboards and the guitars and the bass just somehow get just squeezed just crushed and smothered in the middle there somewhere it's some really strange production that I don't think everybody is is going to dig but what I like about this album is that unknown mortal Orchestra are kind of taking the past and they are manipulating it and warping it in a really enjoyable and artistic way sort of like bands such as foxes Anor artists such as Ariel pink have done already and like the cover are on this LP the music itself sounds like this smudgy overexposed picture from several decades ago with an Instagram filter thrown on it for you know that kind of contemporary Flair and another thing that the cover art tells us about this album is that this record really is about kind of studio trickery and tinkering it sounds like more than ever unknown mortal Orchestra really kind of worked on making this record sound a certain way and honing the the tone and the mix and the EQ of every single sound and this thing to get it to sound so enjoyably warped I loved the rickety lo-fi disco soul feel of the song can't keep checking my phone the very regal and and melodic Keys that kick off the title track on this album no T lobe the vocal breakdown on this track with the handclaps kind of sounds like something that could have been worked into an EDM song or something like that you know given that had different production in the background just writing wise it kind of feels like um oh is is pulling from from that sound and it works out really well the song like acid rain is an overwhelmingly fun and punchy track kind of like Candyland psyckadeli uh relief fantastic synth line or guitar line on this thing you know sometimes just stuff is manipulated and it's squeezed and squished to the point where it's kind of hard to tell what instrument might be making a certain melody or something the world is crowded just another killer refrain and song here as well my issue with this LP though is that maybe there are a couple cuts that are a little bit too subdued instrumentally and in vocally and and the lo-fi production kind of leaves it feeling like a bit of a demo rather than a fully finished song and then there's also the song stage or screen which isn't too bad of a track but suddenly the song just ends and gives way to this sort of wall of synthesizers that feels like I don't know a bit of a cop-out and given that there are so few songs in the track listing here I don't really think you mo gave themselves that much wiggle room to sort of do weird stuff like that because you're essentially trading out an opportunity to just deliver a great tune to kind of just veer into this blah we're gonna do this now the closing track on this help he leaves this album feeling strong though it has a lot of bite blaring guitars I would say very hard rocking which is kind of a change of pace for this LP at the very end you know there weren't a whole lot of tracks in the tracklisting year that that hit so hard and hit so aggressively rather this album wins me over at least with just a lot of smooth wonderful melodies and and great grooves and just kind of quirky production uh I got to say um oh really did it on this one I think they came through with their most interesting and enjoyable album yet some of their best songs thus far and the best production I've heard on their records thus far and I think you know that this record interestingly sort of in a way displays that opinion or maybe displays that narrative as well by sort of showing this you know newly assembled studio that this album was created with along with the two previous records sitting in the background like this record you know is here because those two records were there and things are sort of moving in this you know linear fashion for the band and you know that's that's great you know it's a good record very good record so you know feeling a strong 7-2 a light eight on this thing transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana unknown Mortal orchestra forever 
Yx9J4diol8s,come on me save Cal don't miss me don't miss me no I don't miss you what would what would make you say that hi everyone Jetta Neil AG tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new ASAP rocky record at long last ASAP let's go ASAP Rocky is a New York rapper head of the ASAP mob a rapper who came up in the game several years ago off of the back of some pretty fantastic singles that would be key tracks on his forthcoming mixtape Live Love ASAP and this mixtape put rocky at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic and dreamy world of cloud rap and even though rocky sounds were most definitely vast and very open he also threw some pop rap and some southern hip hop influences in there as well and a lot of drug talk as well to sort of enhance the very trippy vibe of the instrumentals still today I think it's a great tape even though in a way it does sound a little bit dated because there is so much lush heavy vast production out there right now and this tape did essentially lift rocky off into the mainstream and even though his big commercial debut LP long live ASAP did have some pretty horrific cuts on it like fashion killa rocky did prove that he could take his production style his lyrical style and translate it to a mainstream audience and create some radio smashes in the process like Goldie and fucking problems it's no secret at this point that Rocky is not the most lyrical rapper he's not the most technical rapper he probably will never be but he has continually shown that he has this knack for writing these immediate pop rap tunes with the sort of creative artsy Flair and all I could have really hoped for going into this LP is that he just continues to do that consistently although maybe the title did kind of tip me off to something maybe a little bit more ambitious the title at long last ASAP sort of says to me that maybe this is the ASAP Rocky that that ASAP Rocky thinks we've been waiting for or maybe the the ASAP Rocky has been trying to give us the whole time and I do get the feeling that Rocky was going for something larger on this album but instead of getting a kind of catchy immediate just enjoyable to the point rap record instead I think we're getting a long winded mess with some hits and a lot of incredible misses the project starts off well enough though with the track Holy Ghost which has these huge fantastic chorus vocals very gospel theme holy goes a lot of religious themes and the lyrics and rocky comes off pretty impassioned in his delivery the gargantuan size of it reminds me a lot of the first track off of Live Love ASAP it's just a really fantastic start to the record really sets the tone and the very cloudy and lethargic Canal Street isn't too bad either one of the best hooks on the entire record and Bones appearance on this track is not only surprising but pretty good and Rocky's flow is catchy he's charismatic he's got a lot of braggadocio on this track which again is fine but the quality of this project drops off immediately as soon as we hit the song fine wine Rocky's down pitched vocals not only sound stiff but completely boring against the incredibly hollow instrumental on this track and then as we go deeper into the song we have two awful features from m.i.a and from future two of the most half-baked features I've heard on a rap record in a while especially from m.i.a did she even write this thing tell your new bitch to go suck a dick tell your new bitch to the suck a dick tell your new bitch to go suck a dick I would actually say with only a few exceptions of being schoolboy q UGK Juicy J this records feature list while it is impressive doesn't really deliver that much quality even people like yes and Bay or mos def don't really come that hard and where's ASAP ferg where is Ferg Kanye West's verse on the album isn't too bad either the best advices no advice especially when it's your advice he has some funny and interesting terms of phrase even though I'm not crazy about the singing I think the big issue with the features on this record that they're mistreated and and I don't know if Rakhi really guided the process of bringing these people on the record or anything like that that that some of the features on this record just pop in without any rhyme or reason whatsoever like Mis and like Kanye's right at the tail end of the track where he appears it's like you know no real presentation to having these people on these songs going deeper into the track listing here we have the song LSD which is a horrible single it's a terrible song not only is the singing on this track awful but the message and just the theme of the song is so freakin patronizing it's like Rocky is trying as hard as possible just to say to you hey man doesn't this sound like drugs isn't this a druggie song and a song about LSD isn't necessarily a bad thing it's just that that's all I get out of this track because the instrumental is incredibly forgettable I mean if the lyrics are everything was kind of gone it would just be a lackluster beat and then on top of it we have a lack of interesting lyrics and rocky singing is so boring and if there's one more theme that runs throughout this record like on LSD its lackluster writing I like instrumentals on this record like excuse me and on Lord pretty Flaco Jody but the lyrically half-baked choruses on this record are completely forgettable we even have the song JD which feels like a total non track and is shorter than the album's lone interlude toward the back end of the record why we needed an interlude there I don't know as far as Rocky's verses on this record he doesn't really have too much to say that he hasn't said already there are lyrical moments that do stand out though like on the song back home as well as on the intro track Holy Ghost I also loved the reference to the pot calling the kettle black on the song Canal Street that was one of the lyrically smarter moments on the LP but then we also have other spots where I don't know Rocky is just kind of bragging about people who are famous that he's had sex with whether it be Iggy Azalea or Rita Ora I mean you know I'm not 12 so I don't really care who Rocky is having sex with there's also that one line on this LP where rocky says that he visits nice like it's his sister's daughter talking about nice France we then get the Trax Max be far side and wavy bone which maybe make up the album's longest stretch of quality tracks the beats are trippy yet hard-hitting rocky feels way more hungry determined awake not just kind of lethargic or so high out of his mind that he can't keep it together because there are tracks on this record where he just feels kind of disconnected and unenthusiastic like on dreams and on the track max be this is where you will hear one of the many features of singer-songwriter Joe Fox on this record and while musically Joe's appearances aren't bad I don't know why most of them kind of had this distant loaf I badly recorded quality to them I think that what Joe is doing is is nice but when his appearances pop into the record they just kind of feel like loaf I just weird little detours as opposed to an explosive memorable fantastic course that keeps the momentum of the song going again on this record another instance of rocky just not making great use of his collaborators even on the song everyday which is easily the best single in the bunch here maybe it didn't have to be I mean we did have multiply a while back with Juicy J if that song had just a stronger hook and spent more time rapping than it did kind of in trowing or talking it could have been a fantastic single much better than Lorde pretty Flaco but having the Rod Stewart sample on this track as well as Miguel sing the same exact hook right after one another just seems kind of unnecessary and redundant and there are other tracks in the track listing here where we get more clumsily and badly sung hooks and choruses like on better things and Westside Highway we also have the song electric body which has one of the better beats on here and some decent verses too but then the chorus pops and it just turns to this generic shake that ass girl make that busy wit shake that ass yeah the song ends is OK and the little Wayne appearance sounds kind of weird there's something strange about Wayne's voice on this track that's kind of off-putting but with this track at this point the album is really only just barely surpassing the incredibly mediocre standard it's been setting for itself up till this point Rocky's previous albums had style they had aesthetic they had great instrumentals they had great songs on them this new record over here only has one third of that and it's the aesthetic part it has an aesthetic and that's it you know it sounds Pleasant in the background it sounds vast it sounds heavy it sounds Basie it sounds trippy for the most part the rapping is on point in terms of just tempo and and and flows but this record is not as deeply satisfying as Rocky's previous - it's not it's almost like he's completely lost his ability to write and deploy these skilled immediate catchy memorable pop rap songs again with that kind of artsy creative a little bit of a left-field flair this is a surprisingly uninteresting record for Rocky I think that maybe if a lot of the fat were cut in the track listing here it could have been a much better record but even then I think that the best songs on this album sort of stand in the shadow of Rocky's previous two projects as of right now I'm feeling a light five on this thing transition if you give this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana ASAP Rocky ala forever 
nPP1YYoNNAo,uh-huh got you again hi everyone um last video we'll be doing from the UH from the hotel where you know we're gonna be back at it with the next video your the best time for a review of the new hot ship record why makes sense Hot Chip is a uk-based synth-pop and alternative dance electronic music group they have been at it for many years now they have the albums to show for it I love a lot of their early stuff they came off recently of a couple pretty mild records but they really came back on their last full-length album their 2012 LP out of our heads even though this wasn't really uh that edgy or cutting of a record I think Hot Chip really came through with just some really great accessible memorable sticky pop songwriting with some very smooth colorful synthetic production and I don't know looking at this new LP I'm not really sure what I was expecting wasn't really anticipating any kind of big moves or changes from Hot Chip stylistically I guess I was just kind of hoping for a another good Hot Chip album but in fact Hot Chip actually does deliver a pretty significant change of pace on this record which is apparent right from the first few tracks hurrah chi-lites and love is the future not only do these songs have just driving beats behind them very influenced by house music which while Hot Chip does have some very strong electronic music influences in their music I can't say that they have embraced it so strongly here and usually there is a pretty strong song at the core of a Hot Chip track and not to say that isn't the the case with these two tracks here but it seems really that the the dance beats kind of take control a little bit and really propel the song really kind of become the main attractions of these tracks another thing that's kind of strange for these tracks are the just out of place vocal features actually if it wasn't for these features I think these would be fantastic songs from the giant over the top female vocals to the incredibly awkward just out of nowhere rap verse on unloved is the future the it's just it just does not complement Hot Chip style however many of the other characteristics of these tracks sound great especially the robotic craft work sort of Daft Punk like refrains on hurrah chi-lites again if it wasn't for these vocal features I think these two tracks would have kicked this album off to a great start for me Hot Chip has always had this kind of nerdy shy demeanor when it's come to electronic music since pop and dance music and I think that they don't really have the the swagger to kind of pull these vocal experiments experimental for them off even on the song started right which has these just very toned down talk sung vocals that seem kind of chromeo esque Hot Chip doesn't really have the kind of just sensuality or the charisma to pull such a thing off and for it to actually you know hey and I definitely get that desire that Hot Chip has to sort of change things up a little bit vocally on this album because vocals have never really been a strong point of hot chips not that they're awful awful awful but you know it's it's not like there's an incredible amount of vocal range on Hot Chip songs usually the vocals are you know pretty easy on the ears very shy like I was saying before about their music and their way of songwriting in general in comparison with most synth pop and alternative dance music and here I feel like they're just taking some vocal risks that don't really totally pay off either that or the vocals are so underwhelming and so reserved especially on the more just subtle tone down ballots here that I don't really think they convey that much emotion like on the track so much further to go or the lyrically questionable white wine and fried chicken I mean III guess in a sense this record does live up to its title because it feels like Hot Chip is making a smoother quieter more synthetic record with stronger house influences and some vocal experiments and risks that really don't make that much sense but I do admit that I did like what the band was doing on the song I need you now with the again that we had this return of these giant over-the-top female vocals I totally felt like this 90s or sort of early 2000s house jam but with a much subtler B and these kind of I guess I guess droney sort of walls of these swelling just pulsating synthesizers that reminded me quite a bit of John Hopkins last full-length LP songwriting wise it's good and I like the instrumental as well and there's some other highlights in the track listing for me here too I like the song Dark Knight this is another sort of more house influenced track here I like how Hot Chip when they're approaching house music it doesn't feel like they are just passionless Lee following a formula you know there's there's quite a bit of humanity and soul and I think vulnerability in sort of the the softer approach that Hot Chip takes so you know that there is that upside then there is the song cry for you which has a really kind of sweet little funky devilish groove that's fantastic and then easy to get really one of the better ballads Hot Chip has ever written I mean it does have a pretty strong dance beat but it's a bit of a tale of love or maybe even I guess just lust or wanting to be with somebody and the dance floor again one of hot chips better songs hands down and then there is the climactic closer on here which has these just layers and layers of synthesizers from these sort of walls of chords to these bubbling arpeggios and just a really sharp crisp booming drumbeat which actually makes this song stand out a little more energetically than a lot of other tracks on here and this track also features this huge ascending intense chord progression it's it's definitely one of the more vibrant moments on the LP PPU one of the more explosive moments on the LP and even though this record was a bit of a rocky road for me I mean it at least it and did strong so with this record I mean I'm kind of torn in a sense I am a hot ship fan but there were just some ideas and and risks they took on this album that I think didn't really pay off sounded silly fell out of place especially that that rap verse which again is is maybe one of the most unlikable decisions Hot Chip is made on a song in a long time and not that it was sort of inherently a bad idea to have a rap verse it's just that this particular rap verse not good if you're you're morbidly curious about it you know give it a try but the good then again I did like the way that the band approached house music and just had a more overtly electronic sound on this album I think that worked out well for them I just think maybe a third or maybe even a half of the other things that they sort of try on this record didn't really work out for them I think there are some decent songs in the track listing here but either they're kind of complemented with sort of bland unmemorable instrumentals here and there or again you know just some some vocal ideas that aren't that fantastic so you know it's it's it's like I'm faced with a record that isn't entirely bad but it isn't entirely great either even the songs that I I dislike the most at least had an element of something I think are great and even the songs that I love maybe I'm just not so head over heels for them that I think they're perfect so yeah you know really I'm feeling like a decent strong six on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yeah Anthony Phan tanto Hot Chip why make sense forever 
SraSpKzxl-M,hi everyone Tony Fontaine here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I've been spending my weekend here at primavera sound fantastic music festival and Barcelona Spain just following a lot of blogs around doing a lot of interning doing a lot of shadowing a lot of coffee carrying four bands PR people all that just trying to get my foot in the door of the music industry if you know somebody who over you know at a famous music magazine or a PR firm just give them my name really trying to get my foot in the door just please you know you'd be doing me a solid all right so anyway so yes it was my third and big final day of prima vera sound today I actually saw more artists than I did over the past few days although there are a few things that I didn't mention in the last few videos I mean I mean pretty much every artist that I mentioned in those videos I either saw their full set or I saw most of their set there are a bunch of artists over the course of this week who sets you know I kind of peruse through because you know you kind of had that option to try a lot of different stages over the course of the day and and and those artists that I was dying to see you know I really got down in front you know whereas if you know you kind of wait to see somebody you're gonna be stuck in the back so you know when I was kind of in that position I stuck around for a little while just kind of see what was going on and see how things were I saw a jungle set which actually was really decent from what I heard I liked them a lot more live than they were on record way more danceable and lively and I caught Sylvia Nesso as well and that was pretty great caught death from above 1979 their set was chaotic as hell just really noisy just really over-the-top caught a little bit of Dan Deacon tonight as well people were going insane for Dan Deacon like people are going am in front of that stage like his music was hyping people up so hard but um as far as the sets that I saw today where I pretty much caught the full set let's see let's start off at the beginning of the day I caught sleaford mods if you don't know this band I review them before while I didn't love their new record I think they are one of the most Punk things alive right now and I find their music entertaining aggressive hilarious and just kind of off the wall and I've seen videos of them playing live before so I kind of knew what to expect but still the energy was hilarious and over the top it was fantastic you know it was short it was just like a 20 or 15 minutes set or so they did like five songs was kind of disappointing that they said they had a new album coming out later this year later in the day I caught American football I went full emo caught American football they're back they're touring the set was great I mean you know they played the songs really well everybody in the crowd seemed to be really into it and for good reason you know the performances were really tight and yeah I mean they just really didn't miss a beat I mean if they end up coming out with a comeback record I mean that that'll that that would be interesting I mean could be good could be bad I don't know but as far as these comeback performances I mean they got it they got it going on speaking of people who still got it after American football I caught a little Tori Amos caught the little Tori Amos just blast from my past because back in the day my mom was jam in those Tori tapes and she played all the hits it was fantastic she had a she had a grand piano as well as a keyboard and she was kind of straddling the the the the piano bench and playing both the same time Tori was killing it Tori was  killing it she had so much energy so much presence she was very humble very down to earth on the stage and her singing voice was fantastic and her piano playing was great of course it was just a sort of solo performance and you know the songs went over really well however about a half an hour the performance I just got a little I didn't get there early so I was way far in the back and I got kind of tired of being there because there was so much talking you know just so much crowd commotion that it was actually kind of distracting and hard for me to really kind of focus on the on the set unfortunately I don't know if they were just like a lot of people hanging around because it was one of the biggest stages and it was midday and maybe people are just you know kind of relaxing or something like that you know and they're just kind of sitting for Anna Tori you know but obviously not everybody around was a die-hard because it seemed like you know most people around were kind of just commiserating and you know shooting the as opposed to you know kind of paying attention this immaculate performance if I had been closer I probably probably wouldn't have been as distracting but you know there was a serious just commotion going on with the crowd toward the back where I was that just made it hard to a you know concentrate on it so I decided to just kind of hop skip and jump away to the ATP stage to see I sewers ended neubauten of this fantastic German industrial and experimental music band who's been at it for decades and decades and decades they had a new record out this year haven't tried it yet it's I should I should I know and the performance was amazing I'm easily one of the most fun performances to watch and listen to as well I mean they had all guns blazing in terms of just stage at a tie you know they had the they had like industrial drums that were plastic as well as like metal ones and symbols that look like at one point they had been like saw blades PVC pipes a radio also the guitar player was taking a metal vibrator and using it as a slider on his guitar there is also a point at which and you know all of this stuff is Mike so it's amplified out into the crowd we had like this this crazy spinning metal device that was kind of being played with them you know sort of these uh metal brushes and you know the the device would kind of dragged against the metal brushes and create a tone there was also a point at which this big bucket sort of suspended high above the stage was dropping like scrap metal and that was Mike so you know you heard the scrap metal falling as the band was delivering other you know types of instrumentation you know I mean that's that's industrial music for you you know just all this clanging and banging and just a lot of sonic texture and you know of course as they are on the band's records that I'm familiar with the vocals are incredibly dramatic poetically or extra Lisa real twisted stuff and the lighting presentation was fantastic too it wasn't sort of colorful like a lot of other bands I've seen this week they just pretty much had the bright white LED lights just blasting like almost the whole set and you know it was lit kind of like a like a nighttime construction site which given the the sound of the set was was very fitting following that I ran down to I think the the stage escapes me but I caught some of Earth Lissa's set which was just like this continual non-stop just psych rock jam with just tons of soloing guitars and grooving bass and drums and if it was like the part of every psych rock song from the 60s where the drums the guitars in the base just get really intense and there's guitar solos except there's it was like almost no point at which that kind of broke down into something else it was just that continuant that that can that moment continuously but just kind of different flavors and versions of it as the band would progress along people are going insane for that set as well and then the last thing I ended up seeing the sort of close out the day I sort of ended up seeing this accidentally I thought I was going to see a new bit i thought i was going to see another band they're entirely but i think i kind of cut out a chunk of my schedule by accident when I was kind of putting it on my phone but uh I saw tune-yards again pleasant surprise and and maybe the best way to end the night because I hadn't seen the band yet and and unconsciously so um I did a pretty great job of just not seeing almost any acts that I had seen before this week I think the only act I'd seen before that I saw this weekend was son there were some artists that I wanted to see that I wish I could have but still despite that I felt like I personally had a pretty freakin action-packed week between seeing all the artists I saw and meeting all the people that I met you know who watched the show you know if any of you are watching now thanks for coming up in saying hi it's you know it's fantastic to meet you and thanks for watching so yeah so pretty cool festival weekend no Anthony Fantan oh uh primavera oh I should see really quick that the tune-yards set was really awesome merrill Garbus great singer fantastic energetic performer with the beautiful aura around her and you know the the vocalists as well as the side sage percussionist she had with her as well were great they complimented her music perfectly and and sort of freed her up from having to do a whole lot of loops which can be really cool and she did that as well over the course of the set and sounded fine you know but but with these extra sort of collaborators on the stage of these songs from her new record from her last record had more of a just live vibrant in the moment feel which was really great so yeah yeah so that was the that was the awesome freakin colorful over-the-top kooky zany tune-yards set forever 
bwU_uMs83ys,my hotel room is the hottest place in Spain I'm pretty sure okay um hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a really quick video where I give you an update on my second day in Barcelona primavera sound having a lot of fun here as you guys remember from my last video saw quite a few shows yesterday didn't see as many musical performance actually I did see as many musical performances today but I guess I didn't see as many ones that I caught footage of because I was kind of far away this is the the second day of the festival I believe it's you know pretty much the weekend now so a lot more people were down there and of course in response to that Primavera whipped out some of their biggest acts today so earlier this afternoon I went down to these two larger stages i believe the Primavera stage and the Heineken stage because I wanted to see Patti Smith and her band play horses from front to back and I actually ended up running into Julian Casablancas and the voids I saw them from very far away and the performance was not really that good good the harder rocking tracks were great but when it came to the slower more experimental ballads the live performance really didn't do it justice especially a track like a human sadness which again didn't go over too well in the live setting I just kind of headed in the other direction and waited for Patti Smith to play I didn't get as close to the stages I would have wanted still sweating but I was close enough to you know just get a little bit of video and experience the concert without feeling like I was too distant from it to kind of see what was going on and hear the music properly and it was freaking amazing it was one of the most amazing concerts one of the most amazing musical performances I've ever seen not only did Patti Smith and her band just not miss a beat when it came to horses musically lyrically emotionally but you know it seemed like cat Patti was really just kind of just it seemed like she was just experiencing these songs in a really strong emotional way as if she had just written them not like you know the songs are decades old or anything like that it still seemed like you know these tracks for her still carried a lot of emotional significance and power and that definitely came through in the performance I got choked up at the start I got choked up on the last song and then they finished off the whole set with the track rock and roll not gonna say it oh that's gonna make so many people mad as she was kind of going into the story behind some of these songs she just came off so a mild-mannered and an humble and sweet and embracing but once the songs actually started she was just a fucking tornado on the stage um I wish things could have just been a little more punk you know Patti whenever she would kick over the mic stand somebody would quickly fly from behind the curtains and stand it back up as if the mic stand just can't sit there you know I understand it's you know festival or somebody's property nobody wants it broken but you know still it's Patti Smith and and then toward the end of the set she was handed this guitar offstage and she said this is the greatest weapon of my generation and then she proceeded to play it and you know there was definitely like some malfunctioning stuff going out like the knobs needed to be turned and like it was it was a while before she was actually getting some decent sound out of the guitar and that she was just ripping it to shreds and breaking the strings it was it was a crazy performance and again like I said during the final moments I cried I cried I cried like a big baby you know the first two times I got choked up I was fighting it back no right and then during the end it was just like so I went from there to sort of the the main area of the festival where most of the stages are sort of oriented the raybans stage and the ATP stage where a balance abash and we're playing you know I I stuck around for a little bit though they were playing a lot of material from the new record as you know not really a huge fan of the new record but man they had one of the largest and one of the most hyped crowds therefore that people in Europe go crazy for balance Sebastian and I understand you know hometown advantage it's totally cool but it was you know great to at least see people were really vibing with the record though I didn't really like the new LP you know Belle and Sebastian are fantastic band in my opinion an institution an institution that I would hate to see you know go away due to lack of interest but that was definitely a not within the realm of possibility at at this festival because there were thousands and thousands of people sort of you know watching this live performance and you know many of whom knew all the words to the new record and uh you know several performances in several songs and rather I decided that I kind of wanted to you know go grab something to eat I sort of looked around it was just people in all directions like there was no way out and I was just like oh I'm in for the long haul here and you know I did manage to make my way out for a minute and I came back for the set was over and you know I was eaten and the set finished and the crowd kind of dispersed and run the jewels played right after and you know which is really why I was there you know I wanted to catch a little bit of balance abash and kind of see how the live set was and you know they were there with strings keys just the whole nine it's great that Primavera is able to kind of allow these artists to come over and kind of spring on you know large elaborate instrumental setups instead of kind of you know coming over to another country and maybe having to skimp on a few things because of budgetary issues it seems like in terms of setup and presentation pretty much every artist I've seen thus far has been bringing heat in terms of instruments amp quality string sections background singers so you know you definitely a get bang for your buck at this festival in terms of you know the the stuff people are providing artists are providing the artists that you do get to see you know because again there were some I guess schedule clashes for me today really wanted to see ariel pink but i kind of stuck with run the jewels and i'm glad i did because i was down in front for run the jewels i was just front freakin row hanging over you know the the metal barrier between everybody in the stage and the beats were killer the performance was great killer mike LP fantastic level of energy and maybe three or four songs in killer mike is like yo is that the needle drop in the front row I think I see the needle drop there he rated run the jewels hi and you know I jokingly just like when went this back and he says oh and he just flipped me off um you know and then the it was insane it was crazy it was um yeah that was a craziest thing ever Thank You killer Mike thank you I thank you based Mike after a live performance in an experience and I guess a live shout out that could not have been topped I decided to just call it a night come back here and yeah so now I'm just kind of mentally working my way through the day between you know sort of getting a shout out from killer Mike and you know uh crying like a little baby to a Patti Smith and yeah that's it Anthony Fantana second day primavera sound you're the best spain barcelona fantastic beautiful forever 
kcTSN4zdPyY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and yeah it's a time for a really quick video where I basically update you guys on my first day at Primavera Sound the Barcelona Spain based music festival right by the short here in Barcelona in sort of a beautiful large park area numerous stages a lot of groups going this year the lineup is fantastic and um so many sets I want to see happening at the same time regardless though my first date was pretty great I mean I met a bunch of people who watched the show and they were amazing incredibly fantastic you know we sort of talked to each other up for a little bit and over the course of the day I got to see handful of acts that I either have seen before and I saw great performances from them again or just groups I had been wanting to see but through this festival and now have gotten a chance to I kind of kicked off my day seeing the Australian rock band twerps a very easy breezy sweet and sleazy their set was and yeah you know a lot of people were you know really vibing to their garage jangly sound and then after them I caught vietcong you know I've never seen women so I figured I had to see via Kong and I did like their new record didn't love it but I liked it a lot and it was actually one of the better live sets of the the day for me I'm actually pretty surprised that the band came off as visceral as they did in person since on record you know that there is so much reverb there does feel like there is so much a distance from the band there is so much eeriness to their sound and the way that they record that didn't really come through in in the live performance rather you know they were just incredibly high-energy the guitars were twanging and very sharp and cutting the bass was huge and very resonant the drumbeats were sharp as hell so yeah again it was a very energetic very visceral live performance that was a great change of pace after that I went to go see battles who were maybe just an earshot away from from the stage that Vietcong was playing on they were playing at the at the Heineken stage and and you see here's the thing the secret is that you needed to get a ticket before you could see that show at least it was a secret from me so I I did not go and see battles unfortunately but I did end up seeing a wide-set that was sort of clashing with battles at the time I headed over to this large auditorium where they were doing a Sun Kil moon performance mark kozilek was there full band behind him it was actually totally electric there wasn't an acoustic instrument in sight and so we were hearing like these electric guitar renditions of tracks off of Benjy older Sun Kil moon songs as well and Mark was incredibly aggressive on stage and I'm not just talking about you know like a stage banter or anything like that we'll get to look into that a little bit later but he was like yelling the words just shouting the words to his songs at the top of his lungs it was just strangely aggressive I mean he was yelling to the point where his like voice was cracking he was just like shouting the hell out of these songs like you know Richard Ramirez died of natural causes you know he was just completely amped and it was like this drum and cymbal setup for him side stage and occasionally he would go over there and bang it as he was singing it was it was very odd but a good performance as well part of the way in the performance he III won't totally spoil it but he I guess sort of made mention of a few song titles that he anticipates may end up pissing some people off on his next album I I think at this point he is kind of like list a troll so from there I ended up heading over to the ATP stage where I caught my last two performances of the night one spiritualize - I've been dying to see for a long time the performance was great from the guitars the bass the key is the backup singers it seems that the spiritual eyes set oriented itself mostly around the most gospel themed songs in the band's catalogue you know so whether or not that's that's a good thing in your opinion you know is your opinion personally I would have loved to have heard you know more tracks from ladies and gentlemen more tracks from the new LP especially you know the more hard rocking tracks but you know still it was actually a really great set you could tell that you know singing these songs these very religious in theme songs is an incredibly emotional experience for the band and that you know that they're not just one of these groups that um you know sort of puts these messages in their music for show you know that it actually means something significant and I guess philosophically to them so again that was a great performance really great you know sort of a subtle and and and quiet and beautiful moments and and really huge amazing crescendos as well where things would get kind of noisy and and psychedelic and finally actor spiritualize died kind of close things out with a sunset it was just an hour-long set not a massively long set or anything like that I was pretty jet-lagged by the time that they came onto the stage so I just kind of zoned out a little bit you know I was feeling that bass it was just you know the the perfect mood for that and you know Attila was there as well they had you know all those stacked speaker cabinets they had all the Sun amps they had the ampeg amps out they had a Moog synthesizer there as well and tiller was there as I said and he was giving a pretty great vocal performance to came out in a robe was doing the you know throat singing the very deep and that sort of thing but then later you know came out in sort of that mirror shawl robe that he's got going with the spiked crown started you know delivering some pretty horrific shrieks and stuff like that son man if you see him live it's it's always messed up it's it's always messed up so yeah I mean in a nutshell that was pretty much the performances that I caught today I'm gonna be doing a video next you know tomorrow sort of talking about all the performances that I'm catching this afternoon too so yeah I mean I'm having a cool time over here for those of you who did make it out to the festival I hope you have fun as well and you know if you are planning on you know making a trip out here ever you know this this vessel would definitely be a good excuse to do so you know it's it's not too big it's pretty low-key you know if you make it to a spot early enough you can get you know close to the stage and the performances so far have been really good and the atmosphere overall is great it doesn't feel like what while in in a sense it can be kind of frustrating to be like oh there are three bands I love playing at the same high but that's the only sets that hang that that can definitely definitely be frustrating the festival isn't so big that it feels like impossible to manage or anything like that so yeah that's that's it man I'll catch up with you guys again talk to you you know very soon about a my next day and you're the best anthe Fantana music Primavera Sound forever 
cSg87drcKlw,hi everyone goth in a uto here the Internet's busiest music nerd not at home in a hotel room but still gonna do a review of the new Hopalong record painted shut hopalong is a rock quartet who currently I believe is based out of Philly they've been at it for 10 years now they have a few albums to show for it but even though they have just a little bit of material underground rock fans have had an incredibly passionate response to the music they've released thus far a few years ago the band's full-length LP get dis owned I thought was a little rough around the edges but turned quite a few heads especially thanks to the singing and songwriting abilities of frontwoman Francis score who really stole the show on that record she is she is an incredible vocalist she has this insane rasp to her voice when she's singing especially as she's just reaching up just pushing the volume of her voice it sounds like a saxophone just being played very aggressively or maybe like overdrive distortion but on a vocal level or something like that or maybe even like a cat but even as Francis is reaching up there and really pushing her vocals really busting her vocal cords at the seams she holds an incredible amount of pitch and melody and of course there's a lot of emotion fueling these intense vocal performances too and this vocal talent continues on to this new LP as well painted shut on the instrumental side of things on this LP there is a small but healthy range rock flavors kind of influencing things everything from alternative singer songwriters to indie rock and punk and pop rock if you're a fan of pile or speedy or tease or wax a hat gee I think you're going to get something out of this record not only that but the closing track on here just has such a strong Strokes vibe and the guitar work the very twangy thin guitar work on the song horseshoe crabs reads very much like a modest mouse song so like a lot of artists out there hop along grab ideas from their influences but they execute them tastefully and they are just laying with fantastic vocals fantastic distinct vocals and really good songwriting to the LP is kind of diverse as well diverse enough to make listening to the whole thing enjoyable on the song horseshoe crabs as well this track kind of breaks up the track listing because it's a bit of a piano tune - which is a pretty nice change of pace from the mostly guitar driven tracks and the track listing here there's also the song happy to see me which is an acoustic cut not one of my favorites on here mostly because the acoustic guitar doesn't really sound all that great kind of distorted and flat and very quiet in comparison to the vocals and on top of it I'm not really sure Francis's vocal acrobatics and just bleeding on this track really complements the tone down sound of this instrumental though her performance is passionate and I'm pretty sure I hear harp on this track that was nice for the most part I find myself being drawn toward the very succinct hooky loud blaring just no BS direct more rock-oriented songs than the track listing here and it's not just because they're full of energy or anything like that it's because the songs beneath this rock instrumentation are really catchy and really memorable like on the opener here the not the witness just what Stu taught yeah one of the most unusual topics I've ever heard in a song ever I love the heavy guitars on the chorus here the very harmonious bridge the song waitress has a kind of odd tale to it in the lyrics as well kind of singing about Francis as a waitress having a bit of a weird encounter with somebody and his friends who I think she might have had a past with and she channels that frustration perfectly into a really just instantaneous song with a pretty sticky guitar phrase at the very beginning to the knack this album has for delivering great indie rock tunes with some interesting lyrical quirks continues on two tracks like I saw my twin and Texas funeral and especially within my feet tracks here powerful man which is a bit of a tale of like just kind of for a moment seeing an abusive father hit his kid in public and then going to I guess kind of get him in trouble for it but sort of lacking the details to give inadequate description again some weird tales fueling these songs but it's part of the enjoy ability of the album instrumentally musically I don't really think hopalong is reinventing the wheel all that much maybe on a future record I would love to see some more sonic experimentation or at least some slightly better production though I will give it to them that they did improve things production wise and recording wise on this record over get disowned and you know even if they kind of stay in this lane and continue down the path that they're continuing Francis still sounds like she's going to be a fantastic voice for the band and hopefully her stories continue to be compelling and kind of off the beaten path as well I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh hopalong painted shut forever 
sU4GY8v-Mdg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick video letting you know basically my quick little monthly roundup telling you what some fantastic albums from last month were this past month May we are almost at the end of the month excuse the video quality my camera and my tripod are a little packed up at the moment so you know bear with me you know it's not gonna stay like this so quickly I just want to shout out three records that I think you need to check out this month one the new pest and war album I will link down there in the description a review of all these records you can check them out they're really colorful eccentric noisy and relatively high fidelity black metal record with a lot of personality next the new Korean album a double album WETA even though there aren't a lot of albums that I'm recommending I felt like I were maybe we if you like news album as well I was kind of spoiled with these records because they were long like the Prairie and record was really like 2 albums and really it was two records of experimental music electronic music noise ambient music and drone all coming together into a really cinematic epic soundtrack like double disc project and then before that early early early in the month i loved the new Kumasi washington album the epic which is really like three amazing jazz albums in one Komachi and his band the next step pulled together a 3-hour jazz record but it is in three discs each of which feel and read very much like a separate album so don't feel like you need to listen to the whole thing take your time with it listen to it one disc at a time just as if it you know it's like I said it's it's own separate record and then once you kind of get you know a feel for an album or you enjoy it or you feel like you know you've got your fill of it move on to the next one and if you feel like afterwards you've enjoyed all three enough then listen to the whole thing from beginning and and you know if you got the guts to do that right from the start did go for it so again the the Peston war record the Kumasi washington record the epic and then finally the new korean album frozen niagara falls so we have you know a pretty cool black metal record a fantastic amazing jazz record which will unquestionably be in my top ten at the end of this year right up there with you know all the other fantastic records that have given a nine to or higher and you know then we also have the permeant album which again is an incredibly solid creative fantastic and diverse textured and colorful ambient record noise record there's a lot of just gloomy soundtrack very epic icy eighties inspired synth work and there as well some guitar that kind of pops up toward the end of the record there's a lot of sound on this record it's it's indescribable how textured that Prairie and album is but it's very emotional as a very evocative it's very dark like I might have said in the review you know the sound of just crushed human souls on on that album so yeah those are the three records I think you definitely need to check out this month as I said not a whole lot of different albums but I do feel like I was kind of spoiled with the fact that the kamati Washington record feels like three the prurient record feels like I got two great albums in one album so uh you know um hoping this next month is a little more fruitful and that's it you're the best alright thanks for chilling with me for a minute I hope I am doing an adequate job of you know sort of recommending some stuff and you know I hope you guys are digging up the stuff that I'm diggin and even if you're not that's completely cool to you know love you forever 
iN3tGH8H6B8,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the monthly y-you know review segment we're in brief I go through a series of records that I didn't get a chance to over the past month do a full length review of so I'm just kind of talking about them a little bit here let's go I really want to like this record more than I do I'm sorry I really want to like this record I really want to like this record it's it's classy it tries to be thoughtful the instrumentals and and the lyrics sometimes to have quite a bit of salt to them but there's just so much about this record that is just average to me and just does not stand out it just after a while just kind of grows boring to me they just kind of doubled down on the indie alt-country reverb soaked sound that they were pumping on their last full length LP and just not that memorable am I the only one who's just not as crazy about their 2000s stuff hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and today we're going to be making some ghost baths what you're going to want to do is grab your copy of death Heaven's sunbather just water it down get some water in there get it real watery and then you have some ghost baths now what you're going to want to do also is pretend this is from China China China China this LP is some of the most superficial post-punk revival I've ever heard ever knowledge knowledge on this LP prolific beat producer making a big debut on Stones Throw Records and you know while it's it's not reinventing the wheel or anything like that it's it's a pretty good beat tape if you're looking for a nice jazzy colorful sound rich textured beat tape then look this project up because it's pretty sweet you'll see you'll see if you say real still it'll go away the award for the most obnoxious vocals and keyboards on a metal album this year goes to sigh it's like every modern pop tune you've ever heard but with high-pitched vocals and gimmicky production there are songs that I liked on this record but it was only because of the merits of the song that the lyrics the melody the beat was catchy was danceable was bubbly kind of stuck in my head it had nothing to do with the chipmunk vocals and nothing to do with the gimmicky production techniques in fact after a while this gimmicky production gets annoying hearing a song from this album played from a block away will put you in a sugar coma this is the sophomore full-length LP from this experimental choral music group I reviewed their debut full-length album I thought it was pretty great though not one of my favorite albums of the year and this record over here seems to be just a bit more out there and obtuse and abstract which if you're really into choral music maybe is a totally cool thing for you again try this out this is a creative group this group is doing some interesting things but I wish this record was is in your face and is aggressive and is hard-hitting as the debut this one just doesn't stand out quite as much to me they seem to be doing some stranger stuff which i think will appeal to some people but I guess I was looking for something with a little bit more bite no boss that's huh if only every other track on this record was as good pretty much the transformers 3 of rap records this is a very jazzy smooth thoughtful hiphop mixtape with some boomy smooth colorful beats a lot of appearances from the dudes over in the progressive era click Chelsea reject is showing a lot of promise this is a pretty good tape it's free try it I could never really get that much - Mews vehicles and that is especially the case on this record just way too high-pitched nasally sugary it's almost pretty much the same reason I don't really dig the new passion pit record well and those are my thoughts on all of these albums um sorry if we disagree I'm not trying to disagree with you bro it's just you know I'm not feeling some of these projects you know and that's all it's nothing against anybody you know it's just a it's a preferential thing you know what I'm saying though I'm happy to hear anybody who's positive or even negative comments on any of these records down in the description box full just robust conversation and thoughts is what I would like to see what I would like to read what I get off on Oh God doing good off on it and if you'd rather you know to sort of hang back play it low-key that's cool - thank you for watching this video I hope you're having a good day and you're the best transition you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best should have asked you the best advice should they do it music opinions forever 
YHwE4pMld1c,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music bird and it's time for review of the new dr. yen-lo record days with dr. yen-lo dr. yen-lo is the musical pseudonym of Brownsville New York rapper ha as he is teaming up with a producer who I believe goes by preservation and if it wasn't obvious from cause Twitter account from the name of this project from the audio clips flowing throughout this record this project is inspired by the dr. yen-lo character from the 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate and even though in title and from the sound clips this project is obviously inspired by this character by this movie I wish more themes or more obvious whiffs of inspiration came through in the lyrics here kah is is sort of delivering his as usual just level of wordplay his usual visual verbal grit but for the most part the inspiration that this project takes from dr. yen-lo from The Manchurian Candidate seems kind of superficial as Chi and preservation sort of just collaborate on a series of tracks that I could kind of in a way see Codd doing by himself not that he should have I mean it's cool that he's working with a collaborator it just kind of seems like for the most part preservation didn't really push god of his comfort zone or anything on this project he merely came on to I guess sort of complement the style of rap music we already know cause capable of and in a way sort of perfected on his last full length LP the Knights gambit in some ways I kind of think this record is a bit of a typical record for Kai even though it does feature is a typical style it would be kind of an understatement to say that word play and and lyrics are important to cop for him lyrics are everything all other things are secondary the flow the energy the instrumental and not to say that Cod isn't care about these things or that they don't have a particular vibe on his tracks it's just that usually they are so quiet they are so subtle they are so tone down your mind or at least my mind just drifts directly to the lyrics as it is just you know kind of hard to focus on much of anything else I mean Koz flows are usually very laid-back very sparse and his energy level is incredibly low his raps are delivered almost at the volume of a whisper he is just like two shades away from spoken word and I'm not saying that Koz flows are bad they're actually a few moments on this LP where I am feeling a bit more tempo maybe a bit more of a an upbeat spot in his flow on these tracks all I'm saying is that if you're not appreciating the lyrics on a cost song you're really not gonna get much out of it other than maybe just some very light sort of moody hip-hop background music now as far as the instrumentals on this LP go as I expected given Koz style the beats on this thing if you can even call them beats are very light they're subdued their atmosphere at times there isn't even really a strong rhythmic presence on these tracks and and some of the instrumentals here sort of feel like just bits of maybe some moody string music or just some some very dramatic tones looped from an old-school soundtrack to a very dramatic movie or something like that and there's some lyrical moments here that really stand out especially on the intro here pretty much every track here is named after a certain day and then is given a number you're not going to catch any sort of catchy track titles or anything like that but I love the refrain on the opening track here it actually kicks this album off really well sort of talking about how there's a new crop but we the CREM though and you know dr. yan-lo and the pen flow just very nice good job there are just lyrical moments on this record that floor me especially toward the first half but as the record draws on I think kind of paints himself into a corner because he comes off as just not that versatile on this record as with his last full-length LP there's even a moment here where kah has rock Marciano on again and there aren't very many rappers that are as subdued as Casso I can kind of imagine that having instrumentals this moody and having a delivery and and a flow that is so toned down there aren't many rappers that you could bring on to sort of just meet your energy level I understand that I get that but this record in a lot of ways despite the fact that it is under a different name and it is a collaboration with a different producer from front to back it feels kind of like a bit of a repeat kind of redundant especially since I don't really think this album is a sharp song for song for song lyrically and instrumental for instrumental and even hook for hook because there were some decent hooks and refrains off of knights gambit whereas here on tracks like day three or day 11:25 I kind of feel like cause neglecting the whole hook and refrain thing and and not that a rap song needs hooks in order to be good but the way that I kind of see the Knights gambit and cause work up until that point was sort of this experiment with how great of a rap song you could make how fantastic you could make a hip-hop song while at the same time being incredibly minimal and that makes kaveri unique it makes him very idiosyncratic but again on this record it just feels a little less exciting because that lack of versatility you really sort of comes back around to bite this record in the butt a little bit i think and and makes it a little I don't know unengaging I think cause hardcore fans up until this point will enjoy this record it has his trademark style on it and he is at least reaching a certain standard of quality he has set for himself in the past it just doesn't seem quite as exciting to me maybe just a bit of a case of I don't know been there done that I'm hoping that whatever project he puts out in the future he takes a few more risks because I think as fantastic as he is he is just squandering his talent just a little bit by kind of just sitting in his comfort zone with this record feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana kah preservation dr.

mnZbtlbBPT8,boy hi everyone Sexton he taped an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Shamir record ratchet Shamir is a los vegas based singer musician and with this new LP over here he is making his big commercial label debut via excel records i think years ago I might have heard his early early stuff and had a bit of Twitter correspondence with him whatever his older music sounded like I don't really recall it it's just completely slipped my memory but what I do know is that I stumbled upon his call it off single during the YouTube Music Awards that just happened this year and it was like stumbling upon a new artist entirely as I'm sure it was for many people on this track we're talking about a driving four to the floor beat a very bouncy gummy bassline some repeating synth phrases that are kind of squeaking and making glitchy just sort of abrasive noises but it's all very pleasant to the air at least for me that's a strong alternative dance flavor I think that on this track Shamir and his producer Nick Sylvester who he works with across the length of this record do a bit of LCD soundsystem worship on this thing I mean even the refrain about not being able to turn a thought into a wife on this song sounds like something that Nancy Wang would sing off of sound of silver listening to this track and then listening to other singles off of this LP I am floored this record is not coming out on DFA and on excel instead but even though this LP has some blatant LCD soundsystem influences Shamir ultimately has an altogether different personality musically and especially lyrically he is much more influenced by hip-hop he's also influenced by house and that lyricism combines with these danceable beats and then you get the insane body rocking debauchery that you might remember from like Azealia Banks is two-on-two single except maybe a little quirky ER and you get this flavor again on other tracks here like a hot mess as well as make a scene and on the regular other songs on this track listing that I love undeniably this record Nick Sylvester and Shamir have a talent when it comes to hard-hitting dance instrumentals with bubbly playful kind of silly lyrics but this is not a strength they continue to play to on the rest of this record which is a bit of a letdown considering how fantastic I think the singles from this album are this is me on the regular so you know I'm white not that I think these tracks will translate to everybody's Shamir's voice I think is a bit of an acquired taste it's very nasal it's got a strange inflection to it kind of weird but he really plays that inflection up just to add some character character I think it's gonna be a turn-off for some people it was not personally a turn-off for me until Shamir and Nick's start making these attempts that fall very short toward more emotional songs and more balladry like would be very stiff and and kind of passion drained ode to Shamir's hometown on the intro track here or on the track demon where I actually think this record kind of loses its eccentricity and trades it out just for some radio pop blandness with a hook that sounds like twenty one pilots could have written it what made the singles from this LP so attractive those hard-nosed dance beats come back on the track and on the kill but this song among others in the final moments of this record are topped with these incredibly awkward stiff vocal performances that are so redundant it just kind of feels like he's just washing rinsing and repeating as Shamir shifts from the verses to the choruses done and but just not the sharpest and most memorable or our sing-along little vocal melodies either with these lighter more easygoing tracks I feel like I'm listening to Hot Chip but without the pop sensibility when we get to the song youth in the tracklisting here once this track hits though like the the two-minute 15-second mark when Shamir really tries to push himself vocally and I'm done I'm just done but on this track I do like that Shamir tries to say something about the the cluelessness and the follies of youth I find a lot of his lyrics to be kind of funny tongue-in-cheek or he's even making an interesting philosophical statement but on pretty much every single track where he's not going for that bubbly fun demeanor I don't really think his voice because of just constraints with skill and ability don't really carry or convey successfully the emotion that he's shooting for and let's get in closer this one listen the the kind of sour harmonies the strained notes and the very nasal inflection just derails it for me I love the singles off of this LP but this album leaves a lot to be desired vocally and that's it I'm feeling a strong five to late six on this LP transition if you'd give him this tracker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Shamir ratchet forever 
LO9MLBfOb9c,hi everyone Sun theny Hampton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new 21 pilots record blurryface 21 pilots is a musical duo hailing from Columbus Ohio they've been at it for several albums now they came out with a breakout record a few years ago the album vessel that came out via fueled by ramen records a record that featured these boyish sweet blends of pop rap electronic music and rock - this blend of genres might make twenty one pilots seem kind of all over the place stylistically but nearly every one of this duo's tracks boils down to an almost painfully obvious pop formula and that's even the case for this new LP over here and maybe in a way that is made up for as the duo hops from one genre reference to another like with the track ride where we kind of get these keyboards that have a huge emphasis on the upbeat of the song and feel pretty reggae inspired later in the track listing here we have the song lane boy which feels even more reggae inspired and the these-these reggae references man that they pop up on this record again and again and again I don't really remember so much reggae on vessel we also had the song fairly local which has these down pitched southern rap influenced vocals with a heavy huge string back chorus with these massive walls of just monstrous bass that kind of feels like dubstep inspired we also have straight breakbeat electronica on the introductory track here to be perfectly honest on this record all of the genre hopping is just like this kind of cheesy trendy distraction from the fact that nearly every track here unquestionably follows a formula in the way that I might have when I was a little kid and I was trying to build like a Lego model that I got for Christmas and this basicness or maybe even this obligation to follow this formula is even lamented on this album we have the song stressed out where we get lyrics talking about I I wish I didn't have to to rhyme my words I wish I could find some better sounds some new and exciting chords even with the track Lane boy we have lyrics talking about the commonality of the music on this record or songs that are heartless 21 pilots really come through with more strong opinions than they do strong songs on this album in twenty one pilots lyrics I get this sense this this need this desire for adventure but it doesn't really come out in the music though on the song stressed out I do like that we are getting this analysis of the pressures that we are dealing with day to day from ourselves from the world as we age and twenty one pilots take this pressure and they have a pretty underwhelming reaction to it I mean they don't really challenge it and they don't really challenge themselves yet on the song tear in my heart sort of take a subtle shot at radio songs as just being okay and I have a similar indifference toward a lot of radio pop songs but if that's how you feel why include this bright sugary synth lead that wouldn't sound too out of place in any pop divas new single but I admit the song tear in my heart is a pretty well written track definitely the the first flare of genius in this records track listing especially during the kind of tone down vocal break down on the track here the one about taxes and the government and potholes it's actually a really cute moment and one of the few left hooks the songwriting actually brings to the table here the next surprise this album provided as I was first listening to it was on the song Lane boy where we are getting another reggae styled verse but then out of nowhere we're getting these just electronic beats break beats coming out of nowhere these awful polyrhythmic like synthesizers just kind of dancing on top not really falling into the groove purposely playing out of the groove to I guess kind of create some other rhythmic vibe to this moment in the track like is this twenty one pilots attempt it it's sounding like outside of the box this just kind of feels like blandly written pop music for people who have just a touch of a DD then on the track the judge we have kind of another Bacolod coming through the instrumental and some ukulele kicking the track off I mean it just just just just get this song an Apple commercial please and of course twenty one pilots changes up their sound again on the song polarize which not only has this huge massive imagine dragons sized chorus but the vocal inflections on this song kinda add reminds me a little bit of alt-j it's not terrible twenty one pilots in a lot of ways are kind of just like pop chameleons on this record and on vessel two and I see the appeal I think they have a lot of personality and quirk coming through in their lyrics but I just feel like they attempt at just jumping on one sound one idea to the next and in a very uninteresting way somehow it all kind of comes together for fans of the band and sounds like a cool versatile dynamic unpredictable thing but for me it just kind of seems like I don't know this buffet approach to songwriting and buffet food is just not that good but I do like the kind of youthful idealism coming through on the song we don't believe what's on TV I feel like twenty one pilots has that youth element in their music that allows them to kind of point out the ridiculousness of the world that they live in and I like the very very quickly strung ukuleles on this track and the kind of organic booming sharp drums felt really lively I also like the lyrics on the song not today I like the the feeling of helplessness of uselessness on this track and just this this need this desire to change or impact the world help the world in some kind of significant way I agree with what a lot of this record says philosophically despite some ditzy lyrical moments but when it comes to the sound of this record by the end of it I mean I was pretty sick of the gentrified reggae breakdowns I really was as well as all of the blatant sugar-coated pop mimicry while simultaneously like I don't know just mentioning and kind of poking fun a little bit at radio pop music it's it's like twenty one pilots try as hard as they can to sound like they should be on the radio but kind of feel burned they're not being on the radio hey guys listen to minimally you went on a little secret here don't uh don't don't tell anybody but uh there's this new website called the YouTube and and a lot of a lot of bands streaming music on there and a lot of people here in it it's it's like even more popular than the radio so no I don't really care for the music on this record much of the time I do however like a lot of the lyrics here and I do like the vocals sometimes like on the closer here where I think the singing is genuinely passionate and emotionally captivating and I think those characteristics carry throughout a lot of this album and I think 21 pilots have a lot of vocal and lyrical quirk as well again I see the appeal but I think the music just really needs to mature a little bit and and seek out just a more organic interesting and distinct sound then maybe twenty one pilots could actually launch into something legitimately interesting there are kind of two roads that I could go down for the very end of this review I could just you know put my hands up and be like hey guys you know what it's good for what it is it's good for what it is but you know you could really say that about like 99.9% of records or I could just tell you that I don't like it cuz I don't like it yeah I'm feeling like a light too decent for on this LP transition have you given this record to listen if so what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana twenty one pilots blurryface forever 
t0tJhzj29Zc,he got my soul Anthony he got my soul record Catterick okay counter chesta stuck in hell stuck in hell mixtape deal with the demon signed a record deal I've got to get my hands on it try to read it see if there's a loophole we've I can get cow out of there hi everyone new thony hat tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Korean record frozen Niagara Falls / Orient is one of the many musical pseudonyms of experimental music producer Dominic Ferno who I understand has been releasing music under the prurient name for over 10 years now and since embarking on this musical journey has amassed a labyrinth like discography of various shades of industrial music and noise harsh noise ambient Dominic is actually dabbled in a bit of darkwave - he has ties to the band cold cave if it's a style of music that sounds like a human soul being crushed then he's probably made it in the late 2000s Dominic started turning heads with these more experimental and dark and tortured styles of music but then after kind of one soso release after another I became worried that he would kind of just go down the path of many of his contemporaries in these noise and harsh noise genres just kind of doing a quantity over quality type of thing and just methodically churning out albums in the same way that an assembly-line might turn out a car industrially but frozen Niagara Falls is in fact the grand statement that I think Koreans discography needed right now it is a 90 minute double album it is out via profound lore records not typically a noise label they usually dabble in metal music but more of the noisy experimental adventurous and risk-taking band in that style the label actually dabbled in Noise music a little bit last year releasing a collaborative record between MERS Bao and full of hell which seemed to do pretty well for them so I guess they're kind of going further down that noise road with this Prairie and album now let me say that this is not purely a noise or a harsh noise record though part of what makes Dominic's so interesting in the first place is that he brings in other styles of music music music music with frozen Niagara Falls Dominic actually does a pretty decent job of balancing the feedback and the distortion and the throat shredding screams with heavy washes of ice-cold synthesizers and drones and synthetic melodies some vocals some booming drums and even a little bit of guitar which pops up pretty prominently in the second disc here so there is noise on this record there is ambient music but you're also getting what kind of feels like progressive electronic music the kind of very urgent and anthemic and soundtrack inspired synth work that you might catch off of like I don't know an 80's horror sci-fi post-apocalyptic movies much of the music on this LP feels as if it is setting a scene and Dominic while it's it's not like there are many amazing compositional ideas there are some here there are some good melodic ideas in this record here but it doesn't really feel like he is focusing as much on that as he is just kind of sculpting sound sort of manipulating it and twisting it in the way that you might expect a guy like Tim Hecker or lust morte or Ben frost to or the haxon Club but with a very different style a style that is much more harsh abrasive and kind of ear piercing and the results from front to back on this thing almost for the 90 minutes are pretty evocative the ear piercing sounds on this LP are going to turn some people away regardless of whether or not there are some interesting emotional or compositional ideas on this album that's understandable if you don't like this record if it's just way too harsh or just not feeling good in this part and this part over here I understand but if you don't mind the noise and really actually derive some kind of emotional meaning or interpretation from the noise on this record there's a lot of great things going on here because all the songs on this record come together and create a pretty chilling and frightening album and it's not like you're watching the horror of this record going on as an outsider I mean turning the music up or really just kind of encapsulating yourself in it getting lost and it puts you inside the music whether we're talking about tracks that feel like just abrasive desolate sunburned or frostbitten soundscapes these tracks might feature no rhythm at all or maybe kind of a very throbbing constant pulsating rhythm songs like the introductory track here or the two title tracks and there are other songs that feel more like just beings they're enraged they are sonic monsters that are thrashing and calling out and screeching a sorrow with a braid falling mash which I wish was way longer traditional snowfall point set up pills which is one moment on this LP where we are catching some religious imagery coming through on the lyrics and there's actually quite a leap of that across the length of this record that there's there's a lot of religious references on this LP so you know maybe I might listen to this more I mean I will listen to it more but maybe sort of more of a focus on that trying to derive what exactly it is about Christianity specifically and sort of religion generally that fuels this album so much speaking of the lyrics on this LP there's actually quite a bit of very eerie Stoneface spoken word and the track listing here - I think I just want to say that Dominic does a great job of kind of balancing a series of tracks here some of which kind of hang in the background very well serviced ambient music are kind of a little more long-winded and really kind of draw on me kind of forcing me to stare into this nothingness into this depressing abyss while other tracks are a little bit busier a little bit more active just have more going on sonically and are also kind of disturbing and scary but also engaging too with some tracks being more active some tracks being a little bit more still I understand some songs here feeling a bit more crucial than others maybe but I think they all add up into a very disturbing record intentionally disturbing beautifully disturbing I do have a handful of issues some tracks here are a little short and kind of feel like morsels in comparison to the longer and just more intense songs in the track listing here there are a few stereotypical tracks some that maybe could have used a bit more noise or maybe a bit more melody like they sort of slide a little bit too far on one side when it comes to that ambient harsh noise scale that this album kind of toys with and I think the first disc of this LP overall feels a little disjointed kind of like we're getting a series of ideas that don't necessarily connect all that cohesively but the second disc of this album a lot of the songs are a lot drone ear and I think a lot meteor in terms of the length and the repetition so it's kind of easy to feel all the songs kind of bleeding together very nicely I might add so you know it's it's like we're kind of getting this really great album within a double album hahaha alright I loved this record I thought it was great and I love hearing an album that can in a sense feel a little accessible but also in a very strong and potent way appeal to just the darkest corners of the human psyche I mean this record is like pools of blood torture dungeons a physical challenge to anybody who can listen to this album all the way through paying attention to nothing else and then afterwards smile it's just not going to happen but again this was a creative and interesting album was a fantastic blend of synth music ambient music noise and harsh noise industrial Dominic came through with a pretty diverse record considering just how dark and specific his music usually is so I'm feeling a decent wrong eight on this LP transition if you've given this record a listen did it mess you up did it ruin your life did it make you sad did it make you you know sort of start thinking what's the point of all this once what's what's them you know why why are we here let's see you know what's even the point are we just you know going on like this forever 
RkU0mRFQ2AI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new wait a second I forgot about cow oh no he's still stuck in now with the Dayman hi everyone cut them down echo here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Faith No More record sol invictus Faith No More famed alternative metal band numerous fantastic albums under their belt and this is their comeback record if you didn't know the band is fronted by vocalist extraordinaire mr. Mike Patton who has become known for a slew of collaborations and solo albums and side projects since Faith No More disbanded some of which have been incredibly out there experimental but Faith No More comes from humbler beginnings the band's earlier breakout records featured fantastically written blends of hard rock and metal rap and even funk however once these records dropped it didn't take the band too long to start experimenting with other sounds other styles of music the kind of zany nasai might expect out of a Mike Patton solo or side project but the band still throughout their career stayed pretty in touch with their alt metal roots and alternative metal is actually something I think Faith No More embodied more than any other band for their time I mean when alt metal and nu metal sort of caught on in the mainstream Faith No More was a band that continued to experiment and try new things while a lot of the sounds they helped popularize in the late 80s Early 90s became trendy however I wouldn't really say that risk-taking continues on this new LP over here with sol invictus Faith No More actually kind of takes off from where they left with their last LP which I mean you know we're talking about almost two decades of popular music evolution since then hardly cutting edge at this point but the band is still kind of carrying that all metal tour on this LP so if you're kind of nostalgic for that flavor and while that's not necessarily a bad thing I guess another thing that might impact your enjoyment of this album is whether or not you felt that faith no mores last few LPS were kind of a high point in their career personally I kind of prefer the hardrock directness of their early stuff but as flamboyant as this album can be sometimes it is a short ten tracks in 39 minutes obviously Faith No More is not looking to overstay their come back with this LP and for at least a handful of tracks here Faith No More does a pretty decent job of bringing back that heavy dramatic vocally acrobatic alt metal that they're kind of known for like on the track superhero I love the bark vocals on this song as well as the plucky Middle Eastern melodies hanging in the background on the chorus and the vocals on the course here are great - leader of a completely badass song with a lyrical meaning that can be derived from it there's just everything I would want in a Faith No More track and then with sunny-side up huge hulking melody on the chorus here - I love the way Patton's vocals soar over the riffs on this track in many a track and faith no mores back catalogue and I love the way the chorus here kind of smashes into these hard downstroke guitars and there's a sudden shift into just lighter funky guitar chords with some very finely tuned vocal harmonies layered on top of one another on this track there's something with maybe this kind of new age of production Faith No More has been able to I don't know maybe reach a new level of finesse something of Faith No More record might typically forego in order to just get to more just balls-to-the-wall rock music with a little eccentricity and some big vocals and while this changes pace is necessarily a bad thing it leads to a lot more just theatrical camp on this record which you might typically expect more in a Mike Patton solo or side project so you are really getting that drama those overacted vocals on a number of tracks here like on matted the longest track on the entire LP or Black Friday which kicks off with some pretty awful lyrics and then cone of shame which has a bit of a I don't know a reverb II spaghetti-western very open vast and dramatic Nick Cave type thing before the really hard-hitting riffs kick in in the second half and these tracks aren't terrible but they're not really amazing me either they just kind of feel like in a way lesser versions of tracks that I might have heard Mike Patton kind of toy with on a number of other albums with other bands and then back to sunny-side up I guess the one thing I don't really like about this track is that it kind of ends very suddenly it's one of the shorter tracks in the track listing here and it's not the only song that kind of leaves us with a sudden cliffhanger there is the opener here which fizzles out so disappointingly I wonder why they even bothered to put it on the record and then there's the song which I reviewed and I talked about how much I liked this track and how much it felt kind of like a trailer a cliffhanger for this album and I thought it might make an amazing intro for this record but it's actually track eight in the track listing here and doesn't really flow into the next song all that well it's just kind of a nother cliffhanger in the middle of this album and the you know just kind of a perplexing placement in the track listing you know I don't really mind that this record is just ten tracks long after all of these years whatever but at least deliver a series of songs that feel like they're actually developed and fleshed out and that they were kind of you know hammered out and thought about in the studio there are other more direct and hard-hitting tracks in the track listing here like separation anxiety and rise of the fall that I do enjoy but not much else on this record sort of strikes me as a highlight it seems like Faith No More still have their sound and they can still sort of bring that aura that you might expect from a faith no more song and performance wise I feel like these tracks are there but a lot of the murders really under written either that or they're kind of dabbling in these dramatic bells and whistles on a record that already has a pretty short time frame songs that are kind of taking whay potential runtime for another track like superhero so yeah you know this is just really another pretty underwhelming return from a band who you know had quite a bit of popularity in the 90s and now you know sort of do time for that comeback and yeah just to you know the results just sol invictus is mostly likable Faith No More didn't totally miss the mark I could see fans liking it but I don't know the just not a lot of this record sort of struck me as significant really I'm feeling a light decent six on this thing transition if you've given this record of listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Faith No More Sol Invictus forever 
8B4tHaw6Hb4,hi everyone lopsided tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jim O'Rourke record simple songs Jim is a prolific multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter a jack of all musical trades and he's been at it for decades now with his most popular releases falling kind of under that alternative singer/songwriter tag and on the albums that are in that style Jim takes on a multitude of different musical influences you might hear just indie rock or low-five music or country rock maybe even some art pop folk and chamber pop jazz did I say jazz jazz jazz and jazz and then we have a lot of gems solo work his early stuff the steam room series the old news series records that dabble in noise drone ambient improvisational music of different types he has also been in numerous bands over the years or has appeared on the records of numerous bands over the years then he has countless collaborative albums with Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth and Matt's gustafson as well as MERS Bao and Orrin embark just dropped a record with him he's also worked with the experimental jazz and rock band fire jim has more collaborative records than some artists just have normal core studio records so despite all of the various projects all the experimentation over the years with various forms of rock and electronic music and experimental music and everything simple songs heads back into that singer/songwriter direction that people seem to to to to to gravitate toward the most but truth be told simple songs is not really that simple on this LP we get a series of slightly eccentric rock and pop tunes that are highly Baroque with one layer of strings after another very lush Arrangements all over this record there's some nice piano weaved in as well and these arrangements steal the show to the point where they kind of outshine Jim's vocals which a bit of a letdown I don't think Jim has done a singer-songwriter record thus far at least to my knowledge though I have not heard all of his records shocker who has but what I know of his singer-songwriter material thus far he's just sounding a little more emotionally detached vocally than usual still he does bring some clever and decent lyrics from what I can make out of them on tracks like friends with benefits and half life crisis and a few of the songs toward the back end here where his vocals step out just a little bit more but for the most part his vocals lack so much presence that I just find my mind kind of just gravitating toward the instrumentals which actually aren't that bad I really like nearly every instrumental here like with the opening cut where we get the incredibly dramatic ascending guitar lead and strings that have finished the song out and the very nice country rock riffs that start the song off just feel really rootsy and fun and really captivating then with the song that weekend we are getting some baroque pop with some whispered vocals some just very lightly tempo keeping strings it's very dramatic Jim knows how to compose songs to elicit emotional reactions and on the song half life crisis we get a little 70s pop rock a little bit of 70s piano rock like in the vein of Tom Rundgren or Elton John I love the harmonized guitar leads on this track and later as the song progresses we get these almost orchestral layers of strings naissance however as the instrumentation piles on Jim's vocals get even more lost to the point where I'm just kind of wondering why even record a vocal to begin with on the more instrumentally stripped back tracks this isn't really that much of an issue but when Jim is kind of competing with his own instrumentation when he's singing I don't know I just can't help but feel like I'm not getting everything I could out of this record because a core element of his songwriting is just barely audible the vocals step out into the spotlight a little bit more like on the acoustic cut these hands or on last year which feels like a little bit of classic rock and it's it's at this point on the record that I guess this album fits the simple songs bill only in that it's not so abstract and experimental like many of Jim's other albums because while the very complicated instrumental arrangements all over the cell Pere pretty cool and just very much ear candy I just can't help but feel like there are again core elements of Jim's songwriting that are kind of neglected in the face of just kind of showing his talents for arranging and while the string arrangements aren't bad I mean they are key to especially how the back end of this record works I mean the very end of this album features some incredible building strength sections which give this album a powerful finish the track previous to that is one of the softer in the track listing here but is incredibly lush because of these arrangements just very pretty on the ears but I still can't help but feel like just an element of this recipe is kind of missing these bold and creative arrangements I think should also be complemented with a bold and creative and memorable lead vocal but really they're not and it's not like Jim's vocals are mixed low and kind of muffled or mumbled and an experimental or eccentric sense a lot of the time it just kind of feels like he's a just a little out to lunch so this thing was by no means a terrible record and I think hardcore fans will be excited to know that he's kind of returned to the sound even if it's just for for 37 minutes outside of the fact that it's been awhile since Jim has done a record like this I'm just not really seeing anything else to be excited over with this album because as I'm experiencing it musically just not much is sticking with me aside from the very finely tuned and well put-together instrumentals that is it just kind of feels like on the vocal end of things got kind of burned I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music review forever 
qE-RSAy3nZM,hi everyone mix the need tape tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new blank mass record dumb flesh blank mass is the solo electronic music project of one half of fuck buttons Benjamin John power Benjamin John power this is his second full-length LP under this name if you're not familiar with fuck buttons they're an electronic music duo who produce some pretty heavy psychedelic thick layered droney and epic electronic music repetitive driving kind of hypnotic beats paired with incredibly huge building textured walls of sound just a monstrous presentation in fuck buttons music though I have kind of always found the compositional end of things the inner workings the intricacies of their songs to be kind of just non-existent or predictable or obvious regardless that doesn't seem to be as much the case at least in my opinion on this new blank mass album even though blank mass does seem to have a lot of characteristics musical characteristics similar to that of fuck buttons on this LP jörg in those rough distorted textures those walls of sound that atmosphere that moodiness that hypnotic rhythmic repetition but with this blank mass record I'm just feeling a little bit more stylistic diversity like this solo project over here Benjamin doesn't quite have that much of a defined sound or idea so he can kind of jump from one electronic music style to the other so on this blank mass record you're kind of getting Benjamin's little twisted strange perverted not perverted but you you get what I'm saying interpretations on these various electro music styles like on the song atrophies which is just like one reverb plug-in away from a chill wave song or the track double-cross which kind of sounds like a driving dancey shrill and shoegaze II Crystal Castles track there's the introductory song on here which is like a serene chopped and screwed vaporwave instrumental with these slowed down syrupy vocals and then you get these droney tones as well and there's this shockingly bright ear-piercing outro to the end of this track which actually kicks the album off with just a really epic flavor like there's some really huge things to come on this thing there's the track long which is maybe one of the most tame tracks in the track listing here feels like a bit of ambient minimal techno very FX twin esque and the closing track on here Demetrius with it's very harsh grading just wall of noise intro and then the harmonious epic building walls of sound and tones that the track develops into feels just a lot like a track that could have landed on the last fuck buttons LP and while none of these tracks are terrible nothing is truly truly truly like so standout that I'm just like you know floored off the edge of my seat or anything like that again I just feel like we are kind of getting Benjamin trying a bunch of different things and we are getting mixed results some of the tracks are decent so the tracks are very good my favorites include the song dead format which is this shrieking Lea loud twisted freaky and scary piece of industrially tinged house music the beats are metallic they're heavy they're hard hitting and while the groove is very danceable there's something very horrific about the tone just all the sounds that surround this hypnotically danceable rhythm I mean movie companies should be lining up with just piles of cash in their hands to be like please let me put this in my movie trailer for this horror movie that I'm going to be putting out please then there's the track cruel sport which is a bit of industrial e tinged dance music as well that actually might have been an amazing direction to go in with this record from front to back but that might have taken away from the diverse of this album which is pretty good I mean there's a pretty good flow on here and again Benjamin approaches a lot of different styles and sometimes he's just overshadowed by the obvious influences on this record just a little bit though still those very textured large scary fuck button s walls of sound do kind of carry through a lot of these songs and at least bring this album some kind of consistency it's a bit of a trademark so going into each track while Benjamin does hop from one idea to the next there are these recurring characteristics that tie this record together I can't really say anything other than that it's a decent LP if you're looking for a varied electronic music record with a lot of sound a lot of texture a lot of driving rhythms then look this thing up I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this transition have you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it to create it why would you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Blanc mass dumb flesh forever 
c2HOlow4F0Y,hi everyone therapy session oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new snip dog record Bush iconic West Coast emcee Snoop Doggy Dogg and his new Pharrell Williams produced record over here Bush with features from Stevie Wonder Ti rick ross kendrick lamar when Stefani of no doubt Charlie Wilson and again on this LP we have Pharrell Williams star producer songwriter The Neptunes NER D and recently his career has been hotter than ever thanks to the work he's done with Daft Punk and his own solo stuff I mean huge hit with the song happy off his last full-length LP he's also been all over the voice there's just not much more visibility Pharrell could be getting right now and then there's Snoop Dogg who doesn't really need much of an introduction either this is his first solo album under his dog name since turning into a reggae lion a few years ago a move most music careers probably would not have survived but Snoop is is not in the position of most musicians he is one of the godfathers and an architects of modern rap as we know it and he's responsible for some of the genres most memorable and significant songs that's not really a reputation you could shake overnight plus all the extracurricular activities he would do after the 90s collaborations movie appearances so on and so forth as well as some solid singles would sort of turn him into this worldwide icon Hong Kong he's just kind of become this universally celebrated figure not just because of his music but because of his image and his style and just his vibe that he brings in music or in interviews or whatever project he sort of involved involved now let's also get out of the way much of Snoop Dogg's discography since his second album has been super super mediocre almost every record he's put out since then has had at least a few decent singles on it but you know let's be honest snoops success at least right now or as of late doesn't really hinge on him putting out a good record snoops place in hip-hop history is solidified and he's been doing a good job just kind of keeping his brand alive by staying in the public eye and you know doing that doesn't necessarily involve making just top-notch records or anything like that I mean at this point all we really require of Snoop Dogg is that he does a few decent appearances and hops on other people's singles as well as drops maybe a good single or two on his own every year and you know at this point he's essentially filled that annual or sort of biannual quota especially with the song peaches and cream which is the lead single off of this LP has an old-school synth funk vibe to it think like George Clinton Funkadelic Rick James Prinze for some more recent examples Thundercat chromeo Mark Ronson but the production on this track and Pharrell's approach to reliving this very popular at one time genre it's just way more clean and smooth not necessarily in a bad way it's just kind of Pharrell style the lyrics on the chorus of this song are almost total trash but there are some very charismatic bars in the verses on this track I don't do for the haters I do put up if the rest of this LP followed peaches-and-cream formula it actually wouldn't have been that bad but snoop does far more singing than he does rapping all over this album peaches-and-cream features the few rap verses the snoop actually brings to the table snoop sings so much on this record when other rappers hop on he just kind of merely sounds like the guest singer on his own song and then the rapper comes in to kind of do their thing and the guest verses on this LP aren't really that bad I mean TI's appearance is pretty decent Kendricks verses great Rick Ross is ok not that I was really expecting that much from Rick Ross the the Maybach music watermark is is just so annoying why does happening everywhere my issue with this record really though is that snoops singing isn't particularly good it's mixed very low on most of these songs and it sounds like it's just undergone some very heavy manipulations I'm not trying to say auto-tune or anything like that but there's just something kind of faintly robotic and stiff and inhuman about the way snoops vocals sound on this LP the singing is particularly bad on the song I knew that and with Gwen Stefani on the song runaway Snoop and Gwen just sound incredibly awkward together like the collaboration could just not have been more stiff which is kind of sad because it's one of the better instrumentals on this LP I mean really the star of the show on this record for me was Pharrell I mean snoops singing is so quiet on most of this record that my head can't help but gravitate toward whatever the beats are doing especially since they're more interesting I mean even if the vocals were bad I don't understand why not mix them louder if Snoop is supposed to be the star of the show and for those of you who didn't really see this sound or this direction coming I mean you had to have heard peaches and cream and also snoop not too long ago did a collaborative record with Dame funk whose production style is primarily synth funk but that was kind of a you know a smaller independent underground release it was okay it had its moments I prefer Dame's production style maybe just a little bit more than Pharrell's when it comes to this synth funk sound I think Dame's beats and his grooves just kind of rock a little bit harder his synth tones have just maybe a little bit more bite so while there are good elements about this record whether it be the beats or maybe the tune of a song or maybe a what a guest does when they come onto a track little to nothing of this records goodness in my opinion has to do with snoop at least when it comes to the performance aspect I mean you know maybe he was writing a lot of what makes this album so good in terms of its writing but the singing is just so bland and uninteresting and quiet and and not that skilled I mean for me there wasn't really much of anything outside of one song that I could say snoop really hooked me in and then kept me interested mmm even though people probably aren't going to slag this project as much as they did Snoop lion because it just seems so I don't know weird and ridiculous to us at the time that he would make that sudden change in trajectory this record to me is a lot like that snoop lion album in that it just kind of feels like a weekly put together vanity project which if snoop wants to do that if snoop just wants to go totally synth funk and do his own thing and just you know not really care about the quality or the results because he just kind of wants to have fun making this kind of music because it is hugely influential to you know his music from back in the day and you know the this this style of music is really significant to his progression as an artist if because of that he kind of wants to dabble in it a little bit and he has the money to put it out on his own imprint more power to him however that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to like it especially with such weak vocal performances from front to back I'm feeling a strong four to a life five on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it

pFCy16vPT7c,hi everyone say ffunny Fantino here the internet's busiest and then amanda and it's time for a review of the new holly herndon record platform Holly Herndon is an electronic music producer whose style relies heavily on these jittery glitchy techno beats laced with some of the strangest vocal manipulations I've heard on record I first ran into Holly's music in 2012 through her album movement an album that was pretty intriguing had some mind-bending ideas on it though there were some songs that kind of felt like very short unmemorable motifs or detours and the whole album itself was a pretty short of breath but still this LP and Holly kind of sounded like they were onto something and with this newest LP over here I wouldn't necessarily say it's a more coherent or more enjoyable record than movement but it is definitely longer and shows Holly trying to flesh out some of the ideas on her last LP past some of these very abstract and rough sounds now I did love the singles leading after the release of this LP the song home as well as the track chorus a track that when it kicks off it sounds like this faint electronic art pop jam but then it eventually becomes this bustling electronic music track with these multiple soft voiced vocal layers and now that I hear in the context of the record it's not terrible but I do wish there were at least a few vocals that were just a little bit louder and and bolder to kind of kick out of the mix of vocals on this track a bolder voice kind of like on the song unequal and experimental vocal cut that lands later in the tracklisting here where we get some singing that is very dramatic it's slow it's just a little more urgent and upfront and louder - sometimes when Holly throws a lot of vocals into these songs they don't end up so much disorienting and kind of glitchy like they were on movement rather they just bleed together into this I don't know wall of mush but home and chorus are our two of the more accessible tracks in the tracklisting here there are more oddball songs here like unequal where we kind of get this very slow like I said urgent and dramatic singing against this kind of glitchy non-musical backdrop it's it's it's a bit of a it's it's just an abstract piece these vocals are literally paired with just some kind of strange unpredictable sound effects just going on in the background on paper and in theory I guess it's an interesting combination of sounds and ideas but as I'm listening to it there wasn't anything too intriguing or moving about it then we have the song Locker leak which sounds in a way like a bit of Laurie Anderson esque spoken word set against some vocal harmonies as I listened to the track I kind of realized that the spoken word kind of sounds like it could be copy from like advertisements or something like that hearing stuff like be the first of your friends to try this product it was kind of strange and then with the song lonely at the top this track felt like pure a.s.m.r if you don't know what that is look it up there actually a lot of youtube videos about it where you kind of have these people that are just kind of in hopes to elicit some kind of you know tingly feeling moving throughout your body or just kind of in your ears or in your head look it up well anyway this track is essentially an ASMR piece where Holly is not only just speaking throughout the entirety of the song in this very soft voice no music or anything and this is for several minutes but it also kind of has a storyline to it too I feel like I'm listening to some kind of - to people I think that we're supposed to be hearing two people here maybe twins or something like that the person talking is always referring to we and us outside of the person that they're supposed to be talking to and these people I'm sort of guessing from the dialogue on this track our masseuses or like escorts or something like that you know they seem to be servicing this person in some kind of fashion and they're always talking about like oh I don't know how you do it you're so amazing you work so hard I'm glad that you're taking out the time to take care of yourself so on and so forth it's an interesting idea and the first time I've ever heard of this kind of thing on a musical album but uh you know it's it's it doesn't really do too much for me in the tracklisting here and I mean it you know really adds nothing to the flow of this thing I mean it just kind of adds to the overall feeling that this album is just a mixed bag of some strange and some more accessible ideas there are sweeter and just easier to digest songs in the tracklisting here aside from the singles like the track morning Sun this track has a nice vocal melody to it love the refrain although I wish the lead vocals went a little bit harder because they do blend into the other vocal layers a little bit too much like on chorus and on home it's kind of strange Holly does pull together some intriguing ideas on this more accessible as well as the more experimental side of the fence but rarely do these two worlds come together on this record we're either getting something that you know seems very very sweet and very very straightforward if a little muddy it points with the vocals and then we're just getting these completely just whacked out ideas kind of like lonely at the top if there was just a little bit more crossover I could have seen this album being more consistent and maybe even more interesting too because I mean you know some pop song were to kind of develop out of that ASMR vocal sound that could actually be you know kind of refreshing and new I liked the song and exit as well which also features a pretty great vocal melody it is a little Bjork ish at points not really a vibe that came through on Holly's last album quite as much as it does on this particular track and the song Dow which has this heavy industrial be really primal feel to this rhythm is one of the more exciting and hard hitting cuts in the tracklisting here too and on this song some of the vocal experiments and glitches and manipulations are much stranger as strange as what they used to be on movement the they just don't seem to be as out there on this record consistently and and Dow definitely sticks out because of that sonically this is a pretty chilling track as well there's something very fearful about the way this instrumental sounds and I liked it it was very nice change of mood overall this wasn't a bad LP it was decent I wouldn't say it was more exciting than movement it just felt like the more experimental tracks weren't really that attention-grabbing or awe-inspiring and the poppier songs just you know weren't really sticking with me and after a while just kind of became background music especially with how all those vocal layers blended together in such an unmemorable way but I will say Holly does take some risks with this record and if you're looking for a producer who has an interesting take on pop music on experimental music as well I think you're going to hear some interesting ideas on this record I'm feeling a decent strong six on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music review forever 
D46urKgzDbY,oh hi everyone super hot tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new pest Anwar record Lachey's diabla oh and I'm partially French this is the latest full-length LP from the loud eccentric versatile and sometimes offensive black metal project pest you are fronted by a singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist composer in a sense famine who has worked with a handful of different musicians over the course of this project lifespan a lot of whom have ties to some pretty prominent French black metal acts however don't assume this project is very just blissful atmospheric the indie kids they love the atmospheric black metal it's just so hot right now it's hot much more like traditional black metal Peston wores approach to the style is just very harsh unforgiving aggressive you have the tremolo picot arse the blast beats the rest vocals but I think the similarities kind of stop there in a way even with this projects debut LP and a few albums that followed it peste Noire had a pretty straightforward black metal sound but still there was something kind of freakish and weird about it the shrieking over-the-top vocals and then we have some of the full instrumentation that would end up on these records then in 2011 Peston wash stop blurring the line between experimentation and black metal purity and just smashed it with this LP this thing has a title I believe translates to the pure essence or maybe odor of garbage and maybe for some who didn't like this album it was exactly that but for me it was kind of this theatrical schizophrenic avant-garde black metal album bringing in elements of not just black metal but folk music and French medieval music and classical music as well as industrial and some kind of danceable beats - this thing was chaotic and yet the production was way cleaner than any previous album from this project it was very just a bit of a mess but also refined and sounding really nice I mean there were legit classical musicians brought in to perform on this record though I did mention it at the time I was kind of hesitant to praise it but in retrospect I think I can call this album modern black metals most enjoyable clusterfuck to me this album even though it hasn't received a whole ton of praise from the black metal community I think it is a bit of a high-water mark in Peston Juarez discography now the following self-titled album that came out after this LP it contained a lot of the same experimental elements but in just much more straightforward songs and just more lo-fi production it was kind of a bit of a return to form for Peston war but still the the changes that the project had undergone on the last album were still very much there and that kind of brings us to this new LP over here which kind of sounds like a lot of the same experimentation with full Kinsmen tation from the last two albums as well so very hard-hitting straightforward black metal on this LP but with just higher quality production it seems that making just like seriously freakish long-winded indulgent and and noisy metal was just kind of a bit of a detour maybe this project will kind of go back to that eventually but this new LP over here while it is enjoyable it's not anywhere near as diverse or surprising instrumentally or stylistically you're getting guitars vocals drums some keys on here - all condensed into about eight tracks or so even though this is a more straightforward black metal sound peste Noire is is definitely still very animated when it comes to the performance of these tracks and this sound overall I mean I kind of anticipated it because it's roughly the same direction that the project was going in on a recently released EP the title track off which actually appears on this album over here but it's like a different version the opening track on this thing is like an acoustic cut with some fluttering electric guitar leads and these very gruesome cartoony retched and gargled and grumbled vocals all in French I don't know French but reading into the titles of these tracks you can kind of get a grip of what exactly is being addressed or sung about over the course of this album whether it be sort of government overthrow or the devil or wine a couple other things and even though this this acoustic intro with these strange vocals it's a little bit uh silly considering Peston wores recent output it's it's really kind of fitting and this could be a good thing this could be a bad thing depending on kind of your taste for black metal but all the oddity on the record at least for a good span of time is kind of just all thrown out right here in the intro track because as soon as we get into the second song here we're just straight into some quickly strum chords some blast beats great melodies to just really evil dark sinister SEC stuff the vocals the guitars the drums the performances of these instruments on these tracks is ferocious it's nasty it's brutal and again even though it is straightforward kind of like the early stuff a little bit there is a bit of a freakish side especially on the third track here where we're getting like these how old the vocals it's it's like in the midst of the track famine is just turning into a werewolf we get some female vocals kind of hopping in in the tail end of this track bringing a bit of beauty and and refinement to the song Peston waar and a lot of black metal in my opinion has always been about kind of the mix of of beauty and and ugly and faman most definitely does that with his own kind of style and approach and I think that should be appreciated on this record now toward the middle of this LP with tracks like the devil exists in the title track these are two of the longest tracks in the track listing here just mmm I just wish maybe they were fleshed out with some more instrumentation because there are moments here where things get a little redundant especially when I guess the songs just lean a little bit heavier on the vocals we're getting just kind of these shouted angry vocals against these repetitive riffs and kind of drum patterns or we're getting a little bit of spoken word maybe if you were a Frenchman or a native speaker you might just be getting a bit more enjoyment out of these passages than me I guess I'm just sort of missing that instrumental color that was so amazing on that 2011 album now with the to finishing tracks in the track listing here we get some more of that color we get more of that folk Instrumentation back an awesome accordion solo though at the very end of the final track here we kind of get this strange falsetto gargling vocals that are just a tad too ridiculous I just kind of giggled at them however I don't think Peston wores approach to black metal is supposed to be as legitimately frightening as some other artists approach to black metal honestly the way I see famine toying with this genre it just seems more like a really angry troll that's kind of shouting at you and covered in boils and and very freaky and very scary but you know still like you know kind of like a very homely troll I just see pest Anwar is just more of a flamboyant approach to black metal and I feel like with these last two albums after such a colorful and exuberant album with the pure essence of garbage now we're kind of getting just this this planar sound this planar approach though it's still decent it's not quite as exciting at least to me anyway but you know let me know what you think I'm feeling a decent 7 on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you freaking hit it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino Ben doesn't wanna forever 
TBgmf37MGtg,haha colony plumber tan oh here the internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new hiatus coyote record choose your weapon hiatus coyote a melbourne australia band who has actually been seeing a bit of a break out with this sophomore album of theirs over here it seems quite a few people are gravitating toward the band's approach to neo soul yes neo soul you might already be familiar with the Styles very funky laid-back chilled lightly jazzy style thanks to artists like Jill Scott and Erykah Badu and Maxwell even a bit of Lauryn Hill the style isn't quite as active or as popular as it used to be although last year we did have that fantastic sudden release from D'Angelo and then there's also the satisfaction who I would not feel right doing this review if I didn't mention them definitely the most significant new musical group kind of carrying the torch for this style today not only pushing it forward into the future with some very progressive production and musical ideas but also they make some very obvious and clear references and tributes to the Great's of this style and given the recent popularity and trendiness of alternative R&B right now it really only makes sense that there would be a new breed of artists out there that are kind of you know fussing around with neo-soul as well and that's where hiatus coyote comes in with this new record over here it's very dense album but despite the hour of material on this LP the new ideas are very few and far between over the course of the 18 or so tracks on this record I don't think hiatus coyote really shows anything more than just kind of a baseline level of intimacy with this style of music much of the time the sound that they bring to the table is pretty standard for this style and the performances in the execution are pretty average the only thing I'm consistently impressed by on this LP are the winding chord progressions are kind of the unpredictable song structures here and there there are quite a few tracks in the track listing here that suddenly will just make a total change in sound or instrumentation or vibe and it's impressive that hiatus coyote can just so quickly just switch up what they're doing musically on a dime but often they are switching from just kind of one slightly unmemorable idea to the next and I'm just kind of getting a pile of neo-soul flavored clutter most notably on the track Shaolin monk mother funk where we are getting tons of changes across the course of the track and no real excitement or tension building up to each change we're just kind of getting you know one different idea sort of just crashed into another and it just really all blurs together uninterestingly there's also the track Jekyll although this song has less changes and the big change that it does make kind of just makes more compositional sense yeah what's kind of a letdown for me is that there are a lot of moments in the track listing here where it seems like hiatus coyote's is trying to do something experimental but they really just stopped short of that some of the kind of weird odd jagged vocal harmonies are definitely a change of pace for this style they strike me as Dirty Projectors ish at points especially on the song lung which is very very indie folk ish it's like on this song hiatus coyote actually switches genres suddenly and even though for the most part these vocal harmonies these quirky vocal harmonies aren't too bad they're not so plentiful that it's really kind of a bold characteristic for hiatus coyote or even a selling point for this record I guess it's just kind of difficult to put into words exactly what this band's approach is to this style of music because they don't really take a bold approach or stylize this genre and in a in a unique or distinct way there are definitely a lot of synthesizers a lot of keyboards on this record as if that kind of sets hiatus coyote apart not really I mean a lot of the time it just kind of sounds like some I don't know some some very light haphazard flying lotus worship to an extent okay to sort of put one of my main issues with this LP bluntly it takes incredibly faint risks with this style of music but it seems to be I guess sort of convinced that they're actually bigger and bolder than they really are because if you sort of ignore the the synthesizers and the weird vocals and the and the sudden changes of pace all these bells and whistles I mean we're just kind of getting some very stiff plain neo-soul and sounds from kind of the less commercial side of R&B in the late 90s and the early 2000s on here occasionally in the tracklisting here we might be getting some layers of synthesizers making things kind of psychedelic or maybe some references to some other genres very subtle references but for the most part the instrumentals here just feel like very middle-of-the-road neo-soul which brings me to my next big issue with this record which are the vocals and this for a group in this style is where hiatus coyote should be bringing the most but they really just really come up short night palm or napalm actually has a pretty good command of pitch and melody when it's sort of in that bit of her range where she just feels more comfortable I can tell she's more comfortable or at least she just can push out notes with a bit more force and emotion and passion once she kind of reaches lower into her register her volume and her her delivery really just kind of fizzles out a little bit and not only is she constantly hanging in that lower side of her range on this album but I guess what I want to say is the inflections she uses and the cadence with which she sings just kind of sounds like I'm listening to a lot of R&B and neo-soul cliches like she's singing in the voice of like a stereotype of someone in the genre or like it like it's a parody like if you were trying to make fun of somebody who was a neo soul singer you would try to sing like this oh hey we'll just the constant vibrato the constant just jumping up and down in your range so as a result of those aerial being such a big turn-off from front to back on this album I really only end up enjoying the instrumentals which even they can be as I said before kind of middle-of-the-road and even the production on this album is sort of shoddy for the most part the keys sound pretty good the guitar sound clear but the bass and the drums are pretty flat and colorless when they should be incredibly vibrant because they are bringing forth the grooves that are so essential to this style of music the drums are so boomy and Hollow the bass doesn't really carry that much weight in the mix I just wish one thing just one single thing about this album was like exceptional or superb the writing is OK the grooves just the vibe of the performances on this record it's okay the vocals at their best they're okay there are a few odd sort of experimental oddball sounds and songs here and there they sort of lay these tracks on a little bit more heavily in the second half of the track listing here with tracks like Jekyll and Atari and lung the song molasses and the track by fire it seems like hiatus coyote to me is just taking all the risks and whipping out all the weird compositional ideas in the second half that they should have just been using in the first half and not only that but it's not like there are so many amazing ideas and the track listing here that it justifies that hour-long runtime of this album I appreciate that hiatus coyote are trying and you know just making music in this style isn't typically something a group of people just you know get together just be like oh you know it'd be cool if we just like you know started making some neo-soul music you know like that just be cool I think it's safe to assume that they're making this music because somewhere in the group there is a burning passion for music in this style however I don't really feel like that pours through because the performances don't really feel like they take into account the the intricate details of this style of music in a way it kind of reminds me of the last Arcade Fire record where the band incorporated all these musical styles that they had been playing with before some of which it went over well and the songs where it didn't they just merely sounded like just tourists toying with the style of music that they weren't fully comfortable in and I think that's kind of how hiatus coyote sounds to me on this record over here with neo-soul they just sound like to me they haven't quite mastered this sound and aren't quite yet to the point where they could experiment with it in a bold and exciting way but they definitely seem to be putting effort in and I mean they've come this far and I think there are at least a handful of great ideas and some good songs in the track listing here who's to say that they couldn't pull through on their next LP with you know just some better productions and better songs and just a more refreshing approach I'm feeling a strong 5-5-5 transition if you've given this album we'll listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana hiatus coyote choose your weapon forever 
VvKeBjz1NYI,[Music] hi everyone okay the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new the tallest man on earth album dark bird is home the tallest man on earth is the musical pseudonym of songwriter Christian Matson a contemporary folk singer and guitarist hailing from Sweden whose talents have burned so brightly that he has been on a fantastic creative streak with his past three records despite the fact that the sound of these three albums has been so incredibly skeletal much of the songs on these albums are just vocals and guitar and the simple instrumental build of these albums never really quite bothered me that much though it did make them sound kind of one-dimensional but Matson is actually just a really great singer and songwriter so just to kind of hear his bear Tunes laying to just vocals and acoustic guitar was pretty nice and charming I mean you know it wasn't just we were hearing simple songs but he most definitely took advantage of this very straightforward approach in a great way by giving us some very charming quaint kind of rootsy and organic music with these albums in my opinion pretty much every tallest man on earth record up until this point has been very catchy melodic charming and even though there was a lack of progression in the tallest man on earth catalogue stylistically and instrumentally I kind of admired Matson's adherence to this style I mean it kind of became his trademark his simple aesthetic trademark even his last full-length LP which did bring some extra instrumentation into the fold the sound surrounding his voice and the guitars were very very faint however that doesn't change the fact that the obvious direction for Matson to going eventually is to just incorporate full instrumentation into his record some electric guitars and bass and drums and maybe some string sections and some horns it seems like when somebody becomes successful making folk music what they need to do right after is just stop making it and Matson is held out on doing that for a long time but the floodgates break on this new album over here where we hear some extra guitars in the mix some strings we hear more piano we hear some prominent drums too and all of this extra instrumentation on this record when it comes together it forms this big bright blissful wall of blandness take the opening track on this LP fields of our home which kicks off with these gently strum guitars and very pained vocals which you might expect from just about any tallest man on earth song maybe Matson is kind of you know really cracking his voice up yelping a little bit when he's singing the kind of you know work up that emotional quality the lyrics on this track thus far are pretty good Matson has consistently proved himself to be a talented lyricist as well and then as the song progresses along we start getting these faint ethereal strings popping in that don't really match the guitars as well as the vocals in terms of just organic miss or rootsy miss they feel very saccharine sugary just a little I don't know plain and overproduce doesn't really match that very authentic and human charm that I look for in a tallest man on earth song and these bundles of extra instrumentation are either depleting that completely or they're popping into songs like this where I'm kind of getting this strip back vibe from the vocals from the guitars and they just don't really match the foundation of what you typically get in a tallest man on earth track the next track on this LP darkness of the dream in my opinion gets even worse I mean it goes full folk-pop with these just distant cracking snares playing in the background as well as just this bundle of of strings and just everything bleeds together so much all the extra instrumentation that it's hard to pull it apart and tell exactly what's going on and not only that but this extra instrumentation kind of competes with the guitars and the vocals almost drowning Matson's vocals out during some moments which may in part be due to some substandard mixing not totally sure and I don't know just not feeling this full pop vibe on this record I don't think the tallest man on earth goes like full Lumineers on this track but he steps over a similarly sugary boundary that's kind of below him because in a way some of these watered-down full pop groups I feel like they wish they could be as organic and as just human as tallest man on Earth's early stuff I feel like now we're just kind of going in the opposite direction just a lack of relatability here a lack of humanity I feel like the tallest man on earth is is trading in his unique characteristics just for a little extra instrumentation the next track on this LP singers is very nice I love the sweet finger picking on this track and the viola that has worked into this song complements the guitars and the vocals very nicely but it for me this track just kind of felt like a thank you for sitting through the previous two but still if more instrumentation needed to be incorporated onto this record why not like this it just feels more tasteful it just feels more in the moment I feel like Christian is playing with other musicians not just some kind of overproduced post-production instrumentation that was just thrown into the song afterwards because some of the instrumentation on this LP it doesn't sound like I'm listening to a band of people just make really sweet intimate music together I feel like I'm listening to just a multitrack mess like on the song save grace the instrumental on this track sounds like I'm listening to one of these new indie folk groups that should have stopped it for members but instead they have 14 and actually I don't really mind the song at the core of this track the big lunk amenity isn't too bad either but the instrumentation is just so freakin and it's stiff it's lifeless I don't even feel like I'm listening to the same artists thankfully there are single songs on this record that I do enjoy but they often end up being the simpler tracks the more stripped back tracks like the song little nowhere towns which is a piano ballad its kind of sad but it has a nice jig to it as well there's the track Timothy where we hear some drums viola guitars vocals but it feels like it's just live in the moment you're hearing a group of musicians play together not just some studio trickery and the last track the title track on here a kind of cosign as well though the ethereal instrumentation pops back in right at the very end of the song to kind of give the track in the album a very sudden finish in this incredibly standard 10 track tracklist overall this new tallest man on earth LP it's still decent in a lot of ways I think that fans are most definitely going to love it and I did find at least a good handful of tracks on here that I loved and even most of the songs that I wasn't head over heels with they were at least decent or likeable in some kind of respect the tracks that were really ruined by this extra instrumentation are really few and far between but still I really don't see myself running back to this record anytime soon especially with much stronger and much more consistent and enjoyable records already in this guy's discography I'm feeling a strong 6 - a light 7 on this LP and furthermore I want to say one more thing I feel like the tallest man on earth could most definitely come through with a much better record after making this instrumental decision because there are spots on this album where extra instrumentation is brought in like on Timothy and it sounds great it's just that if it's got to happen if it's gonna happen just make it sound more in the moment more organic just make the instrumentation that you bring in sound tangible not just some kind of glossy fake over reverb afterthought transition so what's the deal do you like it do you hate it are you two watching didn't you just fast-forward to the part where you said the number and then you press back I mean what does a guy even say here nobody knows nobody knows not even me just kidding forever well hold on just a second I also review records on my channel here lies music but I don't got the kind of time than a three Fantino does so my reviews are 10-15 seconds long very efficient very thorough I think you'd like it [Music] 
c3PFKqZXmkU,ah hi everyone Oh thony Boitano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new wale album album about nothing wale is a lyricist a rapper hailing from DC who showed quite a bit of creativity in the mid and late 2000s when he was dropping a lot of mixtapes but the charm that would come through on some of these free projects never quite for me anyway translated onto his commercial records which is a pretty common problem in hip-hop music although it seems to be kind of decreasing because we have a lot of mixtapes out there that really are quality albums except they're being given away for free and we have other artists out there that are taking their mixtapes and selling them commercially regardless enjoying wall A's commercial projects for me anyway has not been easy especially since he was suddenly scooped up by Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group the first record he actually ended up dropping on label was the album ambition an album that in my opinion really showed anything but ambition the only thing this album really strived for was to be an incredibly middle-of-the-road pop rap album a project that was so disappointing I completely tuned out Wally's next one but this new album over here caught my eye mostly because of its cover and its title which is not just a reference to a fantastic TV show but also a reference to one of Wally's earliest and most celebrated mixtapes would he come through with a commercial project that actually goes back to that I guess older younger hunger and creativity who was displaying in his early work maybe with more ambition and a bigger sound given that you have a larger budget on an MMG album and one part of that assumption is correct because this album certainly sounds expensive a lot of the beats on this LP are pretty Spacey or they are grand and illustrious a lot like the opening track on here which features some really fantastic nimble pianos some very bright and very upbeat background vocals the the kind of jazzy combination of pianos vocals on this beat reminds me a little bit of something that could have been on the chance the rapper acid rap mixtape the instrumentals for the most part on this LP are pretty impressive doesn't sound like there's a whole lot of sampling and maybe even some live instrumentation thrown into the mix on a handful of these tracks again kind of sounds expensive and let's not forget the multitude of vocal clips on this record from either Jerry Seinfeld just either talking or talking to wall a or clips of Seinfeld hit TV show Seinfeld which run throughout this album and don't really feel like they're placed randomly or anything like that it feels like a lot of the time wale is pulling song idea inspiration from these clips from Jerry talking or just his show whether it be on the song white shoes where we're hearing about vanity and materialism or we have George talking about the appeal of hopelessness or we have Jerry talking about later in the album how people love to you know talk we do and this is a pretty creative idea not just for a rap album but for any album really for an artist to kind of base the concepts of the songs around a really great TV show I mean you know I think there are very few shows you could actually do that with other than Seinfeld because there are so many episodes that touch down on so many different things in a funny and unique way and and given recent releases this album is actually hilarious for another reason mostly because I kind of feel like the the Kendrick Tupac dynamic on to pimp a butterfly is a lot like the wall a Seinfeld dynamic on on this record Wally is talking to Seinfeld as if you know he's got this boundless knowledge and you know I'm not talking about Jerry Seinfeld I mean you know for sure he's been in the industry so long and he's been so successful I'm sure he's learned a thing or two I'm just saying it's a kind of funny inclusion and I think in a way it was inspired for Wally to incorporate such heavy Seinfeld themes on this record but this album inspiration for me kinda stops there well not quite there I mean I do like the instrumentals on this record for the most part there are very slow Serie B sub bass heavy bangers in the tracklist here beats that kind of feel really dreamy like a fusion of cloud wrap and trap music or we're getting tracks on here that are a little more lively and feature a lot of jazzy instrumentation Keys horns background vocals and a lot of the instrumentals here either feature a very heavy dose of reverb of atmosphere or they're just generally smooth in sound and in tone even with some of the beats on here having some pretty punchy percussion or even lively vocals like on the the song the bloom which features a very strong peppy soul flavor most of the time I feel like when I'm listening to this album I'm in a bit of a dream state and it's a dream state that I actually wish wale is rapping in his delivery woke me up from at least occasionally from his flow to his lyrics this is just another project for me from wale that doesn't really do all that much for me outside of a few bars here and there there's one part where wale says on this album that DC means don't come a kind of funny moment but most of the time on this record wale isn't particularly bad but he is not particularly great either there are load of tracks on the first half of this LP where we're getting just these ambien raps about him making music or just his place in hip-hop as a genre although there are moments on here like the pessimist where I do give wale kudos for tossing in some politically charged and kind of socially aware lyrics referencing some pretty dark and intense current events and maybe if wale kind of just stuck to these two things this LP could have been decent but he does one other thing on this record something he didn't do quite as much on ambition he sings he sings quite a bit on numerous tracks and as far as I know wale isn't really known for being a fantastic singer or anything like that and when he does sing on this album a lot of the time it just ends up as this semi tone deaf moaning that reminds me a lot of like some of Kid Cudi's worst tracks like on the white shoes where wale is off-key hard or the glass egg or the gods smile which are equally unpleasant in some respects or the track the middle finger where the hook on the song is is literally you leave me Allah at that point I wish I could have but there were still 9 more tracks so we have wale giving this plane delivery a lot of the time or he is singing off-key or he is maybe sounding a little aggressive a little hard kind of like a young hungry Jay Cole or he is getting a little goofy like on the track the girls on drugs where he's kind of given this deep sort of chest pumping worst behavior ish rap voice he's really on his Drake with this track especially how he goes from this deep-voiced delivery to this soft croon on the chorus in the middle of the tracklist here we have the very druggie slow jam one time in Houston where the forget ability of this album is essentially just brought down to a lower BPM thankfully scissor shows up out of nowhere to deliver some decent singing on the need to know but when wale steps up to rap he sounds kinda half asleep kind of like he just had sex which is fitting because this track is about friends-with-benefits and it could have been decent but just out of nowhere just more Seinfeld clips more Seinfeld clips I like the simple beat on this thing in the acoustic guitar too but with the Seinfeld there's just there's too much of a good thing I mean the point was already made with the Seinfeld clip at the beginning of the track the point did not need to be made further I'm really kind of tired of hearing it by the end of the record even with the track matrimony where Jerry talking on the song actually makes a really smart and poignant observation comparing marriage and just sort of relationships and at the point of marriage to the drop in a roller coaster not that the quality of the relationship drops necessarily but you know that's where things kind of get a little intense and how there are some big life events like marriage that no matter how much you prepare for them you're never quite 100% ready and I love uh sure --za pearance on this track too and the instrumental again it's a beautiful instrumental another beautiful instrumental on this record rack one up for the producers on this album but this track what Wally says what he raps on this song just seemed so unfitting given that we just had a friends-with-benefits track just a few tracks ago and also with the theme of the hook and the theme of Jerry and the theme of the song wale is actually rapping about just this inability or the sphere to commit with his music and his lifestyle and his career kind of getting in the way in a sense and maybe just this attraction and the stability for him to attain multiple women given where he is in life right now but he kind of comes to the conclusion later in the song he needs to settle down eventually Wow to be that young woman that Wally settles for so lucky meanwhile the closing track on this thing is kind of like this really failed attempt at trying to be sexy with Jeremih singing on the hook here as soon as Sousa comes in this album just goes just full pop rap R&B fusion which again is fine but for a record that tries to be so thematic and conceptual especially at its start it kind of falls apart completely at its finish which I understand how much conceptuality can you be expecting from an album about nothing but that's not literally what this is I mean it's it's just a reference because wale definitely tried to make this record about himself money love and a multitude of other things but he's just so uninteresting and the singing oh the singing so I mean yeah just another wall a project completely lost on me I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition Amen did you give this you two listen if so what the did you think did you live it did you it tell me why cuz I want to know oh and what should a prety review next this is your boy Mike C town representing one-fifth the dead and hip-hop crew also co-founder the black ups and widow's alliance make sure after you

fIJvY0sOP7E,yes yes I've been working out some incantations hopefully I can say them aloud maybe do a bit of a which Blackmagic thing and and hopefully kill the demon will hi everyone c'est fini Cal tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Torres LP sprinter Torres is the musical pseudonym of singer-songwriter Mackenzie Scott who under this name is on her second full-length LP here unfortunately Mackenzie's first LP didn't really stop me in my tracks but leading up to the release of this new album here I heard pretty fantastic single strange hellos great song easily one of the better rock songs of the year with these very heavy pummeling alt-rock grunge style guitars very reminiscent of like a whole song very angsty emotionally shattering vocals on this track with a kind of sad story to back it up and the song makes for a pretty hard-hitting intro on this album since it is not just the lead single from this LP but also the introductory track the album glides into the song new skin which if I'm reading the lyrics correctly I believe we're dealing with maybe marriage or like religion on this track I often find Torres's lyrics to be kind of intriguing even if at times they are a little plain sort of like at the end of this track where she's kind of moaning about the darkness and and fears this track has some heavy guitars as well it's just another powerfully sad rock tune and so far with these two songs the album is off to a good start but sprinter is is I don't know I mean I don't want to use a corny metaphor but I'm gonna use one anyway I guess secretly when you say that you actually do want to use a corny metaphor I digress but sprinter loses speed very fast as we get into the third song of this record we have the very ominous song son you are no island where Torres actually brings some pretty turd emotive vocals on this track but musically the song isn't really that interesting just again musically and song wise the track isn't that enjoyable or memorable the track really just kind of feels like in a long gated interlude or motif and as sprinter moves along Torres continues to deliver some pretty good vocals over increasingly uninspired instrumentals like with a proper polish welcome which is very vast it's very open kind of dramatic in a way while it isn't as electronic or synthetic reminds me a little bit of like a bat for lashes song and on this LP as well you might also catch similarities to other contemporary female alternative singer songwriters people like maybe angel Olson or a bit of Sharon Van Etten but unfortunately Torres doesn't bring nearly as much musical intricacy or nuance or layers to the table just take the song Ferris wheel one of the longer tracks in the track listing here and a song that knows that it doesn't function very well based on its lone vocal and guitar parts so there is this just like very light ambient what sounds like guitar noise placed very quietly into the background just to kind of fill space because space needs to be filled not because it's a good sound it's actually a very homely and unpleasant sound drowning out what little song we actually have on this track sure some bass and some drums do pop in later in the song but by that point the track is really already dug its own grave I like that the title track on here picks things up picks the tempo it picks the energy up but the guitars on this track just kind of feel like another just slow plotting all rock guitar variation on what had already happened on the first two songs so not only is this album lacking in some seriously captivating musical ideas but variety as well at this point and when the album actually does kind of step outside of its comfort zone which we hear on the song cowboy guilt which has these kind of flat distorted electronics that don't really sound all that great pretty unflattering and the vocal melody on this track kind of tedious as well not one of the better sound production moments on this LP not one of the better songwriting moments either not that the distorted percussion made this song all that listenable to begin with we do have a decent closure on this album though which is really a moment of quiet desperation the really detailed intriguing lyrics on this track which feel very sad very personal kind of remind me as as well as Torres's vocal melody on the verse of this track kind of remind me of Sufjan Stevens specifically his newest LP not that you know I think that his new album was directly an influence on this track but there just seems to be something just very whisper quiet and just incredibly depressing about it but Torrez doesn't bring nearly as much instrumental character and flair on this track I mean the guitars behind her and just all the instrumentation in general is just so faint in terms of just volume and in terms of just performance as well where I just feel like I'm kind of listening to her voice which by all means is nice but I don't know I guess I was just expecting just more of a an instrumental F from this record because her last LP while there were some decent tunes on it I thought the instrumentation at times was kind of bland and I thought that with the song strange hellos being just as much of a punch sonically as it was that we might be in for something a little different this time around but unfortunately that wasn't the case while again I liked Torres's vocals and and McKenzie definitely brings some impassioned singing to the table occasionally on this album the production and the instrumentation isn't awful but it's just very plain and it's so skeletal and emaciated to the point where I just am left starving on these tracks for any kind of musical ideas to to remember or pull from or just enjoy it just sounds like there are tracks on this LP that are needlessly trying to be as minimalistic as possible there are other songwriters that I think might have done it with just just a degree more of success people like scout niblet for example but in this specific instance it's really just rubbing me the wrong way I'm feeling a strong five to eight six on this LP transition what did you think of this album if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana torres Sprinter album review have a good day believe in yourself eat your fruits and vegetables get a good night's sleep forever 
l2EhEhAeyA4,hi everyone try any hard tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for my least favorite segment on this YouTube channel the monthly album roundup why you know review where I talk about a series of Records in a gauntlet in brief just kind of giving a quick opinion on them because I didn't get that to them in a regular review at some point earlier this month okay this dude's name is Chesky broken bone ballads is the album title he is a rapper and singer and songwriter from my home state typically when it comes to guys who sort of rap but bring like an acoustic guitar in the equation I just run in the other direction as fast as possible but Chesky actually has a pretty great amount of skill on both sides of that fence not to say I always enjoy how he fuses these two worlds every single time on this record namely the tracks on the back end of this LP which are much softer have much more of a ballad quality to them and the singing tends to run maybe a little nasal however there are some fantastic moments on this LP namely tracks like forever 33 and this won't last forever which has this amazing just lush background melody with some great instrumentation and some background vocals as well and there's just something really catchy about the melody on this track and it's just really a triumphant feel-good amazing song on this record and I'm sure that other people will appreciate the deeper cuts on this record more than me I think the reason not in love with this album is is just really the style of this record I've never really been a huge Sage Francis guy or like a Y fan maybe if you're even heavy into sublime you'll like this record and people who are big fans of alternative hip-hop you know your your your Aesop Rock fans too because Chesky can definitely spit some impressive lyrics as well people who are into those artists I would most definitely recommend check this out all saying in Tennessee and those in taxi from eternity the cesspool me once shame on some pretty decent experimental black metal on this new botanist EP over here a hammered dulcimer on this record instead of guitar it's not quite as low Phi as the previous record that this project had just dropped which I love put on the loved list gave it a positive review the dulcimer is just a little bit more dynamic in the recording however the vocals are very obscured some good melodies good chord progressions on this thing it's dark it's just maybe not so out there or so much of a change in pace from the last record that you know I want to give it an in-depth review just kind of another good installment in the botanist catalog there back and it's actually not that bad of a record they're back and it's actually not that bad of a record and Sleaford mods is on it to this super duper duper duper sounds like Death Grips it just really sounds like Death Grips if you want to listen to another project that kind of sounds like Death Grips check this project out however there is good production here it is most definitely listenable as Death Grips II as it sounds there are certainly a great deal of care that went into this EP this knew they might be giants album it's okay it's decent if you're They Might Be Giants fan try to see them tour this year they always put on a great live show but this new album it's ok if you're looking for some pop rock with kind of a fun silly off-the-wall demeanor then look up this record but don't be surprised if you find just more fun in the band's earlier stuff I will say though the production on this record is loads better than the record join us and will you come with me to music jail is easily the most exciting question in album has asked me this year this is some pretty good post-punk in noise rock on this EP but we have known about half of these songs for the good part of a year now where is the album where is the album I think the objective of this album was to make me regret defending the last album mm-hmm good afternoon mr. Raekwon it's not bad some really glamorous production on this LP and Raekwon is most definitely listenable on this record but but half or at least more than half mages a little bit more than half half of the features had no business being on this album I just don't understand why Raekwon is the one member of wu-tang that seems the most eager to collaborate with with just not that good rappers breakout you're Daria DVDs because the 90s are back this Marina and the Diamonds LP it's pretty sweet pop album pretty sweet pop album at times it tends to be a little more grand and big than it really is especially in the vocals which a lot of the time are trying to be just you know very very deep and commanding it's good it's likable its catchy but sometimes I just I just wish it would accept it's just simple sweet pop eNOS and just kind of be that everything that made the last album and okay noise rock album makes this new album in okay noise rock album unless you thought the last album was amazing then this album is amazing - this was my favorite death metal band when I was 15 and there you go the why you know review me trying to do the most painless version of that that I can you're the best love you transition if you've given any of these albums of listen what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh why you know review music forever 
cRekLSSWhtg,yeah mini-review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kumasi Washington Record the epic this is a long album therefore this will be a pretty long review but before we get into the longer part of this review I thought for those of you who might just kind of want to cut to the chase we will do a short mini review before we get to this longer review here we go yes yes yes yes and there you go that's the mini review of this record now if you're looking for something that is a little bit more descriptive in depth uh here we go saxophonist bandleader composer Kumasi Washington you might have heard his name and his playing before because he's actually performed on flying lotuses latest record you're dead and this new album of his is actually on flying lotuses record label brain feeder records but commuter knee has been running long before that point he's been a multi-instrumentalist since his teens over the years he has had the opportunity to collaborate with tour behind some big names and pop soul jazz as well as hip hop there is one CD from about a decade ago that you could check out Kumasi is featured in a group named the young jazz giants he also has a handful of kind of small obscure self-released albums a lot this new record from Kumasi and his band really seems to be his first big step on a label backing his music with some major promotion while he has been working for years on music much of that time has been spent backing up and helping other artists now he is really giving us a long hard look at him and and his creative ideas in the limelight and the vision is actually pretty fantastic and on this first big outing Kumasi has seen fit to give us this album which is a three hour jazz epic consisting of pretty much three albums within an album each of which from what I feel can be enjoyed outside of the context of the record itself so don't feel pressure to listen to this whole thing in one sitting try to take the time to maybe not listen to the whole thing in one go but maybe just get to know each album individually and then from there if you feel like listening to the whole thing and just a a marathon then go for it still though even without the the looming obligation to listen to LP from beginning to end when listening to this album I was still kind of worried is there enough diversity and creativity on this record to justify three hours of length and ultimately to that question I have to say yes between the instrumentation on this LP brings a lot of different flavors the handful of horns that appear on this record the percussion the the piano the bass is the electric and the upright you might actually your thundercat on this record who you might be familiar with from flying lotuses music as well the vocalists as well as an entire string section is employed to create the magic of this album and a bunch of different jazz styles are brought to the table on this album as well whether it be some spiritual jazz or Bop and its subgenres you have a bit of jazz fusion on here fusing jazz with funk and of course there's vocal jazz on this thing and even a beautifully harmonious and melodic rework of de Busey's clair de lune over the course of three hours the epic goes down a lot of emotional and and musical avenues so in this review because we are talking about so much music here I hope to just kind of talk about each album individually not going too deep into every single track just because I mean again it's a lot of music here even before the epic begins Komachi is making I think a lot of presumptions naming this album the epic giving this longing just very deep gaze into the viewer or the the listeners eyes on this album are as well as placing himself into space and on top of all of that we have the opening track here titled changing of the guard you would think that together Komachi and his band are trying to come out with a game-changer here and when you listen to the opening track of this record those ambitions are kind of confirmed for me anyway because every bit of instrumental Arsenal this album has to offer is just locked and loaded on this track the horns the heavy drums the bass as well as the huge group vocals and the the massive string sections on this thing this song is just all cylinders firing at once there is a very cacophonous and and very intense piano solo that sort of pops out against some very cooled drums and bass on this track and this solo kicks off this song's fantastic gauntlet of improvisational performances and I love this song's theme and I think the interplay between just the main jazz instrumentation on this track is fantastic I guess my one reservation about this song though is that it just seems a little bloated or just overwrought at points especially when the strings don't really seem to be matching the flavor of the instrumentation when the horns and the drums as well as the pianos are getting really intense really cacophonous meanwhile the strings are sort of maintaining their very glossy clean very composed outward appearance instrumentally the next track on here asked him actually has a similar size to it in terms of instrumental presence but I think there's just maybe a bit more grace to how the strings are worked in and I actually think the strings complement the Jazz instrumentation when it's sort of building up to its peak of intensity really nicely and the song actually smooths out very beautifully after that and it's by the second track here that I'm actually starting to really love Kumasi 'he's playing style on this record sometimes he is pulling out these really flashy virtuous dizzying and in melodic solos or he is just blowing in his instrument so hard that it's screeching it's screaming and he's just blurting out these these really hard-hitting intervals that even even though they may be simple in a sense they're really emotionally powerful all over this LP Kumasi shows finesse as well as just brutish power on the sax and it's wonderful on the following track Isabel there is kind of this a just very sad teary-eyed soap opera esque organ that fits the very laid-back and slow pace of the performance on this track very nicely it's a milder song the track listing here one that didn't really stick out to me quite as much but I love how musically resolves from some very sour and dissonant melodies and harmonies to some very beautiful and harmonious chords you know sort of going back and forth throughout the performance between those two flavors there is the song final thought which hits way harder really an aggressive standout for the first third of this album one of my favorites in the track listing here and the song the next step which is sort of a I don't know kind of an inconspicuous track for me at the start there's a load of moments on this track where we're kind of getting this this very standard and run-of-the-mill walking jazz bass line fitting against some pretty standard jazz instrumentation but I think this songs sort of trick this this ace and its sleeve that it kind of pulls out as it progresses along is that it turns from this this very plain sounding jazz instrumentation into these really amazing a sense upward the instrumentation kind of becomes noisy scattered really just fills the mix in this beautiful gorgeous way and I feel like I am I'm transported from this this place where I feel very familiar to the sound to the tone to the musical world that I'm in to like being like where Kumasi is right now just listening I feel like I'm rocketed off to this intergalactic musical realm the next step I feel like the title here actually means something and that I am stepping away from this kind of normal jazz sound to something just a little bit more I don't know hard to put into words and the closing track of the first third of this album is a really nice beautiful piece of vocal jazz with some powerful lyrics although I will say the singing on this record consistently is a little campy and that's nothing specific to this record or anything like that there's a lot of very campy vocal jazz out there it's just kind of a style a delivery that you might have to get used to if you're unfamiliar with vocal jazz there are plenty of camping metal singers out there but that doesn't necessarily mean that their music can't be appreciated for what it is is but the camp eNOS is there it's kind of theatrical it's a little over acted but in a sense this track kind of sounds like the the closing to a very great first act of some kind of amazing and vicious jazz stage show now part one gives this LP a great start but for me part two of the epic is really where this album sparked for me really came to life I feel like on part two Kumasi and the next step are a little less focused on big presentations and impressing the listener and introducing themselves and and now they just really dig in and deliver a goddamn great jazz record this part two of the epic is to me a perfect or near-perfect album within a larger album from the very fast and furious misunderstanding that kicks the second part off which is just so intense I love the theme melody of this track and I am just just blazed by the pace that Kumasi and his band are able to keep up on this track which contrasts very nicely with the slower sweeter melody on the song Leroy and Lanisha which comes up directly after feels kind of like something I would hear in a musical then the pace picks up we get a funky bass groove and some tight hand percussion on the song rerun and on top of it the vocals just the extra instrumentation complements the intense performances on this second third of this album specifically on this track really nicely which I think was a must because this second part of the epic has the most fiery performances of the entire album for me seven prayers was a nice move to put on this second disc because it is one of the most soft and kind of fluid songs throughout the entire LP it really feels like the horns are guiding the rest of the instrumentation on this track they're working at a very syrupy fluid tempo while the pianos and the percussion kind of just orbit and encircle around dance around these horns and in a really sort of lazy cluttered way but it's a beautiful clutter the song henriette our hero brings more vocal jazz to the table and I love that with each third here we're getting more lyrics more singing just kind of break up the different flavors of each part of this record and then the closing track here oh the Magnificent Seven has some of the most intense horn solos on this entire record to the point when I was first listening to this track um got kind of choked up especially with the rhythm instrumentation playing so intensely behind these solos really just giving the emotion the emotional power of the horn playing on this record just a really strong foundation just lifting up the horn playing in a really aggressive way and the result is just chemical you know just chemical chain reaction just explosions musical explosions all over this record again you know scan got a little choked up listen to this track because it's just so the saxophone is just screaming on this song and there's some great big chorus vocals on this track too as well as a kind of just weird psychedelic ish bass solo that kind of glides the song out and some really sharp string embellishments that are kind of playing the background bed again another third on this album finishes with an amazing just very eventful closer and and really the epic could have stopped here but it keeps going into our third part where we get the song rerun home which is kind of a revisit to the song rerun which has a bit of a I guess a nuttier percussion section some Dueling horns matches as well I wish the sound of this track the way that they reappropriation that this newer take on the song is six minutes longer than the original which was already eight and that's the thing about this album I mean you're getting long tracks on this thing you know if you're if you're not that familiar if you're not really a big jazz fan listening to the first disc of this album can be a little unwelcoming at first because you're getting one 12-minute song after another so whether you're a jazz fan or not if you are listening to this album and you feel like you know you're just getting a little tuckered out listening to this album sort of pace yourself just take a break because there are a lot of beautiful moments on this record that you don't want to miss so this rerun home track I mean really great 70's style funk percussion and just backing instrumentation on this song the rework of clair de lune on this last third is wonderful another tear jerker moment for me with Cherokee and with Malcolm's theme we're getting these vocal jazz tributes to the two figures that are mentioned in the titles to these tracks we actually get a vocal snippet of Malcolm X talking at the very end of Malcolm's theme and the closing track the message I mean you know maybe not the most explosive track on the entire LP but is one of the harder songs here and for better or worse it closes the album out I would just say at this point it's just another fantastic performance in a gauntlet of already fantastic performances maybe it doesn't seem quite as special when I'm listening to it in the context of the entire record but sort of in the context of this last third of this album I mean it's certainly great because again I do feel like these albums can be listened to out of context of the Greater record you don't need to listen to the entire thing in one sitting so there are a lot of musical highlights all over this LP but sort of the the the grandeur sort of foundational things of this record the production is amazing I mean all the instrumentation is just recorded very well with the exception of a few moments at the very beginning of this album I think these strings and the group vocals blend into the jazz instrumentation very nicely the bass sounds great the drums sound great the horns the vocals I mean it's all just very well placed the time that it must have taken to record as well as mix this 3-hour album is it's it's it's it's scary to think of then we have the interplay between all the musicians on this record just the core jazz instrumentation is great I mean that alone without the extra vocals without the strings would make an amazing record and then we have just the solos which track four track four track are astounding the music and the writing on these songs those tracks that do have you know composed elements to them as well as just the intricacy of these songs as well there's just you know nothing as far as a foundational characteristic of this record that I'm disappointed with and and it's these things as well as just all the the variety and the diversity among these tracks and just the you know the wonderful embellishments in each song and improvisation is I mean it's it's all these things that are going to continue to drive me back to this album over the course of this year because with each listen I'm just going to be picking up and just enjoying more things the one critique one big critique I could make of this record though generally is that I mean it's three hours long and not that it is too long not that you know it should have been shorter but you know with a record that delivers three hours of music of course not every moment is as amazing as the next but um I give this album super duper like high praise for coming out with this much music and just the vast vast vast vast vast majority of it being incredibly enjoyable fun forward-thinking and creative and I don't think there's anything else I can say about this amazing three-hour album I'm feeling a light too decent 9:00 on this record transition give giving a shout magician what did you freak a dick of it did you want to pet it did you want to euthanize it and what do you think Anthony should

hPxfJFGvcyk,mm-hmm hi everyone less than you talked tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a bit of a discussion a conversation about a question some fans have been posing to me over the past week and reaction what's been going on in Baltimore do artists have a responsibility to address social issues do they have a responsibility to address the protests and those who took it upon themselves to riot and the six officers that have been charged in the death of Freddie gray should they be talking about it in their music on their various social media accounts to talk about this question I have brought on someone who might be even more opinionated than myself one mr. DJ academics who has a YouTube channel I will link it down there in the description he talks about various facets of hip-hop culture often in a pretty comedic manner the conversation him and I had that I'm about to play is a long one it's audio of my vocals his vocals kind of a podcast format so a hunker down maybe get a snack or something okay so you know just just be prepared you're in for a long one transition hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd as you already know and now I am here accompanied through the magic of the internet by one mr. DJ academics hey dude how you doing hey what's up man hey what's up nothing nothing just just here to talk to you dude listen man I'm glad we got the opportunity to talk to because which a lot of people might not know I think secretly we've been definitely checking out each other's content on YouTube in we appreciate each other's work so I'm definitely glad we get a chance to talk about our issues or topics or whatever the case is made chop it up sometimes we've just been secretly ripping each other off for years now yeah okay now that's gonna be out there now we can't kill that rule I know I know okay so so you know I've been I've been okay admittedly admittedly I've been watching some of your recent videos sort of in reaction to what's been going on in Baltimore and a lot of people have been asking me and I thought it would be good to bring you in on this you know do you think artists kind of have an obligation or responsibility to address social issues whether it be in their music but also kind of I don't know do what maybe j.cole or like McLemore was doing not too long ago in Ferguson like showing up on the ground that these protests or taking part in social media in some kind of way you know what and this is the funny thing is that it's kind of um at times your own one and then at times you're on the other end like for example I mean especially when the Ferguson thing happened right I was like they definitely should be speaking up or at least making their opinion heard right I mean a lot of their fans are the people affected I mean hip-hop culture has always been the culture of the oppressed and to some extent so you got to speak up somewhat but then when you think about the broad scope of everything that's contained in hip-hop you're like do I really want some of these guys to talk up do I really want somebody like young thug to voice his opinion do I really want certain rappers what's your opinion if we're then going to be selective who are the rapper's we need to speak up and why should they speak up and I mean for me after the last couple of months I could say after seeing how these artists uh what they put on record on wax or whatever you might call it but then not only that but their message in their music it was like a you guys kind of got to speak up you guys are addressing into your music for the most part fans are calling you deep because of that right and because of that you should probably speak up a little bit right you shouldn't only conveniently speak up when it's time to sell a record and I think that's my whole thing about it I'm not saying I can't neither say they shouldn't are they should because there's too many hip-hop artists they're contradictory which you can't rap about killing a bunch of people and then as soon as something happens within the black community black lives matter hands up don't shoot so I'm stuck in between that but um especially with this latest round and I've been going off on Twitter I'm not sure if you're following that also I rested on my videos as well I'm like hey listen man with a lot of people especially the last couple of albums Kendrick Lamar he put out a great album very good album I know you rated it high I rated as high well maybe not as high but very high as well and I'm like to pimp a butterfly was something that had a message for his listeners his supporters that was really it whether you wanted MIT or not implicitly or explicitly was Pro black and it was really speaking about situations where you might feel oppressed and it kind of related to Baltimore and I was like hey this is my thing about everything and this is what I wanted fans to also take because I mean you do mostly review and everything what I do is I do satirical commentary of the culture and part that commentary is that I realized the hypocrisy the irony of everything that goes on for example right you see for example and I'm not saying these artists don't care but I'm pointing out the UM the difference in what's going on J Cole shows up in Ferguson he has an album to promote he does no interviews but he gets great press from me because he's on the ground to be honest that's a bigger I'm just for people seeing it potential buyers potential consumers them seeing that images like wow this guy really is about what he preaches great the same time Kendrick Lamar kind of gets secluded he starts putting out in snippets these very Pro black message to show listen I'm here in the fight with you guys right that's cool because you guys have an album to put out I'm not saying maybe it's coincidental which it might just be the time well you know well well to kind of stop you there I mean you know and you've addressed a lot up until this point you know and I hope to go back to talk about some of it but this point right here I feel like you know when you're as popular as Kendrick Lamar or Jake Cole is there really a way to sort of like make a purely altruistic action in in a situation like Ferguson or in a situation like Baltimore because because you're not an average person anymore you're essentially a superstar in your unruhe no matter what you say it's going to become less about the situation you're addressing and more about this celebrity said this you know what I mean like anything that Jay Cole does in response to Baltimore for example could be construed in some way as like you know oh he's doing this so he gets really good press absolutely but you know what um it's important to hear what these guys have to say and I'm not saying they have to be on the ground while lays on the ground now which I definitely salute him for you don't have to be on the ground we understand you have a schedule we understand you are a company a living breathing company it can't be everywhere someone would want you to be every time something pops up is happen about every week have you noticed every single week there's a new issue right every ever every week every month there's a new issue you know it's it's just that some issues are bigger than others and and in this particular one I mean it's some end up grabbing more attention than others and I think you know the images and just the the the video of what's coming out of Baltimore now has has caught a supreme amount of attention absolutely but uh I would like to hear their opinion um and here's the thing because there's a lot of people and I consider them it's a part of the mass audience that go off ignorant they hear certain things and for example a guy who I talk about quite frequently because he's always in the news about a bunch of different type of um just nonsense really young thug he comes out he says we need war we need chaos if the cops right that's that's what he puts out but the thing is a lot of people want to hear that message right so a lot of people to hear that message so it's not even about what the entertainer said is that a lot of people want to make sure they feel backed by the person who they support and they subscribe to some what the rhetoric they the person's been putting out now young tons a bad example of what he said but for example a Jay Cole a Kendrick right people would want to hear and as I say you don't have to be on the ground physically but just hear what they have to say in just response to okay are you saying what what are you saying it should happen now are you saying that people because some people consider is the consider the riders they're like revolutionaries right to some people based on what what I'm type of rhetoric you subscribe to the people who are riding they're revolutionaries to other people they're flat-out criminals and of course to the media and I won't say all the media but some of them they're thugs so we would like to see where what do these celebrities who you definitely benefited quite a bit from the whole thing with Ferguson because you guys same came out saying the right thing kind of aftermath but it was also around the release year album so I just want to hear because I think for example Kendrick Lamar he came out of months after and he made a couple statements where he kind of like held up the mirror to the black community and he was like yo listen I'm not gonna criticize this that and third what about you guys and then a lot of people turned on him right then his album came back around they were like oh yes now he's back to talking to stuff we want to hear so really people don't want to hear nothing revolutionary from these artists they want to hear what they already believe it but the thing is I like to see the artists who will be brave enough right to make a stand or not even stay at least state their real personal feelings now I'm gonna I'm gonna let you talk in a second but oh you oh you're gonna let me talk to here thank you because I wanna get this last point out because this was the entire thing what I was saying is that no matter what type of artists we're talking about Kendrick Lamar J Cole a lot of people and I believe you would as well consider them to be very conscious deep artists no matter if we're talking about them no matter if we're talking about the migos young thug's rich homie Quan the guys who you consider trapped rappers pretty much they make disposable music in some sense it's really all about promoting their brand they will never and I think that wave of artists is gone where they'll really make a stand that could compromise that whether their corporate interests or any other interest that equates to ER has some monetary aspect in it sure so that's why I was like listen don't look at these guys because you think their message is deep that they're better than anyone else because when it really comes down to it if they have to say something that might piss off someone else because if if Jake older Kendra comes out and says hey I support these guys and I understand that why they're riding even if they don't condone it all of a sudden the corporate people who back in was like whoa whoa really that's what you do but of course it's all about being non confrontational as debit I mean I agree with you I agree that you know there are corporate interests involved and that's what would naturally probably make an artist sort of you know there are artists that are making controversial political statements right now it's just that we're not seeing them sort of on that big national mainstream stage and and that's because you and I know very well that that sort of thing could be controversial not just because you know there might be advertisers involved but saying a certain thing though you might be right and and what you're saying might be the truth in some kind of sense and and maybe you know at least you or I could agree that maybe whatever some rapper has said about Baltimore is morally correct but to a great deal of their fans that statements could still be controversial exactly um you know and and and and people will hate you for the wrong opinion I mean you know that yeah I know that you know we've experienced that firsthand hey listen think about the amount of times you've probably read an album maybe higher than your fans or the the mass majority of your fans probably thought it should be or you probably rated it too low and they think that listen man this guy's selling off selling out he's fallen off because he didn't agree with what I think he should have done come on sure you know absolutely um to sort of address one of the first points you made you know you're talking about these artists not necessarily being I mean for me kind of the issue that comes along with expecting them to make statements about these situations sort of feeling like as a fan base they're obligated to make some kind of statement is that they're not necessarily academics or political scientists or experts on the local situation that may be going on in area like Baltimore or um uh I guess uh or or or even like you know what like you were saying with young thug morally righteous people and you know what one one of his earliest interview sort of talking about what was it Mike Brown I mean you you brought it up before he's like you know that I'm not paying attention to that you know according to him he was ice touting getting way too much money to care in artists like young thug and artists like me goes I could not see myself it would make no sense for me to be like you should say something about this just because you know um I you know if you're not someone who cares I just rather you don't say anything but if you're an artist like Jay Cole or you're an artist like Kendrick who addresses it in their music do you feel like it's it's it's wrong for them to just kind of continue along not saying anything exactly I mean that's absolutely the point where their fans who I mean social media has a different effect these days where it could be someone that's not in Baltimore but they could draw on past experiences with the police and because of what's going on in Baltimore and what they've now perceived to be the the systemic oppression and and by the police or abuse that has been going on for years and they then connected with a personal experience within their particularly a particular hometown or region sure and then they've now filled that frustration right for that people want to hear from these guys and they just want to hear at least what they say and I'm and for a guy like Kendrick and I'm not gonna give all the credit to of course his promotional campaign and also I mean but you have to for like his album just sold the most he's ever sold in his career right part of it is because of the message it was highly critically acclaimed right to be a very good album because of how deep how much he really touched on social issues you would then think that hey listen are you just doing this for a paycheck to cash out do you only have a voice when it's time to album when you get into booth knowing that you have to turn an album in or do you actually do care because this is listen most of these guys were quote quote studio rappers and they're gangsters that they're mostly gangsters inside the studio they're not living that life and they haven't lived that life in a very long time so sure for the guys who you see preach and it I won't say their material comes up across as preachy but there's definitely a message behind it right they're not just talking about yeah whatever you want to hear something more you want to hear at least you don't have to be on the front lines just say hey I'm with the people in Baltimore we need answers that's it I'm not even saying condemn the police just say we need answers or say something Jesus sure people want something to be said man I'm telling I think ok so here's here's all my first questions you know with you and I know part of I mean yeah sure the message is important too why to pimp a butterfly hat had done so well but I think another kind of side to that coin is the reason a message like that was so powerful is not just because it was done well but is also because of just how little of that we get sort of at that level of popularity in hip-hop so in a sense do you kind of feel like when a guy like Kendrick makes a record like to pimp a butterfly that sort of obligation we might feel that he has to talk on social issues has already been fulfilled he's already putting it in the music for us to listen to contemplate on and sort of just reflect on you know do you think in a sense his his duty has been fulfilled just because he made a record about it absolutely not because you know what man as I said that if are these guys just going to be giving pep talks and giving recaps of what happened because it I mean of course police brutality happens all over all the time every second day all around the world right but usually when those albums come out and I'm going to give you the reason why that album when came out in the first place but the reason why that's done is because um kendrick he sees he sees that's what people people want to hear about it becomes a time where like okay yeah drink is always rapping about bitches and doing everything else but now people want to hear about what's going on right now who's gonna actually talk about it that's the reason why that album is actually very relevant and for someone like Kendrick are you just giving us a recap of what happened because it's usually a big event like a Ferguson like a Baltimore riots that kind of spark that train of thought or sparked that relevance so are you just giving a recap of what happened a couple months ago you're pretty much armchair quarterback in it which is cool or are you really saying listen I do want to be a little bit more other than just be in the music because historically right and I that's the thing that people find very is very hard to just completely bind to Kendrick right and you could ask a lot of people especially people of color Kendrick is the guy that yeah he has some strong messages in his music but he kind of aims to piss off no one and really if you have that strong of a message and you really don't piss off anyone usually your message isn't that effective historically we've seen your message usually gets lost and pretty much you just get accepted because they know you're non-threatening and right now Kendrick Sinatra and do it and I'm not not saying he should be but as pertaining to the message he had his last album I felt he needed to say something didn't have to completely jump out there like you a young thug like  all cops but just say listen man look even just saying my prayers are with the people in Baltimore Jesus Christ to say something one do got in I mean and then you hear people with these excuses like no he's busy the center he threw out the first pitch at the Dodgers game - no I mean you know nobody sees you just to send out a few tweets or anything like that um I guess uh I guess my thoughts are you know could could it be in in your opinion though that the the message on his latest album isn't controversial not because it's not strong but more because I mean you know one there are only a few tracks where I feel like he addresses the sort of you know racial issues specifically a lot of the album is actually more about him you know sort of just being a hip hop celebrity you know and sort of going through a moment of personal growth dealing with self-esteem and a lot like how he goes through a moment of personal growth on good kid maad city it's just that instead on this new record were kind of seeing him just do it as an older version of himself you know but not only does he not address these topics consistently throughout the record you know because there are some songs where that message is stronger than others but when that message does come up I feel like it's not as controversial just because it's just very level-headed with how he puts it um you know even even songs where he sort of you know like on blacker the berry where he's throwing those critiques at you know what he sees his hypocrisy in the black community there was very little I guess a blowback over that whereas I think if he had come out and said those statements really clearly in an interview maybe people would have been more pissed off of him I feel like when you put it in music it sort of becomes a little bit more interpretable to people and Plus you know you also had this musical element coming in so people don't even necessarily have to digest your lyrics in the way that they would if they were just reading something that you said absolutely I mean I think Kendrick which I don't know how he does it because I think he does a masterful job of doing it but um he put certain ideas in certain um I guess you will call it his statements that he wants to make he'll put in a song and to be honest it sounds good it's easily digestible maybe it's because of his lyrical wit maybe it's because of just how how dopey is I mean but people get it but when he's saying cuz he said the same thing like most of the stuff well I won't say the same thing but what he did have a interview in a magazine where he tried work alright yeah yeah yeah yeah he was saying a lot of the same messages and he said a couple things and people like whoa is is this because maybe was it more in a vacuum or just maybe it was just in a newspaper or social media people take excerpts okay and it's hard to take an excerpt of a full song well the well the thing is sure it's hard to it's hard to take an excerpt of a full song but you know at least from what I've observed over the past several years or so I feel like the Internet has become worse and worse a place to discuss political issues because one it becomes nearly impossible to have any type of enlightening conversation on the main hubs of social media especially Twitter absolutely - you know if you're talking about something like an article or an interview or a think piece or something like that more often than not any of these politically charged think pieces that you might be running you know into on the Internet are just topped with these disgusting click baby headlines or or are you know loaded with these intentionally controversial opinions just because the writer or the people who are running the site know that this opinion is going to piss people off and just get them to get more clicks at the end of the day more traffic which just means more money in their pocket you know so you know that the Internet has not been a very good place for level-headed opinions so I mean while I I guess in a sense I kind of feel the same way that you do you know I wish that maybe Kendricks point of view on to pimp a butterfly was sort of more revolutionary in a sense on the flip side of that I'm kind of happy to like hear something that has a level headed point of view to it getting so much praise you know what though I think you're um you're happy about that because there's none when there's none compared to you're like I'm glad someone does something right I mean even if yeah yeah exactly exactly even if it's maybe not as much as you would want I'm glad that someone isn't still at least recognized and that's something we needed but sure for me and maybe I'm just requiring too much of these artists outside the music I mean I don't disagree with everything he said in his actual body of work I loved it right and like and everyone who knows me I'm a huge Drake fan right I enjoyed Drake album more but I know Kendricks was better and that's two different things you could know someone something is completely better but I might may enjoy another album sure but anyway so I just want I wanted more outside of music and do you feel like some of these artists like Kendrick Lamar who are sort of standing out is making bolder political statements in their music do you feel like as an entertainer they're just kind of nothing more than that and and and when it comes to being politically involved maybe their political activism should kind of be limited to that just sort of stick to being politically active but sort of within your entertainment and maybe if you do like a benefit concert or something like that I mean that's that's great as well but but it just kind of seems like because they're entertainers the amount of power the amount of influence that they have can can be kind of limited you know what this is what I really think um I think that all these guys are just entertainers right but the thing is fans get a misconstrued because of their message you hear a good message that you agree with that touches on something that's a social or political issue you offer some think they're more than what they are listen this is what I think unfortunate thing about it is that even if these guys do care and I won't say they don't care but let's be honest what's going on I mean because we're not seeing it full circle we're not seeing it when it matters and we're really only hearing about this on albums cuz you're not even coming out and speaking about it and it what I'm saying is that Kendrick has done a great job of dancing around not pissing anyone off but still get getting his message across in his music nobody's really pissed off with his music I'm not sure if he's not a good orator where he couldn't do the same maybe in interviews or maybe he just doesn't want to deal with that but he deals with it in his music to some extent now because it doesn't happen all around I just have to say these guys are literally just entertainers and they have somewhat of a general message and to be honest it kind of sounds very  up to say but they pretty much pimp that out for the release of an album release of an album a great it makes a great thumb attic body of work but after that that's it we can't expect more I mean you would want to expect more because a lot of fans look to these guys and they think these guys are much more right if you really hear a lot of fans of like Kendrick Lamar and J Cole they really think these guys are really just more the musicians I'm not saying they aren't but let's be honest they're really limited whether it's by their own doing arm maybe the corporate entities that kind of control them in and kind of market them and control their entire program so there's not much we could really expect from these guys you just have to say these guys are entertainers and that's it and I was drawing a parallel between a Kendrick Lamar and like even the rapper's you think stand for nothing the rappers who are say glorifying the drug game right Rick Ross he's moving away cause across the Atlantic right he's he's trapping off the iPhone I mean both of these these same artists I mean they're having a message whether you agree with one message or the other but none of them are really doing it so how much are we supposed to uplift one while we kind of look at the other and kind of wag a finger and it says no we don't like you and getting back to what we were saying earlier is that it's not even about like in what the particular person saying as is its new and original in its kind of like groundbreaking it's really just you agree with the artist because you're saying what you already believe they just have allowed a platform we really don't want these artists to come out and just start speaking their mind CJC Kendrick Lamar when he came on Billboard he actually said something that he really felt and people said no no that's not what we want you to say that might be part of the equation but that's not what we want to hear right now I mean there's lots of stuff that he said in previous interviews even shortly after good kid maad city that I don't necessarily agree with I mean um I've heard him saying an interview that you know he believes that the world is sort of on the brink of ending over some stuff that I think his grandmother might have told him and I believe there was a point on Twitter where he sort of stood out as saying that there's just no point in voting and you know why even vote and you know III agree that you know our two-party are very limited two-party system is incredibly flawed but it kind of seemed like and and this is why Twitter is a terrible place to talk politics you know because there's no nuance to any opinion that you break down in 140 characters but it just seemed like his response to the system being as broken as it is is just to do nothing okay I'm glad you brought that up because this leads me to my next point most of these artists now especially these newer artists is that we call them deep just to save they're deep because they might touch on a message that runs deep but our baby that's not quite the case right it's really only a relative exactly you know because we're seeing their music as deep in comparison with what we're seeing in the greater scheme of not just not just hip hop I mean pop music as well because you know there are plenty of white hot artists who don't really don't really make socially aware music the the thing though is that a lot of people give like a Kendrick and a J Cole a a that they allow them or say they're so deep but a lot of times they do bring up issues are important but they don't really get too much into it and that's my thing with rappers right they kind of tell you the problem that you kind already know they might give you a little bit different perspective but they never really offer some solutions right even going back you just mentioned Kendrick in what he said about voting right let's think about Jake Cole is last recent run of interviews he was talking about how the capitalistic Society of America is up right now that's to him the problem now the thing is a lot of people would agree especially when you're artists not your artists your audience is people who are definitely not in the financial situation that you're in or people like you are in they're struggling so when you say the system that yours is up that it kind of doesn't help the peep at the bottom a lot of people are gonna agree with you now here's the thing it's good would point out the problem what's the solution now when they kind of accent about it and I'm really referring to one and if you only think he did like one or two he kind of danced around giving solutions right he said I don't really know the solution all I know is a problem which just shows me again you're not really saying anything yeah you're deep to what extent you know I mean you're you're shown a problem with no solution and as I said and I'll keep going back to it these guys that's why I look to none of them as better than the other because they're only entertainers and that's the reason why most of them don't really come out and expound on the message in their music because they can't it just wouldn't make sense it wouldn't make sense beyond spittin a couple of bars mentioning the problem but not going too much in depth or even really completely analyzing the situation that someone could critically critique or for some critique to what's going on so they're just entertainers unfortunately man and of course as I said there are things that's holding them back because some would probably definitely want to get into that debate but hey listen at the expense of possibly pissing off sponsors possible fans listen Jordan Michael Jordan stated way back which that was the unpopular thing to do back in a day when Michael Jordan refused who I believe refused to back a political candidate and he said listen Republicans buy sneakers too and unfortunately now these guys who were rapping they're thinking more more business-minded where hey I have these endorsements with these companies might wear their views might not be line of mine I'll not really go too much with putting it out there which is a good business move so hey how could you blame them when monetarily and financially for them it makes sense not to write if you do some or you say some crazy stuff it would make no sense to really put that out there so they're stuck in a rock in a hard place I mean I wish I would hear or not see it's so blatant that these artists go absent when a situation like Baltimore riots or whatever you want to call it comes up just don't go completely away right when Ferguson's going on you gotta ready to go on sale don't be all in our face and then when you have nothing to sell because your first like 2 months of sales already is in the books you're like I'm gonna hang out in the background ok be a little bit consistent and it doesn't necessarily mean be on the front lines or say you're cutting a big check or you're doing this people want to hear your voice because of course there's another realm to this is that even the media and even rappers are like when you portray this narrative and not not saying it's not true when you put out a narrative that this is going on so much it then call cultivates into the frustration so you're not really encouraging people to write because people would be like well well Kendrick doesn't really encourage people to write yeah you don't encourage people to riot but you do encourage or not encourage you do drive home the fact of this oppression that has become frustrated and and like some of our great leaders once said is like the sometimes unfortunately the language of the frustrated people is violence so it all builds into it and that's why I mean I think and I would like for these guys to be a little bit more present but it's all about the money so that so then do you think in a sense that no matter who the artist is you know if they're able to make some kind of living off of creating art that addresses these issues and a few bars brings them up contextualizes them or sort of you know sort of rotates around these issues in some way do you think it's misleading or maybe even a irresponsible in a way for them to make music about this kind of stuff but not provide any real kind of bold opinion or solution to the situation no not necessarily and I mean it might sound like I'm contradicting myself but it doesn't because as I said they're entertainers I mean like rappers who don't rap about that but about other things we don't require the same of them however it's important for the fans and like I mean I personally know but there's a lot of fans who really buy in and when the when I mean buy em they buy in and that's why you see these artists you've never seen consciously um sound music sell this well and it's because we haven't been the time that we've been in with social media this and third where people could not put out a radio single M could pretty much put together a body of work that back like 10-15 years ago would completely flop but it does the opposite it does great its record selling and it's because people care about these issues it and and this is why I think this is because I mean the internet is helping the narrative change it used to be up until this point I mean when I was watching a few your videos and I saw that you uh were saying Kendrick was essentially pimping the black message I mean that's the first time I'd ever heard anybody talk about it like that because up until this point the you know sort of resounding opinion or I guess narrative of the whole situation was that politically conscious music doesn't sell it doesn't sell nobody wants to hear it doesn't sell if it's not in the club it doesn't sell nobody cares about it it doesn't sell and now we're seeing this incredibly popular album sort of surrounding these issues and and it's doing listening it's about taking advantage of the current event that's going on I mean if put like this when Michael Jackson died and of course he's one of the greatest a million people made a record that was tribute to him because it would get spins right it would get listens it could possibly advance that art even though they might care I'm not saying they don't not because someone has a body of work that kind of matches the current event or the current number one topic on the agenda means they are only trying to advance their career but it's artists artists do find out what's going on they look around they're like okay so this is going on I'm gonna make a song about this just like a tribute song after Michael Jackson's death people also realize that people really care about we're in a very very tension-filled time in US history and really if you look around it was so with social media everyone is kind of listening everyone's listening everyone's kind of taking shape of what's going on and for a album that's kind of Pro black I'm telling you right now if Drake believe me if Drake meant an album of course he would still have to be singing & symfon and doing all the stuff he does but sure if he did all that type of stuff right he gives a couple ballads where he's in the bathtub crying his eyes out and and then he throws in a couple pro-black like listen I'm being oppressed with you guys people would love him even more but of course he knows he's not that type of artist and I mean he doesn't do that many interviews but he doesn't touch on issues like a Michael Brown that much that's why on his entire album he touched on it once like I believe on one song 6:00 p.m. in New York he touched on it lightly and that's what you expect from Drake because he's showing that he's aware but he's not saying here is my message okay and I'm sure for the others who who are kind of making their message around what's going on I'm like hey hey I mean the I'm not saying me personally I don't care if Kendrick talks but I know his fans who have been defending him telling me that hey why do you talk about this guy when Kendrick is so deep talking about this and he's touching on a real social issues now I'm looking at it like wait you were telling me about Kendrick doing all that then his album was coming out now we have an issue where is Kendrick he's throwing out a pitch at a baseball game he gives no about really giving you a statement to make you feel good or even I'm touching on it to possibly cause any controversial blowback on himself and even now that the verdict just got announced not a verdict I'm sorry the charges or the announcement that charges will be brought by the state attorney in Baltimore against six officers with in a death or in the connection of the earth with Freddie gray and we'll see if anyone speaks up down because a lot of people use the excuse number one maybe they're doing something in a background or number two maybe they don't want to speak too quickly and I agree with both senses you should never jump out like even Mike Brown case I was very reserved at first because it sounded it was too many different variables that we didn't know and but even then I still felt it was a situation we needed to keep an eye on and of course once we know the the no more facts down the line you could speak more but it's interesting to see who will speak up now and that's what we'll go ahead and find out so who knows personally I don't expect Kendrick to sort of be jumping out there and saying something every single time some kind of situation happens even though he does have music that is politically charged in the same way that I wouldn't necessarily expect you know I guess jay-z to be stepping out and saying some kind of political statement every single time something occurs but it in that same breath I guess what I think where people kind of fail in this situation is that we end up expecting more from artists than we do ourselves like we feel like because we're fans of Kendrick and we've heard his music or just any rapper that makes music that's politically charged we should be seeing them out there on the front lines trying to make some kind of change yet we're just kind of sitting here on on social media just expecting for them to start doing that rather than us kind of getting involved and sort of making those changes come you know by our own hands and our own F you know it's that's to some extent true but but also it's more than even being on the front lines I think a lot of people just look for just for a word of advice or not even advice but just a stand of solidarity with their favorite rapper when something happens people look to your favorite rapper to be like is he thinking like we are or is he one of those other people that are saying well the problem starts with you guys and a lot of people usually look towards that like for example jay-z no one expects jay-z right jay-z even said it my presence is a goddamn present or something like that so or like my presence is a gift so if he showed up anywhere his presence would be enough but nobody would expect jay-z to go to Baltimore what people would probably expect is that if the day before you're tweeting about a stream of consciousness right everyone's bashing titling and you have now came out to defend it on social media maybe once in a while once in a while have a stream of conscious and whatnot it not every time maybe once in a while just have a stream of consciousness about these issues because if you notice the big entertainers they've dodged these issues they have conveniently all dodged it and and what I mean Dodger is just like giving an opinion we know some definitely have we can't go without acknowledging people like David Banner he's always been there I always applaud him he's always saying something to not only make us think and it's not only just being there doing stuff it's kind of just contributing to the conversation as you have with your music David Banner killer Mike a few have tried I mean even people not as articulate think about ti-ti went on and try to do it right I mean and we know he's dragging his words like a  but he's trying to get across what he's trying to get across even Meek Mill which I wouldn't want to hear Meek Mill on CNN which he said he was gonna be but he came out on Instagram he said listen I've had my issues with the police but it's not all police and some people could um they could understand what he went through because a lot of people who listen to his music are like him most Meek Mill fans have gone through the same thing where they feel more connected to the artists because they feel I'm like that guy that guy was like me growing up sure I mean you know the audience and this is true for for a lot of music the audience really wants to buy itself you know they want to support an artist that they feel like is going through a similar walk of life exactly exactly so it's it's a very it's a very touchy situation and I definitely understand why artists might not speak up and I understand why they would - but well yeah you know the thing is that they're people at the end of the day but also they have to be consistently reminding themselves at their business now and I feel like that's what music has I feel like if if the Internet has done anything it's really solidified that sort at all levels of relevancy because even these smaller more independent rappers and you know rock and pop artists sort of in the indie scene even they can be making a reasonable living off of their art if they just kind of play their cards right and they sort of you know go through the same kind of PR and media campaigns but sort of on a smaller level that the bigger artists do and as a result even in the underground you sort of see not quite as much of this you know of the charged political messages that you might have heard in the 2000s and the 80s and and maybe the 90s when you might have had these smaller artists who I mean the their opinion at the end of the day is it why not be politically charged because I'm not really going to make that much money off of this record anyway I'm gonna say what I want and exactly and to be honest what I was saying before with the most artists who have made a really big they usually have a very strong niche audience and then they take that and catapult that to a very mainstream audience and that usually starts with something politically charged that usually starts with something controversial that at first somebody's like ah but hey you're gonna get blowback if you do it and if you don't do it I mean sometimes people just look at you like you're you stand for nothing sometimes some artist feels like it's necessary that they stand for something rather than be perceived by their fans to accept everything and with social media now that blowback that occurs I mean it just I guess puts it closer to your everyday life I guess in a sense I mean it's the Internet when people are talking about me I turn the computer off but you know bet back in the day if you wanted to hear about some kind of blowback about something you might have said on a record you'd have to go out buy a newspaper or make sure that you were watching the news at a certain time and and not that those outlets weren't important I mean you know those outlets were people's windows to the world but it's not like you could come out with a song or make some kind of statement and start getting a bunch of negative reactions to it in in 30 seconds or less you know just because you threw it out there on Twitter or people on Twitter started hearing about it and now are you know trying to drag your name through the mud because of a really quick negative reaction they might have had - something you did and speaking of which don't underestimate the internet I mean listen and maybe at this point for you and listen a you're pretty big so don't don't underestimate that I don't get it I just think that sometimes negative reactions on the Internet or sort of the fear of negative reactions on the Internet can can most definitely have like a chilling effect and make people sort of be maybe a little wary about saying what's actually on their mind sometimes absolutely I think that contributes to it a great amount it's actually unfortunate that we got to address it this late because it definitely does think about the amount of people who have lost their jobs over something they've said because as soon as you hit that send one if you are going to tweet that could be used against you if you make any type of remark as an entertainer that could be considered anti-cop I'm not talking about a young thug because young thug is relatively he probably has no real corporate sponsors at this point he's still pretty independent but if we're talking about a big artist like Ariana says something that could be considered anti-police homophobic it could be racist against another race but for say once that gets out there all of a sudden you have people tweeting your sponsors tweeting your record label their I've seen it happen personally where they saw someone say something and they tweet that directly to the people employ them or the people who sponsor them hoping they get dropped so with that in mind why would you do it you're looking like listen man I have my opinions I'll talk to my friends in passion where I may say something not politically correct but to say it on social media and even if it's written by a PR person I'm gonna be held to the fire for it for potentially the rest of my career or it could damage me nah I'm not gonna do that right it's not worth it at least to some artist the sucker they don't care I guess alright man I mean unless you have any closing thoughts on this I think we've explored every crevice of the issue that we could yeah absolutely man um really me I just implore everyone to really just say what you feel man especially in a time like this it is definitely you have to take a second to think before you speak because what you say could be used against you but just to be quiet is more of an injustice than actually not saying something at all especially when you see something that's really an injustice going on so I mean I implore everyone to say what you feel it might differ on what platform you can say it on but you do have to get out what you have to say and if your opinion is something bigoted you probably shouldn't be talking at all and of course if you put that out people will definitely return that back to you and you'll realize you should shut the up buddy personally personally I actually like it when when when people let me know that they're idiot you know because because then I get to check that box I'm like ok that person I'm just not gonna have anything to do with yeah but exactly so those people take care of themselves the other people who can contribute to good dialogue you got to open up and you got to speak as I said if you think you can't you probably can to shut the up ok but otherwise definitely I encourage everyone and that's why I try to use my platform and I'm glad you're even bringing light to this too and you're using your platform to try to open up a discussion it's not more of about who's right who's wrong some people may agree with me may agree against what I'm saying but I just like when there's open discussion because that's where we've gotten to it at this point where you can't really say anything everyone shuts you down or people just instantly defend a particular person because you're speaking what could be considered a remark against them so hopefully everyone just opens up just talk about it that's what it's all about talk about it for me to close I I would say while you know some artists that you love may you know make politically charged statements understand that if they're kind of hesitant sort of pull that into their everyday life or if they're not talking about that stuff on social media every time something happens just try to you know remind yourself that this person you know they may have good intentions and they may care about the situation but still at the end of the day they're just an entertainer and and you should be probably more worried about whether or not you're doing everything you can versus whether or not this other person who you've never met in your life is doing everything that they can because you know at the end of the day while you may feel disempowered because a guy like Kendrick Lamar J Cole might have what you see is this really huge platform while you're just an everyday person I'm just a regular dude and and so is academics over here so you know nothing you know nobody handed us our platforms we sort of just built it from the ground up and and you could do the same and and not even just try to copy what we're doing but you know as an everyday person you have access to lots of everyday people who you could motivate and try to talk with and try to work with to get together and make something happen so you know I I believe in a sense that artists should be held accountable for the things that they say if they do cause harm or if they are irresponsible in some kind of sense but you know you've also got to be worried about whether or not you're doing everything that you can to change the situation at hand if that's your concern and that's your goal and also as far as a platform everyone has a platform you have a Twitter account you have a Facebook account nowadays yeah nowadays everyone has a platform and just the unfortunate thing about is that most people in the pursuit to try to make their platform be heard they jump out the window and say the wrong thing and they get it gets known for the wrong reasons but definitely I agree with everything with what Anthony said all right man um thanks for being on nope and I'm gonna leave a link to his YouTube channel down in the description if you've sat through this incredibly long discussion thank you very much I hope it was enlightening or you know valuable to you and um yeah so I mean you know expect more conversations in the future Anthony Fantana DJ academics artists forever 
WSNlLDqMx6o,hi everyone Fanta no gate here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a really quick segment where I talk about my favorite records that have come out this past April interest albums that I reviewed from this past April you know just kind of give you guys a highlight some reviews that I think you should check out if you had missed them because I think these are pretty good albums number one the new Colin Stetson and Sarah Neufeld record never were the way she was an interesting instrumental experimental modern classical record of strings and sax coming together to create some kind of eerie dark evocative and and strange and very virtuous composition some very great playing on this record so you know if you're looking for something that is going to tickle that odd side of your brain then give this record a listen next the new Billy woods record today I wrote nothing and off-the-wall hip hop album that is very gritty very dark consisting mostly of very short songs kind of like little I don't know hip-hop vignettes there are over 20 tracks on this record a lot of them land somewhere between that 1 & 2 minute mark and we're just kind of getting these like little bite-sized glimpses of dozens of different situations narratives character portraits while not every track in my opinion hits as hard as the next the approach that Billy woods takes on this record is pretty unique next liturgy the ark work New York band they take a very noisy and grand approach to black metal on this record the the mixing and the vocal style on this record is not going to be for everybody but for the most part I did like this album because of its very refreshing approach and I thought the chord progressions the melodies and the electrifying performances on this LP made it worth listening to the new Alabama Shakes record really awesome fusion of pop music rock music and soul music on this LP everything that makes this record great is just very obvious it's on the surface it just throws it out at you it's it's like a lowball not to say that this album appeals to to like the lowest common denominator or anything like that but just the good songwriting the catchy melodies the the the soulful singing it's just all so goddamn likeable next the new Mountain Goats album beat the champ a really interesting folk rock indie folk record about pro-wrestling frontman John Darnell brings some incredibly impressive lyrics to the table on most of these tracks and he really just gives it his all when singing about pro wrestling I guess it's safe to say that no songwriter up until this point has sung at so much length and with so much passion about this particular topic and our final record the new young fathers album white men are black men too Scottish once hip hop trio young fathers have come through with a low fight pop album this time around and it's pretty freakin good not only are there some very catchy songs and sweet melodies all over this record but the very noisy textured production on this LP gives this record a lot of character - and those are my favourite releases from this past month if you haven't heard any of them do make the effort to head down there to the description box and check them out and yeah that's it Anthony Fantana great albums April forever 
tTt7YDzH054,I got in here cuz it didn't deal with the daemon I mean in the olden Amon hmm so I've got a deal with the daemon hi everyone family man tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new floor record the magical of a magic pipe blur one of the most recognized alt rock and Britpop bands of the 90s but a band that has been mostly inactive for the past decade or so the band is at the point now where their older records their best they're bigger records are starting to you know get some historical ground in the greater rock music canon so it's easy to see that blur is you know sort of due for a comeback but I have to admit that blurs come back here is not really one that I have been hotly anticipating for one the band was active only up until the early 2000s it's not like it was a lifetime ago and when the band disbanded it wasn't the end of the world we had some decent solo releases from gran Coxon and Damon Albarn sort of saw his career rocket off taking part masterminding in the animated rock and pop band Gorillaz he has also released a few solo records as of late to now just about five years ago we were getting some anticipation of a blur comeback because of some singles they were releasing out of the blue but since then I don't know I've kind of come to accept a world without blur and I just figured that if blur ever were to come back in a full-length album format it would only be because they had a grand very significant artistic statement to make if blur ever were to come back would they just give us a nostalgia trip give us those old records give us that old-school sound or would they continue to push and give us a left hook like they did with their last LP but blur actually continues to take risks on this new LP here with one of their most somber collections of songs yet a lot of the tracks on this new album here remind me of how just uncomparable dreary a lot of the songs were on the last damon albarn album the difference though with the magic whip is that the instrumental presence of this record is so much larger and a little punchier and as a result this album has more bite but I wouldn't say bite is necessarily a selling point of this album obviously this record is nowhere near as aggressive as an album like Park life or even some of the more hard-hitting tracks off of blurs last full-length LP the magic whip is essentially a mellower more instrumentally refined version of blur and maybe to instrumentally refine two points like on songs like ghost ship the glistening cents on this track the sunny guitars the kind of tropical vibe of this track the title of this song is funny because rather than a ghost ship actually feel like I'm on a yacht listening to some grade-a Yacht rock though I will say for yacht rock it's not completely gross and is actually legitimately soothing relaxing and pleasant to listen to even on the really punchy Rock opener the song lonesome streetwear blur brings back that sort of old-school Britpop sound this track too feels just a little too reserved especially for a kickoff for a comeback record I do like the kind of sad instrumental shift the song takes as it kind of glides into the chorus and then kicks back into the crunchy guitars as it goes back into the verses but still you know just kind of a mild performance here the record continues to sound kind of tame as we get into the song go on which has this lone groove that gets kind of tedious as the track plods along and even though the song tries to be maybe a bit of noise rock or just noisy rock with these abrasive guitars and kind of shrill keyboards orbiting around the beat the track just isn't that interesting because there's not a good song backing it up but there are actually some upbeat tracks on this LP that I like such as the song on really one of the standout tracks on this record when it comes to just pop appeal I love the really sunny upbeat chorus vocals that start the tract off as well as the refrain on this song I wanna be with you sounds like something that would have done really well on the pop charts in the 50s but just with more of a modern production punch and the kind of aggressive and feisty I broadcast is a highlight in the middle of this record - but my favorite moments on this LP the songs I find to be the most passionate are the tracks that are sadder like with the track Pyongyang which has this dark twined guitar lead and some electronic beats hanging in the background it's kind of post-punk II and I love the very warm instrumental shift this song brings when it glides into the course it kind of sounds like a sunrise coming after a very dark introduction and the song new world Towers um really eerie sticky melody on this track no towers and one of the I guess more depressing vocal performances on this LP but but in a good way and that it's actually affecting and kind of powerful feeling pretty much the same way about the song might terracotta heart and then we have ice cream man where we actually get mention of the title on this record and the Sun is sad as well I love the quirky keyboard here and also the the lyrical imagery as well while the music here does sound sad what Albarn is singing about on this track does bring I guess kind of a playful undertone I guess you could say it's an unexpected lyrical direction for a song that sounds this sad and the track there are too many of us the tune here is decent I think the song itself is maybe a little bit overblown because the productions are so grand and trying so hard to be dramatic especially with these just punchy strings this song is like like blurs Eleanor Rigby and the song on the surface kind of seems to be about overpopulation but there's really a feel of loneliness and isolation coming through and some of the subtext of these lyrics for me and the song I thought I was a spaceman another one of the sadder tracks on here with a kind of explosive ending it builds up to this nice climax in the middle of the track and then goes into this just full-blown rock instrumentation while I wasn't Huw on the tune here I did like the fact that the instrumentation just the sound of this track a lot of evocative sounds here feeling like Albarn or just our protagonist is sort of lost in the middle of space or in the middle of the track when the instrumentation really gets going is blasting off into space overall a good mixed bag of tracks from blur no amazing flow to this or anything like that but decent stylistic variety a good mix of just more hard-hitting and catchy as well as mellow and sad songs and they're both hits and misses on both sides of that aisle this record may not sound like an old-school blur record and it may kind of sound like a Damon Albarn solo album but it's still a really good collection of tracks but it's still a really good collection of tracks and I would say far from a disappointing return I'm feeling 80 some strong 7 on this LP tram how's that drama going how's that drama that drama taste and good you like that drama is that drama going good for you how's that trauma going you're lacking that drama oh yeah yeah you like that drama that's some good drama right there mmm-hmm you're the best I love you I hope you have a nice day and I hope you dug this record as much as me if not more loved you already said that forever

BfetFfARwv4,hi everyone Grantha need arctan oh here the internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new paul de Jong album if Paul is a New York via Netherlands multi-instrumentalist songwriter sound collages this is his first full-length album under his own name if you didn't know previously for years he had been releasing music in the musical duo the books along with songwriter Nick zoom uno and in the books music you've got a lot of combinations of folk music electronic music where samples were in heavy rotation and not just like samples of other music or something like that I mean samples of people talking samples vocals snippets just sounds that came from a variety of places unfortunately the books broke up after one of my favorite albums in their catalogue the way out and it wasn't too long after the release of that LP that we had Nick as a Muto talking about solo stuff coming on the way we eventually got a self-titled record a follow-up album which were both pretty good not quite as folk-influenced as the books stuff more of an art rock edge and there were faint whiffs of the sample-based music that the books used to make on these records as well but not really to the same degree it was definitely refreshing to see Nick go in a different direction with his solo work but it seems that Paul over here is kind of staying in much more familiar territory with this new album there are musical sound collages on this record folky instrumentation pianos and strings along with some strange electronic manipulations that come into play on some of these tracks some songs they are very overt and your face obvious on other tracks they are just very subtle or maybe even non-existent theoretically kinda sounds like a books record but for me this album doesn't necessarily read as a lack of progression because I think by himself Paul is able to explore a lot of these ideas and themes that you would typically find on a books record specifically their older stuff in a more intimate serene way stylistically on this record we get a handful of different genres a bit of folk music and bluegrass some classical modern classical it sounds like some ambient music this is a tender beautiful touching little album with some flashes of eccentric fun here and there it's got a nice flow as well this LP has a pretty light-hearted start to it with the song auction block which features some very gorgeous piano some very fast speedy southern-fried fiddles and some crickets worked into the background as well this song sounds like it would work perfectly next to a campfire just kind of sounds like this this very welcoming track like you're stumbling upon this beautiful world of music hidden away in the woods somewhere where nobody else has heard it or seen it just nobody else knows what's going on but you and the handful of other people that are there it's a little get-together it's a little hootenanny B song Holly Wald has a weird little instrumental build to it based off what sounds like a guitar instructional video which is nothing new for the books something that even Nick Sam you know in his solo capacity kind of whips out as a routine during live sets this track continues the bluegrass theme of this record and it's just a really nice nimble performance of fiddles and acoustic guitars this track is also just a short three minutes a lot of the songs on this LP function more off of just little diddies and motifs than they do just grand showy musical compositions even the song this is who I am which is one of the heavier songs on here the layers of instrumentation come together and don't create something explosive but rather kind of repetitive and hypnotic it's alright after this song that album flows into a series of kind of serene instrumentals some of which are strikingly beautiful others are kind of breezy mild and not that memorable which I kind of found to be the case with the title track here however I love the song debt-free with the fluttering woodwinds and strings on this track wonderful the song Golden Gate is great as well and after this phase in the album we get a series of tracks that are even lighter on the ears kind of am in tone maybe even a little classical some of this records most refined performances are on this last leg of the record maybe with the exception of the kind of quiet squeaky fiddle that closes the album out overall with this LP I liked it I thought it was really good if you're into the books if you're into instrumental folk music maybe even bluegrass with kind of an experimental edge just fusions of electronic music and folk music I think you're gonna enjoy this record because as I said there's a lot to like about it it's nothing mind-blowing or anything like that but it is a charming album with a lot of pretty moments I'm feeling a decent strong 7 on this LP transition if you roody-poo candy-asses have given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh what what what's that god damn luck took his head off 
6HLTXL-s4J8,I want to save you but what's keeping you in there hi everyone Anthony Montano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Colin Stetson and Sarah Neufeld album never were the way she was this is a collaborative record between two stellar Canadian musicians who have both over the years helped bring together the illustrious sound of Arcade Fire's music with brass and strings however colin has actually been making quite a bit of noise in a solo capacity over the past few years with these intriguing records of long winding solo sax pieces in which he makes use of these continuous breathing techniques so there's not actually any point at which the sax pieces the very intense and large breaths he pushes through his reed instrument actually pull out some phantom notes as well the sort of how under or soar over whatever he's kind of playing in terms of these sort of very speedy hypnotic runs and arpeggios he sort of broke out with this sound and style with his record new history warfare vol 2 but the follow-up to that album vol 3 it was ok didn't really feel like he was bringing all that much in terms of a new approach to what he was doing on vol 2 and there were some kind of uncomplimentary vocal appearances from Bon Iver aka Justin Vernon but the skill level behind this LP was still incredibly high and Miss Sarah Neufeld has actually been putting in some effort on some solo material lately as well the same year that Colin put out new history warfare vol 3 she put out the album hero brother a very haunting string based modern classical project and now that these two are venturing into some solo projects it seems that their creative paths are crossing again and it's going to be pretty interesting to see how they complement one another this album or at least it was then I listened to the album and this is my review for the album what we're essentially getting on this LP is a series of somewhat minimal modern classical pieces fueled by repetition hypnotic repetition and kind of subtle progressions if you've heard Collin Stetson solo stuff if you've heard miss Neufeld solo stuff none of what is going on with this LP will sound all that alien to you there are actually a few pieces here that sound like they could have made it onto one of Colin's past two albums but with just some very faint string accompaniment namely the opener on this LP which admittedly for me was a bit of a mild opener for this LP not really the the change in pace I was hoping for to kick this LP off I was hoping just for more complex compositionally complex and dynamic songs a lot like what was on miss new Feld's album but Colin and Sarah don't disappoint on that front with the following tracks the track in the Vespers actually moves through multiple musical movements after a very intense dance of sax and violin where it seems like the two instruments are just following each other just very closely a lot of tension building up on this song and then there's a bit of an explosion as a result of this intensity and the sax is kind of sent spiraling into the abyss as the violin is just kind of weeping just crying out now that it is alone and the song won't be a thing to become as a shorter piece on here and it's kind of this lumbering lurking heavy bit of sax and strings it sounds like some kind of deformed monster just Lloyd being down the hallway of an old Victorian home may be about to creep into the room of some unsuspecting kid and just scare them things on this LP get even easier with the song the dark hug of time if that title isn't already telling enough but there are these gurgling bass notes on here which it seems like Colin is just blowing into so furiously that he's getting these just just squelches this noise these owls that run along with these gurgles later into the song there are some shrill strings on this track too and what sounds like a drum surprisingly I could be mistaken on that because on past Colin Stetson records he has miked the inside of his saxophones to kind of get the the rhythmic sound of the valves opening and closing on his Sachs's and these sounds actually pop up on this record with sounds like them on this LP on the next song but during a few moments on here it does sound like there is a drum keeping a very simple slow steady pace making this song sound like something is just about to creep up behind me and kill me and this track and other songs on here are assembled with the kind of reverb soaked gritty recording and production style that you might have heard on Collins Pass material or like a Godspeed you black Emperor record which adds to the overall vibe of this record and just makes it sound great the instruments on the sell Pete are surely if you've heard any popular music of the past several decades familiar to you but the way Colin and Sarah play these instruments on this record it's just so evocative it's refreshing there's just some weird sounds on this record the sounds on this LP are stirring their apocalyptic thick thick thick as well as moody and kind of dreary and just pulling at the heartstrings - not only is this record here an entertaining instrumental album with some classical undertones but I think it's a bit of a refreshing listen a refreshing approach for those specifically me who might have found new history warfare vol 3 to be kind of stale for calling I think Colin and Sarah really pull the best out of one another on this LP whether it be through the really great string parts of this album or the rumbling drones of the title track on this LP teaming up Colin and Sarah I think she brings the perfect amount of accompaniment and detail to what could have just been some average sax pieces for Stetson and as they come together they're able to kind of just branch out and push past some of the I guess more minimal tendencies that Colin displays in his solo work for me this was a very enjoyable straight to the point experimental instrumental album I'm feeling a strong 7 to a late 8 on this thing transition what do you think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think Anthony should review next and seriously if you're still annoyed about the whole Yelawolf review just relax I really really liked it as an album he did not you probably fell somewhere in between and there's lots of room on the internet for all of our opinions and that's really all they are but until then Marc Rondon spectrum pulse forever 
8quP0JNiFSg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new yellow wolf record love-story alabama rapper Yelawolf isla mericans citizen himself out with a new record his second release for the Shady Records label I believe I was pretty impressed with yellow Wolf's rap flow his delivery is gritty lyrics on his early singles and mixtapes but then came in a Shady Records record contract which you know while I haven't really been a big fan of a lot of Eminem's latest releases and projects and I'm not a huge fan of the Shady Records catalog I thought we were actually going to be in for a decent album from yellow wolf because I don't know just seemed like a pretty good fit given how big of an influence Eminem is on yellow wolf style not only in how he raps but also the themes that come up in his songs being an outsider growing up poor yellow wolf packs and lots of references to his southern heritage in his songs as well but my high hopes for this record were dashed by just a series of mediocre songs this radioactive album lacked in a lot of the same ways slaughterhouses Shady Records debut lacked it didn't bring any of the grit of the early work and instead swap that out with more sugary beats and poppy rap tunes it just seemed like a more watered down version of yellow Wolf's already established style so to be honest I wasn't really expecting all that much from this new yellow wolf album over here and not that I thought it was going to be terrible but yellow if hasn't really crossed my mind since the release of radioactive but some people seem to be making a huge deal of this new LP over here so out of morbid curiosity I ended up checking it out and I think yellow wolf came out with a less enjoyable album this time around yellow Wolf's cardinal sin on radioactive is that he ended up doing the same thing most rappers do and they make a big commercial debut or a big commercial record they just come out with a kind of sugar did focus-grouped product now I don't like love story either but for completely different reasons this album feels like there was no control over it whatsoever this wolf on the front no leash on this wolf and as a result the songs here are incredibly indulgent it's like yellow wolf was given the ability not necessarily the grasp but the reach to go in any direction he wanted so we get these funky fusions of country rap all over this LP a la Kid Rock along with the opener here which is a bit of bustling rap rock that would have just blasted to the top of the charts had this been 1999 when this record dropped and people were just you know really hot off of a biscuit and then there is singing singing singing and more singing off of this LP and and not just other people singing yellow wolf singing which in small doses on some of these tracks is passable like on the song change or empty bottles but I'm pretty much every other song here yellow wolf takes it upon himself to deliver one nasal vocally strained and wimpy chorus after another like on whiskey and a bottle which samples a in instrumental I haven't heard a sample since mad villains mad villainy or the song till it's gone or the hip hop country fusion of American you there are songs here where yellow off tries to do a legit folk tune like on devil in my veins where the chord progression definitely brings a House of the Rising Sun vibe but his vocal delivery on this track isn't so nasal and obnoxious like it is on the other songs it's very quiet and subdued to the point where his singing is actually kind of passionless and boring despite the very illustrious strings on the instrumental here I kind of feel like his vocal delivery is lacking on the song have a nice flight as well these two tracks to me highlight that yellow wolf is just not that exciting of a singer he's more passionate and compelling a rapper we also have the unbearably corny best friend with em on the song and you know his really angry aggressive verse couldn't even save the track and yellow if does not rap on this song at all I mean he's singing throughout the duration of the track except for Eminem's verse my best friend he's just really really pushing it off a cliff we also have the sickeningly lovey W Tennessee love and and more songs on the back end of this LP - it's to the point where I no longer feel like I'm listening to a rap record with some country undertones I just feel like I'm listening to a country record with some rap undertones and it's not that yellow needs to sort of stay in that rap Lane it's not that you can't experiment or venture out it's that the country that he's making or creating or indulging in on this record isn't even particularly good country it's more commercial than it is outlaw the one bit of that you might hear sampled in the opening sketch that kicks the album off that is the last bit of good country you will hear on this record after you have started it to go back to that opening track one more time even though it does feel like some corny just of stale rap rock I do like the track quite a bit it is fun it's fun despite the horrible outro I'm from outer space yellow wolf just sounds so amped and excited at the intro to this LP that it completely blows away any biases that I might have against this rap rock sound once the song kicks off and when this guy makes a point to rap on this record his chops and his passion are certainly still there it's just that these moments don't happen that often on a record that is over an hour in length I just kind of feel like on this record yellow wolf has made himself tired of rapping he just doesn't do it often on this LP and when he does do it his lyrics just kind of circle around the same topics we know him for talking about being a redneck his upbringing tattoos Chevy's drinking and he doesn't really give us any more insight into these topics than he has before in his one-liners and his kind of loose Association verses where he's jumping from one idea to the next or even the songs where he seems to dive a little deeper into a bit of a narrative with the exception of the song heartbreak which actually I think Yela delivers some pretty coherent verses on this track talking about his I guess time in the music industry signing trying to keep fans happy trying to keep his family fed and paid trying to keep the record label happy just seemed like there was a lot of frustration real frustration coming through in his verses that that made the song go over pretty well despite the fact that it had this a beat that would have McLemore mouthwatering like who I got a rap on that this record to me is just all about the very strong sense of cult of personality that is in hip-hop right now because if you weren't invested in the persona of the artists who you're following and you're such a big fan of what why would you want to listen to them sing if they're not that great of a singer there are some rap artists that take advantage of this to a small degree people like Kanye who widely acknowledges the fact that he is not a good singer yet continues to sing again and again and again on records but at least he continues to bring lyrics Yelawolf takes advantage of that cult of personality more than I think any rapper has as of late even Action Bronson whose new record features a ridiculous amount of singing over some awful rock instrumentals and not only is yellow Wolf's just unlikable singing voice all over this LP but the album emotionally is just sickeningly sappy over these just somewhat excruciating a lot of the time fusions of country and hip-hop I mean this record ends off with I don't know kind of like dueling turntable scratches and fiddle solos I mean yeah that makes sense so yeah this record to me it's just sappy it's overly emotional without actually bringing any lyrics that would make those emotions compelling just some corny songs all over this record not good singing just in bad taste fusions of rap and country again not feeling this record alright just feeling like a light three on this thing transition if you've given this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana yellow wolf note starter forever 
KdbAYLHLUZ8,hi everyone can theny do tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tribulation record the children tribulation is a Swedish metal band on the third full-length LP if I'm correct I first caught wind of them in 2013 through the album the formulas of death a sometimes brutal and sometimes harmonious throwback of thrash death and heavy metal with some very dramatic blackened vocals and some progressive song structures sometimes as well as sinister melodies not only because some of the tracks on this LP you were pretty catchy but also it's it's pretty awesome to hear such a seamless blend of multiple metal styles on one LP though I did have some issues with this record I thought the vocals were just maybe a little too buried for my taste and some of the tracks on this thing we're just kind of I don't know forgettable I didn't think tribulation came through with that strong of a personality on the cell P though I did think there were some awesome instrumentals on this album the right balance of flashy playing and head bashing brutality he think a cross between the gruff killer aggression of a band like toxic Holocaust mixed with the kind of melodic sweet eerie and a cult vibe that you might get on a ghost album with some classic heavy metal vibes thrown in at times as well well that record is in the past now we're in the present we are here for another round of tribulation songs and they haven't really changed the core of their sound all that much we get some bigger production on here the vocals seem pumped up a little bit and all of all tribulation actually pulls through with a pretty solid metal record the entire LP kicks off with these powerful theatrical organ chords the track slowly builds tension until it eventually just breaks into this moonlit melodic metal tune the vocals on this thing puncture the mix like vampire fangs into an unsuspecting victim with some soaring guitar means flying like bats overhead it's a pretty great start and then the record starts its full-on attack of driving drums and chords supporting these gothic melodies the occasional kind of catchy vocal this album is nothing but cobwebs castles candelabras cauldrons and and head banging and tribulation sticks to that vibe pretty closely through this entire record some tracks on here get a little more ambitious than others instrumentally introducing these long winding instrumental passages others bring on extra instrumentation some keyboards some strings there are quite a few six and seven minute long tracks on this nearly one hour album and tribulation does a relatively good job of keeping things riveting throughout these tracks even on the songs yeah which is noticeably quieter than the other tracks here features a bit of a surf rock drumbeat mixed with some mighty drum fills and some great guitar melodies now here's the part in the review where I'm like well you know it's pretty good but even though I appreciate that tribulation seems to put everything into their sound and style I think this record is a little OneNote despite some pretty good interludes and and intros pretty much every song here ends up falling into these similarly triumphant and righteous builds of melodic heavy metal guitars and drums and their points on this LP where I wish the vocals are just a little bit more eccentric while I like the fact that they are a bit more intelligible lyrically than some black metal vocalists are I wish there were maybe some cleans on this record some shrieks anything to kind of break up the monotony of of this album's instrumental style and vocal style I wish there were more moments on this LP like cada Pavone s which is this orchestral ish interlude that builds the album up for its closing track if there were more instrumental bits like this worked into the album tracklist or into these songs themselves it would have kept a lot of them from just blending together and even though the song is a pretty good setup for the losing track this song doesn't really hit all that hard for me because I feel like at this point tribulation has done everything they are going to do with the exception of the really noisy intense last few moments of this track overall this is a pretty good LP I liked a lot of the tracks here I think there are definitely some catchy highlights on this album and tribulation are most definitely unquestionably talented from an instrumental standpoint I just wish you know this this record took more risks really instrumentally and vocally feeling a decent too strong seven on this record transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next in that set anthony Fantana [Music] music tribulation forever 
x6Lis-8oaCU,you're scary Damon you're a scary David Cal no hi everyone Bethany go down here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Toro y Moi LP what for Toro y Moi is the musical pseudonym of producer multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter chaz bundok who now has multiple albums under his belt with this name at one point chaz was actually one of the bigger names to come out of chillwave the sweet psychedelic and short-lived micro genre that was kind of a cross between dream pop and electronic music much of it was sample based however chaz quickly moved beyond the sound of his breakout album causers of this and into the realms of synth funk and lo-fi indian psychedelic pop on his album underneath the pine which features some of his best singles the song new beat is easily my favorite off that LP however chaz followed this kind of decent and likable album up with an almost excruciating one anything in return on this LP Chaz was unearthing some of the most homely and unlikable elements of 80's pop music and then putting them on display as if anyone needs to relive the sound of the New Kids on the Block each Toro y Moi project since the release of causes of this has dabbled in a different era of pop nostalgia and what for is not really different in that regard on this LP we get old-school psychedelic pop and rock mixed with a bit of funk and disco it's like an amalgamation of music that could have been released anywhere between 1966 and 1976 not totally sure if we need Chas reliving the past for us once again but there are some redeeming qualities to this LP that are worth noting for one this album features some of Toro y Moi x' catchiest songs yet as well as some of the projects most carefully and fantastically assembled instrumentals yet bass guitars drums keyboards vocals coming to other to create some pretty groovy funky but also detailed and and sweet pop instrumentals in the past the kind of shoddy instrumental limitations of Toro y Moi how back some of Chaz's reanimations of synth funk and pop not so much the case on what for for example the song empty-nesters which has a jam in its runtime or the track run baby run which kicks off like an honest-to-god tender ballad also I think the vocals are a step up on this album Chaz is not one of my favorite singers but he seems to be mixing his vocals a little higher on this album putting a bit more effort into his singing singing singing the production on this LP is pretty good too it's not a total nostalgia fest while it does feel vintage it does feel old-school Chaz is a homegrown producer so his kind of quirky approach to mixing and recording shines through on these songs plus Chaz's appreciation and love of modern indie rock and pop gives these tracks a modern punch - for example the song yeah right which is the closing track here which at its core feels kind of like a Weezer song but it's enmeshed in this lazy sun-baked 70 soft rock instrumentation it's pretty sweet in the orchestral instrumentation that finishes the song off was an incredibly nice touch the record is 36 minutes there's not really a whole lot of room for BS Chaz has come out with records in the past that are about the same length however I have found them to be loaded with very unmemorable songs and filler not so much the case with what for with this album I just feel like I'm listening to an alternative pop songwriter hone his craft and in a way approach the danceable sweet and catchy eccentricity of people like Ariel pink or Arthur Russell and I think people who are in the Hot Chip or even Chromeo would appreciate this album - the opening track on here features some incredibly fat warm round drums and bass they feel like they are compressed to the point where they are bleeding into one another like I'm listening to this song on a really old cassette tape and I like that tape sound on this song but it does get excessively muddy at points on the song Buffalo a dance beat pops in it's a quality disco tune with a lot of quirk at a very smooth bass line the vocals feel a little limited at points kind of strained again Chazz is not really an amazing singer but he does seem to be putting in more effort with putting the vocals up front especially on the track spell it out this to me was a great moment for the vocals on this record he has all these multitrack bits of I guess spoken word or just kind of I don't know monotone singing or like chanting it was just really ear grabbing it and kind of energetic and exciting but even though the album continues to dish out some pretty good instrumentals like on the song the flight it's kind of disheartening to hear the singing over these instrumentals just kind of stiff and lifeless the instrumentals on on these tracks they feel so fluid and in lush and poppy but then Chazz over this song he is just singing in such a but I loved the appearance of piano on this track really gorgeous solo essentially the album here just kind of swings back and forth between these psych pop tunes and these dance pop tunes with a disco flare a weird mix of styles for one record but Chaz's approach to production and his singing even though it does have its low points makes this record feel pretty cohesive and despite the tracks that are more forgettable than others on this LP the entire album is just similarly sweet and warm kind of like a s'more now personally I've never really been that big of a sweet sky but this record certainly puts me in the mood for sweets I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever 
PFywKjG6Vjw,the hi everyone retha nice Ponton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan where I essentially uh answer a letter written by somebody who watches the show and they got kind of a question thing going let's let's go dear Anthony I've been a big fan of yours for a few years now you've introduced me to a bunch of artists that I now consider to be my favorites thank you my question is can bad people make good art in light of the recent Bill Cosby rape allegations my friends and I have been debating the impact that an artist actions outside of their craft can have on the craft itself while Bill Cosby is a comedian there's no shortage of praise musicians that have been accused or convicted of doing terrible things Jimmy Page of our maker nice Chuck Berry John Lennon etc is art separate from the artist or is the character of an artist also intimately intertwined with their art to the point where the two are inseparable does it depend you touched on this topic in your musicians that are assholes video but I would love to hear your thoughts on this how do you deal with listening to music that has been made by people of questionable moral standing thank you for taking the time to read this your fan Tom all right so Tom Tom it boy let me answer this question that you should admit um can bad people make good art short answer yes long answer since good music is almost completely subjective what you're really asking me is can someone of questionable moral standing or at least someone who does not align with my personal morals make art that emotionally resonates with me that I find entertaining over the years there have been leagues of seedy individuals in the music industry on stage behind the scenes or maybe even behind a printed page if you want morality pick up a book or a written piece by Plato Aristotle maybe a bit of Socrates or Rousseau if you want entertainment pick up an album musicians are famous for making ap of our a piece of auditory art they're not famous for fantastic life decisions but I do sort of understand the concern one these artists if they do become famous they are public figures and everything that you do while you exist in the public eye is scrutinized no matter what to the art that this person may be making might resonate with you in some kind of really deep emotional way that feels incredibly personal to you so it might be heartbreaking in a way when you find out that this person who was the mastermind behind your favorite record likes to murder things unless that's what they sing songs about then it might not be that much of a surprise and the third part of this concern is that people see an incredible amount of power and influence in popular culture and often musicians or singers or rappers that are popular might extol some kind of idea or message or life philosophy or maybe a questionable situation in their music and then a I guess unassuming listener might somehow take that life philosophy and mold it to their own yellow now emphasis on that might happen because there are no trustworthy statistics that I could show you that could prove any such thing in a quantitative numeric way like X amount of people that listen to this song about selling drugs actually ended up selling drugs and if there was such a study it would have to prove these statistic is is causation and not just correlation for example consider the number of people who tried smoking crack after listening to Vipers yeol cowards don't even smoke crack most likely zero even I myself cannot pick up the pipe to prove his challenge of cowardice wrong and after the release of Tyler the creators kill people burn ship school we saw no statistical increase in people killed  burned and schools though I am sure that Kevin Gates has turned quite a few people on to booty eating but there are some artists that seem to have some kind of socio-political or mental agenda when it comes to how they want their music to be received consider kendrick lamar's new album to pimp a butterfly but also consider on that same album the line where he's talking about the message and the sort of music that he's making not reaching his younger sister it's kind of weird when we hear music that we think has a good idea and a good philosophy to it we sort of see it as not resonating with anybody and not affecting everybody but when we look at somebody like Chief Keef we're kind of afraid that somebody might see his music videos and hear his music and then want to go push a wig back or maybe we're worrying that the new run the jewels album is some kind of misogyny co-sign again this phenomenon of music and the artists behind it directly changing and impacting the moral ideals and the actions of the people listening to the music and listening to these artists it's not something that is easily measurable and for those who might see achieve Keef song and and think that he drives people to be violent I think the only way you can jump to that conclusion is that you are so outside of that culture and you are so just out of touch with it that you have no idea as to what the personal choices the social pressures and the economic pressures are that would drive someone to lead the kind of lifestyle that mr. Keefe leads not to paint Chief Keef is some kind of victim or anything like that I'm just saying that he is in control of his life choices as you are in control of yours you cannot blame your crappy decisions on something that you heard in a Chief Keef song so my long answer to this question is a question of why do we care if entertainers are bad people nobody is perfect may he who is without sin cast the first stone it's cliche but it's true maybe influence isn't really an issue for you and you just want to make sure that you're you're not exposing yourself to anybody that you might disagree with on moral grounds I sort of understand that the audience wants to buy itself and support the artists that that they most closely relate to or at least they feel like they relate to which honestly in my opinion is a pretty shitty ideal to seek there are tons of artists in my record collection here whose albums I would just need to throw away if I were just specifically trying to hear people who I identified with ideologically and philosophically and and morally there are records that I think have redeeming qualities or I even love from people such as Freddie Gibbs and mad lib or waka flocka flame or maybe even Nick Cave who has tons of songs that depict murder or maybe even rape things I would not do but that doesn't mean it didn't make for a compelling piece of art and it doesn't necessarily mean that the artist is giving you the okay to do what they put into a song or even do what they do outside of a song because there are some artists whose personal actions I take offense with or I disagree with or just personal politics I disagree with and sometimes they turn up in their music but I managed to enjoy at least some of their tracks anyway Action Bronson Eminem Azealia Banks Burzum Varg yet there are other artists who for the most part at least what turns up in their songs I agree with what they're saying but I don't necessarily enjoy what they're doing musically for example the new heenes album I loved the song Patriot Act off of that LP but didn't really care for much of anything else on the record or even immortal technique I mean whenever I hear this guy interview I think he is saying some incredibly real on point  when it comes to the current state of things but I could not stand his last two projects message and philosophy and personal choices outside of music for me are not key to enjoying a piece of art sometimes simply relating to what a song is saying or what an artist is doing in the music or outside of the music is maybe the the laziest way to enjoy a piece of music because there's no real appreciation in that equation for the sound or their performance or whatever the melody is or what the the mix or the production is like I'm going to bring this back to Kendrick Lamar again the final song on his new LP he asks the audience challenges the audience saying if the hits the fan are you still a fan if there is some point where for whatever reason you find the artist to be morally reprehensible Cybil do you still enjoy their music do you still follow them do you still enjoy the art I think with the song Kendrick is kind of making a grander statement about how difficult it is for the audience to separate the artists from the art a lot of the time and it you know has a lot to do with with artists like Kendrick making music that is so personal and is so based on his personal experience and philosophy so because we feel like we're getting so much of him in the music when he does something outside of the music that feels out of characters maybe questionable maybe he's breaking the lard doing something that would endanger someone else we kind of feel like we've been cheated in a way as if this bad thing this artist just did completely invalidates whatever message he or she had been delivering up until that point me personally I don't really see it like that because messages are static and and sometimes perfect things that mean a certain thing no matter what way you look at them they don't change they're just that whereas a person can be kind of inconsistent a person can change their mind a person in your eyes could change from being good to being bad and the world is filled with people who in your opinion you might deem bad and I don't know I personally find it better and more interesting and maybe more constructive to kind of work with these people or at least I guess keep conscious of them rather than shut myself off from all of them which i think is a pretty unhealthy takes away any chance for maybe you to have a learning experience takes away any chance for maybe you to a influence this person the world is filled with people who you might deem bad whose moral compass does not align with yours and some of these people have made your favorite albums maybe they're just good at hiding the bad things that they've done because they're private people and they don't want the drama musicians and music aren't really looking for your moral compass I have my opinions on music which again are completely subjective you're free to disagree with anything in every thing I say in regards to the quality or the character of an album but I'm not going to try to shame some musician I listen to on the internet because they might have committed some crime or done some kind of heinous thing or maybe have said some offensive stuff that's not really my place and for those who do see it as their place to kind of police the moral decisions of others okay those are essentially my thoughts can bad people make good music thanks for thanks write in the letter you're the best transition what do you make of all this crazy stuff I just said pretty crazy right none of it made any sense well let me know down in the in the comments cool cool you're the best I believe in you you're number one don't forget that Anthony Fantan oh can bad people make good music forever 
pTZXb28CM_U,hi everyone to theny cute anno here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new marching church album have the Libman oklahoma marching church is the third band and capture the attention of the indie music circuit and also be fronted by singer-songwriter guitarist elias be Ronon felt also known for fronting groups such as far an ice age one of the better noise rock and post-punk bands of the past several years they have got an incredibly solid discography so far I recommend you listen to it their last LP over here was easily their most ambitious they stayed in touch with their punk roots while simultaneously bringing on some horns some strings some full instrumentation which was just as chaotic as the guitars the drums and the vocals typically are in an Ice Age album and through this chaos surprisingly more complex songs shined through it was just a really creative and diverse rock album so it's not surprising to hear that there was some creative spill over into a another project marching Church which at one time was just a lowly side project for Elias but now he has built it into a full-fledged band its own independent thing where I'm guessing he's maybe a little bit more the star of the show let's also not ignore the fact that there are other members of this band that have been featured in groups such as sex Jerome and var and lower I mean we just have a collection of post-punk misfits from Denmark on this album and compared to their other projects the members of marching church are taking a noticeably different approach to writing and performing on this world is not enough this is a rock album but the songs feel just looser just more in the moment a little more chaotic a lot of repetition in these tracks of riffs and rhythm patterns and chord progressions and as they are repeated they sort of go in this rollercoaster of intensity sometimes building up sometimes falling down until it all meets some kind of climax or sense of closure there are eight tracks on this album and the record is 50 minutes long some of these songs number up to six seven eight or nine minutes and there's some pretty varied influences on this record we have some soul here some punk and noise rock experimental rock some blues rock as well there's also one track that kind of feels like a bit of pop rock from the 60s there's this big grand you can't always get what you want esque instrumental expansion on the song king of song there's some spoken word here and the same kind of instrumental palette that you might have heard on the last ice age LP with the horns and the strings and the kind of funky instrumentation here and there but no matter what the stylistic vibe what pulls all these songs together are these kind of loose in the moment somewhat improvisational performances which tends to make these songs feel less than to the point even some of the shorter tracks on here like the opener feels like it kind of goes on forever [Music] often what ends up hurting this album is that there might be some decent song ideas on these tracks but they are drawn out to the point where they turn kind of dull sort of like an overused knife kind of like the song hungry for love where we get some freakish and intense vocal embellishments throughout the entire track and it's pretty great that the instrumentation moves very closely in tune with the vocals in terms of just sound and intensity it just feels like everybody on this record is very much in tune with one another in others but it's not like the performance and the writing is so fantastic that it justifies the seven-minute length of this song it really could have used maybe a bit more forethought and a few more changes and some songs on this LP feel like they had a bit more planning involved like the track your father's eyes which has some really awesome horn work in the track and has a bit of a waltz to the groove sort of sounds like the soundtrack to the most depressing prom ever in the history of the world and the song moves through several different instrumental shifts without a hitch it's a good track and pushes beyond that seven-minute length I think there are some high points on this LP but I can't shake the feeling that maybe this album is really only going to be entertaining for ice age listeners because is just a little indulgent as aliases freakish vocal performances are often the focal point on these tracks and any ambitions for songwriting kind of take a backseat I think the main mission of this LP is emotional intensity and just tension building with the instrumentals which ends up making the other tracks on this album not memorable for being catchy just kind of memorable for different sounds and different emotional moments they're kind of able to stir up like the song every child which features just multiple overdubbed vocals that are just incredibly weird and just just very odd there's just some weird mixing on this track overall and a kind of off-kilter piano phrase - it's it's maybe the most demo ish sounding song on the whole LP the song up a hill is chilling it's menacing nine minute length on this track but doesn't sound too tiresome compared to other songs on here and the closer sounds like a pretty good ballad but um it's like dying it's like on its last breath all of the vocal quirks that you might catch on an Ice Age album are here in spades like they're all just turned up to 11 the moments where Elias is so overcome with emotion that he can't even bring himself to carry a melody that that's essentially how this album ends this was a pretty decent album me as an Ice Age fan I found it entertaining and while I do appreciate that the band might not want this project to be seen as a side project I mean I kind of find it more to be like a Danish underground rock supergroup instead really but still a kind of feel side project ish as it reads like a much more radical and indulgent version of what we have already heard from this handful of bands extra blower ice age and VAR I thought there were some interesting ideas on this LP some cool left hooks but points of this album can be kind of patience trying and and the record isn't even that long I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition have you given this Alma listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana marching Church forever 
5NptvA4PyEI,help me help me it's David David hi everyone yeah thony Fantana here internets busiest night and it's time for review of the new Alabama Shakes record sound and color true to their name Alabama Shakes are in Alabama rock band and this is their sophomore full-length LP a few years ago the band was making some waves in the mainstream and in the underground with a handful of pretty winning singles from their debut album tracks like hold on songs that had kind of a pop sensibility to them but a very dirty southern rock delivery also the band's guitarist and frontwoman Brittany Howard while I did think her performances on this record were okay in the live setting she was proving to be a pretty passionate and electrifying performer in my opinion this debut Alabama Shakes LP while it had the basics down it had some admirable qualities there wasn't anything that distinct or exciting about it other than the fact that it's it's been a while since we've had a band this popular reppin this southern rock sound so hard sure we have drive-by truckers and other groups as well but southern rock is not exactly in its heyday right now so at one point I was kind of on the fence with Alabama Shakes but I heard a few of the singles leading up to this new LP I was pretty impressed and decided to give this Owl molas listen listen listen listen and was pleasantly surprised this new LP from Alabama Shakes is not just a decent echo of ideas from the past there is a better recording on this album there are better performances on this album and what I feel to be better songs and this LP is a stylistic shift for Alabama Shakes as well because Britney Murphy's voice pushes the band into more of a soul sound which in my opinion fits her singing style so much better now the band is still in tune with their southern rock roots they still have a vintage sound a vintage quality to their recording style to the production on this album but here I would say Alabama Shakes take that first couple of steps toward just getting out from under the looming shadow of their influences which was really obvious on their debut the entire album kicks off with these really sweet wonderful just gorgeous on the ears xylophone or vibraphone melodies that that really chill the atmosphere of the track and brittany howard's vocals on this song are wonderful the track really kicks the album off very slow and easy on this track we're also getting some slowly building drums some sort of eccentric vocal harmonies laced into the vocal melodies that bernie howard is already singing and we're also getting some strings just very subtly swelling into the song as it progresses along two minutes into this track and we're already getting a night and day difference between the detail and the subtlety of this album and Alabama Shakes last album the first track on this LP is great but it's just more of an intro more of a taster the album really gets started off when the song don't want to fight kicks in it's got more of a rock edge but the sole flavor of this track is incredibly strong the twanging guitars and booney drums on this track would have fit pretty snugly into Alabama Shakes last album but I love the way this song changes pace on the chorus here to what feels like just more of a minor key or a minor guitar riff Brittney Howard's falsetto vocal melody on this track is great and her lyrics are actually pretty great depiction of the emotional drained feeling one can have after arguing with somebody who maybe you care about for an extended period of time very passionate vocal performance on this track and it feels like a step forward for Alabama Shakes too but the song dunes feels like a step backwards once again we're kind of getting the muddy production style that we heard on the band's last LP and aside from maybe some strings that were maybe added in afterwards it feels like a song that could have just been on that album the song guess who is similarly muddy is as well in my opinion it just doesn't fit in the lush clean big and just larger and more ambitious and panoramic sound that Alabama Shakes had been showing on this album thus far but things go back on track with the song future people which isn't so much a pop song as it is just a really huge dramatic soul instrumental with some really awesome vocal work from Brittany Howard thrown on top I get a buzzing bassline on this track some pentatonic guitar leads and just really explosive performance which we also get on the song give me your love give me all your love this track has a similar heaviness to it and some monstrous organ chords - and I love Howard's voice on this track sister her screams of Yeti hi I am is just so is so intense she's just going all out on this album wears on boys and girls there were points where I felt like you know in comparison here maybe a little reserved and I love the way the band pushes this track into a bit of a jam in the second half it's nice to hear Alabama Shakes show not only that they can write a great song but they can kind of let loose and dig in instrumentally - while simultaneously making quieter and subtler ballads on this LP like this feeling work as well this is a pretty dynamic LP with a good handful of surprises on it namely the song the greatest one of the few tracks on here where I actually think the lo-fi recording of this track kind of fits this song is sort of messy sloppy it's weirdly punky with this baton Bobby and a pretty fast tempo and Britney Howard's vocals on this tracker are pretty amazing as well but what really makes this track work is just how sloppily the instrumentation comes together it's like they're having a lot of fun putting the song together and just playing this song it feels like this kind of impromptu off-the-cuff silly moment but a good song shines through anyway I know it sounds corny but listening to this record I feel like I finally know what Alabama Shakes is you know I got him I got a love am shanks when I listen to this album all I got to say on this LP Alabama Shakes great job this was an improvement on pretty much all fronts and not only were there improvements on this album but the band took a few risks as well most of them paid off maybe with the exception of the song Gemini which I really love the huge droney ending of this song with the layers of guitars but the kind of mutated odd off-kilter chorus effects on the vocals are I don't know a little trying for a for a six-minute song for them to last that long and while it's not reinventing the wheel or anything like that we are getting some great songs here and some really fantastic fusions of rock and soul with a lot of personality I'm feeling a light a decent 8 on this LP transition if you've given this new Alabama Shakes LP a listen what did you think of it what went through your mind as it was going into your ears let me know you're the best Anthony Fantana Alabama Shakes sound in color forever 
Aa2NmA9LlsY,oh boy young thug Minh that's my favorite rat man yeah that's how he would have said it hi everyone yeah man tan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new young thug album barter six young thug Atlanta rapper who is one of the fastest-rising hottest most popular in newest faces in southern hip hop right now as far as buzz and and height goes and that buzz was partially built off of a couple singles that were doing really well for thug a couple of years ago songs like Danny Glover or some more but he was added even before that with his I came from nothing mixtapes he also has connections to the 101 7 Brick Squad which of course includes Gucci Mane Waka Flocka Flame Chief Keef among many others who are mostly southern rappers but if not southern rappers they kind of have a southern or a trap rap sound kind of forgettable delivery on a lot of the tracks on these early I came from nothing tapes a lot of little Wayne influence to me just kind of sounded like another Atlanta rapper in 2011 but he started to experiment with this particular delivery that you might hear every once in a while in his early stuff this mixture of rapping and this very nasal high-pitched yell P singing young thug had kind of stumbled upon something with this delivery and as he started to hone it more and define his style by it more I think he was moving into more I guess unique territory you knew when you heard young thug on a verse even though his little Wayne influence was still very much a parent Aaron there and I'm sorry to keep bringing little Wayne in this young thug review but but but he doesn't impact young thug's career in just a musical influence kind of way also in sort of a music business kind of way young thug has been signed by I'm guessing is also supported by and is managed by Birdman of Cash Money Records co-founder of cash any records who for a while was kind of a mentor to little Wayne however currently Birdman and Wayne are not on good terms from what I understand because Cash Money Records has essentially shelved a little Wayne's new album the Carter five and watching all this drama unfold has been like watching Monday Night Raw in the middle of all of it I just kind of see Birdman as just being a businessman at the end of the day he has essentially put on the back burner this artist who used to be more successful in favor of pushing out there another artist who currently translates to the generation of people little Wayne used to translate to in the 2000s with albums like the Carter in the Carter - in the Carter 3 and the incredibly prolific mixtape gauntlet he had released in that timeframe as well little Wayne's latest releases have not really been received all that well by critics by fans nor are they terrorizing the pop charts like his older material used to considering how money-oriented Birdman is are we really all that surprised that he would just kind of throw little Wayne's new album into the recycle bin and just kind of you know put all of his money into young thug's career instead again right now young thug commands that demographic commands the attention of the demographic the little Wayne used to in the 2000s whether it be through his Instagram where people are constantly freaking out over his clothing decisions he has also been kind of hush about his personal life and people have brought up all these questions of his sexuality and Birdman essentially capitalized on all of this hype musically by coming together with himself rich homie Quan another southern rapper and young thug bringing all of these people together under the rich gang umbrella and putting out a pretty popular mixtape last year as well as a tour songs like tell them and Givenchy and especially lifestyle have been incredibly huge hip hop songs so young thug and Birdman are doing a lot of numbers right now and with a new album around the corner they decided to sort of drive a final nail into the coffin as far as this young thug little drama is concerned and named young thug's upcoming project the Carter Six going off of little Wayne's Carter series and kind of breaking his balls about his project being shelved however over a potential suit from what I understand the idea of that has been totally just thrown out and instead we're getting this project over here named barter 6 I know I haven't talked about the music on this album yet but there's just so much drama and just BS building up to the release of this LP and the reason that it's worth noting is that a Birdman has orchestrated an incredible PR campaign with a combination of just drama as a result of this little Wayne beef and just kind of keeping people in the dark about young thug personally and what exactly this album is going to do how it's going to sound and what's also odd about it is that it seems like in the digital age a lot of artists both underground and mainstream are kind of totally forgoing that hype cycle thing and just releasing their albums to the public out of the blue just BAM you got it so there is kind of a question whether or not this album is actually going to live up to the hype live up to the hate that has fueled this whole hip hop media circus thus far and now that the album is here and I'm listening to it as far as the content musical content it's nothing really all that surprising given young thug's previous material but that does not mean it's terrible there's some people who hate young thug because he really doesn't really stand for anything except for just a load of hip-hop cliches haters bitches sex money that sort of thing and he explores these themes so generically I just feel like as an artist I know literally nothing about him because everything he says is just so cliched I mean on this album there is like a Michael Brown reference he talks about at one point the people who he knows personally who he does this for but really maybe it's not anything worth wondering about because I don't really think young thug tries to make purse or emotional music or anything like that at least when it comes to what he says there is certainly something melodic and ballad like about the tracks on this project a lot of the instrumentation here the the beats are trap music influence you get those rattling high hats you get that heavy sub base but the instrumentals are very sparse their skeletal a lot of the time they're vast there's a lot of reverb on these instrumentals and young thug kind of takes advantage of this added space by getting a little more ambitious with his singing which a lot of the time is raspy its emotive kind of passionate and he has a pretty good command of pitch which is more than I can say for some rappers that try to sing there are a lot of tracks on this project where I actually come away from the melodies that thugger sings thinking they're pretty catchy like the song dream or dome or the track check or the opening track constantly hating and again to the lyrics on this project while they're nothing to praise they're nothing to focus on they're not what young thug is trying to impress you with to just say this album sucks because the lyrics aren't good is kind of lacking to appreciate the fact that this album really isn't about lyrics so while I do feel that way I think that young thug style works well in a single capacity to sort of listen to this just incredible lack of substance for the length of an entire album gets kind of I don't know boring and it's not even just a lack of substance like it's it's not like inside I really want young thug to be addressing some super-important urgent social issues it's nothing like that it's that when young thug says things they're not even clever or funny or impressive in any way like one line saying a ps3 I'm not playing which just kind of feels like a cheaper version of something that little Wayne would have actually made to be funny ten years ago so while there's nothing special about young thug's lyrics on this record the selling point really is his delivery that runs kind of thin and what also doesn't help is that on that rich gang mixtape you had some huge just like radio smash choruses no song on this album is written quite as well as like the song lifestyle for example um this record in comparison with the rich gang mixtape is just very subdued it's chill it's laid-back the instrumentals and thugs delivery are very intoxicating to the point where nearly every person who appears on this project as a guest rapper or singer just sounds high out of their minds and there are times when that goes over really well like on the song can't tell which added nowhere features Ti as well as boozy badass and thug opens up the track really nicely there's a bit of a line on here where I think he's taking a shot at little Wayne saying that you know I might kill you dead and call it dedication making fun of little Wayne's dedication mixtape series but also um I don't know it's not a good line there are other tracks on this project I like though the song numbers has an irresistible catchy melody on it young thug speeds his flow up a lot on the closer here which was nice and there was also the song check which I thought was put together really well but even these songs again not written quite as succinctly and explosively as some of that rich gang material just really low-key now there are other tracks on here that I enjoy elements I think elements of these tracks are catchy but maybe young thug pushes things with his vocals a little too far and the song becomes obnoxious like with the track dome which has one of the better vocal melodies on the record on the chorus here but these vocal melodies often devolve into young thug just going yeah to his credit though this track is actually about something um getting head which is one of the few moments on this record where it actually seems like thug is focusing on a certain topic and delivers a handful of lines about one single thing it just seems like a lot of the time he just you know frog lilypad hops from just one rap cliche a to another till they all just kind of blend together into this whirlwind of unmemorable 'ti and even though there are some questionable lyrics from thug on this record easily worst verse on the album goes to a yak gotti for his appearance on a track over here we're in the middle of his verse I am pretty sure he just goes into a coma of some sort because he just disappears you Mauro there are some moments here where young thug does show off at least a level of self-awareness though where he is addressing haters going after him at a live event pictures of himself going viral because he's addressed in a certain way he's also kind of deflecting rumors that he's gay and even though he does bring this stuff up um he doesn't really put down his haters in a clever or an entertaining way I mean it's the it's the equivalent of somebody you know who's a troll on the internet typing to you you're gay man and then you just kind of you know come back with no I though still this album the sound of it does make for a nice relaxing kind of druggie atmosphere if you're just not paying attention to the lyrics at all I don't really think young thug style in general is awful like some of you may but what really disappoints me about this record is just its its lack of ideas we have the song with that where I don't really feel like I'm listening to a young thug song the song is really just a series of future isms and MeeGo isms that just kind of sound like a you know just just a b-side off of amigos tape like the song isn't good enough to make the cut of a mixtape with 30 songs on it the song amazing is essentially this album's attempt at being sexy while the song knocked off not really sure we needed another birdman appearance here especially with such an awful verse and then with the track OD one of the dreary ER songs here in terms of the instrumental and young thug's uh vocal melody I just feel a lot of emotional pain on this song as young thug talks about OD'ing as well as Michael Brown and some other dark things but it doesn't really come together into a coherent feeling that manifests itself in any kind of lyrical sense I guess I just feel some serious sadness on this song and I wish young thug just kind of painted a lyrical picture that also reflected that musical and that you know vocal sadness that is portrayed on this track I just wish this album had a larger lyrical component to it and I'm not looking for him to like go NAS or anything like that but it's just very apparent on this tape that on the lyrical front young thug does not give a  he doesn't give a he doesn't even care to write something catchy or charismatic or clever or funny I wouldn't even say his lyrics are even eyebrow-raising in any sort of way I mean some people might hate young thug but in my opinion on this project he's not really special or stand out enough to hate I just come away from this project feeling really indifferent the instrumentals and sometimes the hooks are pretty good and the vocal melodies too but as far as young thug goes um he just kind of feels like a placeholder which is kind of funny because at the end of the album we hear young thug saying over and over and over that I might be the realest that you've ever seen um what exactly about this album reflects reality because young thug's reality just feels so shallow and so generic in the greater rap landscape that I mean being real isn't really a challenge I mean when your reality is unique and it goes against people's worldviews I mean that's when it's hard to be real and young thug I think had an opportunity to bring that reality forward I mean there's certainly been a lot of drama just stirred up around him over the past few months in regards to the way he dresses little lane his place in hip-hop but he makes no attempt to address any of that whatsoever and just kind of sidesteps it or tries to take it head-on with a really bad lyric so I mean no there's there's nothing really that interesting about this record there are a handful of tracks that I think are catchy and maybe I would even return to namely the song with Ti or check or numbers but again young thug I think has kind of exposed himself on this album as just you know a one-trick pony if he's going to come out with another project in the future he's going to have to offer more ideas and angles than this and you know maybe even a bigger more explosive song that might be up to the level of some of the catchy or tracks on that rich gang mixtape I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever

jar okay that would be J so J Dilla that's J space so that's going to going right before the J a yes I do this alphabetical all right all right let's let's get into this Record Store Day stuff because why do you all I'm sure curious about that um there is one record I picked up a run the jewels 12-inch EP with few non-album tracks on it I don't have it with me though here is a picture of an Instagram picture that I did that that has it in there I don't have it with me right here it's in the other room the reason that I don't have it with me right here is because it's it's not going into my collection I'm actually going to do a giveaway with it during the next early access exclusive classics week thing but you know what is actually going into my collection the first thing is not an LP it's not a piece of vinyl though there is a piece of vinyl in here it's not it's not a record as much as it is a CD it's a CD reissue of km DS black bastards um I already own this album digitally why did I buy the CD well for one it comes with a bonus disc of extras and um this is just not any CD reissue oh my god look at this beautiful plastic sleeve covering the whole thing and and what is this is some kind of crazy CD booklet is it some kind of crazy case it's it's a pop-up book it's a book this is a book oh my god oh my god oh my god so you know we're opening this we're essentially getting the tracklist for the first CD here and here's the first CD you know you just sort of pop it out of there oh we know they got they got a little thing in here you slide your finger in and you pop the CD out that's cool that's nice that's convenient all right and then we got the the bonus disc over here you know we're getting remixes we're getting album versions or instrumentals on here and then comes the pop up oh my god it's a bit of pop but man it's the pop up guy from the beginning oh my god so yeah there you go and then uh you know from there says RI P sub rock dooms brother over here you know who's passing unfortunately ended KMD sadly but actually what I didn't know when I told a lot of y'all in my record store day pics video about this package you know seemed like it was a CD cover book is that it actually comes with a 7-inch picture disc of a single off of this album totally not strolling that's what the instrumental version on the other side so that is and it's crazy right there see right there you're getting so this is a wonderful package this is a wonderful way to celebrate this record in my opinion so that's why I picked it up I'm gonna put that in the collection that's where it's going alright let's get into the records the real records over here have not listened to this yet though I have heard a lot of these songs before because you know this music holds a very special place in my heart so I had to pick it up the records this dis band is a from Connecticut or at least you know has Connecticut roots and a lot of people from Connecticut in the indie scene you know sort of you know feels a sense of pride when thinking or just sort of talking about this band not just because you know it's a home state kind of thing but also a nostalgia kind of thing Polaris music from The Adventures of PN P fantastic television show I told you all I was looking out for this record and the record store that I went to red scroll in Wallingford anticipated a demand for this record and bought many many copies because went with it I was waiting in the line for a few hours and even when I got it to the front there were lots of copies of this left some people were telling me that you know that their store had run out of copies you know rets role new people are going to want this one this is the record that CT pride over here so there you go you know I can't wait to sort of you know revisit the old days listen to his sad day you know and and all those classics all those Pete and Pete classics going to get them on the turntable you know do my do my best Artie the strongest man in the world pose and you know just just a love life another thing that I was looking out for this is maybe my most this this is really what I wanted most on Record Store Day if I could not get this on record store day I would not have been happy swansea p reissue of swans debut EP two tracks on each side I have heard it digitally but I have not heard um you know I have not listened to it on this vinyl yet so you know I'm excited to get this on the turntable if you know actually I have not listened to I've listened to one of my Record Store Day releases so far reason being you know usually I sort of wait to listen to everything before I talk about it in a vinyl video but you know regular daters happen and I just want to get these records in them in a video but it's pretty simple package lyric sheet in here credits you know plastic sleeve for the record you know clear plastic sleeve black record nice heavy pressing you know it's nice to have another piece of swans vinyl in the collection I should probably actually go back and buy some vinyl for the seer that would be awesome got to make a minute for that alright I bought this next LP because apparently this is Mark cause like covering ac/dc songs morbidly curious about that I you know watch my Twitter um I will you know at the needle drop whoa I will react to this on Twitter and let you know how awesome or horrible it is yeah yeah okay well I mean you know there's there's really not much more to say about at that mark has elec Sun Kil moon Red House Painters you know sad very sad song Smith very deep verbally man voice covering ac/dc acoustically unassuming so you know we're just going to see how that goes we're just going to see how it goes this could not could not say no to that situation and this next record is an EP from one of my favorite underground groups of the 80s ESG a fun little disco funk post-punk group of three ladies from New York the Bronx I believe and this is the moody EP if you look up the ESG song UFO that is a pretty popularly sampled hip-hop song that song is on this record doom MF doom actually sampled that song on his Born This Way album Idol you know really fun funk song very experimental guitars for their time on this track not even entirely sure to this day how they were making that song sound the way it did but yeah if you look up the four tracks on this EP your no-good UFO moody and moody spaced out some fantastic tracks there you know if you love funk you love post-punk you love disco you know they opened up for a public image limited back in the day and you know when I was kind of going through this phase where I was kind of obsessed with female post-punk bands from the 70s and 80s you know ESG was one group that I was very smitten with so I had to get this record and you know I've put it on the turntable sounds amazing but one thing I did not anticipate about this record when I picked it up when I was reading um when I was reading about it is that oh my god oh my god this is gorgeous and it matches my shirt holy crap that is this is one of the prettiest splatter vinyls I've seen ever and it's it's so gorgeous I don't want to play it I just want to stare at it all day I would much rather just look at it then play it on the turntable because if I get to look at it then yeah I derive more pleasure from it almost another piece of interestingly colored vinyl that was passed my way which I believe had something to do with Record Store Day I read that there were just been 1,500 copies or so of this LP released I have a reissue of The Strokes Rahman fire which is the fantastic sophomore album from the New York pop rock band The Strokes yeah a lot of people don't really like as much as there is their debut album but I still think it's a really great record some of my favorite stroke songs are on this record and the special thing about this album is that it is half golden half black mofo Wow crazy crazy crazy amazing splatter record just mated in the collection amazing half-and-half I don't think I own a half-and-half record yet so this is my first half in half there's actually a half and half reissue of the money store that went out on Record Store Day that I didn't that I didn't know about and the store I went to didn't have a copy and it was half black half white and so shout out to anybody that got a copy of that have not put this on the table yet though I've heard this album you know hundreds and hundreds of times when I do get around actually listening to it I'm sure it'll sound great that black and gold though all right um this next one is an album I reviewed on the channel a while ago and actually uh yeah it made it onto my favorite album of one of my favorite albums of last year and I've actually had the vinyl for a little bit but I forgot to mention it in a vinyl review and my buddy Austin who loves this record as well has been harassing me to get it in here because I keep forgetting dean blunts black metal now if you look up this album online you will see that the cover art is just nothing but black it's just a black album and yeah you know that's essentially what you're getting here um you know so we have this black kind of pleather sleeve which when we pull it out we get black with a parental advisory sticker and you know you can't really see this here but there is actually in fact if you tilt it right into the light you can see that there is a sticker here that is just a clear sticker with black printed on this is deep blood black metal on it so you get this black record right okay so you know it's it's it's two LPs you know it's a double it's a it's a two LP album and it's not a gatefold or anything like that but you know if you open up the sleeve you'd see it's black in there and you pull out the records and they are in fact in black sleeves and tum from there you pull it out to reveal a black record with a black label that has nothing on it so Dean Blunt put together the blackest  right here with this record I don't think anyone's made a blacker album I don't think anybody's album is blacker than this album right now and you know I've listened to that I've listened to the records they sound fantastic pristine clean nice clear sound a lot of clarity on this record that I thought sounded amazing so you know if you're looking for something particularly black a singer-songwriter that is a kind of unorthodox weird a bit of an oddball it's it's kind of hard to describe the music that Dean Blunt makes I would just say it's abstract it's weird it's lo-fi it feels very homegrown and the closest thing I could relate it to is that he is of sorts a singer-songwriter keep in mind there is no black metal on this album so you know don't get disappointed by that but again Dean blunt black metal very interesting record album that is kind of rudimentary it's a little amateurish at points but there's just something about it which I try in my you know is to my to my best efforts to explain that appeal in my review but you know right here sort of the words are escaping me a little bit at least a little bit da da l oh my god dee dee dee maybe C D F G a G together okay sorry already listen to this one just got to get in in here ah okay call all right great we're good we're good we're good we're good we're good okay no DEA oh my god oh my I am I am messing up here I am messing up oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh my god oh my god sorry sorry sorry um Death Grips Bam Bam got the double LP had to get the double LP gave this thing a nine sorry you know if that pisses you off sorry man but you know it's I think it's a great album I think it's a great double album and oh my god what's up with this we we have the cover art for one don't wait for one of the albums in the double album here but where is the Marilyn Monroe picture for Jenni death Jenni death that the the search continues the search continues that's all you can say that the search for Jenni death continues where is she so you know wonderful gatefold here have not put it on the table yet though I have heard it tons of times already I want to get on the table this week but the package they put together is really nice you know we get some really cool kind of cryptic lyric sheets with weird photos which is really nothing new for a Death Grips album the jenni death side of the album has a much darker lyric sheet where you actually get a bit of you know some credits liner notes for the people who were involved on that side of the album because it's not just you know the Death Grips trio as we usually know them they bring on some collaborators which is you know it's really great that they give them a bit of shine because I know Death Grips sometimes they can be a little elusive and you know the vinyl itself very thick very heavy looks very nice cool labeling and you know they picked some really nice paper sleeves for this package as well so you know really no complaints the way the records fit into the double LP the gatefold is just a little tight it's a little tight you just got a Jimmy in a little you just gotta get it a Jimmy don't give it a Jenny give it a Jimmy okay it's in there and finally one of my favorite records of last year picked this up because I saw it in the store definitely felt like I needed this I think it made it in my need of it like I wasn't going to die without it but you know you know what I'm saying I think this made it into my top 15 if I'm not mistaken the new D'Angelo record D'Angelo's comeback album fantastic funk and R&B album just really great instrumentation great songs tangelos voice sounds amazing and his approach to producing these tracks incredibly instrumental just a really really envelope pushing for a for the genre and he put together a nice very black package for this thing you know we're also getting black sleeves black labeling but we do have white lettering on here the records themselves look great no complaints there and you know we're getting a wonderful little lyric sheet here which um is very uh seems very refined you know very very organized very well put together you know beards it's huge it's big but we're getting this beautiful small white lettering looks really elegant elegant is the word elegant is the word that I am looking for looks beautiful looks nice looks pretty oh we got a download code can't oh did you see it did you see it don't take my download I already have whatever and yeah that's that's the last record in this vinyl update yeah yeah yeah it is so um let me know what you guys picked up for Record Store Day and if you own any of these records and I hope you're all well I hope you're doing well I hope um some good news is coming your way soon you know a brighter day some personal goals being fulfilled maybe some money in your pocket some newly acquired knowledge or something like that um yeah that's what I hope I'm hoping that for you and I hope that we all get through everything that we're going through together I hope we all see each other on the other side of all of our you're the best Anthony Fantana vinyl update forever "
I8ZvRBl6zfA,hi everyone nothing happy at all kill me here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dance Gavin dance album instant gratification Sacramento rock band they've been at it for years and over the course of that time they have undergone numerous lineup changes but despite the revolving door of members the band has stuck pretty passionately to the post hardcore style bands that were essentially taking ideas and inspiration from the ferocity of hardcore punk music and fusing it with you know sort of current competing genres of music whether that be funk music dub music maybe some jazz alternative rock and some bands took things in a really emotional depressing direction setting the stage for emo like a rites of spring but a lot has happened to post hardcore music since the 80s and the 90s and the heydays of bands like Husker Du as well as shellac or maybe so Minutemen Fugazi and Drive Like Jehu and the genre continued to expand in the late 90s and the 2000s where we saw the game-changing refuse album the shape of punk to come yeah it it really was an album that featured very tight awesome grooves throw shredding screams incredibly heavy and visceral guitar riffs some groups took notice of this and push things into even more fast extreme complex territory of bands like blood brothers who were incredibly experimental for their time or even fall of Troy some bands went kind of progressive rock with the whole post hardcore thing like at the drive-in and and later the mars volta some bands started incorporating dance beats such as q and not you meanwhile emo is morphing into screamo with bands like NV and then other groups are kind of fusing hardcore punk or post hardcore with metal and you're getting metalcore like poison the well or from autumn to ashes meanwhile you have other bands that are taking this post hardcore sound and fusing it with some indie rock or pop rock or just pop punk or pop music in general some bands whose approach I enjoy going in this direction are like a brand new but other groups in my opinion maybe a little too sweet sugary the wimpy vocals and the pop melodies didn't really do too much for me bands such as Thursday or Circa Survive and dance Gavin dance is kind of one of those bands too there have always been other bands in similar veins that I just thought were more interesting so you know I just never really gravitated toward them and the reason I enjoy other groups in this same style of music continued to be shown on this new album from dance Gavin dance for one there are plenty of screamed vocals on this record which inherently is not a bad thing but I've always found dance Gavin dance --is approach to delivering scream vocals to just kind of sound more trendy than it is I don't know stand out or unique it just kind of sounds like this relic from the 2000s that um you know should have been given up by now and then there's the clean vocals that show up on this record because you know you're sort of getting these harsh vocals you're getting these harsh throat shredding screams and they're kind of matching these up with some cleaner melodic moments with cleanly sung vocals and these cleanly sung vocals are so nasal showy overacted and mixed in such a way that it's soaring over the music like a beautiful rainbow bird with a sparkle trail following its tail if I wanted your singing this over the top I listened to an Evanescence record these passages make 5 seconds of summer look like the next minor threat and now that we have these two moments in a dance Gavin dance song sort of established what happens is that they switch back and forth and back and forth and sometimes these two worlds kind of overlap a little like on the song something new where you're simultaneously getting these scream vocals some cleanly some vocals as well as some melodic guitars sort of thrown in together over the chaotic drumming and um yeah it's it's a pretty uh hmm and the lyrics on this up here not winning me over either and often the most readable lyrics on this album end up coming through during the cleanly some parts like on the song death of a strawberry hilarious title and in the midst of the song we're getting this being sugar daddy or on the opening track here let your hair down have one more round drink till you believe it sloppy kisses and dirty wishes baby this is living and the vocal melodies on this album that that are coming through all these clean vocals I can not stand them some of them like on the song the cuddler I can imagine kind of working well in a Katy Perry song and and and maybe they wouldn't sound too bad there but sort of contrasted with these really dated homely post-hardcore freak-outs there's absolutely nothing interesting about them you know the one thing I have to compliment this band on and compliment this record on is that it is impeccably tight and in a way the two things that they are constantly switching back and forth from standalone they sort of execute them well any single element of a dance Gavin dance song maybe aside from the lyrics if you pull it out it doesn't sound bad on its own but when it's all put together then how gaudy this music is becomes pretty clear in my opinion there's not a single redeeming factor in dance Gavin dance --is approach to songwriting there are redeeming factors in the clarity of the production on this album in the way that they perform this music again impeccably tight this album is just one diabetic Lee sweet melodic rock passage after another car crashed into these really obnoxious frenzied noisy rock freak outs in just a really obvious attempt at just clashing together these sweet spots with these aggressive spots in hope of coming together with some kind of artistic contrast of styles however dance Gavin dance has been doing this for so long at this point it's it's not anything that I think they're they're thinking that hard about it's just what they do except for the one part where we hear the song Eagle versus crows we're out of nowhere we get a Linkin Park quality rap verse I'll crush your mound up on your birthday cake with your whole family there watching at your aunt Viv's wake I liked the self-destructive girls where the be all missing I find it interesting that they kind of characterize the women that they're into is self-destructive potentially the fans of this band because I find the listening experience of this record to be kind of masochistic I mean when I'm listening through this thing I really feel like I'm inflicting pain upon myself you know there are some albums there are some sounds there are some styles of music that when I listen to them I can kind of appreciate the artistry I appreciate the effort or the technical ability that goes into it but it's not really for me I think a lot of this sort of a very ultra clean very up perfectly produced prog metal out there is like that for me even dance Gavin dance over here hearing a song or two from you know a lot of their previous records over the years and you know I went into this LP just kind of curious just wanting to try it didn't have any big plans for a review or anything like that but I just kind of you know sat through it and sat through it and sat through it I continued listening even though I didn't really care for what I was hearing and the less that it clicked with me the more I realize that I don't even really think this is just a matter of me not liking the style of music that dance Gavin dance plays I think this album is in horribly bad taste the whole record functions on these incredibly uninteresting songs that feature these cliched crummy overuse contrasts between these harder more aggressive and softer and more melodic moments the vocals a lot of the time are desperate to be dramatic the lyrics when I'm reading into them are kind of cringe-worthy I feel like we're just packing a lot of filler in layers and musical complexities into a series of just would be pop emo songs that are just constantly interrupted by these heavy guitar riffs and throat shredding screams listening to this record I did not enjoy a single second of it nor do I see myself coming back to it for any reason other than to maybe have it giggle at that rap verse you know I'm feeling a strong one to alight to on this same transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it - jate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fanta no music forever 
md484TdkZ5c,hi everyone you thony mantan oh here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new square pusher album damn again Fury's square pusher is the musical pseudonym of versatile talented electronic music super producer tom Jenkinson the square pusher name has taken on numerous sounds and modifications since its inception but it's the fusions of drum and bass and jazz music in the 90s that came out under this name that has stuck with me the most over the years and into the mid and late 2000s Jenkinson continued to experiment with his sound with sort of mixed results the LP hello everything one of my favorite albums in this leg of the square pusher discography the album just a souvenir or Tom Jenkinson's solo bass LP or the Shuba leader one side project where he brought on other band members to collaborate with a bit of a rock album and the abalone record he came out with a few years ago the series of albums you know took on elements of rock music funk music xxx and even modern dubstep this is a very unpredictable time for the square pusher discography and as a fan I was pretty interested in seeing where he would move next with this new album over here and I don't know the answer still is like no definitive direction really it's kind of a mixed bag and it was clear that that was going to be the case from the very first track on this record which is kind of funny because it features a very familiar kind of groove to it if you've listened to square pushers older stuff you know all the break beats on this track but above these rhythms there's this buzzing bassline and this very glossy huge shimmering sinfully that sounds like it could have come out of either MGMT's debut LP or maybe even some of these producers that are kind of copying that 2000's very sugary bright indie pop sound people like made Ian or Porter Robinson it's very futuristic very electronic very rigid but also kind of sugary and sweet and poppy as well I don't care for the lead melodies or the tone of the sense on this track that much but it seems like Jenkinson wanted to make a sweeter track without really dumbing it down or anything like that in that regard mission accomplished because there are some pretty awesome rhythmic complexities on this track and then right after this kind of sunny opener Jenkinson unapologetically does a 180 into dark heavy experimental and glitchy territory with the next two tracks especially with the song rake fire - which is one of my favorite tracks on this LP features this disorienting stuttering synth lead with these tones of Moaning huge cavernous metallic feedback hanging in the background it's just simultaneously dizzying and and haunting and creepy there's so many detailed just unpredictable and skilled beat change ups throughout this song one moment where the beat even kind of feels like it could have backed like a cyberpunk tune doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo so we went from grossly sweet to difficult to decipher overwhelming and tangled in a matter of moments Jenkinson has made it pretty clear that he couldn't give a damn about Sonic or stylistic consistency in this leg of his catalogue and while it has led to some kind of unfulfilled projects in a way it's better than kind of just seeing him stagnating and doing the same thing over and over and over and on the song content as we see Tom flirting with dubstep style drops once again however not in such an obvious way the heaviness is there the groove is there a lot of the songs on this album are booming just filled with this massive bass tone but he kind of subverts this style with these jittery synth leads and various disorienting glitches if there's anything that pulls all these songs together it's this chaos that a lot of the songs often find themselves in it is chaos but it's also kind of complexity there are patterns coherent rhythmic and melodic patterns that ring through in these songs it's just that they're often obscured with lots of very subtle and minor variations as well as just things being thrown on top of them things being thrown under them so yeah if I could boil this album down to anything it's that we get a series of kind of playful distortions and experiments on these popular electronic music styles as well as just Tom Jenkinson's own ideas because occasionally there are some synth leads here or some drum beats that that sound like they could have been lifted out of a 90 square pusher record that's actually exactly how I feel about the synth melody from the song X jag knives which I don't know I I guess I was hoping for something maybe a little bit more novel and refreshing and envelope-pushing on this album not just kind of a you know a bit of a revisit to the old days which we get again on the back end of this LP with this tr 303 ish squelchy acid house inspired bass line however with the trackball Tang Arg we get this interesting groove that kind of sounds like I don't know it might have fit like a Diplo track or something if he was going in a kind of a moombahton direction this hi-hat kind of emphasizing the upswing of the beat and this track is huge just the bass on this song is there's a lot of oomph on this song but it doesn't punch in this obvious EDM way or anything like that I mean the song moves through a series of just dizzying musical progressions it's just difficult to describe how complex this song is and it's it's just so overwhelming at times it's like synthetic fireworks or even like a a war zone with explosions happening overhead and a bullet dodging there is a really rough texture drone that ends the song off it kind of sounds like it might just be some kind of rhythm being played at a thousand beats per minute nearly every track on this LP in a way is very noisy it's very dense it's purposefully cluttered and and sometimes through those things the track may turn out climactic such as this song and and other times a track may just kind of sound like tom is just throwing every sound that you can find at the wall just kind of see what sticks kind of like the very uninspired and weirdly mixed closing track on this LP which kind of feels like I'm not really listening to the full version of the song kind of like I'm listening to a muddy version of this track like there's a wall or something separating me from a full clear crystal clear version of what this song could potentially be and another thing about this LP is that it's I don't know disappointingly short it may be 40 minutes in length but we're only getting about eight tracks here and the final one is a you know kind of a snoozer and while square pushers talents a ring through on this album once again you know there's no denying that Thom Jenkinson is an incredibly detail-oriented and perceptive musician and producer I kind of feel like we get another square pusher record here that is kind of I don't know self-serving or sort of reclusive like it wasn't really meant for mass consumption or anything like that sort of more like Tom Jenkinson merely exercising to avoid atrophy versus you know pushing himself into a new sound a new phase and then coming through with a generic work record in that sound but in a way I guess at this point he's proven that he can do that he's done it time and time and time again he just kind of seems content to wander around and just kind of you know fiddle and just see what turns up and and share those results with us at this point I'm feeling of decent six on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it - Jade it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantana music forever 
K9x6-CzjbsA,[Music] hi everyone bland theny taste a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mountain Goats LP beat the champ the mountain goats are a california-based musical trio fronted by a singer-songwriter storyteller John Darnielle one of the most lyrically and conceptually creative minds in songwriting today in my humble opinion from his early low fire releases that he captured on barely functional tape recorders to his more recent studio work Jon's songs are filled with sad funny triumphant and harrowing tales or expressions he has written songs about his abusive stepfather historical and religious figures a death metal band trying to get started however I haven't always been head over heels for the mountain goats incredibly prolific output especially when it comes to the sound of the more recent studio recordings that the band has been dropping which a lot of the time in terms of the the sound of the instrumentation I think things are maybe sounding a little sterile sometimes toothless but even on the mountain goats weaker and more recent material some great stories have poured through whether it be on the album get lonely or the very personal and religious themes on life of the world to come and then there is this new album over here beat the champ this is one of the mountain goats most boldly conceptual albums yet an album that very creatively clearly and fluently addresses its subject matter with an unwavering grip a sleeper hold of passion and attention to detail if you couldn't already tell from the cover here this albums about pro wrestling that is the bass line all of these songs kind of work on but as far as the music of this album even though I appreciate the mountain goats efforts over the years to kind of make their instrumentals maybe a little bit more lush dense arranged and intricate I don't really think there's anything on this album sonically that will be all that refreshing for a long time Mountain Goats fan on these songs you're getting a lot of the same open basic guitar chords that you have most likely heard on dozens or maybe even hundreds of mountain goat songs prior but you know John definitely plays them like he's playing him for the first time and you know he's just given him a ton of passion and guts but there are a few moments on this LP that musically are a bit of a detour for the mountain goats or just something different entirely like the last moments of he'll turn part two which are essentially the serial wandering piano Odyssey and the song fire editorial this song is essentially a jazz instrumental through and through with John Darnielle just singing on top of it this is the last album I would expect a jazz instrumental to show up on and it doesn't really do that much for me since John is just kind of doing his usual thing on top of it it just kind of feels like maybe a bit of window dressing however I do love the lush arranged instrumentation added to the opener here especially the the kind of jazzy and very nimble woodwinds on this track of course pianos and strings and horns and woodwinds are nothing new to the Mountain Goats repertoire as far as their studio material but I do think the instrumental on this by the way it was put together was particularly impressive but the horns on the song foreign object along with the distorted bass guitar on this track are so heavy are so overpowering almost kind of like they're compressed to the point where they're just smothering the whole song that's that's definitely one moment in Tintin to where the extra instrumentation competes with John's vocals and takes away from the song more than it adds so with an overall lack of novel musical directions for this album to go in I often kind of find myself gravitating to the lyrics of this album it's the stories and the character portraits that draw me into these songs and and John does not skimp on this side of the album I actually think John delivers in spades on the lyrical side of this record I think this is one of the better albums the mountain goats have released in years as far as lyrics go we have the opener southwestern territory which kind of seems like this beautiful poetic depiction of this pro-wrestler having a solitary moment before he goes out to perform in front of the crowd talking about personal stuff like trying to write in this diary for his kid and also performance stuff like knocking this guy's nose into the back of his head and the cheap seats going wild then we have the track the legend of Chavo Guerrero a song that I really think the mountain goats just phoned it in on this instrumental there's just nothing special about this instrumental to me but the story it's like John as a kid sort of idolizing this local wrestler who eventually had a kid who sort of made onto a more national stage but as a child Jon just looked up to this guy and thought he was this fearsome fighter and he hated his enemies the easy in a really poetic and perceptive way John breaks down the way that a young mind can kind of look up to a wrestler as a very heroic person and then on the song he'll turn - we kind of have a wrestling figure disappointing his fans and not living up to that pedestal that his fans put him on because he either failed as a person or sort of you know turned evil and the very loud and intense werewolf gimmick is one of my favorite tracks here features just a huge instrumental amazing vocal performance from John John I know his vocal is very nasally it's not for everybody but the impassioned performances that he gives he's not just a songwriter he's not just a singer he is very much an actor especially at this point of the album where he is kind of playing this wrestler who is not only just a complete badass when it comes to performing out in front of the crowd but he doesn't play well with others behind the scenes either showing up late or just not showing up at all for rehearsals giving other people a hard time telling people would get out of his way oddly enough the loudest song on the record is matched up with the two quietest songs on the record both of which musically are okay I think the mountain goats might have been sort of assuming that the quiet instrumentation John's very hushed vocals would pull me and maybe other listeners in more than they actually did in my experience the song has really just kind of hang in the background for me don't feel that riveting in terms of performance but when I kind of listen and close to the lyrics these songs actually move the album into pretty interesting territory and give the album a really awesome thumb attic flow toward the beginning of the album we're getting fights we're getting action we're getting by Slams even though I think the lyrics of the song are very basic and the one of the least interesting lyrically on the album you know you get tracks like for an object where you're you know getting John singing about stabbing someone in the eye with a foreign object it's it's funny or even the song choked out you know you're getting is really hard-hitting in-your-face fast and to the point songs tracks that essentially you know ask you or ask the protagonist to act very quickly make a snap decision or get a snap neck and even though this makes the album kind of exciting it can be a little bit of a rocky road kind of like watching your favorite wrestler get beaten to a pulp by two guys with folding chairs as the referee is passed out in the corner of the ring but again things do come together interestingly during the final third of this record we're not getting these fighting songs or these intense moments anymore we get John on songs like Luna sort of singing about the end of someone's wrestling career it's like the night it's the twilight years of this person's of time in wrestling and then with the song unmasked it's not like this dramatic i've unmasked you moment it's kind of like unmasked in the sense that i'm out of that life now and all i have left are these memories and these old friends who are dying john starts talking about wrestlers who are aging and finding a life beyond wrestling like on the track the legend of bull Ramos and on this song it doesn't really seem like it's wrestling related at first to the point where our protagonist is injured and then he is recognized as a former wrestler by his surgeon the closing track on this LP though brings things back around to a strong wrestling theme with the title hair match which is a style of wrestling match where you know you essentially lose your hair maybe even lose your mask at the end of the match you know by you know sort of buzz cutting the person who lost and then the lyrics on this track are fantastic and one of the best lyrical finishes of any Mountain Goats album thus far in my opinion just the the detail that John goes into with this song of a being held down and you know getting some really cheap Clippers down at the thrifty store and this is not so much a literal wrestling song as much as it just kind of feels like at this point a metaphor for life for John and for the mountain goats in general like this track is kind of about just having something taken away from you or losing control and you know other people kind of taking away your autonomy and tearing away this thing that could be very important to you life kind of getting you down which i think is actually an amazing way to end this album because it just seems so I guess focused in on its subject matter for the duration of the record it's nice to kind of have this moment where you know we kind of get the camera lens pulling out showing the bigger picture and just kind of illustrating why this is a significant album concept John Darnielle proves once again he is a unique talent in songwriting because he can take a very unlikely topic and turn it into a pretty compelling album and even though the instrumentals on this album didn't blow me away at first and I guess they're not really blowing me away now for the most part I do like them a little bit more than I was when I was originally trying the album out you know it's just really the power of the storytelling on this album that that just really fuels these songs that's pretty much the case for most Mountain Goats albums anyway I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this album transition have you given this album a listen if so did you love it or did you hate it and why and what San Anthony review next my name is cover killer nation I do heavy metal reviews here on YouTube and I love me some men vocals they're the only ones I listen to anthony Fantana men vocals for ever 
YxqQ9e8MYgE,it burns it burns oh hi everyone her fanny rate tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new drench album undertow drench is a UK rock duo this is their second full-length LP I caught wind of them earlier this year off of a few hot singles namely the song we can do what we want easily one of the better rock tunes of the year it's wild it's fun it's sweaty it's wordy it's got a punk vibe to a bit of a rockabilly vibe coming from the lead guitar that intros the song songs wall vocals on the tracker a little obscured by some low mixing and some reverb but they still sound pretty good the guitars and drums come together on this track and create a very visceral performance and there is just a million-dollar hook on this track as well we can do there is a very dark tense bridge on this track too with an awesome build-up to a final climax for the song it's very well put together track but unfortunately this is one of those albums where the deeper cuts just don't measure up to the lead single I found a lot of the tracks on this album to be just far less fulfilling we can do what we want is to me such a direct bold memorable in-your-face song so it's kind of weird to hear the rest of this album suffer from like a musical identity crisis the other cuts on this LP just kind of feel like these basic rehashes of various underground rock styles with kind of nondescript songs fueling them like the song the snake which is just 100% pure Nirvana worship from beginning to end or the song side by side which oddly enough feels like I'm listening to Michael Stipe sing with some echo drenched vocals on top of a kind of watered-down Jesus and Mary Chain instrumental with a very foreign mystical sinister lead melody and the title track here it's a bit of instrumental filler maybe kind of heavy and it may have some nice tremolo guitars laced in to the instrumental but there's not really much to it in terms of excitement or I guess I guess structure it just feels kind of um I don't know it's a little uneventful and just like it's kind of killing time there are two other tracks in the track listing here that caught my ear though for a good reason the song the woods and standing in the cold both of which are kind of slow dreary deep-voiced post-punk with kind of a gothic flair to them very heavy on the eyeliner with these tracks and these songs are actually one of the better directions that the album goes in not just because I think that drenched ooh the style well but also the tunes underneath these songs are actually two of the better written songs on the album especially the woods which actually feature some incredibly dark imagery in the lyrics of being nailed to a tree to a degree there are two somewhat newer underground bands that already kind of remind me of what dredge is doing maybe a bit of grave babies or crystal stilts groups that pull from a lot of the same stylistic influences garage rock post-punk shoegaze some goth rock similarly they are amalgams of all these different underground styles but in the case of Krystal stilts or grave babies they actually come through with a definitive sound that is instantly recognizable I know when I'm listening to those groups or when I have stumbled across a song from one of those groups I can't say the same for drench rather than forging a distinct sound that they can kind of carry out from the beginning to the end of an LP listening to this album is kind of like watching dreads just sit very uncomfortably in a chair they're just constantly switching position just very fidgety kind of unfocused and focus is something that for me is hard to come by on this album especially as drange on a lot of these tracks exposed themselves as being reverb addicted like many young underground bands out there right now who are essentially using the effect to either I don't know mask a lack of ideas or just make a song feel or sound bigger when what's really opening is these song is getting washed out and the bite of your performance is just being pulled away I wouldn't say there's anything particularly god-awful about this album there are certainly at least a handful of highlights here but much of this album there's not really anything all that memorable about it in my opinion there's nothing about this record that really goes above and beyond in terms of songwriting vocal delivery the playing and the performances the technical ability as well as just the the energy and the intensity they're just too many mild tracks on this record for it to be stand out for me drench has certainly proven with this album that they can make a bigger sound bigger and more I guess intricate and layered than their last album and they certainly have shown that they have the basics of a rock album down but can they move beyond that I'm feeling a strong 5 to light 6 on this album transition if you giving this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what did you think I should rub you nuts and that's it Anthony Fantino drench undertow forever 
MGJyb8YuUvY,I know God the need am tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Death Cab for Cutie album Sookie famed Washington indie rock act came up in the mid-2000s off of the wave of popularity that indie rock was seeing at the time Death Cab for Cutie aiding the Death Cab for Cutie buzz was also frontman Ben Gibbard who was actually seen quite a bit of commercial and critical success with the indie tronic synth pop side project he was working in at the time they just released their debut LP the postal service great album highly recommended and it also helped the Death Cab had recently released their most critically acclaimed album yet Transatlanticism and easygoing clean and profoundly sad rock album at this point the band had creatively peaked after spending years mellowing out their punk influences which are much more obvious on their debut LP and over here and with LPS such as the photo album moving into slower subtler territory with a sharper focus on lyrics with very melancholy introspective themes as far as the records that followed plans it was very clear that Ben Gibbard was in a different place emotionally these records in my opinion are not really as emotionally potent but give herbs talents as a songwriter remained especially on the album codes and keys a record that I would say is commendably catchy now as far as this new LP goes I wasn't really going into it looking for Death Cab to come through with a visceral or an explosive album or anything like that I over the years have kind of come to expect Death Cab to appeal to a different set of emotions than most rock bands do but maybe even for Death Cab this new album of theirs over here is just a little too mild for example the opening track on here no room in frame which has maybe just a faintly danceable driving kick drum and some very clean guitars a bit of a glassy synth lead and I don't know it just kind of feels a little bland and on the opposite side of that spectrum is the song Black Sun SADS stand out in the tracklist here and it's not the kind of sadness that is in your face or overt or anything like that it's a bit of a slow burner no the sadness of this track kind of itches at the back of my head until I realized just how depressing the song is by the end of it especially with imagery in the refrain here of a black Sun revolving around the protagonist in the lyrics I tend to favor the more strip back in simple songs in the tracklist here like the song you've haunted me all my life which has a bit of an acoustic intro very desolate sounding a song and there are some pristine guitars in the second half some great melodic phrasing here with some drums that kind of pop in and add a groove to the song and the song hold no guns is an acoustic ballad that is very charming even though it kind of has some incredibly chilling lyrics and on the refrain of this song we have Ben Gibbard singing um I love why do you run for in my hand I hold no guns there is a lonesome piano ballad that ends the album off that feels like a pretty special moment and it songs like these that to me say the Death Cab when they want to be and they're focused on this they are still masters of this clean sad contemplative rock music but the more upbeat tracks in the tracklisting here tend to be just a little middle-of-the-road for me not only are the unbearably middle-of-the-road but they don't really leave me with that much to report on I think there are a few tracks here that could have slipped in very snugly into the codes and keys tracklist without really ruining the flow of the album songs like little wanderer or dosa Beverly Drive there are a few tracks on the back end of this album that stand out but not necessarily for the best reasons the song good help is hard to find features a bit of a danceable beat but the very prominent peppy drums don't really fit the slow-motion guitars and neither do they compliment Ben Gibbard is kind of even-tempered vocal delivery I think they take away from Ben a little bit as well as the emotion of the track which feels so faint already a lot of the time this album I kind of feel like I have this old crappy radio and I am just very frustrating ly trying to tune into the emotions of this album and I can't tell if it's because my receiver is bad or if the signal itself is kind of getting weak that is pretty much how I filled out this record I'm pretty indifferent toward it honestly there are some highlights here but it's not like they're so great that they're gonna have me driving back to this album anytime soon these songs on this album that I do like I wouldn't say I like them because they're you know particularly special or anything like that I think what Death Cab does on the highlights from this album is that they merely prove that they can still go through the motions of making a decent Death Cab song as far as the other cuts on here they're either incredibly forgettable or they just have a few subtle qualities that just kind of knock the sound quality off slightly to the point where I don't know if just something doesn't quite feel right whether it be the huge booming drums on Eldorado or the out of nowhere dance be on good help I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this album transition if you've given this death cat album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan out does Cab for Cutie forever 
e2rexvDHPZs,tell them what happened yet me tell me what happened Steve Kerr no hi everyone I'm Phineas at a know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tyler the Creator album Cherry Bomb Odd Future member lead member of our future sort of seen as the the West Coast hip hop collective rapper producer songwriter he announced this album just last week and when he did so he gave us a taste of two different tracks one the song death camp which kicks this album off one of the more aggressive tracks on the entire album with this hard rockin distorted guitar riff the song kind of reminded me of some Pharrell style production off of an any Rd album specifically the song lap dance and it wasn't a bad track it featured a lot of beat change ups and some of Tyler's lines on this song weren't too bad either and then we had the song fuckin young where Tyler is essentially going in a bit of a neo-soul direction it's definitely one of the most lush and classy instrumentals Tyler the Creator has been on so far he entirely produced this album including this song and I think this song and a few others on here sort of exposed Tyler's talents as an arranger however the sort of statutory rape theme and topic of this song as well as the trashy lyrics just weren't that appealing to me Tyler seems to be afraid of getting cuffed over this love interest who is too young for him but yet all over this album we get constant reminders that he is rebellious and he doesn't like the rules Tyler's rebellion is kind of like a safe rebellion a bit of a storm and a teacup sort of thing he is rebellious to the point where he will use homophobic slurs in his songs and will get angry about not being able to wear his hat in some place which was a line off that death camp track that dropped before the release of this album and now that I'm getting the full scope of the lyrics what is going on here is Tyler is kind of pushing the cameras away and saying I'm not liking these lights and all this attention as if all of this over coverage and media saturation and controversy isn't what got Tyler and Odd Future to the point where they are now anyway as far as the other songs on cherry bomb go they kind of switch back and forth sonically between this more smooth neo-soul style and some of this kind of goofy noisy hard-hitting hardcore hip-hop we have Ok Go California find your wings as well as the track two seater all of which have more of a soul style to them and these are actually some of the better tracks on the album they have really clear production lots of sweet melodic in harmonious layers it kind of reminds me of another Odd Future group the internet and even though there seems to be a lack of mastery for the genres of jazz and soul in these tracks just like with the Internet I feel like Tyler turns it into something a little left-field and kind of warped whereas the internet albums the albums that they've come out with so far are just really all weakly played written and produced and I've seen videos of Tyler playing piano and he seems to have a lot of talent on the piano and if there's one record in his discography so far where that talent shines I think it's here whether it be on some of the piano parts on this record or whether it be through some of the great chord progressions now the harder louder cuts on this album are the ones that really stand out though but they don't really stand out for any good reason for example the title track on this LP which is maybe the most boring show of aggression I've heard on a record this year for one the song has this booming break beat to it which sounds like it was lifted out of a prodigy song and every bit of instrumentation in this song is compressed distorted over modulated to the point where the beat is really the only readable thing about this track Tyler mixes his vocals very low and essentially stashes himself away behind this crappy wall of digital distortion which most likely is entirely intentional if Tyler wants to throw a temper tantrum behind this unlistenable wall of crud that only his super fans have want to sit through in order to listen to the deeper meaning that they're most likely making up that's fine not interested mission accomplished and there's some other cuts here while I may like some of the instrumentals they suffer from at least a similar degree of distortion over modulation unintelligibility like I can't even make out what the lyrics are saying or they're kind of chipmunk tanned kind of pitched up in a really obnoxious way like on keep the O's or run and the song Buffalo I actually like the beat on this track a lot some massive bass on this song and a sample that you might remember from one of Pusha T's more recent singles on numbers on the boards it's a vocal sample from Tina Sigler shake your booty yeah alright yeah which actually reminds me of the way that the children's voices were kind of sampled on a track from the new Earl album but yeah despite a few likable qualities a lot of these harder cuts are completely unlistenable the album is actually just much easier on the ears in terms of clarity and and likeability on the last third there you're getting the song the brown stains with schoolboy q and oddly enough on the intro to this beat Tyler is delivering this flow that reminds me of Pharrell's rapping or the refrain that he's delivering on the clip song H and there are moments where this beat actually reminds me of the beat that Tyler I believe created and landed on on schoolboy Q's new album and even though this track seems distorted like many of the others on this album Tyler is much more readable on this track as he delivers a series of lyrics that kind of seem like an anti endorsement of rap stereotypes whether that be a diamonds on the neck the drugs the lien and the song Smuckers uh surprisingly enough features both Kanye and little Wayne on the same track there is a sweet beat changeup on this track the little Wayne side of this song is much more sweet and soulful as far as the instrumental character Kanye does his typical rapping slash singing thing where he is kind of simultaneously struggling with an ego complex but also a victim complex which just never comes together well for me and we have little Wayne bringing his usual chunky style braggadocio Tyler on the tract I actually find to be pretty entertaining and is a hilariously dark and offensive sometimes saying that he's like an AIDS patient nobody's fucking with him I actually think this record would have been a little bit more entertaining if I could hear Tyler a little bit more I think some people have been kind of comparing some of the more aggressive and distorted moments on this record to Death Grips and and their new album and sort of the guitar distortion that landed on the Jenni death side of the powers-that-be and maybe that did influence Tyler on this album I don't know but if he did he went about manifesting that influence in like an incredibly unentertaining way there's a difference between having pieces of distorted instrumentation in your mix and then just distorting the entire track to the point of unlistenable 'ti and that's what I think happens on this album all too often overall with this LP I didn't care for it but I'm sure in a sense this was an exciting album to put out for Tyler I kind of see this as maybe the third part to a trilogy starting with goblin and wolf was kind of the mature building point which was incredibly story-like and conceptual throughout much of the album and I think Cherry Bomb is kind of Tyler taking the sand castle that he's built over the course of his past two albums and then just angrily smashing it into just a pile which is a very Tyler the Creator thing to do there are moments on this LP that make for some of the most refined instrumentals that Tyler has ever been on and then conversely just because of the bad mixing and the bad production there are some instrumentals here that are some of the worst that I've ever been on a Tyler the Creator album so while I don't really care for this LP I do have to give it to Tyler for being one of the few artists out there bold enough to simultaneously disappoint and impress so consistently I'm feeling a strong three too late for on this album transition you gonna know all of them move a little blah blah oh no what ha ha ha oh mama no no no 
N5Q1qj8qNpc,hi everyone need any nap tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new twin shadow album eclipse twin shadow is the musical project of singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist George Lewis Jr who a handful of years ago had wooed me with his dashing good looks as well as alternative approach to synth an indie pop with the album forget which had some fantastic tracks on it such as castles in the snow or the song when we're dancing the album had kind of a low budget sound to it but still managed to come together with some really sensual captivating songs however things turn kinda sour on the next album confess where it seemed that the budget was up and the sound clarity on this album was improved tenfold but rather than kind of sticking with the sound and the style that George had established thus far what he delivered on this album was kind of an uninspired rehash of old-school synthesizer pop from the 80s and sadly with this new album over here I think George is moving into even less appealing territory this album is his major-label debut and it isn't really synth pop in the same way that confess was synth pop a style of music that is currently seeing a bit of a comeback now and at least has an established fanbase following artists that are making more modern takes on synthesizer pop eclipse is moving into much riskier territory if that wasn't already forecasted by the incredibly overblown lead single from this album to the table a song that feels like a bit of a adult-oriented arena rock circa 1984 complete with epic drum fills whoa whoa x' and some very grand piano chords my first reaction to this track was a basically just a look of shock and while I have warmed up to a little bit since its release I haven't really been able to move beyond ironic enjoyment of this song whenever I hear this track I just think of like huge frothy ocean waves splashing up against a rocky shore as Baywatch babes just like run by in slow motion with like some epic pyrotechnics going on in the background however the song ends up being really the only track on the entire LP here that goes in more of a in arena rock direction the only other song that really kind of sort of flirts with that vibe is the song I'm ready which is almost as over rocked but moving outside of these two songs this album generally is just a series of okay songs applied to a series of incredibly corny and and unlikable styles of rock and pop music very dated and these songs are mixed and sort of produced with these incredibly boomy choruses really compressed and occasionally kind of pompous instrumentation the entire LP kicks off with these song Flatliners which isn't too bad of an open for this album George comes on in the very subdued verses on this track with a bit of a flow to his voice that reminds me of like an old-school like 90s R&B song and then what's the song explodes on the choruses it's a pretty passionate chorus for all of this albums cornball instrumentation George can be a pretty compelling and captivating singer when he's really you know trying to give an emotional performance conversely we have songs on this album like half life where George is singing is actually kind of quiet in comparison to the instrumentation and very drained as well this album after the first track even though it is a good start it goes south very fast with the song when the lights turn out which on this track I feel like George is trying to cobble together some kind of Katy Perry Carly Rae Jepsen level radio pop smash but without the ultra slick production in the background kind of back it up the chorus on this track is just compressed and impressing the press to the point where the instrumentation kind of smudges together and in a somewhat unappealing way we get this jealousy next to see sort of a mish mash of emotions on this track - it just kind of feels like George is grabbing it emotional lyric idea straws in any direction that he can not just on this track but other tracks too as George is saying things like you know hold on to me or making mention of heartstrings it's no surprise that the lyrical approach on this album is as uninventive and as stagnant as the musical approach the song alone is a kind of hammy duet with Miss Lilly Elise and the song old love new love is maybe the most unflattering track on this entire album it's like a bit of house pop like some really trashy eurodance type stuff complete with the really punchy piano stabs done a lot like with the song to the top I feel like with this track George is trying to bring back what was essentially a cultural headache I'd rather listen to no Mercy's where do you go which I can at least enjoy from a nostalgic standpoint this just feels like a really bad portrayal of nostalgia which honestly is just a feeling I can't get away from when listening to much of this album either the lyrics or the instrumentation is just just unbearably cheesy or we have some tunes on here where the vocal performance is just okay or the courses are compressed to the point where does the music isn't really that enjoyable or we have some songs on the back end here that might be decent but maybe they kind of cut off abruptly and they're just not that fulfilling there's just a lot of things in my opinion at least for me for me I mean this is my view on this album but there are a lot of things about this LP that that are working against it's enjoyability I'm feeling a strong two to a light three on this thing transition if you give him this on will listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Twin Shadow it clips forever 
h8gXje4iizw,hi everyone turn the fan table here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick list talking about basically all the records the releases that I am looking forward to not necessarily buying but maybe that I'll be looking out for this coming Record Store Day if you don't know what Record Store Day is it is this annual celebration of all things vinyl and record stores where a lot of different labels and artists will release exclusive limited runs of 7 inches P's albums whether it be like an older record and they'll do like a crazy double LP colored vinyl reissue or something like that or maybe just like a piece of vinyl that will only run for just a limited time only of maybe some single that they'll only put at one time who knows I'm not really here to discuss the economics or the politics a record store date we're buying music in general as opposed to buy or streaming it because we do a lot of that now I'm just gonna list the Record Store Day releases that sort of caught my eye and sort of relay them to you and then maybe you'll look out for them as well and get a hold of them before I can name name haha Blackstar you already know and fix you up on the same 7-inch fantastic hip hop duo consisting of Mos Def and Talib Kweli also we have a 7-inch with the Black Keys as well as blues man junior Kimbrough if you don't know the Black Keys didn't EP of just junior covers once and I think it's one of their best releases in the Black Keys discography so it's awesome sort of have a 7-inch with them together there will also be a David Bowie changes 7-inch picture disc so if you really love that track and you want to picture disc and there's also a little Johnny Cash live in prog 12-inch we have a 7 inch from the Angelo and the Vanguard with 1000 deaths on the b-side bomb a side is the song the Irish so you know if you really love that new D'Angelo album you might like that 7-inch there is also a J Dilla picture disc dropping this year it's sort of in the shape of a police badge and it's a song titled the police no direct relation -

pzeeahvMiUM,it's track review no yummy no hi everyone no money broke tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new tile of the Creator single fucking young West Coast rapper producer video director Tyler the Creator seen as the leading man of California hip hop collective Odd Future Wolfgang kill them all at this point Tyler has a few albums under his belt I have reviewed them I don't really fucks with goblin but I kinda like wolf and even though I wasn't head over heels for this album what I did like about this LP in addition to the handful of good songs off this album is that it seemed like in a sense progression for Tyler maturity at least in an artistic sense so now Tyler a lot like his Odd Future cohort Earl Sweatshirt is going to release an album just very suddenly next week after dropping a video single seems that he doesn't want to buy into the whole month long 2 month long hype cycle things since that's kind of what sort of deflated The Odd Future bubble to begin with when they initially hit and then started to come out with their first string of big commercial records so now Tyler is going to be dropping this album next week it's titled Cherry Bomb there are a few tracks from it we can listen to right now but this one over here fucking Jung has a really elaborate video attached to it it's the big single the second half of the song has a clip of the song death camp that starts off this new Cherry Bomb album I will touch briefly down on the song death camp at the end of the Youtube upload Tyler has put on the Internet this track is easily one of the most hard-hitting songs Tyler the Creator has put together so far it's a bit of rap rock with this distorted guitar riff all over it that reminds me quite a bit of nerd like some Pharrell style production specifically the song lap dance Tyler Tyler Tyler is saying I like to follow the rules which is essentially the sentiment of this song kind of a basic sentiment but one that has run through many a Tyler the Creator song over the years lyrically the song reads is like this braggadocious i-told-you-so moment as well as this childish micro rebellion there are a few decent bars on this track I love the line about how blind haters are not seeing his vision and now he's paying off a mortgage instead of paying off tuition but what mostly grabbed me about this song is how we're sort of getting these beat change ups as well as just the the instrumental you're just sounding really nice just having a lot of sound quality to it a much better sound quality when you compare it to some of Tyler's earlier work on Goblin as well as some of the shoddy just rough distorted instrumentals on the of' tape vol 2 with the beat on death camp Tyler is kind of upping things a level in terms of not just sound quality but musical complexity GTG too and I kind of see that same complexity on the song fucking young as well when I look at its instrumental however in a way maturity still remains an Achilles heel for Tyler it's just that instead of musical immaturity it's just kind of you know topical or lyrical immaturity but again the instrumental on fucking young is pretty sweet it's this lush dreamy kind of synthetic feeling neo-soul tune there are some very refined layers to this track some plinky melodies that sound like they might be coming from glockenspiel some horns some strings as well as a story tagged on to this song that is essentially about a love interest being too fucking young so young for Tyler that he seems to fear having the cops knocking on his door I guess due to some kind of statutory type situation and this is kind of a weird sentiment to hear in a Tyler the Creator song because I wasn't he just saying that he doesn't give a fuck about the rules also Tyler's attitude in his music is usually so bratty and childlike it's kind of strange to hear him commenting on somebody else's youth but he's not really talking about youth in terms of how one carry oneself he's talking specifically about age as a number and how that may factor in him going to jail there's not really a moral quandary going on here it's just more of I would like to stay out of trouble please it's a song of temptation simultaneously pushes this girl away but also just flirts with the idea of being with her anyway which in theory isn't a terrible song idea but the lyrics here do tend to run a little lowbrow and kind of trashy the singing at the start of the song is kind of amateurish but it's self-aware in that and it kind of hams it up sounding kind of bad for I guess kind of a funny effect but once the verse and the lush instrumentation kicks in the instrumental really smoothes out and it sounds kind of gorgeous and classy there is a rap verse in the middle of this song while it isn't really tasteful it does bring more context to the situation for one the age difference going on here Tyler saying that I'm going to be 27 you're going to be 21 we're essentially just talking about six years here which isn't really the end of the world or anything like that there are larger age gaps and fully functioning relationships and if this song has been written in the now the girl he's talking about is about 18 and why would a legal issue even come into play here unless the song or at least the song idea is much older than what we're hearing right here or maybe Tyler's just not trying to self snitch I don't know we also have Tyler here on this track talking about his dick and it being longer than his attention span and how splats in his hand nice lyrically on this track I can't really say Tyler is any better or any worse than he usually is but maybe the lack of maturity and the lack of progression in his lyric writing is kind of highlighted it's unag Norah Boleyn strim ental game seems to have seriously improved these two tracks so far okay I'm not turned off by them I don't think they're terrible they could potentially sound better in the context of this album because Tyler's projects thus far have at least been a little conceptual I think Tyler continues to have an interesting and even in artful aesthetic and presentation but when you dig beyond that to the substance of what he's saying it's just I don't know kind of unfulfilled that's essentially what I think about these tracks transition if you give the new songs listen what did you think of them did you love them too J eat them why what do you think I should read next and that's it Anthony Fantana Tyler the Creator forever 
ejIWf57iILg,feeling a little better here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a monthly segment why you know review where I not only keep my eyes closed because I'm going to try to nap and talk at the same time but also I talked about a series of albums in brief that I didn't get a chance to review this past month so I'm going to talk about them just again in brief right here right now cool cool let's try to make this as painless as possible the the new Buck guter album the spiders eyes but guter is an insane man he's really an eccentric he's he's he is an interesting character this new album right here is some noise rock some punk rock some industrial rock and there are some interesting song topics on this record I would recommend checking out the song sex with a hornet's nest really anthemic ballad about having sex with a hornet's nest I guess my issue with this album though is that it seemed a little one-dimensional a lot of the other tracks on this LP kind of had the exact same vibe but maybe weren't quite as funny or as memorable but uh the the few tracks on this LP that do stand out for their incredible weirdness are definitely worth a visit with spiders eyes next to nuke our anger and album this is no fairy tale this is a black metal project specifically a symphonic black metal project with strong elements of storytelling in the lyrics the lyrics on this album are actually quite readable you don't even really need to dive into a lyric sheet to hear much of what's going on if you've listened to a lot of black metal in the past and you know you've been able to decipher lyrics on some of the classics or you know you've even newer albums the lyrics are more readable than they usually are in a black metal record and um I don't know some of the storytelling can be kind of melodramatic at least in the way that they present it while there are some very dark and very gritty themes going on in the lyrics not a lot of it seems very real despite the fact that the title would be kind of telling you otherwise I mean in a way it kind of does feel like a fairy tale a very dark and morbid fairy tale but still kind of a fairy tale all the same my issue with this LP though is that I don't really care for the potentially MIDI symphonic instrumentation if it's not it definitely feels that way the way that it had been recorded produced and mixed into this album it doesn't really connect very intimately with the guitars drums and vocals it kind of feels like it's own separate thing that was added later and the guitars and the drums are produced very very very cleanly as well I mean I would say this album is a touch over produced but I do care for some of the melodies that the symphonic instrumentation brings and I do find the element of storytelling on this album to be pretty ambitious so even though I'm not usually in the metal of this vibe and of this style this record definitely did stand out and I think you'll find it to stand out as well but don't be surprised if the things that do stand out about this album are a complete turnoff to you that's the thing about this record it's its most unique characteristics I think could either be an incredible win for some listeners or just completely obliterate any hope of enjoying this project at all next the new gay kiss album preservation measures not only does gay kiss have an amazing name but they are kind of a crust punk sort of black metal influenced hardcore punk act lots of speed lots of ferocity I guess you know kind of like that spider XY's album just a tad one-dimensional but still if you're looking for a hard-hitting in-your-face just darkened blackened punk record give this thing a listen next two new chand album grow a lot of people been asking me about this LP and just not really seeing the hype behind it I mean this is essentially a bit of a progressive metal record a math rock record fused together and not enjoying it at all not only because I think the you know this this record kind of suffers from the same level of over production many progressive metal records do but it also exemplifies the kind of soulless noodling that I find on a lot of new math rock records as well not really into this kind of you know clean voiced singing style either so you know this album is just really one strike after another but I know there are a lot of people who watch my show who are much more crazy about those genres than I am especially oh when they are brought together under the same umbrella so you know give this thing a give this thing a try if you're you know moving down that road preferentially the new Freddie Gibbs EP pronto Freddie Gibbs a Gary Indiana rapper gangsta rapper hardcore hip-hop rapper who had a fantastic album with mad lib last year pinata definitely one of the best hip-hop records of last year and yeah with with with this new EP here if you're a Freddie Gibbs fan from either his past work or this new pinata record the CP is most definitely worth checking out but the instrumentals you know if you're looking for a more of a mad lib vibe it's not going to come through on this EP because the instrumentals they're cleaner they're more atmospheric I wouldn't say they totally go in a cloud rap direction but they definitely you know tip their hat toward that and Freddie deliver some good verses pronto is definitely the standout track on here though I wouldn't totally say you know the CP is the most memorable thing in the world it just kind of feels like you know just a couple of a pretty decent tracks from Freddie just reminding us that you know in 2015 not going anywhere next a little more hip hop with the new mellow music group persona compilation mellow music group a pretty fantastic independent hip hop label that is out there today I haven't really been a huge huge huge fan of them I guess until recently because I've always kind of found their roster of emcees to just be you know maybe a little bland a little predictable or whatever as far as you know underground hip-hop goes but they have been kind of building up their roster with some more eccentric voices recently people like quali Chris and open mike eagle who both appear very prominently on this compilation right here and while you know the there are some corny hooks here and there the bulk of the songs on this compilation are pretty great and you know if you're unfamiliar with the label and you're looking for some underground hardcore hip-hop or jazz rap hip-hop that has I guess more of a thoughtful socially aware edge to it but you know still kind of a straightforward punch you know to giving you bars I'm giving you verses then you know give this compilation to listen it's a solid comp and I think a good way to kind of dip your toes into the ever-growing discography of this very solid indie hip hop label next the new demacia six album watch what you wish demacia six you guys might remember that I reviewed them not too long ago with the six commandments mixtape and Damacio six is essentially famed dark and tortured southern hip-hop outfit three 6 mafia and at the time of six commandments it was three 6 mafia sands Juicy J which is totally cool because three 6 mafia over the years has been a pretty big group I don't see their success being completely dependent on whether or not Juicy J is is with them you know as he's sort of exploring more solo stuff however now we have had more members kind of depart from demacia 6 since that original mixtape came out so now you know that it essentially kind of just feels like a DJ paul project with just a few other you know three 6 mafia members thrown into the mix you know especially with gangsta boo being out of the loop now you know sort of doing her own solo stuff you know which which i don't mind either it's cool but just kind of seems like three 6 mafia for me as always you you know it's it's not like they've always had the best lyrics or anything like that it's been always sort of the tone of the message of their songs that has played in their favor and made them appealing and also kind of the power in numbers that three 6 mafia's had bringing so many different voices to a single song and that just doesn't end up you know being the case on this new project over here you know with just so many of those old familiar voices that you're looking forward to hearing on a demo fiha six project or a three 6 mafia project just not being present on this new project over here this is getting convoluted it just you know it's just not as inspiring or exciting I guess I just don't feel like I'm listening to the same group anymore that I was hoping I would see come to fruition when I enjoyed what was delivered so much on that six Commandments mixtape next the new Noel Gallagher's high flying birds album chasing yesterday yes this album is doing that if you were at all familiar with Oasis or specifically know Gallagher's high flying birds you know that with this album you're going to get some rock and roll you're going to get some Britpop but on this album particular over here you know not only is it kind of very safe sonically a lot like the last high flying birds album but the songwriting really isn't even you know they're quite as much nor is Noel's vocals not that his singing is awful on this album but it just kind of feels like more of a chore than you know a delivery of a passion or any measurable amount of emotion just to put it bluntly this just felt like some very bland uninspired rock music with no guts or edge to it nor a really strong pop appeal at least to me anyway you know I'd rather just listen to some oasis truly honestly the new hot sugar album God's hand hot sugar a really fantastic and versatile electronic music producer was Donal hip-hop production for a different mcs over the years and I don't know I was I was kind of anticipating this new solo album over here didn't listen to many of the much much of the music from this album before the record because I just wanted to you know listen to the album as a whole you know all the songs in context so on and so forth and um I don't know I've always seen hot sure's music and style and have seen him perform lie before as well as being much more quirky colorful and kind of hard-hitting I wouldn't quite say bangers delivered you know in his music but definitely you know punch year and poppier seems like with this new record over here he's doing something that doesn't have quite as much you know weight to it as much viscera to it and maybe he's just going in more of a just a little bit more of an abstract direction on this new album over here um which I mean theoretically is fine but it didn't really translate to me into anything all that entertaining but if you're looking for an electronic music producer beat music producer who's um you know trying some different things trying to do at least something a little weirder than you would expect give this thing a listen and now two artists who deal entirely in bangers for the most part we have Diplo and Skrillex coming together for the Jack u project and album now unlike the new hot sugar album while this project over here is very visceral it's incredibly formulaic if you've heard any of the bangers Diplo and Skrillex have done before you've pretty much heard this album you know this is this isn't anything entirely new though they do get some good vocal gas song you know people like to chains whether they do something original or they sample their vocals from somewhere else I'm not entirely sure but the way his vocals are incorporated is fantastic you know and there's also a some alunageorge on this record - which turns out very well for the most part I do like this album it brings one hard-hitting drop after another it's an explosive catchy album but the songs with Justin Bieber the slower jams the tracks they're trying to be really emotional trying to be that next big Avicii wake me up sad but also EDM inspired anthem those songs are a pretty lackluster and uninteresting but it's not like this music is really crafted for the album experience anyway if you're just looking for a handful of bangers some of which you'll like some of which maybe we'll just be okay try this thing out next in new made an album a another electronic music producer this new record over here sort of seems to be in the same vein of that new Porter Robinson now that happened not too long ago where you're getting these EDM style drum Tambor's mashed together with this very bright happy sunny indie pop and indie tronic music from the 2000s you know there were moments on that Porter Robinson album that sounded like passion pit this album over here actually features Passion Pit I get that Maidan might have been doing this style for a while with his previous EPS but Porter Robinson seems to have kind of beat him to the punch on this sound at least in an album sense I'm not saying that you shouldn't try this out them out if you're into the style if you think the idea a very bright sunny EDM with kind of an indie twist to it is interesting then give this album a listen as well if you love that new Porter Robinson album you'll probably like this too but like in the same way I didn't enjoy that Porter Robinson album I didn't enjoy this either the new Simon joiner album grass branch and bone if you're looking for a very sad downtrodden singer-songwriter sort of alt-country all folk type give this album a listen it's new it's out on Woods's records Simon joiner has been around a while has sort of been I guess tie casas this sad-sack songwriter individual and he's been doing it for years but he never quite got the popularity that dudes like Elliot Smith and Conor Oberst received and I think it's because his songs are never really overtly catchy or anything like that he's always a little bit more abstract with his lyrics and maybe a little bit more difficult to tangle with emotionally and I find myself and I'm really digging this new album here that much either not that I think Simon joiner you know makes it difficult to enjoy or understand this album but I'm not really finding the same kind of emotional intensity on this record that I've enjoyed in his past albums this album Tomita seems just way more reserved and laid-back from a lyrical and an emotional standpoint then I guess I would have liked from a Simon joiner record oh and you know we're gonna leave it at that cool cool Anthony Fantan oh transition if you given any of these albums listen what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh why you know review who forever 
t5OplI_vGFU,hi everyone queuing is a minha theater the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new slow-mo album dark-red slow-mo is a West Coast electronic music producer this is his latest full-length LP he has been dropping music under this name since the late 2000s the first I heard of him was in 2011 with the album bad vibes and album a very subtle and quiet glitch hop and wonky music that sounded like it was loaded with samples culled from Shlomo's bedroom or something like that just sort of clicks and thuds and boosts that is not even a sound or a word as well as squeaks and the end result of pulling all these sounds together was a very smooth gloomy and kind of relaxing album which occasionally was very dark and brooding now since the release of that LP Shalom O has continued to put out music but more in an EP and single format than in an album format and with each AP Shlomo put out it seemed like he was kind of just embracing some new current trend whether it be the vacation EP where we heard just a little bit of UK bass and future garage on here mixed with some trap Hollywood full trap on the laid out EP which was incredibly dark and Atmospheric and then with the EP which is a collaborative EP with singer Jeremih we had Shlomo embracing the increasingly popular trend of very moody atmospheric alternative R&B with eg P it seemed like Shauna was just kind of delivering just enough material to kind of grasp the style that you wanted to chase and and didn't really push it much further than that so now we have this new LP and I wasn't quite sure what to expect it's not like there's this new big sound and electronic music or or even hip-hop for Shlomo to kind of chase after but dark-red is an album that seems more guided by mood than it does by trends or genre yeah there are elements on this album of trap music as well as maybe a little bit of glitch hop as well as some 90s IDM style rhythms a little influenced by jungle or and bass there are a few different electronic music styles running throughout this album but what's really gonna grab your attention on dark red is that it is dark or at least that's what it's kind of shooting for and while a lot of the songs here may have kind of a dark aesthetic to them they go about expressing that in very similar ways the drums on this LP are slightly distorted slightly dirty very upfront very dry very close the rhythms are kind of claustrophobic on this album but then they are topped with reverb soaked synthesizer leads as well as maybe some watery guitar depending on the track and there are some kind of droney synth chords thrown into the mix somewhere - if you like your electronic music sort of misty and foggy slow and in gloomy if you like music of X X Y X X or blue sky black death or you repeatedly find yourself going back to the triangle records catalog I think you're gonna find some things to like on dark red the synthesizers on this LP occasionally have kind of a rough gurgling analog quality to them and they play through some pretty chilling chords and arpeggios or some very sad synth leads I feel like I'm kind of listening to like a John Carpenter soundtrack but for the trapped generation just take the intro track on this LP and my favorite track on the entire album really ten days of falling very horror synth s and the song eventually builds into this huge wall of rumbling a synthetic sound it's definitely a great start to the album but the following tracks actually deliver roughly the same formula but to a lesser degree of success and I think it's mostly due to Shlomo kind of fueling these tracks with some sort of lackluster chord progressions and and melodic progressions the mixing and layering on this LP sounds really good this album has a pretty good sound to it but the writing leaves quite a bit to be desired like with the instantly boring plinky synth lead on the track meet your maker I do like the IDM style drumbeat on this tract though we also have loads and loads and loads of stale arpeggios all over the song buried which eventually rise up to a kind of lukewarm climax and with the song emerged from smoke we get these heavy heavy drums and one layer of synth on top of another which kind of drowns each other out a little bit each one individually doesn't sound terrible but there's not really much to these scents in the way of counterpoint or sort of working together to create any kind of complexity a lot of the time it just seems like the only reason Shlomo introduces another synth part is just to kind of fill space not really to add any harmonic or melodic intricacies while these tracks aren't awful to me they just kind of read as something that would work much better as a soundtrack to something versus like kind of just an album or a main course there's also the song beans the closing track on this LP and here I just kind of see Shlomo as trying to keep the very limited amount of ideas on this album hot and kind of refreshing whereas at this point they've actually kind of gotten old for me I mean the album is an hour long but I don't really think dark red gives me an hour's worth of ideas I just think this could have worked better as an EP because there's at least a handful of highlights on here I love the song slow descent where the synth lead and the guitar lead on this track actually come together pretty nicely and I love the jittery rhythms on this track too and the song remains I like quite a bit as well which is incredibly short it's dark it's sweet it's kind of bittersweet it's dark chocolate esque and I think a lot of the other songs on this LP you could learn from this and why in that yeah maybe about three minutes of runtime is a good length for tracks on this album because once songs here kind of push past that four five six minute mark how limited Shlomo's compositional abilities are becomes kind of clear I like this LP overall I thought it was decent but I'm not crazy about it I can put Y pretty simply the sound of this album is great the cold frightening gloomy synthetic atmospheres on this are are entertaining but when it comes to the music it's just okay the rhythm is a lot of the time are very visceral and and sound good but the melodies and the court progressions don't really bring that much flavor in my opinion I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition have you given this album and listen and if so what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and more importantly what should Anthony review next let him know down below as far as myself I am youtuber by the name of Joe Alexandria I'm trying to be a full-time youtuber and at the same time I'm trying to be a full time magician following the footsteps that they've Blaine Houdini trying to be a full time musician as well and trying to be a full time filmmaker and movie maker my first film is on my channel right now and 4k resolution this dark is sick it's bloody it's creepy so you might like that I do reaction videos and reviews myself so check me out as well and yes forever 
oX56GvWAGY8,no no you just hi everyone Anthony out tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new young father's album white men are black men too young fathers one of the most standout Scottish musical acts to come out in the past several years some of their earliest music the music they really started to catch buzz on featured blends of hip hop pop soul music sort of filtered through a lo-fi lens occasionally these songs would be backed by African rhythms or like some rap verses or maybe some really great vocal harmonies off of their debut tape young fathers caught the ears of anti Khan records where they ended up signing with them releasing tape to the sequel to tape one where they pretty much had the same sound but delivered a series of just as quality songs as what was on the first tape and after tape 2 they would eventually release what I kind of see is their big commercial debut they did it through big Dada records as well the album dead a record that saw the trio making kind of a cleaner slightly catchy er version of what they were doing on their previous two tapes and even though I think there were good intentions behind this album I found a lot of the instrumentals on this LP to be kind of just repetitive the beats here just really kind of got stale before the song was even over but even though I was kind of indifferent and on the fence with this LP this album did manage to drum up more attention for the Scottish trio and it actually won them a Mercury Prize as well so I mean they were doing something right and with this new album essentially young fathers are continuing to experiment and challenge which i think is great is is actually pretty refreshing not only does this new LP over here come with some very bold and head-turning album art but the music and the musical style of this album as well is a bit of a change in a shift for young fathers white men is not a cleanly produced affair that Dead was young fathers embraces lo-fi once again with this album they head back into grimy er smudgy ER sonic territory and there's not much on this LP in the way of hip-hop either there are some verses and some spoken word here and there but mostly on this record we see young fathers kind of resting on their pop and their soul talents which isn't necessarily a bad thing because the more pop and soul oriented songs of tape 1 and tape 2 or some of my favorite moments on those projects and if young fathers can pull together 10 or 12 songs in that stylistic vein why not now personally I really like this record I think this is a great record in a way sort of a bit of a return to form for young fathers but I wouldn't be surprised if I were to find that a lot of people who were big on dead this album didn't click with them as much the kind of noisy and obscured vocals and drums all over this album kind of keep the songs here from translating on first listen there are some tracks in the track listing here that I think are a little bit more instantaneous than others like the song shame which has a cute little beat to it with a little bitty synth bassline and some tambourine and some drums it's really stripped back it's very simple but with these very simple elements young fathers come through with a lot of texture and a lot of magic and I love the vocal parts on this track and the way the song carries along it's not so much like a clean-cut verse chorus verse type track but more of a continued groove that I get kind of charmed by and and lost in the longer it continues and the song 27 which has some of the best singing and one of the best vocal melodies on the entire LP here even though there's a lot of dirt on the instrumentation with this LP with the piano phrase and the layered vocals on this track there's just a lot of joy and just a lot of Hope in this song and the song rain or shine as well which features some driving drum and bass as well as some just kind of non-stop eerie creepy but also sort of quirky organ chords there's some spoken word in the tract as well and it's another song here the features kind of a linear structure the the song either kind of changes part suddenly or it just continually builds tension on a single idea that just continues to repeat and it's because of tracks like this that I think instantly charm that if you repeat this out another time another time the other songs will kind of grow on you like they did with me like what the song gets started which is the closing track here one of the most climactic tracks on the LP really fitting for a closer and this song features just more sound and instrumentation than any other track here at least from what I can hear and all the sounds are just smudging and bleeding into one another to create this wall a very rich triumphant but also kind of dreamy instrumentation the song nest kind of feels like with this really awesome piano lead like young fathers take on old-school soul or Motown music and with sirens we kind of get this lyrical look at police violence as well as God and instrumentally on this track while it is as simple as a lot of the other songs here that the very few elements that do work their way into this track are wonderful especially the layers of strings on the song which are gorgeous typically you don't expect such refined instrumentation to be going into such a low five album but don't let this albums kind of grimy aesthetic throw you off because there is really beautiful stuff going on beyond the noise and the and the muck and with the song old rock and roll we kind of had a theme of things not being what they seem and with the lyrics here young fathers not only make reference to the album title but they kind of blur racial lines as well this is one of the few moments on this LP that isn't just a ballad either they kind of flirt with hip hop with some spoken word and some verses on this track but it's just really a hard-hitting booming beat here and I don't want to have anybody scared off by the title of this album either I just want to say that even though a record with this on the front might read to you as like oh man this is going to be really and just trying to shove some kind of ideology down my throat I guess what I'm trying to say is they talk about things like race on this album in a very artful and smart and nuanced way they're not just handing you this laundry list of I think this and I think this and I think this and a lot like with that Kendrick Lamar album that dropped not too long ago the music is actually really great on this album so yeah while there is in a sense a message the music is not neglected in order to get that message out there but the one downside there is to this album is that maybe young fathers went a little too far in that low five direction especially for songs on here that that are so melodically rich there are a few tracks on the back end of this LP that have very abrupt endings and and are maybe just a little disappointing because of that but it's really the the mixing and the cacophony of the instrumentation here that I think holds some of these songs back from feeling as big as maybe they were hoping to be like the song liberated for example which despite all of its vocal layering just feels kind of small and just stunted at least a little bit and the song John Doe - which has a sweet melody to it some catchy lyrics a little good times row as you know as well as that reference with with the right instrumentation this track really could have been one of the hardest rocking songs on the entire LP but instead it just remains kind of mild instrumental and just kind of hangs in the yellow and and I do really like the tune though however I just kind of see this as another moment on this album where young fathers are taking pop music themes and ideas and doing some weird and some subversive things with it kind of in the same way that you might have a guy like Ariel pink or a band like women and young fathers is another act on this album who just are making pop music but they're kind of intentionally throwing a wrench in the works and that maybe with an abrupt ending or with kind of an obscure door hidden chorus or with just the general low fire recording of this entire album and even though it may take away from a few tracks I think the kind of fuzzy tattered production of this album adds more character than takes away I think white men are black men too is essentially a really nice lo-fi pop album with a lot going for it in terms of sound in terms of songwriting quality and as well as just a really interesting blend of musical styles even though I do sort of define this as a pop album it really does defy categorization in a lot of ways there really are a lot of popular music styles blended into this album though you might not necessarily notice them on first listen because they're all brought together and tied up very nicely in the very grimey production of this album I'm feeling a light a decent eight on this LP transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fanta no young fathers forever 
I6wrqIndfJM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Courtney Barnett album sometimes I sit and think and sometimes I just sit Courtney Barnett melbourne-based singer-songwriter and currently the pride of the Australian underground music scene she has captured the hearts of local music fans and his copy ear of western audiences as well it's not too hard to see why she has kind of developed her style over the course of a series of well-received EPS and singles all of which have kind of built up to this final product over here this album which features a coy and kind of funny album title as well as some album art that is kind of rough around the edges and has a bit of an amateurish charm and the music itself on this record delivers on those traits as well instrumentally on this new LP here you will find some kind of dirty indie garage rock drums and guitars you won't hear the kind of dirt or grit that you might find on a Black Lips record or AJ retard record not even an album from fellow Aussie Garage rockers like king gizzard the drones or eddy current suppression ring you could liken the rock aesthetic of this album to like distressed clothing that you might find at a downtown clothing boutique something that reads as old but is secretly new which is evidenced in just how the music on this record is performed how it's played much of the time of these tracks sonically musically are pretty straightforward on tempo and pretty well put together Courtney's band doesn't really play it as fast and as loose as they might like you to believe even the big single off of this thing pedestrian at best which features these really big grungy guitar riffs is kind of tame even by grunge standards and the writing on this LP is kind of okay a lot of the time it feels sort of bar from much older ideas on vintage rock albums just as just check out the guitar riff at the intro to the song nobody really cares or again pedestrian at best Donna Donna Dan or even the keyboard lead introduction to the song debbie downer which kind of gets me thinking hey watch that keyboard part it's an antique I do give props to this album for having all the songs instrumentally flow into one another but I can't really obsess over how good or not good the instrumentation on this album is because all in all it's pretty secondary not only in that it doesn't stir up much of an emotional response from me but this album really is much more about Courtney Barnett and her vocals and her lyrics specifically Courtney on this record sort of fashions herself as a neo rock poet the rock instrumentation on this LP will often just very steadily repeat in the background as Courtney on top of the instrumentation will deliver these rapid-fire diatribes on really any fleeting thought that seems to float to the top of her head and while she does this her voice isn't quite monotone but it's definitely sort of unenthused or at least drained and over the years I've loved a lot of very wordy rock or folk music from people like Woody Guthrie and Phil Ochs to Lou Reed Adam green of the Moldy Peaches as well as that new Sun Kil moon record as well and you know what let's just even throw in Sheryl Crow's all I want to do which I think this album has an incredible amount of musical and lyrical common ground with maybe more than some fans would like to admit I don't really mind the formula that Courtney is working with on this LP it's just that what she actually says in these songs the experiences and the feelings that she is detailing in her lyrics are often just so general that they are uninteresting sure there are lyrical moments on this album that are relatable but only in the sense that much of the western music listening audience has had coffee has had a crush has hated going to work and maybe has pontificated whether or not the organic fruits and vegetables at the grocery store are worth the extra couple of dollars some people might find solace in hearing the incredibly mundane details of their own lives post it up onto this musical billboard as if they're worth writing on anything else other than a to do list or maybe a Twitter timeline and maybe given the right voice or personality they are things that are worth sharing but personally I don't really find Courtney Barnett to be that riveting of a voice I find her observations on this album a lot of the time to be kind of plain and dull and it gets to the point where instrumentally and in vocally I find these songs hard to bear like tracks such as small poppies or the closing track on here occasionally though Courtney does come through with some great lyrics there are flashes in the pan there are spots here where I think okay you know I could see why people are really drawn to this LT because this is a legitimately good moment tracks like pedestrian I think Courtney sort of challenges her audience if they put around a pedestal she'll only disappoint them by taking it a step further and saying any money that she is handed will immediately be turned into origami it's moments like this where I think Courtney handles Fame depression and boredom ennui listlessness in a really interesting and creative way as well as on the song Kim's Caravan where not only is Courtney incredibly depressed about the environmental state of the world and people having different points of view which I guess keep things from getting fixed but she also kind of talks directly to her audience saying that she is essentially a mirror a reflection of whatever the audience wants to hear or see and that they shouldn't really ask her what she means when she is talking about all these different things that essentially are kind of mental clutter that some listeners might be reading a little bit too deep into like Courtney you're saying so many things what does it all mean I thought it was smart for Courtney toward the end of this LP to kind of very point we deflate any hope of there being any kind of big answers to any life questions in this album life questions that I think a lot of people might sort of assume are being answered given that Courtney may suffer from a lot of the same emotional issues and neuroses that you know your average introspective music fan might as well she seems to already know how some people might be enjoying or reading into an album like this and she addresses that in a really awesome way and there are some other tracks on here such as aqua profundo where she's talking about crushing on someone at the community pool which I thought was actually a really cute song the song nobody really cares if you don't go to the party is a hilarious homebody anthem maybe the best homebody anthem since our Stevie Moore's I like to stay at home and the hook to Debbie Downer was pretty sweet as well but outside of these cuts there aren't really that many highlights for me on this LP overall I'm not really into a lot of the instrumentation on this LP I find a lot of it to be kind of copy and pasted in just a little drab and as far as Courtney goes with her lyrics her vocals there are a lot of spots here where I find her to be witty but there are just as many moments where I think she is kind of mundane and uninteresting and while she may be really self-aware about that it doesn't necessarily make it any more entertaining for me I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP transition if you give in the salma listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Courtney Barnett forever 
i_nT7yigOXA,hi everyone kalsa need ed tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a really quick video letting you know some of my favourite albums of this past month March albums that I think highlights of the month should most definitely be checked out let's start the new Death Grips album has been completed with the second half Jenny death of course these two albums coming together is titled the powers-that-be if you have not checked this album out do give it a listen it is some progressive insane electronic industrial experimental hip hop music the first disc being way more jarring and abstract and just kind of difficult the second disc Jenny death being way more hardcore punk inspired there are themes of death sex and technology running throughout both halves of this double album I think it's one of the better releases of this year and it's fantastic Death Grips came out with over 80 minutes of music and so much of it is incredible mind-bending and really creative and envelope-pushing then after that I would love to recommend if you know you've been living under a rock the new Kendrick Lamar album to pimp a butterfly definitely probably will go down as my favorite hip hop album of this year at least and sort of more of a traditional approach to hip hop incredibly conceptual and well put together long dense and creative record some fantastic and very diverse production on this album as well I could talk about this LP all day and and I did already in my review which I'm gonna link you to down there in the description box anyway so you can see it there next the new Clarence clarity album no now this is an insane little pop and alternative R&B record if you're not aware there's been a lot of alternative R&B coming out lately oh you know with lots of reverb e effects and kind of a very desolate moody sound palette but uh this album takes a completely different approach making things very dense and experimental and noisy and sometimes dissonant and maximal and with some really good songwriting too I find the approach that Clarence is taking here much more engaging than what a lot of other alternative R&B singers and producers are doing right now I think the way he approaches putting music together it's very detailed and it's very overwhelming and at parts I think really exciting and it also helps that many of the songs here kind of catchy maybe he's a little too eccentric sometimes and his voice can go a little overboard to the point of maybe some slight annoyance but I do think this album is really creative and out there another very dense and thick and difficult to sift through album is the new Leviathan LP Skaar cited this is a really interesting black metal album that melds different forms of extreme metal together for an incredibly incredibly layered and hellish display of sound this album is not only hard-hitting and visceral it was pretty easy to enjoy the aesthetic and the vibe of this album really quickly but it also has just the detail and the heaviness and the I guess the the range of frequencies that I love to hear in a metal record something that's also pummeling but has a lot going on with numerous vocal layers and styles and lots of layers of guitar work as well I mean this album just works in layers and layers and layers there's just so much going on especially toward the beginning and in the middle of this record things kind of become a little more straightforward not quite as difficult to untangle but the last three or four songs on this album get really epic and huge and climactic so the record itself has a great flow to it not reinventing the wheel but definitely one of the best black metal albums you'll hear this year even though it's not a pure black metal album like I said there are other metal styles kind of fused in there and finally I got to give props to the new Jeff Rosen stock album we cool a personal kind of yes pressing midlifecrisis kind of album if midlife crises happened in your 30s this album is pop punk flavored maybe a little bit of a Weezer style power pop in there as well really catchy songs very personal self focused lyrics a lot of themes of a kind of being stuck in this limbo of being an adult age wise but not having quite matured personally it's the most fun I've had listening to an album this depressing and those are the five records I would like to recommend to you this month and that's and that's it you're the best did you Anthony Fantana forever 
mU0Gw0_u1ok,hey everyone good phanie Viton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Billy woods album today I wrote nothing Billy woods is a lyrically clever shadowy and kind of esoteric rapper currently based out of New York one of my favorite MCS of the past several years or so once part of the super Kron flight brothers he's actually been working in another duo recently Armand Hammer with another new york-based MC a-- lucid it lucid actually makes numerous appearances on this new Billy woods album over here as well but even though I do like that duo stuff it's been Billy woods so material as a recent soul material that's impressed me the most the album history will absolve me some incredibly produced grimy hip-hop with numerous tracks on this record each one dealing with a different theme some of which are really smart kind of unexpected unusual for a hip-hop album whether it be a depiction of a deadbeat dad and his dysfunctional family or a really surly depiction of a strip club or the song DMCA where he's kind of parroting the way people rationalize pirating music from independent artists who aren't really making that much money off their music to begin with and then there's Billy's follow-up to that album now or candy where it's kind of a character portrait for a good deal of this LP of this kind of shady drug-dealing character not entirely good but not entirely bad either and we get this depiction of his sort of mundane day-to-day and without Billy explicitly saying so there's something about this album that feels kind of autobiographical and this is something that to me has consistently separated woods from a lot of other modern emcees he gives these really vivid portrayal of incredibly dicey situations but he doesn't really give you the full details or maybe doesn't explicitly say whatever role he might have played in any of it the lyrics Billy delivers can create these hyper realistic glimpse of the situation's he's talking about but I never feel like I'm getting the full picture like he's leaving out some incriminating details or something like that I just always get the feeling that he knows way more than he's actually telling me kind of like he's waiting for the day when rap lyrics can be used as evidence to incriminate someone in court oh wait other characteristics of of Billy's style is that he's got this kind of slow conversational rap flow there are people that talk faster than Billy Woods raps he really spits bars like he doesn't have anywhere to be but he's still an incredibly talented writer and lyricist and he makes sure that every line he puts out there sort of like an emcee such as kah for example he makes sure every line counts and moves toward either building a narrative or a character portrait he's putting together the issue is that sometimes Billy can kind of drop us in the middle of a story or a scene without giving full context or anything like that or if there is context it's kind of hidden in some very difficult to decipher lyrics and that's especially the case for this new album over here which seems kind of like just a smattering of relatively short songs a lot of the tracks on this album landing somewhere between 1 to 2 minutes and 30 or 40 seconds or so today I wrote nothing flows kind of like a compilation series of lyrical scenes from about 8 or 12 different movies none of which are finished but were entirely written and composed in Billy woods head and there's no way you can pull all these different scenes together into a coherent narrative because they're all coming from different movies which I don't even know if Billy entirely knows or understands what direction any or all of them are going in there's actually one moment on here where Billy takes a pretty hefty sample as a vocal snippet from an episode of The Wire and if you're at all familiar with the wire it's it's pretty easy to understand why Billy would be influenced by a TV show like that comes to a lot of the topics and themes and the kind of criminal underbelly that goes on in a lot of his songs for example on the song rpms which instrumentally is a very atmospheric track doesn't really have a strong backbeat to it or anything like that it mostly feels like the epic synth scape that you would find in the opening or closing credits to a really great 80's post-apocalyptic action movie but lyrically what Billy is describing here is a sort of the inner monologue of somebody who is being carted off by the police right now in slow motion in every single detail and just micro thought in this person's head is kind of explored or explained everything from this guy kind of talking slick because he wants to give up the appearance that he's going to be back in the neighborhood really soon too people watching him getting carted away in the back of this squad car as if it were a hearse saying that as he's getting carted off he has a max B smirk because of the time constraints Billy purposefully puts on this album the beats are kind of bare the hooks are pretty stingy and when a hook is here maybe it might appear one time before the track either ends or maybe introduces one more verse and then finishes the shortest song on here is about 45 seconds it's called dreams come true it's a hilarious anti love song and these are all the lyrics these are all the lyrics in this song they're funny they're funny but these are all the lyrics this album actually delivers one lyrical loose end after another which on the surface it sounds kind of unfulfilled but for me anyway it was actually pretty entertaining you know sometimes an artist is so talented that even their sketchbook is impressive to look at it's kind of like that the record here kind of starts off in a in a somewhat in conspicuous way though with another rapper wrapping it lucid and he kind of gives this day-in-the-life verse I'm not really sure how it ties into the whole record though I do like it it's really diverse after this one Billy woods is where he kind of delivers a the manifesto of the album talking about how he's making the effort to write but yet the page kind of stays blank he's just drained on ideas and after this verse is over he just dramatically states today I wrote nothing and after this we get the song big nothing featuring some DJ scratches from Moe Nichols who reappears on this album numerous times to do exactly that and over a kind of redundant and meditative piano loop Billy delivers these lyrics about just boredom maybe a bit of ennui or something like that this album to a degree seems inspired by a lack of inspiration which is something that's not often talked about in hip-hop music usually about musics all about the times when inspiration does strike and things are exciting and things are happening this song much less so and it's really contemplative track - like many of the other songs here are however this album didn't just bore me to death or anything like that the album does pick up momentum does bring some more visceral tracks with some clear themes or topics for example the song Woodhull has this incredibly punchy synth line soaked in this disorienting echo and Billy woods is back to delivering these kind of urgent and very snide vocal performances we have the song u-boats which features this just grimy squelching instrumental that apparently was produced by bus driver and Aesop Rock and the song was essentially about drug dealing and given the title of the track there are a lot of nautical themes and given that it is Billy woods he is exploring the dark side and the downside to drug dealing he's not really in the whole glamor aspect of the profession there's a great verse from a lucid as well on this track and this song is one of the few tracks here that I think instrumentally transitions right into the next cut the song Zulu Tolstoy which is one of the only rap songs I think has ever mentioned mr. Tolstoy but it's actually pretty smart track with Billy woods being wrapper writing about himself writing about a rapper writing about himself it's a very meta track and it kind of borders between being funny satire but also a sad reality of this younger rapper who is very hip very trendy there are a lot of mentions of industry cliches on this track he actually writes from the voice of the character for a second saying he'd say no homo if this was his track and there are other tracks here where I don't 100% understand what exactly the overarching theme is yet but I do love some of the one-liners Billy woods is coming through with on these songs for example the song bicycles we're over this kind of rickety guitar led beat that kind of sounds like a Tom Waits song he says second childhood neither were very nice their moments on this LP were Billy displays that he has the wit of a comedy writer another line here where he says not one to face the music gave it a crude mix there's some great lines as well on the song borrowed time where Billy is kind of reflecting on meeting up with old friends and associates talking about old times but it simultaneously while it does feel good it's awkward to because you realize how much distance has grown between you and whoever you haven't hung out with in so many decades and there's a pretty hefty MF DOOM sample on this track as well living on borrowed time the clock ticks faster I could go into nearly every track here describing its handful of unique characteristics that either separate it from the other songs when it comes to what is being said on the track or the beat being so wildly different from every other beat here we're talking about 24 songs on this album that push just over 50 minutes in time so while there are highlights on this album they're all incredibly short and I think you're kind of just enjoying them in the same way that you might a beat on like J Dilla's donuts for example it's almost as if this album is some producers crazy short beat music album but Billy just decided to put lyrics over these songs no matter how short they were so while the downside to this is that he doesn't give himself a whole lot of time to build up any of these concepts to something that really hits hard though occasionally that does happen because he does come together with a really poignant or a smart lyric he doesn't give himself a whole lot of time to work out these themes and kind of tease them out on a song what's cool about this project is Billy kind of lets go of his inhibitions and does some weirder stuff and take some risks and plays with some imagery and maybe some themes that he wouldn't have talked about otherwise while the opening track to this LP to me wasn't the most fitting in the world the closer is actually very fitting goodnight it's kind of a hilarious track with an interesting metaphor to it maybe a metaphor it might just literally be about love and just sort of lust or something like that but Billy is in this bar asking that the bartender keep his drink full and he's watching this woman who he seems to have history with dance and he don't dance he don't dance he says again and again but then the hook here says last call put my song on and you get this impression that Billy toward the end of the song has actually got up the courage to go over to her and dance and I don't know it was just like a super fitting finish for this album I kind of equated to the odd dancing fellow who pops up notoriously in the dream sequences of the main character in the Twin Peaks television series I did enjoy this album a lot I did think it was a really interesting LP there are some issues though you know the fact that so many of the songs here are so very short and takes such a very bare approach to the narrative and the beat or the hook if there even is one sometimes the tracks can feel kind of shoddy or maybe just even unmemorable but which tracks are unmemorable I think are going to be different for different people you know I just think with an album formula such as this there were going to be some hits and they were of course going to be some misses I kind of see this album not as like a perfect display of marksmanship where you've got a revolver and you've landed all six shots into the center of the target this album is more like a shotgun blast just all the songs flying at you at once of course they're not all hitting in the center of the target but there's still like a lot of power there's a huge burst of energy and creativity that I think went into this album I'm not loving loving every track on this album but I did really enjoy the time that I spent with this project I did think it was really intriguing and I could see myself coming back to this thing time and time again I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Billy woods forever 
hxfr_YEbfYg,cough cough the knee cough cough here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new portico album living fields portico is a uk-based musical group fresh off of a name change from portico quintet and obviously a lineup change as well since they are no longer a quintet at least with this new album and they've been building up a reputation for themselves since the late 2000s with a very modern and progressive approach to jazz music incorporating elements of minimalism as well as electronic music into the style most notably on albums such as 2009's isla as well as their last self-titled album which was one of my favourite albums of that year but as Portico has progressed artistically their sound has seemed less and less based in the Jazz tradition and now with this new album over here it doesn't seem like they're making jazz music at all dun dun dun oh yeah Cal's dead he would have been surprised by that if he were still alive maybe he said something like I can't believe it's not jazz rather than any of the kind of steady calculated funk and grooves that we got on Portico quintets last album with this new LP over here we're getting just a lot of simple skeletal stiff very clean in atmospheric electronic production on top of which portico kind of invites a handful of singers to deliver some voice people like singer-songwriter and producer Jonah McCleary as well as Joe Newman of alt-j and another singer-songwriter and producer Jamie Woon and the presence of these singers is very prominent on this album there's only one short interlude track on the entire record here that doesn't feature at least one of these three singers so on this new LP over here portico is essentially acting as the producer as well as the songwriter or Co songwriters as they bring on these different vocalists and if you couldn't tell already from the singers that there on this album they're going in kind of an art pop and alternative R&B direction because that is the background these producers and singers come from which isn't necessarily bad these are bad styles of music but I guess it's kind of porticoes approach to these styles of music that leaves a lot of these songs feeling less like really great tracks and and more kind of like just moody trendy filler now there are a few highlights on the record here like with the song 101 featuring Joe Newman at that temperature on all three I love the tune I love the vocal melody that that rings through on this track Newman takes a very somber tone with his voice and the lyrics he doesn't quite bring me wild inflections that he does on a lot of alt-j songs but still the very sad emotions of this track ring through and he just shows himself to be a passionate and a very capable singer the simple beat of this track is okay be very glassy and smooth arpeggios on this track as well are nice but the ending kind of fizzles out this track and the next song on here as well which feels like a bit of an interlude song it shows that there are some good ideas on this album here but not many of them are organized or defined in such a way where they feel really complete and solid or fully formed all of these okay and sometimes good ideas kind of meld together very bland ly in a way that they tend to just kind of cancel each other out and make the highlights of this album just feel a little less significant and there are other tracks on the track listing here I'm just having a hard time pulling anything significant out of like atacama which takes a definitely a weirder approach to sound and texture on this track they're just some strange effects that pop up in the rhythm on this song and you know even though it might be a little quirky to a degree the track musically still kind of feels like just wallpaper and the song color fading while I'm getting kind of a soul vibe from the boat on this track the instrumental the beat it just feels so stiff and so calculated that it pulls any potential for emotional connection out of this song and it's not like its approach to coldness and soul music is is such a strong juxtaposition that it's novel or that it's exciting or whoa this is totally different it just kind of feels like a weaker watered down version of all this trendy reverb lead and alternative R&B that's just popping up left and right right now and the song memory of newness which is the closing track on here that features Jamie Woon who is actually one of my favorite singers on this whole project but his his singing ability and his talents I don't really think pour through on this track this song seems way more infatuated with its inability to develop past anything else other than like an ambien intro to something you know versus like a legitimately interesting song it comes out of it's shell for just a spare few seconds but then immediately after it just begins to wander into the nothingness this album has presented for the past 30 minutes I really did not like this album and and in and so far it's it's been one of my biggest musical disappointments of the year and for several different reasons one this is not the kind of record I look for from anyone much less portico to this LP is so short it's just 37 minutes it feels like they wanted to come together with this new sound try something totally different but not really commit to it all that hard three not only is this album kind of just unsatisfying to me in its length as well as it's surprising change of pace but I also feel like I'm just kind of tossing this album on top of the pile of albums in an already very established trendy style that I just already don't care for and on top of all of it in the midst of this sound change and this very short album portico couldn't even spare more than like one or two decent songs we get one track after another on this album and yet there's no incredible song at the core of much of any of it not that that was the case for porticoes previous material it wasn't really not at least in a sort of verse chorus verse kind of sense you know they were playing with jazz music and minimalism and in that realm you can rely a little bit more on things like repetition and groove and and so on and so forth but here they've kind of gravitated into a much more song based style of music and the songs are maybe one of the weaker elements in the equation over here with this album and it really hurts it's enjoyability with just so many melodies here being so incredibly not memorable not really digging this album at all not even really a little there's like maybe one track I liked off of this entire LP and I didn't even like it that much I don't think portico is untalented or anything like that I don't think this album is necessarily a fall from grace depending on what they end up doing with future projects but this album to me it really just kind of felt like an unflattering change of pace a very unflattering change of pace I'm feeling a strong two to a light three on this thing transition so have you given this album a listen if so what did you think of it love it hate it why and what do you think and you should review next I'm you're wrong you're right from YouTube ywi on Twitter and just an average-looking guy IRL forever
