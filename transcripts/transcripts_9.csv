mlLqB2lxii4,hahaha good the hi everyone don't say anything to hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tyler the Creator albums flower boy yellow flannel is on view is going cameras on microphone is on over here cue Cal Church esta making out with a picture of Tyler the Creator and I think we are ready to start the review this is the latest full-length album from California rapper Tyler the Creator once the flagship member of the slightly defunct Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all a West Coast rap collective whose member to member relations seemed more tentative than ever I mean that they're still kind of the kind of thing but in my opinion Odd Future kind of waning a little bit as a group is not necessarily a bad thing because there's always been a massive talent gap between the group's best and worst members and with that separation I've been hoping that the group's best members kind of find more clarity in their work especially Tyler over here who I have been kind of disappointed in his past efforts because I feel like he is one of the members of the collective who has had the most potential which I hope would be capitalized on with each new release and yet however in the lead-up to this new album over here fell like flower boy for me at least was going to be that artistically defining moment for Tyler not because of the revelations about his sexuality peppered throughout some of the lyrics on this album which the music media and sensationalist hip hop fans made a bigger deal of than Tyler's actual core fanbase but some of the lead singles on this thing like who dat boy and nine-one-one slash mr. lonely in my opinion where some of Tyler's best material to date it finally felt like Tyler was brushing up on his rapping and his production skills his flows were smoother his performance seemed more animated than he mature the production was well mixed well balanced Eddi hard-hitting bassy and exciting and visceral on who that some of the finer and smoother and jazzier moments on some of the lead singles of this thing were very beautiful the awkwardness and the clunkiness that ruins some of tyler slow jams in the past especially on Cherry Bomb seems to have kind of dissipated so going into this record I was looking forward and hoping to hear a Tyler album that wasn't plagued by some of the same technical flaws that made some of his past work just difficult listen but one more thing that had me excited on the lead up to this record is that everything has been relatively silent on the social media and the headline front meaning it's been a while since Tyler's been embroiled in a lot of the same Internet drama that seemed to be kind of informing a lot of the lyrical content on his past work much of which I just found really uninteresting and petty and boring now I feel like I'm finally able to hear a record where Tyler is just completely out of the woods on this endless feedback cycle between him and the music media and now that he's out of that bubble I'm just kind of curious to see if he has anything interesting to say is there really anything to him just beyond being confrontational with his online detractors and Tyler actually does have a lot of interesting things to say on this record right from the start of it on the track forward Tyler hits listeners with a nice string of thoughtful rhymes coated with some strong wordplay and it's almost like he's questioning just how much longer he has in the limelight or if he'll continue exceeding expectations as he has in the past this is kind of an introspective side of Tyler that I found very interesting on bastard when I heard it but I only got little bits of it in the future once Odd Future blew up and one more thing I found pretty striking on this track as well as other cuts on here are all these references to materialism cars chains things that Tyler really seems to be infatuated with on this new record but in the past was something that he didn't really care about or would actively talk about caring about which almost kind of leads me to believe that he's using things like cars to fill a void that's very clearly informing the moodiness of a lot of songs on this project like pothole and boredom and garden shed there are a lot of songs on this that had this dreamy yet dreary aesthetic like many cuts that were on Cherry Bomb they're smooth they're lavishly layered they're jazzy they're soulful however this time I feel like we're dealing with instrumentals and songs that are much more solidly composed and gorgeously arranged too and just the sound of this thing man I've never been so impressed with just the sound of the instrumentation on a tiler project which in the past especially on goblin has come off kind of shoddy by comparison flower boy is expansive it's kaleidoscopic it's so intricate it just sounds like Tyler's finally coming into his own as a producer while still showcasing a lot of the things that made his music special in the first place this deep appreciation of jazz and a very healthy dose of Pharrell worship which turns up on a lot of the percussion patterns and the beats or in some of the Corky synthesizer leads that squawk their way through some of these very smooth instrumentals if I had to pick on one instrumental on this record though it would be where this flower blooms featuring Frank Ocean it's one of the few beats on this thing I found to be kind of hollow a little lifeless and flat Tyler doesn't have the most passionate delivery on the track and Frank Ocean I think leaves a little bit to be desired the kind of lazy demeanor to his performance I think works a little bit better when he appears on the song nine-one-one generally though I think the features on this thing do add a lot to the record Tyler really did string together some pretty capable singers to carry some of the jazzy or interludes on this thing even Jaden Smith on this thing who I was not anticipating liking at all I feel like his boyish a voice and very stone cold demeanor played very nicely against Tyler's a very cartoony rasp and little Wayne's feature on drop-in seeds actually played very nicely into the floral themes that are kind of peppered throughout the record so not only are there a lot of good guests on this thing but there's so many sticky melodies and hooks 20 times on a 20 vision cool a boy via me is Who am I gonna check out is there gotta check out her chest find some time find some time to do something I'm just surprised how many moments on this record cemented themselves in my head even after just a few listens of the album it just felt really easy to become very some Miller with the album very quickly and yet it still feels like I'm peeling back little musical details and intricacies each time I listen now as far as the lyrical content goes on this thing I feel like we're finally getting an opportunity to unravel Tyler as a personality and kind of a weird musical celebrity a weird popular culture enigma kind of like this album is just a fainting couch for him to lay on as he tells us everything that's been driving him crazy over the past few years and we're just a silent therapist listening and nodding but I think a lot of what Tyler says on this thing kind of boils down to the dichotomy of the title of the album itself scum flower boy just think of those two phrases kind of playing off of each other what each one signifies though I do think that this album is more flower boy than it is scum  there are a few grimy bangers on this thing like I ain't got time and who died boy but even on these tracks you'll find lines where Tyler is talking about his sexuality as queerness making reference to more of that flower boy side of the title and after listening to this entire album I I don't so much feel like we're talking about two sides of Tyler that are at war or odds with one another rather I came away from this record feeling like these two sides are a little more like yin and yang they're kind of deeply ingrained and informed by one another and very inseparable and it's not like the tracks on the track listing that are more sonically smooth and soulful and sugary don't have any bite to them either we have lots of lyrics on the softer cuts here where Tyler makes reference to his kind of lone wolf status his tendency to push people away his loneliness how he's just kind of unapologetic about his somewhat antisocial behavior yeah this album also shows Tyler at his softest I think the softest we've ever seen him in his entire discography putting out some actually like very capable love songs on this thing other tracks on here more about his insecurities his struggle to beat himself his sexuality his vulnerability which I think if there's one word that you could boil a lot of this album down to it's that this is a legitimately emotional and personal album from Tyler the Creator Tyler the freaking Creator like if you told me when goblin came out we'd eventually be here I might have laughed in your face but somehow the album ends up being pretty gratifying and relatable to and actually works beyond the Tyler the Creator and Odd Future cult of personality a few tracks in the tracklisting pale in comparison to others and I think that I would have been more interested to see Tyler organize some of these thoughts into more bite-sized and cohesive and focused tracks taking on specific topics with each song occasionally he does do that but not throughout but most of the time I just kind of feel like I'm listening to Tyler just spill out the contents of a toy box or something which is not necessarily a bad thing because it's very fun and very easy to sort of sift through all of what he's saying my last major critique of the album is really that it does not end on the strongest of notes I don't really feel like the song glitter is all that much of a final statement or a thematic wrap-up to everything that Tyler has sort of dumped on us with this record it's lovey dovey it's pretty it's kind of well put together and it expands the space of Tyler softer side on this record but it's essentially the last song of the album with the actual last track of the record just being this extended instrumental which I kind of like it's a decent instrumental Tyler is clearly trying to tell us something with the title of this instrumental too but really what does it say as far as a summation of everything this album has been about thus far not really much still though despite those shortcomings I think this album is Tyler's best effort to date it's very tight 47 minutes it's his best produced album his best written and conceived album his best performed and wrapped album and I loved a great deal of the tracks on this thing I'm feeling a decent a strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

Ab3m47hEUuU,hey everyone hey everyone hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week ooba-dooba do and not sure if it needs much more explanation beyond that at this point all the songs that I talk about in this segment are linked down there in the description and of course we have to shout out a couple of things before we get into the tracks one our amazon associates link look for it down there in the description if you click on it and you shop on Amazon and you live in the US we get kickback from whatever you buy does not add to your overall price supports the segment supports the show we also have a similar thing going on with the good people over at turntable lab you can buy colorful pressings or records that we have reviewed on the channel both positively and negatively and you could also buy you know audio equipment turntables stuff for the budding record collector budding audiophile whether it be you or someone in your life and also want to shout out our t-shirts over at the needle drop coms slash support go over there that link is in the description check out those shirts the shirts are kind of on backorder right now I'm sending them all out myself with Jeremy shout out to Jeremy and you know we're packaging them you know I'm printing out the labels I'm collecting the addresses and all that stuff and you know I just got back from vacation so this week I had not sent out any shirts however we are going to be sending out the next batch very soon as soon as within the next 24 hours so again very soon so you know that batch will go out and eventually the batch of t-shirts that I get ordered this week will go out but just please be patient especially if you are overseas because even if you know I send them out ASAP the shirts typically do take 3 to 4 weeks to reach you know overseas destinations like Australia and the UK and Japan and stuff like that so keep that in mind all right cool I think that is everything that you guys need to know before we get into the tracks let's just get into the list starting off with the worst tracks the week worst tracks the week the songs that I was most disappointed in what are those no what this new single from the darkness all the pretty girls the darkness continued to come through with and deliver the worst and most in excruciating cliches of hard rock and hair metal from the 80s however you know now at this point there's so many albums deep with the debut it was kind of cute it was kind of fun now it's just getting tired and old and that's certainly the case with this new track over here all the pretty girls moving on from their Marc kozilek has a new track out from an upcoming a collaborative project featuring Ben boy and Jim white this new song titled house cat sounds like a really messy live demo that's kind of unlistenable didn't really care for the lyrics all that much either just felt like a really messy performance felt like all the things that I didn't really like about universal themes but turned up to 11 you know because the universal themes as much as I was underwhelmed by that record there certainly were some cool things about that album there certainly were high points of that record where it felt like the visceral kind of loose in the moment recording of that album work to Mark's benefit but all of that is just on the negative edge of that sword on this new track over here unfortunately not expecting much from this forthcoming project based off of this track but you know who knows and I still have to try out that new album Marquez out with a the parquet courts bassist moving on from their Demi Lovato with the new single sorry not sorry which really is is pretty much every every modern pop music cliche just regurgitated once again onto another top 40 song there's really nothing to say about it and the look is absolutely obnoxious it's just a really annoying painfully formulaic song with nothing special about it and that's really kind of how we have to leave it because again there's there's really nothing to describe there's really nothing to write home about in regards to this track I mean the hook is kind of sticky but it's not really a special song at all by any means and finally in this segment I believe is their last track in the worst segment diamonds from ASAP 12e featuring ASAP rocky this track is kind of like one of those cloudy a mysterious very very pillowy and soft trap flavored rap songs that I wouldn't say it's a sensitive song but it certainly has a sensitive sound to it which I don't think compliments 12e style at all rocky usually does pretty good over this kind of production but it does not bear out here on this new track over here this really weak underwhelming song with you know really nothing all that captivating about it you know just really a throwaway single in my opinion and I believe it's going to do it for the worst tracks let's get into the mess songs the songs that I was a kind of on the fence with but still I wanted to mention them here shout them out point your attention toward them because I think they're worth your attention if you're into some of these artists or into the style of music that they deliver first I want to which one is this this is the new wolves in the throne room track yes wolves in the throne room has a new single a new track out titled born from the Serpent's eye and this to me is kind of like the follow-up record that to Hunter's where the band kind of wiped away a lot of the atmosphere and a lot of the reverb that their music was previously shrouded in maybe to show that they weren't entirely dependent on that sound to sort of make a good record but in fact they were and unfortunately it sound like they go a little bit drier a little bit brah on this new song over here and as a result it is a little underwhelming you know wolves in the throne room have never been one of those bands that again in the raw has sounded the best to me you know they sound amazing and atmosphere especially their last record which was mostly an ambient album which I thought was an amazing and a fantastic and surprising turn but this new track over here while it certainly does sound better than a lot of the drier cuts the band has released over the years it's not really flooring or anything like that however you know I'm willing to sort of be patient and see if it all kind of works as you know a complete project whenever this album does come together with a or this track rather does come together with the rest of an album moving on from there the war on drugs has a new track out ty strangest thing which is kind of a very slow burner ballad not quite as gauzy as the band's previous stuff it's alright you know nothing nothing really flooring me about it but you know certainly a track that could grow on me as I listen to it more and more within the context of the upcoming album a deeper understanding look for that album very soon and look for a review too for a to when it drops Randy Newman has a new track out legendary songwriter ran the Randy Newman excuse me new song Sonny Boy which is kind of a a biographical tune about blues harmonica players Sonny Williams and a pretty interesting thing for Randy to write about but he's always been kind of one of those quirky singer songwriters who you know attacks and features interesting topics in his work in his material and you know that's nothing to be surprised about here on this new cut you know the song the tune was okay it doesn't really have the usual jauntiness and I I guess a pepper and flavor and spice and pizazz of a usual Randy Newman song but you know he is really getting up there in age and he is kind of at the point in his career where he is toning it down a little bit that's to be understood but you know this could be a really cool and interesting Twilight release for Randy Newman once the song sort of is you know heard within the context of the entire record I keep bringing that up but you know it's important the context of the entire album you know and which I think is especially important to highlight and point out in the nature where people sort of seem to be appreciating albums less and less but I digress moving on from their propoganda has a new decent single out title victory lap never been a huge propoganda guy just going to be straightforward about that but you know I thought this track wasn't interesting and a cool piece of melodic hardcore that was kind of catchy kind of poppy obviously with propaganda propoganda there's always a politically charged sort of angle to the lyrics so you know be on the lookout for that and want to shout out Joe Gees new single titled rain on me Joe G aka George Miller aka pink guy aka filthy Frank Bulova you know him I know him on a somewhat personal level just wanted to give a shout out to this new track over here that he has out that was really the 88 rising YouTube channel it's okay it's a very kind of melodic tune with him mostly singing and I mean I don't know I'm not as crazy about it as I am his pink guy stuff obviously his pink guy stuff there's a comedic element to it but I still find it very entertaining this sort of seems like you know hopefully the kind of thing that when George dropped pink season that his fans were kind of bitching for him to go in the direction of because there was kind of this pervading and very annoying vocal opinion that oh you need to make serious music make serious music's biggest serious Oh Mickey I'm honored to be here yes I went to music to be serious um which was kind of annoying because you know I think pink season is kind of entertaining hopefully this kind of quenches that thirst I mean it's not really doing much for me but again hopefully for the people who are demanding such a thing a more serious direction hopefully you're getting something out of this and one more I think the new Chad Van Galen song over here pine and clover obviously a mix of experimental music indie music and folk music kind of crashing into a really creative and interesting sonic color palette for Chad not one of my favorite Chad tunes that I've ever heard but you know that creative production and that sort of left field instrumental style that he usually has to his songs is here it's alive and it's well and you know if you're into experimental folk experimental indie music you're not going to want to miss it alright let's get it what I thought were the best tracks of the week or burning through this list and hopefully you know you're getting some good recommendations out of this - what burnin right through it alright Wolf Parade cry cry cry was pretty surprised to be heavy heavy into the new Wolf Parade track for me the song brought back the visceral instrumentation especially the guitars and the undeniably dramatic and captivate captivating vocals from Spencer crude that has always made Wolf Parade captivating and fun and an interesting and a wild and an exciting band you know this isn't going to be the first time Wolf's parade has ever come out with a solid single you know that led to a record that maybe was a little you know underwhelming at least in my opinion but at least this new song kind of gives me hope you know it certainly has me excited to hear this new album over here so shout out to the old guard of indie wolf parade over here from delivering a solid single and I didn't mean to say cry cry cry I apologize for that the song is valley boy the album is titled cry cry cry screwed up on that one because I'm a dum-dum and I do these in the raw so there you go new single new track from uncommon NASA featuring Billy woods and cuale Chris the new song is titled written at night and given the title it's not all that surprising that we're hearing a very Spacey a very almost ambient instrumental on this track but of course uncommon NASA comes through with his very the word I'm looking for is very confident you know and almost almost bordering on talking very narration like rap style of the delivery of course Billy woods has a style that is very similar to that not to say that they sound like each other but Billy woods his rap styles are a narrative like as well it's very kind of still it's not super animated and neither is quality so it's kind of interesting to hear these three rappers that have similarly subtle styles all landing over very subtle instrumental and you know it's kind of a unique experience kind of here these three guys you know all of whose are all of whose work I admire quite a bit on one single track a shout out to uncommon NASA for sort of bringing it together making it happen because I do think it's a really good song it has me excited for the new album over here moving out from there grizzly bear neighbors yes pretty much every single single to drop from this forthcoming grizzly bear album has landed in the worst section of these videos because they've been so painfully underwhelming and I just don't know you know what where is I'm just not hearing much of Daniel on these new songs over here and I just feel like his songwriting presence is is is really a pivotal part of what makes grizzly bear grizzly bear and I'm just not hearing it on these tracks but having said that I do feel like this new song over here is one of the most instrumentally and compositionally powerful it actually is the most instrumental in compositionally powerful single of all the batch of singles that have come out so far given that I've heard more songs I was disappointed by then excited by from this forthcoming album I can't say that this track is making me excited now but at least I know that maybe there's hope maybe there's a chance that I'll hear more cuts like neighbors over here really dynamic songs with interesting crescendos and you know more captivating melodies doesn't just feel like a cold fish laying there so flatly and so lifelessly just hoping again for a little more life on this new grizzly bear album and this new single is bringing it make sure you check it out you know but don't don't skip it just because you may have not dug the past singles from this record I do think it is a highlight Emily Haines and the soft skeleton Emily Haines just simply Emily Haines fronting metric emily haines solo project essentially the soft skeleton with you know emily haines and the soft skeleton new song out titled planets very powerful very Spacey and I want to I want to say very dramatic ballad from Emily but that's kind of the songwriting style that she goes for when she's in more of a solo capacity that I enjoy so much I've never been a big metric fan I loved it on her solo stuff she's able to kind of unravel and play things a little bit more subtly and a little bit more theatrically on on this stuff and you know that's really what kind of continues to attract me to it also some of the arrange in the backing instrumentation on the song is gorgeous so don't miss out on a very beautiful tune moving on from there we have a new Adult Swim single over here that I wanted to point out I believe from a track or no not a track from dear Huff yes excuse me dear have your dystopic creation doesn't be are you featuring Aquafina who is a rapper based in the New York area if you haven't heard of her she's very entertaining very eccentric very wild very left-field a lot of personality and a good sense of humor around her too and her teaming up with deer house I've caught her live with beer Hough but I don't know if I've heard them collaborate much which is totally you know fine not saying that I expected or didn't expect that but if there's a song out there previously that they worked on it's not coming to the forefront of my mind but I love hearing them together on this new track over here and I'm actually liking kind of the direction deer hoof is taking their latest tracks in like it seems almost smoother and poppier and catchy or not nearly as abrasive as some as some of their recent stuff and I'm hearing some different sounds and new dynamics and their music that I haven't heard before with this new cleanliness in their production and I'm just kind of hoping that you know they sort of continue to experiment under this newer sound and they just don't turn completely smooth and you know a little bit more commercial and super easy to listen to not that I like difficult music or music that's bad to listen to or anything like that but um you know there is sort of a weird crunchy and naughty character - deer hoofs music typically that I enjoy hearing on their records I don't want to just hear the band try to go mainstream or something like that not that I think that that's going to happen but especially with this new track over here because Aquafina definitely turns the weirdness up to 11 on this track but I don't know what I'm ranting about or worried about it's a good song I had a lot of fun with it so moving on from there I think this is our last cut that I wanted to shout out yes this is a new eight track song believed featuring quavo and little yachty it's very sweet and dancey and summery tune with yadi and quavo coming together with a lot of chemistry on this song and I don't know it's just a fun little kind of trap kind of dance and EDM inspired song that has a lot of personality to it a lot of them I guess with yadi you're always going to have like a lot of character because he is kind of an eccentric and a sort of a weirdo in the rap game still and and he always so comes through with a good feature despite the fact that I saw his latest record was really underwhelming and left a lot to be desired but whatever I digress all right there we go guys that is going to be this segment the weekly track roundup again all those songs along with our amazon associates link our turntable lab link that I showed you earlier and the shirt link are down there in the description check these tracks out hope you're doing well so we got some good recommendations out of this video and thank you for watching thank you for watching I will catch you guys the next one Tyler the Creator video coming out very soon I mean the review of scum fuck flower boy and love you love you love you love you forever blue forever

you're gonna like it I guarantee you're gonna like I guarantee you said that our members like a food career guarantee so I was weird about Channel and we know about the popularity of hip-hop and how hip-hop seems to be everywhere but EDM is like right behind it well we're going to talk about today is whether or not hip-hop medium has passed rock and roll as the cultural zeitgeist like you know what just initially like what are your initial thoughts on just about any diems popularity and where it stands today in today's world hip-hop has definitely gotten popular over the decades just for me personally often sodas and videogames the other day you see it rocking you you know like when they start when eventually the ground or so yeah when when a graphic started getting more advanced I mean I'm not going to like Nintendo stuff that you know how that music sound but like when the graphics started getting advanced and the music that was an area incorporated in there there's always rock music and all of a sudden it started being all hip-hop music I get at this point like you know maybe certainly some video games here and there might have some different type of music but a lot of times ups are seeing the video games first it's like alright Theft Auto yeah a lot of the sports games yes even car games - yeah yeah I'm like a grand jury I'm my man like I'm here hip-hop artists on here and I'm like that's crazy folks just in the late 90s from the mid to late 90s to now I'll just see how hip-hop as like just culture wise has got into video games even at e3 what about EDM because according to reports on Google that that there has been 175 percent rise of EDM music on gaming consoles - everywhere have you noticed that at all or maybe simply not this price the games that I'm playing I'm hearing hip-hop all over their night crazy remember when we did the interview outcomes how was the the video angles work I can't remember the video where that bothers that one hurt granting AutoKey was a part of soundtrack is partly I'll try and they wanted original music and so so it is either taking a step above not we're not just going to take what's hot out here we want you to craft something directly for this particular video game and is this the cityscape that they're creating so I think that that's definitely interesting and for me hell yeah hip hop has overtaken other musical genres as the pop culture leader because hip hop sets the most trends hip hop is what makes certain things cool and I'm not saying that EDM and rock still don't have that type of influence I think all musical genres have influence in the world but the number one by far is hip hop how we just how to talk what we drink what we eat what we're doing like it's 90 percent hip hop III doesn't really think we've overtaken all of the other musical genres I agree with you 100 percent I don't really see it with eating am I think when it comes to being cultural influencers I don't know that EDM really fix anything because how many of them are really influencing culture mmm is just party music and people like to party of course know that in that aspect it fits but when you look at hip-hop as a whole and how it simplified when you were talking about video games I was thinking I was like oh yeah that totally makes sense I was thinking skate videos I remember when I was younger it was all punk rock and some metal and I remember there was a big shift and all the sudden it was all hip-hop and I think that now you're you're totally correct it's like hip-hop controls so many aspects of society at this point it's funny how even just when you talk about vernacular like the way we used to say certain things that's rad value that's not you know now is that so that's Liz you know and when you start seeing those words being used by people who aren't even really within hip-hop culture right you're just an escape it exactly I also say in the news anchors where they're saying that kind of shit when you have WSB and what went around Atlanta that was given the the props to prodigy when you pass yes don't you guys mean right here yes I grab like a chicken mine my name is do that wins like Joe Crocker or he passed away recently and they didn't do that for the bird for a lot of these rock legends you know it's just interesting to me how big hip-hop is Rick you collected it for tribes surrounded by a fight fire blood it was going to fight our system biggie birthday of March 19 year in there Tupac birthday was calling to popularity am i introducing from Stuart Scott right like he brought that to ESPN because if you look at ESPN prior to Stuart enough so so Larry another you know Kenzie high if it was very news like yeah from Assuan Scott chairman Ames IA am happy cooler than the other side of the pillow he started making rhymes with his stuff who made it cool and then I put it to you like this and there was no Stuart Scott ESPN would it be where they are right now because everybody they wanted more urban he did breakfast and everybody now has to incorporate that and if you don't incorporate our vernacular if you don't incorporate hip-hop into who you are the ESPN analyst then you're just you're not going to get higher I'm gonna pass ESPN is it like in though just in and pretty much anything like this is our top show remember anything like that if you're not incorporating some element of urban hip-hop culture I really don't think you're going to make it like remember when rock and love came out like exactly yeah tomorrow that was prep Michael Michael everybody I remember anything like that was their last-ditch effort to keep rock-and-roll heavy metal in the public eye once that failed it was pretty much a rap now every single reality show has some element of hip-hop culture even you're talking about something like Real Housewives of who who the fuck ever there's some element of hip-hop and if they have if they have some kind of lineage to a rock some rock person doesn't seem like anybody cares what was the show they had the family with the guy of it was him since I was born The Osbournes is you know can that was big at one point oh it was yeah you know ii mean i just want to get all gone yeah that's what I'm saying though a lot of people aren't popular anymore right so what the fuck happened hip hop hip hop sabzi came the dominant culture right why would Rock fall off the way that cuz Rock was extremely huge so what happened to the popularity of rock over the years I think that it stops being edgy so it stopped being sexy okay so I think when it comes to these type of situations like the way all of these things become dominant culture is these smaller cultures they find them and they and there's like a like an element of rebellion there that is really attractive so when we were younger they were really attracted to like the metal because it was like these bad boys and they're doing drugs they're fucking all these women you know they got tattoos all that shit then it was you know the punk stuff became really popular because it was rebellious then hip-hop kind of moved in there because they saw an element of edge they saw rebellion in that and with every single one of those at some point those moved into the mainstream because these bigger companies they see this edginess and this rebellion and this whole thing is just really sexy but then something always comes along after it and moves in and says no this is where the edge is this is where the rebellion is it's just with hip-hop it hasn't gone away it's been around for like what 20 some years up and not a slump but then it came right back and that's what's so interesting about how hip-hop has moved into being the dominant culture it just started off where I think a lot of these I want to say rich kids but the more well-to-do people they saw this rebellion they're like I want to be a part of that and that's not seized with all these cultures because it always starts up to you yes and then it kind of just recycles at one point in time we were that you that push hip-hop forward but now we have the little Aussie verts little yachties and stuff like that now we may not like but guess what they're pushing the culture forward whether we like it or not eight with their perspective demographic right so and they have a certain level of age because now that we're the Oh heads we're kind of talking down to them it was this and this that in the third so it's always like a revolving cycle of edginess and it's always being pushed forward if you really think about it hip-hop is still that music that is not accepted by the previous generation like an hour a day when you think about our parents our parents parent when rock and roll is coming around there's like this is a music miss I want to hear this shit this is not Elvis yeah this is not it's not Little Richard I wanna hear that shit at some point that became accepted then you had metal Oh is it music I don't hear this it's not accepted at some point that was a I talk about like death metal I'm talk about like heavy Molly at some point that became accepted even punk rock became mainstream and accepted hip-hop has still not gotten there when you approach your average parent they're still going to say I don't understand this music it's still a kids game it hasn't moved away from that yet all those other genres has moved past that metals move past that rock is move past that ultimate past that hip others hip hop is my deal as long as it is appealing to the youth it's going to be the most dominant culture what about you name them like who keeps on each other's way you're not above it is the Cellini number soft water like this really EDM just took off right you can their numbers to back it like and we've been to hood we went to a concert here where it was pretty much EDM heavy you know and uh atmosphere was going to come play right I think they didn't in the park something happened to go thing yes rain so they do matter and then after that there were more and more video types of concerts popped up so if hip-hop is edgy right and that's the appeal to a lot of the young kids was any absorb drugs and dancing and having good dinner party EDM is it really is it popular here is really popular overseas it's possible here two years I'm here to get lots of medium I'm thinking like like London is more popular there I'm sure okay I don't say I just don't think that there are cultural influences you however I think it's just popular music because you don't ever hear the thing it's like you don't ever see EDM DJs on MTV giving these in-depth interviews right now I'm sure people go I saw DJ scratching sniff on the bus yeah I'm sure there are anomalies but on average you don't see a lot of you die sometimes feel like the DJ's are more popular well that's what I was going to say like like so is EDM just focuses on a DJ because there's a actual EDM artists 80 artists is the DJ nothing I'm saying so that is that's what it is yeah and they'll just add up a big difference between like somebody that you can really really attach yourself you with lyrics and all that versus just a very hip about pounds or hours - DJ - no of course but then we talk about parties yeah there was always assistance of the artists right and the union was bigger than the artists way back when when regard to happiness we deal right Kenard because because with any of artists typically it's not I mean and I could I listen to a lot of the brushes from what I know of it it seems like they just tend to get people to just sing over these be meet until the EDM DJ could be a DJ mustard or a dr. Dre or somebody like that that we also see the visual I don't know they can break anyone who goes are some of you guys with that level who really really popular dollar like really hope you did a lot but really did not influence culture deadmau5 doesn't influence culture okay yes they're popular I'm just asking I don't know clue that of course they have major followers I'm not saying that away like if we're talking about following yes there's a whole bunch of EDM guys that are as big or bigger than a lot of hip-hop dollar but with words are about influential we're talking about moving a needle one way or the other in terms of what are we going to wear now we're going to go back to baggy jeans are going to go to skinnier jeans are we going to go from Jordan to chucks like I like EDM doesn't move that needle hip hop is moving that needle and hip hop is crazy cuz this started will really will run DMC where my readers like that because really after the kids went Vans now like yeah and I was really like a Kali Linux or everywhere like wow yeah but strictly Cali rock was really that cultural influencer and we we took that away from rock because you hear a whole bunch of hip-hop artists are my rocks on this on that yeah right so yeah that's it so we took that from the rock and then we just fuckin blew it up even more splits in consequence when you really think about it like for a while rock was pop a what it was Madonna yeah it's not anymore anymore because when you look at it people will say oh that's not hip-hop that pop someone like a Kanye sometimes is depending a lot of jump into Drake perfect example make you perfect example Drake that's not hip-hop that pop you don't hear that was rock anymore Nickelback can come out with a new jail and nobody's gonna be like that's not rock that's top nobody's done that but they did back in the day like when certain like when corn I'm I never late Moore's just when corn came out I remember people like oh man this is this is this is Ausmus metal hole ah I remember a lot was like shit ain't fucking melts pop because cuz it was played on the radio I brought got in hold me he's aged yes I like baseball yes I think that the the youth side of rock in general has now just kind of moved into what they think is metal I know that sounds really dismissive but you know they listen to a lot of more aggressive and extreme music that's what's sexy to these type of young people's but you even see hip-hop influence in mmm there before the fuckers are putting out Fonzie getting rapper not even getting rappers before the rabid fans crazy I remember going up um going to high school and there were black people like listening to you know rock and pop in this kind of Isis a million times on the show when I was younger it was not cool to be weird and being weird was a black person listen to something outside of the culture there was a lot easier for a white kid to pass off listening to hip-hop in a one for black go to the end the reason is because if you think of the root rebellion side of rock was pretty much long gone by that point the root rebellion part of hip-hop it is it's diminishing it's going away a little bit but it's not gone hip-hop was born out of that yeah and it's an element of that is still there so it's hard to separate those two things you know you can't really separate black culture from hip-hop you can kind of at this point you can kind of separate well this is not just white boy music anymore you know yeah hundred percent because you know sometimes when I like I'm here to watching this too we grow up and then it's our name and all these people think it's just name dropping right and I'm like oh you know now and I'm just president yes I don't know about that like just once I okay so one guy said like why is it there in many black rock artists this great point why isn't there there when I was I've always said like when I was younger and I know I thought I put videos up Buffett forum and for some reason commenters get upset about this but I always say like I like a lot of white bands but a lot of the ones that were really exciting to me were the black groups I always say like when I was younger and I was listening to certain bands while I enjoyed it I felt weird as fuck because a lot of kids didn't understand there was I what the fuck why look at this white boy shit so when there were black bands I got so fucking excited because it made me feel less weird right so I'm going to found living color you know man when I found fishbone when I found Bad Brains but I found King's X you know what body count came around like these were seminal beds for weird kids like me who just didn't feel comfortable there are feel like there are still not a lot of black rock bands because our numbers are not and that's really what it is our numbers just aren't up means they are no lizard okay and it's coach and those and like especially like but like with metal and stuff like that like yeah there are a lot of black people that like that kind of shit but our numbers aren't up to be running around starting all these bands it's still not accepted with black people for that to happen when we as a culture start being like oh shit I don't know fuck what you listen to oh you like metal cool like punk rock hell yeah when that houses didn't that for the change aren't we coming out of that though okay yeah we lot more over my line my charitable win yes and it's slightly touched on that it's more acceptable but like Mike said until know [Laughter] it has to be fully embraced five black culture in order for that to completely go away yeah and it's not there yet and if you think about it that could be why Rock kind of faded away and it and hip-hop moved in and just took it if you think like if we had embraced rock and roll's and it's black you had embraced rock and roll would things have been a little bit different you know first of all knows I just want to say I'm glad that I have other people to bounce these ideas off of because if I would have just read this question they're like yeah hip-hop the most comical I I will do as much you know like discuss but that's why I like being on the show because it's four and a half guys that always talk shit I was calling to her you buy I got another damn face right now gotta schedule a while it's

TZNCuB2gVVk,I may be a lot of things but an expert in music is not one of them so why do Fanta no invite me Alex from I hear everything onto his channel to talk about the subject of music while he's away well I don't know to be honest but what I do know is that I'm extremely passionate about the way music is used in cinema specifically original scores for movies there are endless examples of fantastic soundtracks from basically anything by Scorsese Tarantino downing boiled of Coen Brothers etc etc but what I want to talk about specifically is stuff like [Music] [Music] by no means can I claim to have any knowledge in music theory I can't explain to you how to write an effective well-paced song with melodies and themes and crescendos or whatever it may be but what I do have is working ears and I do know how this music makes me feel and at the end of the day is that not the point of a film score to make you feel something to convey the raw emotion of the scene with no barrier whatsoever everyone with working ears can understand how magical a swelling orchestrated theme can sound it doesn't matter what language you speak or what age you are music is universal to everyone and honestly it took me a while to figure out just how important a score is to a movie experience because chances are if a film is making you feel any kind of emotion it is thanks to the use of music of course there are exceptions to this but in my mind all the most memorable and affecting moments in a film are accompanied by some kind of music let me show you what I mean everyone knows the theme from ET by John Williams it is such an innocent and pure piece that truly captures the Wonder and childlike excitement the characters experience in the movie but what happens when you take that music away well you get something like this it's awkward cold and most importantly holds no passion or excitement whatsoever my point is there is only so much a director and actors and film crew can convey on their own you absolutely need a composer to bind all the hard work together to make it resonate properly I want you to do something for me pause this video and watch the edited ending scene from et with absolutely no music whatsoever with a video link in the description and then afterwards watch the same scene but this time with only the score meaning there's no dialogue loss on effects that's also in the description after watching both of those if anyone can point to the musically bare one and tell me that it's more effective than the other way around then quite frankly I just won't believe you and sometimes the choice to not use music can actually be just as powerful and have the same effect it's all of our creators having faith in the balancing act to the making of film is an example of this I always go back to my head is the truck chase scene in the dark night for most of the scene is silent in terms of music and this was an artful decision that makes the sequence feel so much more intense as a result before this sequence we've been presented with an array of different types of themes from disturbing Schill music for the joka scenes and loud booming drums that heighten the violence and tension in other scenes but all of a sudden the complete lack of music does wonders for the pacing because like the character of the Joker it makes you feel uneasy it highlights the action it gradually makes you slide your butt off the edge of your seat in pure anticipation because every little noise is heightened with a lack of clutter it was a careful and deliberate decision that works very much in favor for the tone and atmosphere the sequence was trying to invoke in the audience so those are two good examples of how use music and why it's important let's take a quick look an example that sucks the amazing spider-man 2 has one of the worst scores I've ever heard ironic considering how I was just praising how Zimmer's work was used in the Dark Knight but here we have an embarrassing confused mess that in a lot of ways represents the movie itself whereas the Dark Knight is tightly edited well directed well acted and well paced throughout and the music reflects that Zimmer's score in this film lacks consistency in conviction and is outright laughable at times the villain theme for the blue guy electro that really consists of on-the-nose whispering of these lyrics things happening mine destructing agony inside of me my pulse is racing mental torture self destroyer Cantona the paranoia denying the rising the crying I'm dying he lied to me he shot at me he hates on me clearly fitting and if that wasn't enough obnoxious dubstep sounding noise seeps its way into the theme if this doesn't seem that bad to you go and listen to it so a light motif is when you compose a theme that is associated with a particular person idea or situation people like john williams and howard shaw are excellent and well versed with this as evidenced by their equally excellent track records incorporating those lyrics like i just read to you into a theme is not only laughably unsubtle but contradicts the entire point of what a score should do the score should use music to convey a certain emotion tone or atmosphere without having to literally scream at you your character is angry or upset well-written music should be able to convey everything you need to know about what's going on without stupid garbage like this I'm going to leave you with a clip of Peter Jackson director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy which has one of the best scores of all time in my opinion someone who like me has very little understanding of the technicalities of how music is composed explaining why music is so important to film specifically the music score on any film is obviously vitally important because it totally guides your emotions when you're watching the film I mean the actors can do their job the director can do their job in terms of creating a certain amount of mood and emotion but obviously music is like so strong and evoking what you should be feeling at any given time did in listening to some of the best film scores I've put together a list of some of my absolute favorites that will be in the description so if you're interested please feel free to join the club of nerds who love film scores like myself thank you so much for watching I don't usually get to make content like this so this was fun for me I hope it was enjoyable in some form for you thanks to Anthony for inviting me on to his channel while he's away make sure you subscribe to this

LTweat11TdE,[Music] it's here finally here as I promised sorry for the wait but it's here this is my MF DOOM worst to best I'm going to be going through the discography of one of the most creative and enigmatic voices and hip hop's underground and ranking his whole discography from worst to best now this can get kind of weird because over the years MF DOOM aka Daniel du Malay has only released a handful of records under the MF DOOM name at least true-blue rap records he's released quite a few instrumental projects under the special herb series he has one album simply under the name doom then he has some other records under a few pseudonyms and some of the guys most legendary projects have been collaborative efforts in this video I'm going to do my best to take it all into account with the exception of candy the rap trio where he essentially got his start which saw a premature demise due to the passing of his brother and getting dropped by their label at the time Elektra Records and this is by no means me telling you not to listen to these candy records please do they're great pieces of music but to me it's such a vastly different moment in Doom's career that I don't really feel all that confident about ranking them amongst these albums nor am I going to include in the ranking projects where Doom has found himself in more of a producer role than a rapper role I'm pretty much starting with when Zev luv X returned in 1999 reinvented and villainous and just kind of calling it from there the rest is history in my opinion dooms weakest record is his latest record at least at the time of me shooting this video this thing features production from Gennaro Durrell who before this album I had not really heard of him but he seemed kind of like a beast Smith once I heard his production on this thing who was really up dooms alley with his penchant for odd grooves and really obscure samples I'm not really saying I love all the instrumentals here anything but if there is one thing about these beats they're not very stylistically consistent the first 5 tracks on this thing feature an eclectic array of sound the song govenor featured these off-kilter kicks and like these tinny strumming samples it sounds more like a dreamscape than a rap beat the song Ryman slang is punchy and punctuated with a fuzzy synth bassline now being experimental and being unpredictable is not necessarily a bad thing especially on a doom album but he just doesn't sound up to the challenge of rapping on these beats like I'm a song banished which is really warped trippy psychedelic features this cycling groove and dooms very fast overbearing flow just feels really awkward and out of place it's a moment where he steps outside of his comfort zone and things just kind of go left but then when he's resting on a more trademark flow like I'm a song boring convo there's a severe lack of quotables and intensity and passion and character in his delivery it's like watching a seasoned gymnast who's been completely out of practice for a decade and on a steady diet of quarter pounders just try to get up and do like a classic a usual routine and overall in this record there's just too little doom presence with at least a handful of tracks on here that feature little to no doom vocals whatsoever dog-friendly about the shoes still caps Liberians son now this album is not without its highlights though the health conscious and conspiratorial GMO is one of doom sharpest topical tracks in a long time and also Darrell's production fuses really well with dooms flow on winter blues to elicit just a very steady head bobbing groove and retarded friend is probably where do was at his most villainous on the entire record he comes through with this monstrous aggression talking about how he'll eat one rapper a day like a centrum you know it's not a terrible listen it's just inconsistent and doom is clearly released better next in the list it's venomous villain the second album to be released under the victor von name this album dropped in 2004 and arrived in the midst of a very prolific period for doom vaudeville villain dropped in 2003 just months earlier was mad villainy and just around the corner you had the Danger Mouse album you had food so it's kind of easy to see that in the midst of all of these legendary releases that venomous villain over here didn't really get the attention it deserved not only from fans but doom himself not only because there's kind of an overall lack of material on this thing but also the cover makes me think I'm about to listen to a knockoff of the artist who made vaudeville villain also this thing was released on a label that I'm pretty sure is now defunct because now I just see some kind of like domain placeholder web page when I look up the website as far as the music on this thing goes I think its quality but it doesn't really amount to much more than a series of vaudeville villain afterthoughts I think the only thing keeping this album going is that it was recorded during a time when dooms style was just relatively fresh and even here on this somewhat lackluster project his awareness of that is very clear in his voice at this point in dooms career it's almost like he couldn't write a verse that didn't have at least a whiff of genius to it the song rap game still remains one of my favorite doom tracks of all time and if you're looking to learn more about the victor von character you're going to want to look this project up because there's a bit of a spoken-word interlude where doom or Vic can Dove explains the reasoning behind this persona why he needs another persona in a very frank and funny way there isn't a track on this thing that I dislike or that I hate or that I think is total trash it's just that overall the album is really just kind of short and unambitious it loses steam toward the end - it's mostly for hardcore fans but I think even casual listeners will get something out of it as dooms persona his creative lyrical references are both in full effect now King Ghidorah take me to your leader dropped in 2003 not officially a part of the MF DOOM timeline if you can call it that but an essential part of MF goom's evolution post his debut operation doomsday now there are a lot of features on this thing so it's not the most doom centric project there are some tracks where he makes no lyrical appearances at all not to see the album is bad because of that those songs like I wonder in lock jar serious highlights for me on this thing but what places take me to your leader at this point in the list is that it's an essential part of dooms evolution in progress as an artist because on take me to your leader he manages to start honing this huskier darker more villainous sound in his voice his production gets a little more cinematic it's easier it's more colourful it starts to evoke the vibe of like an old monster movie or something or you're listening to the soundtrack of an old-timey superhero movie at the moment where the villain reveals themselves ideas and sounds that didn't sound quite as developed on operation doomsday and while we may be just getting a mere glimpse of them here on this album they still sound great which makes this LP a significant moment in the doom catalog next is the mouse in the mask dooms legendary collaboration with producer Danger Mouse this thing dropped in 2005 and came after an incredibly prolific and artistically amazing period for doom with vaudeville villain and new food and mad villainy all dropping within a year or two prior now I personally do have a bit of a love-hate relationship with this album I loved it more for its context than what it actually is I sort of see the mouse in the mask as a bit of a victory lap for doom he had just dropped all of these dents incredible amazing creative records and now he's doing something that's just a little bit more lighthearted and promotional and comedic in affiliation with Adult Swim doom and Danger Mouse got together for a series of cartoony rap tracks centered around all this late night animated cartoon net programming occasionally rapping directly about characters or scenarios and shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force Sealab 2021 Space Ghost Coast to Coast Harvey Birdman attorney at law at the time it was really exciting personally for me as an underground rap fan as a huge Adult Swim fan it was just so weird to have these two worlds colliding here because both of them were just in a Golden Age of creativity and linking up brought both of them a lot of attention and legitimacy especially doom whose hype on this thing was only amplified by the inclusion of Danger Mouse who at the time was one of the industry's most in-demand producers not only because at this point he had proven his salt with some excellent tracks on guerrillas demon days album but also because he was kind of a renegade in the industry at the time because of the heat and the attention he caught off of his grey album mashup record where he pulled together Beatles instrumentals with acapellas from jay-z's black album still though I think a lot of the production on this thing is really fresh it's really diverse it brings the cartoony sound and vibe that you would want on a record like this while still staying true to some very jazzy and gritty hip hop production fundamentals especially on the mask and old-school rules my one issue with this project though is that it is super heavy-handed with the adults when the sketches to the point where it's really disruptive borderline annoying and this is coming from someone who was a fan of this programming back in the day even though I owned most of these shows on DVD I feel like engraving them so deeply into this album's DNA just kind of makes it feel a little dated in retrospect and if you don't believe me give it five more years please I think some of the integrations are really creative and fun but a lot of them just wear thin for me as I get older still though I do think Doom is in rare form on this album he continues to bring the playful frisky lyricism that made food so great I mean on the opening lines of the song sofa King he talks about eating a rapper spitting out his chain and then immediately after makes a super-deep Shakespeare reference with the beast with two backs line you know there are a lot of good things about this album that in my opinion make it one of Doom's most accessible releases easygoing flows articulate delivery lots of fun dirty references it really serves as a great introduction for anybody looking to dip their toes into alternative into abstract into some modern underground hip-hop it's odd and it's off the beaten path but without sounding stuffy and alienating and too cool for your average person to listen to undeniably fun great project operation doomsday 1999 doomsday Buell fans continually ranked it as one of his best best best I slightly disagree though there are a lot of highlights on this thing and this album ranks relatively high on this list because of the historical significance in Dunes discography it's so crazy to think of this thing coming out in 1999 I was just breaking into high school and from what I remember of the most popular hip hop around the time like we had DMX mmm Biggie and puck were still getting tons of play like dr. Dre ODB Beastie Boys lot of jay-z all of which were a far far far fetched from the rap underground that doom seemed to be emerging from at the time for some reason operation doomsday had a super rough amateurish sound and performance quality to it even though doom was already a seasoned emcee from his years in candy it's like in this characteristic reinvention he was kind of starting all over again and that's because in a way he kind of is with this total top-down renovation of his performance style his persona and anybody who is familiar with the output that came before operation doomsday and after operation doomsday can tell that dooms evolution is transitioned into this new character this new persona is not yet complete on this album there are only a handful of songs amongst the 19 tracks here where doom sounds even halfway his villainous as he would in five years down the road his eclectic lyrical style his trademark flow and his very husky rasp do show up occasionally but in a very diminished capacity not to completely discount operation doomsday though because this thing is loaded with very interesting very smart jazz rap tracks what Doom does not have in terms of grit on this album he makes up for in some very youthful spunk a lot of relentless flows good production solid features it's still a very solid very good project especially the remastered version if you can get your hands on it and in my opinion a must listen for any doom fan 2003 vaudeville villain Victor Vaughan the first album doom released under the victor von name and released just months after take me to your leader in this very short span of time from what I can tell Doom seems to improve his talents by leaps and bounds both in terms of vocal delivery of lyrical ability from the get-go on this thing doom is showing an impressive amount of skill and aggression I mean the title track here is probably one of the hardest openers of any Doom project yet and while vaudeville villain is not one of the darkest and most villainous albums and Dean's discography it is one of the longest most consistent and most lyrically satisfying and if there's anything else that separates this album from the rest of Doom's catalog it's that there's still kind of like a youthful hunger of fire in his belly that I still hear at this point in his career that isn't quite as intense on any other album at least not while he's showcasing this level of skill there's just an intensity to so many of the flows on this project so many relentlessly dense verses on this thing which is why in my opinion vaudeville villain truly is like the hip hop heads doom record because here it's just no bells and whistles it's all killer it's no filler doom isn't quite emphasizing his character his sense of humor all of the weird bells and whistles gimmicks that he would later emphasize a bit more on subsequent projects some of which I think add a lot of character and drama and personality to dooms albums but again if you're looking for just a hard gritty straightforward no BS doom album which again is part of what makes this record so great so entertaining so freakin flawless then please do not miss out on this it's excellent born like this released in 2009 dooms project where he drops the MF for some reason one of his late era projects some of you might be wondering why it's landed so high on this list but in this humble music reviewers opinion this thing is consistently underrated even almost ten years down the road unfortunately time has not really increased this albums profile in the eyes of most fans which kind of leaves me confused because given that dooms persona is a villainous one this album is everything that a villain truly should be this is easily dooms darkest and most apocalyptic album the man's sense of humor is still intact but it's nowhere near as cartoony and as light-hearted as previous releases and you know I think there's something to be said about him simply wanting to be referred to as doom on this project because he sounds particularly monstrous on tracks like gazillionaire his voice sounds noticeably deeper it's like he's almost swallowing the microphone on this track and when doom is playing a joke and getting hilarious he's just super vulgar about it like I'm ball skin and you cannot deny that the song with Raekwon on this thing is one of the grittiest cuts and dooms entire discography and he gets even darker on tracks like cells and supervillains and there are a lot of vividly violent moments on this album too that range from grim like on the song absolutely to kind of animated like on rap ambush there are some tracks on this thing that I think are a little rough around the edges like the song angels with Tony Stark's but I think in the end they work too the album's filth coded benefit this is also the case for microwave mayo or the song that's that which features one of the craziest flows of any doom song of all time also this hilarious like moment where he's singing his brains out toward the end of the track still stands out after all these years is one of my favorite moments on any doom album and at this moment on the track he kind of acknowledges his shadowy kind of character his penchant for appearing and then disappearing I wouldn't say it's a perfect perfect album I do think the very homophobic batty boys looks uglier as every year draws on but the album is so potently dark I just have a real addiction to it I think the J Dilla production adds a lot to this project too especially on light works I just love love love this album for its wicked it's shady style and I just crossed my fingers here in hope that it grows on doom fans more and more as the years go on blue food dropped in 2004 out of all of the albums released under the MF DOOM name moon food is easily dooms tightest and most consistent and most somatic album experience it's an incredibly creative beginning to end series of food obsessed rap songs Network and all these double entendre is all this symbolism and a fantastic sense of humor and all the production on this thing with a few exceptions is provided by the metal fingered villain himself this thing is just back-to-back creative eccentric beats loads of colorful obscure samples but maybe the most impressive thing about food is just at how many angles he's able to approach the whole food theme whether it be on pot holders where essentially the refrain hot and sort of holding hot is enough to sort of make that connection or the meditation on friendship with deep-fried friends which is actually one of the most thoughtful and in a way emotionally moving songs doom has ever penned beef wrap I mean kind of obvious there you get it the song vomits potentialy is just doom delivering endless bars upon endless bars and on the song cookies I mean you're getting all of these awesome hilarious deep cookie references and doom explores these themes not just lyrically but instrumentally too with just not only some of the sample that turn up in the beats but with a weird sort of like little instrumental like four-part interlude that happens in the middle of the record and there are moments on this album that run deeper than the food theme itself like on the song con carne which is essentially a tribute to his brother great album one of his easiest to get into as well and I think the sort of food theme of the record makes it like a really Universal enjoyable piece of music - super well produced super well put together super well recorded performed I really just wish it was longer number one mad villainy mad villain you probably saw this coming and that's totally understandable I mean this album being number one is is obvious because it's just so freakin gray Dunes legendary collaborative record with the man the myth mister Madlib what can I say here that I haven't said already in my full-length review of this album that we will link you to at the end of this video not much it's just it's just great it's just so amazing it's so amazing after all these years you know it's just really doom and Madlib both in rare form both at peaks of creativity in their respective careers not only is doom assembling these incredibly intricate and dense and hilarious and vivid verses that sound like they're just coming from another world like this entire world is entire like a place that he's just invented entirely in his head where only the logic of his bar sort of makes sense but you know they sort of make sense to someone who's not in that world in his head but it really makes you want to be in that world it's so enticing it's so descriptive it's so intriguing but also mad lids beats on this thing oh my god oh my god this production is insane you know not only is it fantastic track for track for track but I'm just blown away at the sonic palette the diversity of this album I mean tracks like accordion and meat-grinder and curls like to imagine that these just these three beats are all coming from the same musical mind is insanity and not only that but you know sort of the weird linear motif like structuring of a lot of these tracks is just like really weird really unexpected very unorthodox but somehow it all works because the album hits you with so much quality material so many tracks on tracks on tracks on tracks this thing is so abstract it's loose its shadowy it's beautiful its inventive I'm just I'm just talking and ranting about it and it just really makes me want to listen to it so I think I'm I think I'm going to go try to make an effort to do that right now because I just rather be listening to this album than talking about it all right you know what's number one I know it's number one you know why I know why I'm not going to you about it anymore that's the list hope you guys enjoyed it and I will catch you guys hopefully in the next best to worst worst to best list video that I I don't want it to take too long to do but no promises no promises I'm very bad at doing these in a timely fashion transition what did you think this list did you love it did you hate it did you expect it did you predict it did

of the week awesome awesome that was smooth it was a nice smooth transition I also should mention that while I'm gone this week programming is going to be changing up a little bit we do have that doom

few reviews hopefully at the tail end of the week for you guys as well so a slight programming change up but you're going to enjoy what's coming out this week alright let's get into the worst tracks let's get into the worst the worst tracks without a doubt without questioning worst tracks of the week ooh we got to start off with Lana Del Rey with the song summer bummer featuring ASAP rocky and playboy cardi the song is terrible God like the the Spacey flavorless trap beat I can't tell if it's rocky or cardi sort of in the background providing like this really bad like you know there's really bad like a bit of bit of background vocal that is not in tune with the rest of the instrumental and the rest of the track it just sounds really bad you know a lot of hook on the track is actually not that bad if this were like an ASAP rocky song and Lana did the hook I would come in here and say hey you know at least the hook didn't suck you know because Lana's vocals there and the melody there it's actually pretty solid but I don't see what Lana is really getting out of coming out with this more like Spacey cloudy trap inspired music because really I feel like she's kind of already built an aesthetic she's built style that has a lot more musical potential and class than what she's doing here on this track over here just kind of seems like she's painting yourself to do a bit of a corner over here because this year you know rap and trap music specifically is very much the zeitgeist Rockies performance is okay but you know really the song comes together in a really ugly awful subpar way and again one of the worst tracks of the week moving on from there got to unfortunately give it to Ke$ha for the song woman not only are Kesha's vocals on this thing annoying like her singing is really subpar on this track and really kind of like yell P and annoying but I feel like the whole topic and theme of the song I feel like womanhood and sexuality and gender are amazing things to explore in song and I feel like there's a lot of potential there I feel like there's a lot of gold potential to be dug out of that but what Kesha does on this track is simply pandering and that's it she doesn't explore anything she doesn't reveal anything she doesn't enlighten anybody to anything it's just straight gross pappi pandering and that's all it's just straight pandering and there's really no other explanation for what she's doing on this song it's just pandering that's supposed to be coming off as empowering but it's not it's just pandering and we're going to leave it at that moving on from there we have this new track from chance the rapper featuring young thug which is hot garbaggio bad recording bad vocal performances and hilariously this track is supposed to be saving the SoundCloud platform young thug can't even move like more than 40,000 units of a record he comes out with how is a feature on a chance the rapper sawing excuse me song going to save the entire SoundCloud platform you know correct me if I'm wrong there about young thug's numbers there but as far as I've seen like you know a lot of projects he comes out with they don't do a lot of numbers in terms of sales or in raw streaming as well so you know how is this song gonna save SoundCloud how's it going to save SoundCloud the problem with SoundCloud is they don't want to make money you can put a song on there with 20 million streams on it if they don't make any money off of it what's the point it's not saving the platform so you know it's a terrible song that is sending in a terrible idea moving on from there Arcade Fire a electric-blue huh easily the worst single they've dropped so far like you know I want to save more positive things about the song than I want to you're yeah then I want to because I have to be obviously myself I think it's subpar I think it's mediocre I want to say nice things because you know a Regine is singing on the song and it seems like you know the track was well-intentioned but this is one of the worst dance beats on the entire record her vocal performance is mediocre the entire time I hear her singing she's just singing this really nasally super high falsetto that is a total mess I could barely make out what she's saying half the time it just [Music] looked like a little bit of reverb thrown on it the entire time sitting there listening the song thinking what what what what are you saying just enunciate for the love of Christ yes it's it's easily the worst single Arcade Fire has dropped from this forthcoming album not expecting good things because every single us so far I thought has been bad corny mediocre I don't know why they're forcing themselves into this dance music direction it's not that good of a look all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought I should shout out but I was just maybe a little underwhelmed by or I thought you know we're definitely worth highlighting kind of met but maybe you guys will dig in more than me Selena Gomez fetish featuring gucci mane selena gomez effectively on this new song over here trying to transition which she had another single out recently as well but she's attempting to transition into making more adult pop music she's not just simply you know writing teen or tween pop music anymore she's trying to write stuff that's a little sexier a little more risque a little more suggestive and um I don't think this attempt at doing that is all that bad it's a somewhat boring Spacey trap percussion backed ballad the Gucci Mane feature is OK the hook is OK it might do well on you know like an iTunes playlist it might do well in you know the club or something like that but you know it's it's it's not that special her vocals are not that unique to me the instrumental is not that unique to me you could catch a Gucci verse almost anywhere the song topic is ok you know I like the idea of someone's love being someone's fetish you know seems like a kind of decent song theme but I wouldn't say it's that special you know it's listenable it's listenable but I'm yet to hear anything that's blowing me away here Nine Inch Nails new track over here less than forthcoming EP of Trent Reznor is going to be dropping very soon unfortunately this is not as exciting or as gritty as what Trent was releasing on that EP that um you know I reviewed not too long ago earlier this year this is a more synthetic more flat more clean less tortured sort of Nine Inch Nails which we've been hearing for years now it's ok Trent Reznor's vocals are fine but really for me it comes down to the songwriting on this thing which to me just kind of sounds like some wishy washy middle-of-the-road 90s alternative rock that you know has a very radio-friendly hook on it there's not really anything all that special about the songwriting in my opinion you know I do like some of the synth patches on this thing you know some of the synth tones are pretty cool there's definitely a groove to what Trent is doing on this track as well but it's not really him at his best when it comes to songwriting but you know surely check it out don't miss it if you're a Nine Inch Nails fan moving out from their Mets have a new song out titled cellophane Mets the noise rock band that's on Sub Pop Records right now previously I've been kind of underwhelmed by their stuff felt that their riff writing was kind of subpar kind of basic kind of primitive especially their that III also felt the same way about their vocals too but this new song over here while it is still very much steeped in a sort of 90s post-hardcore noise Rock nostalgia I do think the songwriting has matured by leaps and bounds the vocals are way more melodic and harmonious the riffs and the guitars are more dynamic this has me kind of excited to see what Mets are going to do on this forthcoming album because it seems like they're really trying to grow and do something different they're not simply trying to write the same like ugh ugh like you know caveman riffs that you know and not in a good way that I've heard on their previous material so give this a shot giving us a check out seems like the band again are trying to grow trying to mature here and you know if you're in those Rock you're probably gonna get something out of this Lana Del Rey this new song over here also featuring ASAP Rocky groupie love this is like bat leaps and bounds better than that summer bummer cut with playboy cardi and ASAP Rocky on it ASAP Rocky's performance is fine Lana's performance is great I like the tune of the song a lot but the thing is a lot like that track where she was singing about Coachella not every single song you do needs a frickin trap beat in the background in fact I would say that that sound is more of a hindrance to Lana's style than it is helping her her breathy vocals the nostalgic instrumentation the very cloudy windy breezy intoxicating and gauzy sort of way that her vocals kind of layer on top of each other and sort of melts into the instrumentation and then you have these very sharp kind of punctuated very almost out of place you know sharp 808 sort of just like bustling away underneath it just doesn't sound like a match you know it just sounds really again kind of out of place and that's the one thing working against the song I think everything else about the track is great you know it just really could have been better I've heard better percussion on Lana's tracks in the past I just don't get what is driving her in this direction you know with these incredibly mediocre like very skeletal track beats they don't really do her much musical favors much in the way of a musical favor on this track really nor any other artist I think you know because again the production seems kind of as far as the beats pretty plain you know at least you're going to go in this direction bring a little bit more detail to the table please because this is just like you know the definition of underwriting in instrumental nomadic higher brothers featuring Joe G on the hook jouji George you know him as a filthy Frank on YouTube on the hook on this thing it would no emetic like it's it's not a bad hook it's not a bad hook and I don't know just got to give a shout out to a 88 rising and the higher brothers on this one because it's a kind of fun video it's kind of fun song some of the lyrics that I was reading in the subtitles on this thing are pretty fun as well obviously you know this is some hip hop music from the Far East open up your freaking I want to say I guess your tastes here give this a shot because I think there are a lot of cool things about this song it's a kind of fun single and let's move on to the best tracks let's move on to the best tracks remember you know these songs and all the songs have been talking about they're all linked down there in the description as usual you guys know the business by now alright let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best this week with Zola Jesus kicking it off with the new song soaked incredibly slow powerful dense heavy ballad from Zola Jesus on this one I am so excited for this new Zola Jesus record I've never been a huge Zola Jesus fan but the instrumentation she's been bringing on these new tracks over here is just so thick it's so thick okay and it's heavy it's passionate it's powerful and you know while I have like her vocals in the past I just felt like she could have used a little bit more sonic support on her past stuff and it seems like with you know this new material she's definitely getting that you know because these songs are heavy they're hard-hitting they're dense and I'm loving it you know and even though the song moves very slow because that's sonic density again it has power has gore its mountainous and make sure that you don't miss it vic mensa with Pharrell Williams and Saul Williams on the new song wings to be completely honest I had listen to this song a lot I've listened to it as many times I have other songs here simply because what Vic does on this track at least from my initial reaction here lyrically and vocally it's really powerful it's super intense at the time that I was listening it was kind of late and I was like okay this is just like it's like blowing away a little bit it was like a little bit too emotionally potent right now I wasn't fully in the mood to take it all in what Vic is saying on this track at first I was like okay it's something he's going a little overboard but then as the song drew on and he grew more and more intense in the subject matter what he was rapping about here just got more and more grim you know became like a serious like you know like a bit of an eye widening moment for me as I was listening to this which I have not had very many of those when listening to Vic Mensa's music so it seems like you know on this new cut over here and hopefully this forthcoming record he's really kind of cutting the he's getting down to brass tacks and you know he's hitting upon some serious topics because it seemed like he's always kind of referenced that direction the potential for him to do that has always been there but he's never sort of made that full step and it seems like on this new track over here he's just doing a cannonball into that you know and in a big way too so don't miss this song seems like a very powerful song for my initial impressions here and definitely wanted to endorse it because it seems like a special moment for Vic Tyler the Creator boredom you track over here promoting his forthcoming record scum  flower boy and this is a slow jam over here it's not as hard-hitting as who dabble what a blah you know this is a slow jam but this is one of the most harmonious and beautiful slow jams I have heard come from Tyler in the past I felt his slower tracks have always been kind of awkward the sense come together and just like a really hideous way if they're singing vocals maybe they're kind of off as well but this is just like one of the more refined more ballad inspired songs that I've ever heard and put together and his rap verses or rap verse on the song is not really all that bad either liking lyrics liking the smoother more melodic production here liking the mood of the track and again this is another mode my mouth is watering I have not been I've not ever gone into a Tyler the Creator album having like so many tracks and being this excited so I don't know what else to say other than again I'm looking forward to it this track sounds great to my ears sound like Tyler is you know not only with who that boy coming through with solid bangers on the flip side of there with mr. lonely and you know this track over here boredom you know you're getting a dynamic display of Tyler's emotional range here just with this handful of tracks and I'm really excited to see that play out play out across an entire record so you know really liking this track as well check it out if you haven't already you most likely have but alright the cool kids new song check out cool kids really came through on this new single I've been kind of worried and kind of questioning whether or not the cool kids are really going to deliver anything of note in this decade it's taken them a while sort of seemed like you know there was a little bit of separation there for a while and that you know the duo's demise was maybe around the corner but with this new minimal track with some excellent and creative and colorful sampling throughout is really awesome and what to me made the cool kids exciting in the first place so you know if cool kids if you're listening please keep it up you know this sort of creative production these funds smooth head-bobbing flows the clever lyricism you know the the playful sort of attitude but also you know that that like hint that dollop of grime enos and darkness you know that's so awesome that is amazing that is sort of a vibe and a sound that you guys pull off better than anybody else and you know I'm loved hearing it in full display on this new track over here I want to hear more of it moving forward and you know hopefully you know it turns on other people as well because I've always thought the cool kids they never really got the career that they could have had they never really got the career that they fully deserved and you know hopefully with material like this they finally get there ooh proto martyr new proto martyr post-punk out for proto martyr who I've been pretty um I guess the word I want to say is I'm receptive toward and you know praised nicely in the past you know especially on their last record have a new song out which is one of the most powerful and depressing songs to date in my opinion this new track called the private understanding it's very slow it's very patient and it has an amazing ending with a powerfully depressing refrain that sort of finishes the track out a mantra if you will you know all the post-punk fans all of those out there who like their their rock music really moody and really you know sort of in the darkness shadowy and give this thing a shot powerful deep lead vocals some sort of eerie guitars on this thing too and the music video is kind of strange as well so give it a shot don't miss it the OCS have a new track out from their forthcoming project the title of this song over here is animated violence and this is some grade a prime heavy psych on this track like the riffs are huge there are some amazing guitar leads that are sort of popping in between those those riff passages that are hard-hitting and powerful really excited about the dynamics of this new track and that the OCS have been displaying on their most recent material and you know really excited to sort of hear the viscera and the power and the energy that they're bringing on a you know traction was forthcoming record as well a really good song excited Oh Caesar sounding you know really great here and in my opinion putting out some of the best material of their entire career although I may have said the OCS recently are just now rather I think I meant o'seas because I think they just dropped the e so I think the band is now just simply known as overseas so I apologize for that moving on from there we have a new song from Mount Kim be featuring freaking King cool which I've never been a huge amount kimby guy but every once in a while they do drop a track that's really good with a great vocal feature from a guest and this is certainly one of them throttling and visceral groove on this one kink rules vocal performance is fantastic don't miss it I want to give a shout out to the new Ariel pink single which I don't want to say too much about because I am excited for the new Ariel pink album eriell pink in my in my opinion continues to be a pop music genius this new song over here and I want to get a shout out to Andrew savage of teenage cool kids and parquet courts Fame who has a new single and a new solo record dropping very soon this new song over here is titled Andrew savage Andrew savage winter in the south and there was something about this song about his vocal melody and his sort of vocal flow if you will on the song it kind of reminded me a little bit of they might be giants maybe they're an influence I wouldn't be that surprised but they're you know some of the lyrics on this thing are kind of quirky but there's really a folky kind of edge to his songwriting here as well seems like there's a lot of musical influences kind of at a crossroads on this track and maybe on this forthcoming record too that a that I haven't quite heard mixed in the way that he is mixing them on this song which you know has me kind of excited so you know make sure that the song doesn't slip by you and that is going to be that those were the best and worst tracks of the week in our weekly track roundup remember down there hit up that shirt link it may take a little while because I'm going to be away for a bit but once I get back I'm gonna be sending out more shirts ASAP so we have shirts we got that turntable link the Amazon link and the good people over a seat

4xoLimmZOtQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a new student peace react to a horrible culture writing mostly in regards to music on the Internet in this installment of stink peace I'm reacting to one of the many think pieces and click beta articles that have been released over the past several days about Tyler the creator of Odd Future Fame rapper producer fashion icon you know who he is but in a handful of song serv bars on his upcoming record scum flower boy and admittedly I have not heard any of the album yet because I'm not trying to spoil the frickin album for myself with the leaked thank you very much however I have been reading the lyrics in question on genius and there has been a massive discussion over the fact that Tyler essentially comes out of the closet on this album I mean here are some lyrics it's it's pretty unquestionable it's pretty plain as day and the music media's obsession over this revelation has been disgusting I thought we were over an age where like Tyler the Creator clickbait was a thing I thought we were just kind of done with it but nope it's it's back it's very much a thing and my god like they just can't stop now I've caught a lot of pieces about this that are really tasteless are really stupid are obviously just like short little bits of blur be clickbait just to get people just on to the webpage just to get that you know that little bit of that little bit of click revenue but the worst piece that I that I read about this the worst think piece which was posted so soon after sort of this news broke so I I doubt our writer even really had that much time to think about what they said in this article on the website heist 'nobody which really does live up to its name how do we reckon with Tyler the Creator as part of queer culture which seems like a kind of nice way to put it but when you actually look for the article on a Google search you get the original title of the article which is how do we deal with Tyler the Creator as a part of queer culture let me give the short answer that you just shut up you live your life you let tyler do whatever the hell he wants because who he sleeps with is none of your business it doesn't affect you as much as you would like to dramatically posture eyes in an overinflated article that it does so the article starts with our writer setting the stage talking about excitement for the album the fact that it leaked then getting into referencing some of the lines in this album that have people thinking that Tyler is coming out of the closet on this one but then the article starts to veer left with our writer very clearly having a difficult time dealing with the fact that Tyler isn't straight but as juicy as this narrative may be for the pop culture blogosphere lest we forget this is Tyler the Creator we are dealing with this is a man who puts capital T in trolling a man who created three seasons of a jackass s comedy show for Adult Swim and a man who has made it abundantly clear in his lyrical content that his word should not be taken at face value sure maybe Tyler has trolled a lot of people over the years with his social media with his music he's obviously poked at a lot of artists who don't like him a lot of music journalists who don't like him but there's actually quite a bit of sincerity in his music about his personal life and his personal views on the world I mean I'm not even a Tyler the Creator fan and I can very easily tell when he's being serious and when he's not so why our writer here would even theorize that what Tyler is saying here is just him like bullshitting you it's just him lying to you I don't know maybe because our writer would just like for it not to be true at all but also I don't get this insinuation attached to the loiter squad show on Adult Swim like people who are LGBTQ or just like this mental monolith and no way could they be involved in such a show we are not here to hunt for evidence proving Tyler as this sexuality or that sexuality nor are we here to give him a label sure but you certainly will question what he has put out there as his sexuality and try to deal Aegina my's what he said if Tyler the Creator is well and truly coming out of the closet it would make him among the most problematic controversial and downright subversive figures in queer culture today is a pretty bold statement to make considering that we just had Milo you nopales touring around the country beating the drum for Trump you're just putting Tyler at the top of this problematic pile because you said a bunch of that offended you our writer here then goes on to quote some of Tyler's early work on like bastard and Goblin where obviously the dude was an edgy teenager and not that I'm trying to give Tyler's behavior or writing here a pass I myself have been critical of it in my reviews of some of those releases but the cognitive dissonance that a writer is suffering from in this article is just mind-boggling he just cannot come to terms with like how can somebody who's just come out of the closet and said these things he's just so problematic it's like Tyler's whole artistic direction and message and vision is just lost on him like just look at the title of his upcoming record scum flower boy our writer saw fit to highlight the fact that the the phrase flower boy is in the record that phrase is Tyler self referencing his own sexuality yes but the words scum are also in the title he's clearly creating a contrast and a juxtaposition there with those two visuals he's essentially admitting that he is a conundrum but nevertheless like it's a conundrum that exists it's real it be and there's no amount of whining or moaning or clickbait ting that could make it less real or legitimate our writer then goes on to tell us how many times Tyler used the homophobic slur or on his album goblin-like 200 times not that I really needed to know which again I don't understand now that Tyler has essentially come out of the closet doesn't it kind of put his usage of that word in a slightly different context and yet for all the utterly horrid epithets Tyler hurls he continually managed to show support for a community he simultaneously belittles yeah our writer is really yet to bring up an instance where Tyler actively seeks to belittle the LGBTQ community like yes he has said some edgy things that offended you that are not nice it's not polite conversation it's going to hurt feelings it's going to get people clutching their pearls which a writer was doing so hard in this article I'm surprised he can get his hands down on the keyboard to type this thing must have been like a voice dictation app he was using our writer seems blissfully unaware of just how ridiculous it is to be overanalyzing Tyler sexuality that Tyler statement in this Larry King interview that is embedded in this very article seems to just go woosh woosh woosh Larry King essentially asks Tyler out right what do you think about the possibility of there being an openly gay rapper in the mainstream in the future and Tyler hits Larry King with why does it matter why do we care which honestly is an excellent question I know Tyler doesn't go into the philosophy of that question but he's obviously asking that question because why should the fact that he is bisexual dictate his behavior dictate the art that he makes dictate his public persona dictate what other people think about him dictate whether or not people are writing stupid articles about him Tyler first and foremost has always been an individual he's always been a lone wolf he's always been somebody who has carved out his own path which is what makes the whole premise of this article so confusing to me talking about dealing with Tyler as a part of queer culture like I don't know if he really wants to be a part of queer culture I think he just kind of wants to be a part of his own thing he just wants to be himself for whatever reason this is not painfully obvious to our writer who is more concerned with enlisting him into the LGBTQ ranks like it was some kind of military or standing army which how is this not a destructive attitude how is this not added pressure to people who would like to come out of the closet and just live normal healthy constructive lives because yes not only are people who want to come out of the closet dealing with the potential backlash of people who wouldn't be open to their sexuality who may be homophobic transphobic what-have-you but also you're dealing with people like our writer here who are also putting additional pressure onto these people who are in the closet because not only do you have to live with the fear of people potentially hating you because of your sexuality but you also have to live with the fear that you're not living up to the standards of people in the community like our writer who are sort of judging judging judging you have to act like this you can't say that you have to have this opinion you can't be acting like this and I think that's what makes this struggle so difficult for our writer here because Tyler clearly doesn't want any part of this he wants to be himself he wants to be doing his own thing and now we have arrived at our current position one where a suggestively titled album called the flower boy implies an honest open admission of a sexuality heretofore treated as a joke in his artistic / there's a very real chance that this could all be some ploy or gimmick with an aftertaste of severe queerbaiting which if so would render Tyler's levels of good taste and human decency at an all-time low and God would this guy love for that to be the case you would love for that to be the case you would love for Tyler to just be a JK man is just a prank bro it's just a prank when honestly it's kind of disingenuous to act like Tyler has just never been open he's never been Frank he's never been honest about himself he has a track record of doing so yes he's a troll yes he's a jokester but honestly at this point we really have no reason not to believe him and you can really hear just like the gulp the gulp and the writer's throat but for his sake we must take his confessional as it stands because that's so hard that's so hard for you Tyler's entire fanbase in persona are built from a place of willful misunderstanding of the queer community and attempting to bridge such opposing viewpoints is a commendably brave endeavor I get that our writer is trying to give Tyler props here for coming out in a culture in a genre and a community that is necessarily accepting of people who aren't straight however to act like his entire fan base and persona are built off of a willful misunderstanding of the queer community I mean Jesus Christ like that's what it's all built off of that's the foundation of it please without Tyler you wouldn't have odd future without Odd Future you wouldn't even have Frank Ocean come on and neat I mentioned Sid the Kid Sid the Kid anti queer is not the odd future brand nor is it the Tyler the Creator brand on the other hand what kind of message does that send to our questioning queer youth that a role model can emerge from a man who will trash tarnish and humiliate theirs and other oppressed communities and service of a joke I mean I think the message that it sends is that each person is an individual and you know doesn't really matter if they're straight if they're homosexual or what-have-you like you can be on either side of that fence and make bad decisions and say offensive things and hurt feelings and be a shitty person and honestly I feel like you're putting a little bit too much emphasis on jokes here if jokes are the most damning evidence you're bringing to the table in this trial I got to tell you there's not a jury in the world that would put Tyler to death if Tyler was such a hindrance to the queer community that he was actually setting it back our writer would have cited at least several examples of the happening in this article but he doesn't because he can and honestly I feel like our writer just spends too much time trying to paint Tyler's actions as some kind of like major public setback to the LGBTQ community when in fact I mean all he's ever done is just be an obnoxious asshole who honestly would not be at the level of popularity that he is today had the music journalism community just not fed the beast so hard and fed into the controversy so hard because they needed that clickbait they had to get that clickbait so if all of these writers think Tyler's truly a monster you're only dealing with a beast that you created so I mean have fun personally um you know if Tyler is coming out of the closet on this one I'm pretty proud of him you know good for him good on him I'm excited to listen to scum flower boy you know the singles from the record have been really good so I'm really excited to hear what he does artistically around the corner but I'm also excited to see him you know now that he has come out of the closet continue to just be himself don't give in to this pressure - okay now that you've come out of the closet you've got to say this you've got to think this you've got to be this I want to see Tyler continue to just do him and be him without worrying about or giving a about what other people think about what he should be because he's just come out of the closet now however I don't think I have to worry too much about that but alright what did you

ymkvtN3aVkk,hey everyone anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for a review of the new Billy woods album known unknowns now Billy woods if you aren't aware is one of the most shadowy elusive and enigmatic rappers in the underground today numerous solid projects under this dude's belt our candy history will absolve me today I wrote nothing also has a duo with fellow MC lucid Armand Hammer has also performed in the super Kron flight brothers Billy woods has a really unique delivery unique voice cryptic lyrical style and I was really excited to listen to and talk about this new album over here I didn't get right into it the moment I knew it came out because Billy woods his records usually take a while to digest I wanted to give it the time that it needed to kind of move its way through my brain and also I wanted to take this opportunity to collaboratively review and talk about this new record with fellow Billy woods appreciator and YouTube music reviewer mr. Mike c-town of dead and hip hop fame him and I basically discussed some of the ins and outs and the appeals of this new Billy woods album and yeah we're going to get into that conversation right now I hope you enjoy it hope you enjoy this new Billy woods album - check it out give it a shot and let's transition and here we are - the magic of the internet with mr. Mike c-town of dead and hip hop and his own YouTube legend status as well where he does a reviews and final updates and whatnot thanks for coming on talking with me about this new Billy woods record known unknowns how you doing dude I'm doing very well thanks for inviting me man no problem um you and I both heard Billy's last record and the record before that and the record before that we I think you know the only music reviewer on YouTube who was kept up as intently with his output as I have so you know I thought it would be good to talk with you about this new record over here you know given what you knew of his progression up until this point how did this album sort of hit you in comparison with like his fast work um the first thing I thought of when I listened to it the first time through is it's a bit more varied than the last I mean his albums are all really moody yet it's like this time the move was it was still really consistent but the tone was buried you know I mean okay like the production was all very different it wasn't all one sound hmm and production from blockhead we should say that he did do production on dour candy from front to back he also did on this new one over here I will say if there is sort of a comparative difference between those two records just production wise this one to me on the whole seems a bit punchier there were a lot of beats on candy that were a little stripped back kind of scold yeah like you say Moody but there were a lot of tracks on here that you know read as a little bit more aggressive to me just because the the percussion seemed a little bit more prominent the samples and the melody seemed a little bit more vivid and I think Billy sort of up the volume and the intensity of his delivery occasionally to to sort of match that energy but I do agree you know it is varied in terms of mood there are a lot of tracks on here like no mento the source Awards track another song toward the end where he's essentially rapping about I guess kind of being like a bad other half in a relationship you know he has like these women in his life who are sort of just kind of in and out sort of like a revolving door because he sort of comes off as like an undependable partner or just like not real partners not really present if anything sort of hit me about this record it's that he comes off as like the ultimate loner poet oh no like it's very much like I don't know it's it's very much like an isolationist rap record in a lot of ways you know it seems like really dirty tear-stained coffee-stained like little like little little bit of weed bits in there caught in there in the diary and you know just like a really filthy grimy diary that he's just like kind of filling up with you know all this like pen ink spilled everywhere to again you know definitely like a loners a loners hip-hop record yeah it definitely feels I don't like to call it pessimistic but I mean I guess it's more just darker slash realistic I guess like he gives a a really bleak feel of what it's like to be just a black dude living in America man it's not a beat you over the head type of message but you still take that from it cuz there's a lot of social issues that he talks about regularly but with this one I just like that he's doing it in different ways you know like you can go from bush-league you know to the song like like wonderful to to like Groundhog Day like those songs all sounds so different but they still have the same type of mood I think he did a really really well here he did do that and also on these tracks even though he does sort of address these serious topics and he comes through with these moods he still drops those lines every once in a while that are just like super fucking funny or just like you know just like super dark humor you know you brought a bush-league one of the first signs on that track that hit me was when he was rapping about you know is this your first time in the killing field we're not trying to reinvent the wheel like you know that's just like one of those really matter-of-factly very frank moments in his lines where you're just like kind of screams out this like this is what this is the bullshit this is how it is you know and it's like you either just like shit-or-get-off-the-pot you either deal with it or you don't you know and it's like I love those moments in his in his lines because as dark as his songs can get they just kind of make me laugh because it's just like you know IIIi really don't know how to explain it he's just so boldly and bluntly and brashley just highlighting this really horrible stuff in a way that's like he can't really do anything else other than to have like kind of a kind of a laugh at it and also I kind of think that's all the case for the song source Awards where I don't know where that track is coming from it seems like a really weird cartoony power fantasy where he finds himself at the source or right and he's like running up running up on these other rappers and he's just like you know threatening people saying he's the best thing he has the best music and talking about you know other debauchery that's going on there you know some of the stuff he raps about is clearly based in the reality of sort of these societal inequalities that you're talking about also the rial of you know these relations romantic relationships he finds himself in going south or you know at a point where he finds himself alone and sometimes you know what he raps about seems to come from a place of you know just these really weird satirical fantasies that he drums up just to kind of highlight an issue or make fun of something sort of another width of reality that comes on the the record was definitely police came to my show but that's also I'm also a track where he clearly kind of takes a bit of a light-hearted tone to it you know like as he's rapping about the police coming to his show and just everything that was going on at this concert like it's really tongue-in-cheek yeah cuz he even mentions the fact that he's sold no merch yes I forget the exact line but he says something like after selling no merch then he starts talking about the policemen that the whole idea of the song is so absurd these cops who show up and they actually pay to get in but I Billy was just so coated sometimes or a kind of those are from my head a little bit but I'm still not quite sure what he's saying the cops were there for yeah exactly but that's the thing it's sort of like they could be there for something they could not be there for something and also I think it adds up to this sense of paranoia on the album too you know that comes through on songs like everybody knows you know that's like an incredibly dark track where he's rapping about not only people sort of in his immediate neighborhood that are aware of his actions you know because there are moments on the album and in past records to where he's rapping about stuff like dealing and sort of the the CD and the dangerous lifestyle that comes along with that but he's also rapping about things like you know big brother coming in the shape of an app on your iPad or something like that so it's kind of like you know this local paranoia but then this grander sense of paranoia too you know but again it's a the details of why the police were there at the show doesn't so much hit you or doesn't so much reveal itself as much as like little details like when he's talking about that kid who's half his age trying to trade tapes with him like hey I have my tape can I get your tape he's like I don't even have a tape player right now alright you know but also another moment on that everybody knows track you know a spot when he's um uh you know dropping a bit of like really sharp and dark humor in the middle of like this like horrifying song is when he's talking about I think that one line when he's talking about you know the people who's watching out for giving him a gift he doesn't want and in the very next bar you have that sound effect where ho ho ho you know like Santa's like you know like coming down the chimney or whatever and he's like and as soon as you know you hear the ho ho he's like that's how they laugh you know and then it goes into the next bar it's again it's just so funny and we haven't sort of gone into this detail yet because we're sort of familiar with his previous stuff you know we haven't established it but you know he continues really well with this whole rap style that's completely unique to him where he's half rapping but also half ranting yeah you know there's like a flow to it but he's also kind of like just yelling into the air like a crazed psycho who you might see sort of like pacing up and down New York Street or something yeah that's always what really drew me to Billy woods as I you know I I came up listening to all that weird New York rap and it's very rare to find someone that's still doing experimental rap but differently than everybody else and literally I can't think of anyone that sounds like Billy woods and you're absolutely right because his rob style is so it's so unique and it's so unorthodox like he'll be rapping at one point and then ill decide like he's doing like some weird spoken word like you said or just talking to somebody but it's still weird Leon beat no it absolutely is and you know he's doing it just as well here as he has in the past you know those one moment where I think where he really sort of dug into his lower register and sort of shouted with you know kind of this authoritative tone and it reminded me of like ride just like a little bit but really beyond that there's like really no comparison I mean the features on here for the most part I was pretty impressed with ASAP not ASAP ASAP Iraq and homeboy Sandman on a wonderful or excellent like that was an excellent compliment to him um I agree that were my favorite racks actually yeah it is one of the better tracks on here like it has a really good momentum to it good energy good intensity and the way that they play off of each other's really well is really good and it's it's easily one of the better feature version I've heard from homeboy Sandman like he's not typically a rapper I go out of my way to hear but he did a lot for this song in my opinion yeah I agree that he has some line about kicking ass he said something about my mic steel toes got a lot of mileage yeah and you know you're right um I I like homeboys Sandman but if he's featured on a song I don't typically jump to say okay he's going to murder this track yeah but I think what was so good about wonderful is all three of the MCS on that song sounded so drastically different that it just worked really well like none of them have a similar rhyme pattern no so it just worked out really well and the beat was a little bit more up-tempo than everything else hmm so I thought that made the song stick out in a good way another thing that really stuck out to me what did you think of the track straw man which sort of had that like thumping slave grooving like you know it had the singers but also kind of like that rock guitar bass line on there which is like a really weird direction for Billy to go in um and it's funny because that was actually one of the questions I had to ask you yeah because it was okay I'll get it out the way that would be only song on the whole album that I didn't like really and it was to the point where I was listening to it over and over again because I wanted to like it and the reason I wanted to like it is I don't want to put Billy woods in a box yeah and say okay she tried to do something a little bit different and Here I am the super fan that doesn't like it I didn't want to be that guy but unfortunately I end up being that guy because I don't think it was necessarily a bad song I think people that like that type of beat and that type of book I think they would dig it but from my personal taste I felt like it stuck out like a sore thumb and yeah it just didn't work for me you know there are things about the track that I like there are things about the track that I dislike it did stick out to be instrumentally it was just kind of like a sore thumb like it didn't fit in with overall tone of the record I think Billy's performance on the track was pretty decent Barry McClane's hook on there I didn't care for it all that much it just kind of seems like this stereotypical R&B vibe but I actually liked her vocals a lot on the closing track I loved a tone of her voice and sort of the melody she was pulling off on the closing track I actually didn't care for the guest rapper on the track either especially when he sort of kicked off his verse singing but also kind of stepping on the end of Billy's verse it just seemed like a little bit of a traffic jam you know like it didn't seem like the song was organized as well as it could have potentially been you know and Billy he's not the most ambitious when it comes to structure you know he's typically like just get a really good verse out there or good intro then hit him with like a repeated hook you know that's just like sometimes you know you have tracks like snake oil in my opinion or tracks like fall back that the hook is a little clunky you know it's almost like a chunk of a rap verse and he's just like kind of just spinning refrain just to give you like a little bit of space before the next verse comes you know I do wish some of the hooks on here were a little bit sharper here's a moment where it struck me is like okay you know he's trying but like it's falling a little short you know and not that it didn't have potential you know I do like the lead melody of the hook you know I do like Billy's performance I do like the idea of sort of wrapping over the groove that the song presented but you know again it does stick out sort of like a sort of summon not in the best way yeah I agree with you 100% I didn't care for the further guest rapper and forgive me I don't remember the person's name Wendy Oh beauty yeah and that's somebody that people have told me to check out before I just haven't got around to it but I didn't think the chemistry between Billy Judi or Barry on that song worked at all yeah um I thought when Billy did his own hooks or even when lucid did the hooks form I thought it sounded really good yeah and I thought these were some of his better hooks that he's had on his albums it was almost like he's trying a little bit harder to get in your head and be a little bit more catchy I just I'm a little worried or that song may be a little bit learning that he might start pulling in people like this did you hook storm and I don't think that would be a great idea yeah you know I I do agree you know he did try and he does have some of his better hooks on here this album is a bit more hook focus which I think plays along into the overall record feeling a bit punchier a bit more aggressive a bit more straightforward those moments were lucid is on the record he appears on here twice I believe you know obviously they work together before on numerous tracks they work together an arm and Hammer so that chemistry is there it comes through with flying colors so you know the elusive tracks are excellent to be expected you know but the other moments when he is by himself and doing his own hooks for the most part they do stick in my head too you know as as I guess some as I guess off the cuff of some of them I seem as like a I wake up and smoke weed I wake up and smoke weed but the things like when you really dive into that track you sort of see like the really weird isolated sort of tone of the song and the fact that he's surrounded by all this junk and you know we sort of spot he sort of finds himself in this rut you know on the song you know and also uh to go back to everybody knows you know he's like they know who you are they know who you are you know just kind of that sense of paranoia sort of getting more and more tense in his voice as he's sort of repeating the line over and over and over you know so while some of the hooks here do work they're not your average hook you know they're there to sort of establish a mood and sort of you know set in to the listener you know a certain kind of emotion that the rest of the song is trying to build up it's not merely just meant to stick in your head right right and I thought that like the hook that he had on to fox jackets yeah not sure if um yeah well as what I wanta has a lucid on it - yeah where you know I liked how especially on the hook where they took the the idea of thug and kind of twisted the line around does mean we all know that Tupac had a certain idea of what thug life meant for it wasn't just dub life so I thought that the whole the highest under the highest under the way elusive was doing that didn't even click until way later on after listening to the album a bunch of time that he was referencing the word thug and it was from what I took it and I was going to actually email him and ask him if this was correct what if the highest under God did you get that from that huh I didn't but the thing is that sort of adds up to the quality of Billy woods music that sort of like on the end of the song snake-oil where you know it sort of ends off that track saying he's got a mouthful of riddles you know like his albums from front to back are just so cryptic like and that's just kind of the tone that you know they're at but what's funny is like when you actually figure it out and actually figure each track out you're like oh that's what that is like it should have been obvious from the start you know because the thing is all the clues and all of the imagery it's all there it's just like he replaces it in like a weird reverse order you know sort of like scatters at about almost randomly so that when you take it all in in the linear style that a song plays you don't necessarily connect all the dots because it's not happening one after the next you know I have a clue that might make sense with the line toward the beginning of a track toward the end of the track you know and then finally like when you pull it all together and you get the greater context of everything you finally figure out what the song was about and the point that he's trying to make sometimes it's more obvious than others you know like on source Awards like on everybody knows like on Groundhogs Day like on memento you know but still you know I do kind of love that cryptic quality of Billy's music I do think it adds a lot to what he does it makes his music had a lot of replay value and you know on top of it it just kind of gives his music a certain kind of vibe and tone that no other artist really has yeah um he definitely he it feels like Aesop Rock sometimes when I listen to him among the cons I'm trying to figure out what the hell he's talking about yeah but with Billy was I can never claim to decipher even 50% of what he's talking about I'll get bits and pieces here and there but there was one song that I was actually surprised by it being more straightforward than I expect from him and that was super predator yeah which ended up being probably my favorite song on this on this whole album but it was still coded it was still cryptic but there were lines that were much more blunt that make you walk away say okay I know exactly what he's talking about like when he says the whole lean out the car with one eye closed washing negros off the block like a fire hose it's like then he says the line about Kool G Rap being Frederick Douglass with a dutch and it it it's the bluntness of that song and the darkness of that song that really really just pulled me in and and the beat worked so well with what he was talking about that that's the one jams I can listen to over and over and over again yeah I mean I I think um I I don't think either certainly walking away from this record you know that unimpressed with any number of tracks you know I mean obviously strawman a little bit I mean a couple of hooks to me here and there just felt like you know but not really that memorable here you know but outside of that I mean this is I think one of his most listenable and straightforward and engaging records in a long time you know his last record where he sort of you know embarked on a lot of these really weird short wrapped vignettes you know was interesting but it was like really hulking and difficult to kind of digest you know in a lot of ways you know Gower candy had its moments as well you know I think it could have ended a little bit better you know this to me feels like he's sort of going back to the basics he had on history will absolve me and he's making a record was just like a lot of a lot of strong content that all works together on sort of an individual basis you know you could separate each track out of this album and it kind of works on its own merits you know not because it's a part of like a greater grander sematic concept or something like that he's just kind of hitting you with one great quality track after the next and you know that's part of what makes it so listenable and so and so fun because each song sort of taking things from like a different angle mm-hmm yeah this definitely like his most complete piece of work I won't say it's his best album hmm but it definitely feels like this is the one that he wanted to make a complete journey as opposed to an album full of really songs this is an album full of songs that feel like they each one had a a distinct purpose yeah exactly which you know which is very much what I like so much about history will absolve me you know it kind of feels like he's going back to that a little bit but with obviously you know a different approach to hooks and you know a different approach to production to with with blockhead you know on on the beats on this thing because he's obviously going to bring a way different vibe you know the Billy had on history so you know overall I'm loving the record I'm really liking it and you know probably going to be one of the best underground releases in my opinion of the year I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing I imagine you're probably you know vibing off this thing too then yeah it's definitely one of the best things I've heard this year that in hip hop we just did our we just filmed our mid-year best of rats products projects excuse me and this would have been in there had it come out a little bit earlier but I definitely see it being on my list at the end of the year okay cool all right oh that's an insider info yeah awesome boy open the chills on y'all man sprinkling it the salt

jp0Z2IDfvOo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and I'm doing a quickie review here of the new Toro y Moi album boo boo which is probably in my top 10 for favorite album titles of the year but I digress Toro y Moi is the long-running musical project of producer multi-instrumentalist chaz bundok you most likely are aware of his output by now he was an early pioneer of the whole chillwave genre jumped on to you know other waves other sounds other trends moving forward with underneath the pine and his subsequent albums his last record I loved quite a bit he sort of went into a little bit of a psyche pop direction on that album and some of his best songwriting in my opinion turned up on that record not an album in my opinion that you know was as steeped and just kind of like groovy vibe a pastiche as some of his other albums and I was kind of hoping that he would move forward sort of honing in on his songwriting flexing those songwriting muscles with his subsequent records with his following records however on this new album over here I feel like he's kind of folding to aesthetics again on this thing I feel like a lot of what this record has to offer a lot of a boo boo has to offer just kind of boils down simply to the vibe and the sound of the record with the songwriting just kind of being so so based off of some you know mediocre vocal improvisation or something like that or just kind of whatever was coming vocally to Chaz's head a lot of the lyrics come off a little cheesy probably tongue-in-cheek but still you know cheesy nonetheless the overall musical style of the record is very much like a chill laid-back steamy neon-colored dark nocturnal set back in the 80s maybe it's in Miami sort of synth bunk vibe again it is very vintage it is very nostalgic I would say chill wave fans will probably find some enjoyment in this vaporwave fans will probably find some enjoyment in this you know if you can get past the fact that there's not anything super abstract about which has is doing here what Chas is doing on this record actually sounds like if it had come out in the 80s what would have been source material for some kind of vapor wave edit or remix or something so anyway again a lot of cool milky baselines on this thing you know very simple but head-bobbing drum machines and i synth patches on here as well Chaz's vocals are you know as okay as they've ever been he's never been one of my greatest or rather my favoritest or rather the my favorite singers excuse me he's never been one of my favorite singers that still kind of continues to be the case here his voice does kind of wear thin for me after a little while you know he sort of tends to have the same kind of nasally high-pitched tone that doesn't do that much for me I would say his vocal his voice actually wears even thinner than usual when he does jump on a track where he just slathers his voice in auto-tune which in theory I don't think is actually a bad thing there is some there is something kind of experimental and odd and very unexpected about it over these types of instrumentals it's like I'm listening to some kind of old I don't know eighties slow jam mixed with Kanye's 808s and heartbreak it's actually kind of cool to hear those two worlds collide but again I don't think Chaz brings his best songwriting on these tracks to really kind of make these two ideas come together into something that's like really truly exciting there are a lot of tracks on here that sort of seemed to harp on a single groove or an idea and Chaz just kind of strings that out until it just kind of fades the song out again kind of leaving me feeling like this is more of a vibe record this is more of a motif record this is more of a in 80s funky cynthy pastiche kind of record this isn't the kind of album or Chaz's like really like oh here's a strong tune with an amazing chorus verse that has you know a distinct personality from that hook so you know there's kind of a good contrast there you know and that's the thing you know there's not like a whole lot of you know structure and build ups to a lot of these songs too much of it again comes down to the groove the vibe the laid-back kind of dreamy nocturnal sexy feel of the album you know and the thing is if you're looking for that in a record you're gonna love the hell out of this thing you know for me a vibe an aesthetic a style a sound is good but I'm looking for something a little bit more in terms of like songwriting substance you know and again not to knock this album entirely I do think if you know you just kind of want some vibe music something that sounds kind of vintage kind of you know a little bit what's the word I'm looking for you know some people some people use that term hit hip hip Nagappa when they're when they're talking about you know pop music the sort of elicits this is very sort of a vintage sort of nostalgic feel I would say there's you know definitely a hint definitely a quality of that to this new record over here you know if you're looking for that in your pop music you're gonna love the hell out of this thing I wouldn't not recommend it but you know I would say that the album doesn't necessarily hold up to really close scrutiny very close attention you know it's very much something that you just kind of put on in the background sounds very pretty sounds very funky puts on a dark old-school vibe and you know if you're looking for some mood music like that you're gonna dig boo boo so yeah there you go those are my thoughts on the record here is my review of Chaz's last album last Toro album right next to my head over here that you should check out dug that a record quite a bit and I will see you guys in the next video thank you for watching do the best love you love you forever 
WXpbp3x0X_I,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's disease music yeah you you know who is doing a quickie review here of this new beach house b-sides & rarities collection beach house being the legendary indie and dream duo came out with some of the best dream pop records of the 2000s in my opinion I would say that their first four projects are either good to great highly recommend checking out any of them if you have not already especially loved devotion and teen dream amazing however I digress it's no secret that I caught some heat off of the fact that I find that their latest material like their two new albums like super underwhelming super disappointing like they didn't want to push their atmosphere and their sound into a new exciting direction or expand it or really sort of enhance it in any sort of way and I feel like the duo is kind of running out of song ideas too which unfortunately kind of made me hesitant to try out this b-sides and rarities collection I'm not sure why I guess I should have known better given the title and a better understanding of what this project is but yeah it's exactly a rarities and b-sides collection and I guess the reason I should have been more interested in this than I originally was is because we're talking older material here a lot of which I have been well aware of for years maybe like I owned an mp3 here and there of some of these tracks because I snagged it downloaded it off of like you know some old mp3 blog back in the day like it's actually kind of crazy to think like it's it's ten years since like the indie blog boom and and and now that whole landscape of indie blogs for the most part like a lot of it is gone much of it that is still there is not quite as relevant as it used to be but yeah you know I remember grabbing like you know some of these very tracks off of like you know some of these blogs like um you know the used to be single also I do not care or the Wintersun love that track when I first heard it however there are songs on this thing that while they may be older their tracks that I don't quite remember and you know while none of it is really quite as exciting as a lot of the material that came off of teen dream or you know it is some of the best tracks off devotionally card of chambers love that song there's actually still a lot of good performances on this thing a lot of good tunes on this stuff a lot of good recordings good production too in my opinion what the band is doing here because a lot of it is older and coming from a time coming from an era where beach house is writing their best stuff there's still a lot of magic on this project you know if it wasn't just a be sized collection much of which I was already familiar with I would just like you know kind of slap like a hey I love this let's throw it in the love list because it is really that good and given that beach house has had a pretty consistent sound over the years the experience the listening experience of this thing is pretty seamless there were a few surprises here and there you know there were some nice moments on this thing where the instrumentation was a bit more acoustic like the pianos and the guitars the drums are a little bit more up front so it was kind of cool hearing beachhouse in the raw they're also the cough syrup remix of the song in vials Kerry was a bit of a surprise too but all around a really enjoyable collection of tracks you know I love the dreamy atmosphere I love Victoria's voice on this thing I love what alex is bringing in terms of the guitar on this thing as well you know again it just sort of brings me back to a time at a place when beach houses music was just a little bit fresher a little bit more interesting you could hear that even the duo themselves they knew that they were onto something they knew that they had something and nowadays it just kind of feels like when I listen to a newer Beach House track that they're just not sure where to evolve it past this point hopefully you know and listen I don't care about beach house sounding the same forever that's not what I'm advocating for and that's not what I want you know all we want is for you know the duo to come out with more music where they sound as excited they sound as well aware that they have struck upon something incredible and amazing as they did you know when they were coming out with releases like devotion and light Teen Dream because then you know you could hear in the recording you hear in the performances you hear in the writing that what they were doing was like whoa you know we're really on the verge of something really on a cutting edge or something you know and it's really beautiful too now I'm just kind of feeling like the atmosphere has grown a little stale it's grown a little drab but that excitement that electricity that passion that intoxicating vibe that intoxicating beauty of beach houses early years it's on this b-sides collection in spades now understanding that this is a b-sides collection it is a rarities collection not every track is amazing you know there are some tracks here that are just kind of drab or pale in comparison to some of the duo's best stuff but that being said there's a lot of great material on this thing Beach House fans should not miss out dream pop fans you know if you're into some of these twanging dreamy SoundCloud errs or band campers and somehow beach houses are to slip through the cracks for you please use this app as an opportunity to try this b-sides collection and go into the duo's back catalogue because there's a lot of great material there and I'm going to leave you with that here's another video next to my head that you should check out another beach house review on this channel and um I will catch you guys in the next video love you love you love you mmm forever mm-hmm 
ZwKvfRTE6Pc,
qyFbsYI8nCc,hi everyone party liberato here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the brand-new higham album something to tell you hi i'm is a sisterly trio that exploded onto the music scene with their forever EP back in 2012 which led to some pretty snappy pop rock singles the very next year the bulk of which made up the band's debut record running if you call my name falling the wire great tunes however the album that they were built into was far from a perfect record though it was a pretty solid debut from a band who looked like they had a lot of room and a lot of potential to mature in the coming years and matures how the trio is sounding on this brand-new album right here thankfully throughout this record there are no unforeseen attempts at trying to appeal to like the dubstep crowd just a smooth consistent well-rounded vintage pop sound that feels like it's coming straight out of like the late 70s early 80s which in 2017 is nothing all that surprising as there has been a decent crop of mainstream pop records that has sort of embraced all things 80's most notably carly Rae Jepsen's couple of recent projects even the new Lord album and I'm not saying hi I'm on this record or bringing some kind of generic bland New Wave pastiche far from it for the most part on this record the band delivers this very sleek smooth and funky blend of R&B and pop while still managing to subtly work in the elements of rock and Baroque pop that fueled their last record on the whole the band definitely sounds bigger on this record they sound cleaner on this record the songs on this thing are produced to be more instrumentally dense and lavish however the end result on this album doesn't really have me all that excited it's like the trio consciously made an album that sounds like it's already sitting at the bottom of a dusty $1 tape bin at a used record store just like all the other forgotten relics from the 80s this album starts very strong it has a handful of impressive highlights but very quickly the record starts to trail off unfortunately the trio does not really learn from the music and the album centric mistakes that their predecessors suffered from but again there are highlights on this thing like I want you back which is a shimmering intro track a lovely intro track amazing single love the lead vocals on this thing really passionate really captivating the Spacey tension building verses work very nicely with the courses which blossom beautifully on a great groove back by nimble vocal harmonies some handclaps some cute little bass embellishments the song nothing's wrong might sound kind of like an adult contemporary piece of pop rock from back in the day but it's actually yet another solid tune and the track listing here the driving guitars on the hook sound fantastic and the song is yet another example of a verse where instrumentally we kind of have a lot of tension being built in atmosphere in space the instrumentation is kind of orbiting around the lead vocals and the somewhat fragmented way but then when the chorus pops in boom it all sort of syncopate comes together really tightly and just sort of forces its way through a chorus pay attention to this little trick pay attention to this little formula hi i'm use it multiple times on this record to great effect however that's not the case on every single track a little of your love comes through just something and hitting hard right away with this massive bass a very peppy piano the vocal harmonies are as delicious here as they are in any other track on this album and I would say this actually like a bit of a vintage Motown vibe to the tone of the track especially the lead melody the the chord progression coming out of the instrumentation and there are a few deep cuts on the album too that I wasn't anticipating to like as much as I did the song you never know which has a very nocturnal smooth disco tinged groove that was really Pleasant and the skipping beats on the song kept me crying sound like they came straight out of the the Fleetwood Mac down stop so you know that's about playbook though I still think I am do good things with it however I think I should say that I am somewhat underwhelmed and a little disappointed by the lyrics on this track actually numerous tracks on this thing I went into this record assuming that Higham would kind of grow out of writing the nondescript love songs that sort of plague their last record these heartbroken these love 6 songs that don't really have anything in terms of real details or distinct qualities but unfortunately that's just like still the level that they're writing on so even though from an instrumental standpoint this record might sound more mature than its predecessor we're still kind of getting more of the same at the core of these tracks however that's not really the album's Achilles heel here the worst thing about this record is when Higham and their producers seem kind of unsure as to how to string together this massive amount this massive influx of instrumentation that is coming into this record like the incredibly rough right now toward the end of the album which I originally enjoyed hearing as a strip back and very dramatic piano ballad during a studio session that the band uploaded to YouTube and promotion of this record but the studio version of this song is a total mess it's needlessly cluttered with all of these completely useless little pieces of background noise that don't really add anything to the track whatsoever in fact all they do is just distract from the performance meaning the singing and the piano playing the actual meet of the song not all the annoying sonic bells and whistles that surround it the title track on this thing features some of my favorite vocal harmonies and one of my favorite lead vocal melodies on this entire record but suddenly hitting the audience with a bunch of syncopated bass and drum fills does not a chorus make even if some of the bass licks on this track are really fun and the constantly throbbing string sections unfounded in silence are just a little overkill the instrumentation surrounding this track in general is just a tad overblown some of the lead vocals and the harmonized refrains on the song walking away come together a little awkwardly not only that but the instrumental palate of this track is so synthetic and so sanitary it's like hi mr essentially making the kind of music they were originally the antithesis to when they broke onto the music scene and the closing track is one of these stereotypical slow burners which while I think some of the vocals on the track are beautiful especially the vocal harmonies I mean hi I'm always bringing at least a decent or a great vocal harmonies to attract the very clunky kind of blemished and ugly guitars roaring away really quietly underneath them I don't know they just sound kind of slapped together even if I do find the chord progression at least a little interesting I don't know this this for me is just kind of like what happened the album because I expected a lot of great things out of this record I mean aside from right now I was thoroughly impressed with pretty much every song I heard in promotion of this record at least a few deep cuts were great but man is this album front-loaded because after about the middle point of the record I feel like the quality of the songs the organization in the production it all just really starts to evaporate you know unfortunately this is a really inconsistent album I mean I'll walk away from this thing hoping that hi I'm fully capitalize on their potential in the future with another album but it just kind of seemed like they were allowed to just kind of do everything and anything that they wanted to with their producers without actually kind of like cleaning it all up and making it all come together in a cohesive fashion for the final product I'm feeling a strong five to light six on this thing trip Church or transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

eqEPZaPOaIg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of 21 savages new album its album 21 savage is a southern rapper who is currently based in Georgia his uniquely low-key and murderous style was making waves in the underground back in 2015 that reached a peak in 2016 with the release of savage mode 21 savages collaborative project with Metro boomin which I came right out in my review and I said that I thought it was not good however in retrospect I can give this thing at least a little bit of credit for creating a very Spacey and uniquely eerie vibe but that being said savage mode is kind of the definition of a one-trick pony as every single track on this thing is steeped in pretty much the same atmosphere 21 savage vocally lyrically isn't exactly versatile on this thing as he's merely just mumbling and talking through every single track it seemed like he actually had more tools at his disposal on his slaughter tape back in 2015 but with tracks like X and no heart kind of becoming flagship singles 421 it seems like with this new album over here he's giving way to pressure to kind of give the fans more of what they want and that's not to say he doesn't try to change things up or put himself outside of his comfort zone on this new album over here but every single time that he does it seems like it's only by way of doing something a little more commercial like on a very glamorous and somewhat upbeat track famous which kicks the entire album off produced by Zaytoven surprisingly and honest cut 21 savage pretty much explains what brought him to this point where he sees himself as a success in the rap industry but lyrically and vocally 21 savage sounds kind of underdressed for what comes off as a celebration of how far he's come in a few short years he dropped some lackluster bars here and there they don't really have anything to do with the main topic of the song he also tries to engage in some really pathetic singing and even though I said this in my savage mode review I feel like it needs saying again I had no down my head that 21 Savage is with the and that he had to overcome a lot to get where he today but his slow flow his deflated delivery and his monotone voice don't exactly make for compelling music of any genre and his voice feels especially off when it's not within the context of an instrumental that brings a very atmospheric and cold-blooded vibe now this intro track doesn't seem like kind of a betrayal of 21 savages signature sound the song face time will which is essentially this auto-tune synth anthem where twenty one essentially tries to sing his way through this very silky buttery piece of trap and R&B fusion the whole premise of the track is essentially I'm too drunk to text you let's FaceTime the song special is even harder to listen to for a lot of the same reasons but easily the most difficult stretch of time on this entire record comes in the shape of the seven-minute freestyle that ends the entire album off where not only 21s rhymes are more subpar than usual but occasionally they just defy logic altogether I'm ballin like Nowitzki whoa I get head like Lewinsky if we're to follow the logic that he is doing the action described with the amount of proficiency as the person he references in the line then how does the second line make sense Lewinsky didn't get head she gave head so I can only assume that he's rapping about giving head here but I know he doesn't mean it that way and that's not to say his writtens reach a much higher standard like on this line my jewelry twinkle-twinkle doing donuts in the foreign wallace sprinkles you keep callin i'm ignoring bitch I'm single you keep callin bitch I'm single like a Pringle Pringles are not single Pringles are many there are many that come in one single can of Pringles where ever could you find or buy a single Pringle maybe he's trying to say that he's with a lot of people or that he's not single and that's why she should leave him alone but he's already established in the previous line that he is single and that his interest in her isn't dependent on whether or not he's with someone so there are moments on this album where 21 makes no sense he literally makes no sense or he's dropping like these little splashes of homophobia but let me just get back to my main point here 21 savage on this album is not playing - what phew he has not with these love songs not with the painfully awkward baby girl which is the least sexy attempt at being sexy on this entire album songs that take a softer approach don't really suit 21 savage because he's not known for being the emotional type and in fact if you just listen to the dudes voice he's not really the emotional type which is every single time he tries to embody that on this record it just comes off awkward twenty-one savage truth be told is that his best on this thing when he's putting out these really dark shady ah almost scary tracks usually with very skeletal instrumentals miraculously my favorite cut on this entire thing sounds like a song that would have fit pretty snugly onto savage mode the song numb which in my opinion is not just simply your average 21 savage song even though it may sound like it on the surface because I think this track actually says a lot about his ethos where he's essentially using his newfound fame and money to try to heal himself or ignore his very dark past which continues to haunt him also this is one of many cuts in the track listing here where we have some production from Metro boomin we have other tracks on here that are similarly appealing and minimal close my eyes that business and even though I don't really care for 21 savages singing voice all that much I do like the song nothing new at least what he's trying to do on this track thematically because it's easily the most socially aware and politically conscious track on the entire record where 21 is essentially engaging in a lot of the horrible systematic and root causes of the very grim realities that he typically just addresses on a very surface level in his verses though if I'm being completely honest I can't really compliment the album on much else outside of you know this handful of cuts this thing is truly and painfully underwhelming and in a way disappointing and even more than savage mode was in a way because there are so many moments on this thing where twenty-one savage jumps outside of his comfort zone and every single time he does it almost feels like he's just kind of selling off or trading off his trademark style which is funny when considering that in the grander scheme of things every single time 21 savage takes a risk on this record it's not even radically different from what he typically does as he still manages to deliver the same passionless slop over every instrumental here the production on this thing though basic is relatively solid and I can definitely continue to give 21 savage credit on the fact that he has a sound and he has a style but those are really the only two pros I can come up with for this record this album is the spitting image of squandered potential because I can't really think of another rapper out there right now who I instantly recognize the moment he pops onto a track I instantly recognize his style but simultaneously he does so little with it and again I can only give 21 savage so much credit on the style front because it's not like he's the first rapper to ever do like the spacey outsider minimal thing you know there other artists out there like kha and rock Marciano who are similarly laid-back and minimal obviously they come to completely different artistic and lyrical conclusions than 21 does but I mean it's not like the foundational ideas of what make him special as an artists are that hard to come by I'm feeling a strong three to life for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment the comments if you're angry next to my head is my review of savage mode which you should check out or click the subscribe to the channel link and I will catch you guys in the next video forever 
iHyqvFgPRzA,hey hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for the best and worst tracks of the week aka the weekly track roundup where I go over what we're essentially the song highlights for me this week hope you're doing well is a bit of a holiday week this week so not a ton of songs hit me this week but did find a decent crop of tracks over here to talk about before we get into that of course I have to shout out a few things of course our amazon associates link which is down there in the description box if you live in the US

would prefer you use a turntable lab that's and really colorful and amazing pressings of fantastic records that I have covered as of late and also great turntable equipment an audiophile equipment as well for your budding record collector you know speakers wires the whole works so check them out they have a lot of good stuff over there and finally I want to shout out the t-shirts that we have available online at the needle drop comm slash support it's a name ffunny named Shanno shirt with you know all the different like little name remixes on the front this is different than the original that we did not only in terms of font but the name set is different on the shirt - we have dump the neon follow play pinning nintendo company Boitano all the good one all the good ones all the highlights all the hits and problem what I didn't mention last time when I put this shirt on blast is that if you buy one of these shirts and this includes the people who have purchased shirt already

of those two vinyl records again it's like more of a raffle we'll have two winners out of everybody who's picking up shirts and they'll be randomly chosen so just letting you guys know that and finally that's uh that's going to be it lets get into the worst tracks of the week oh yeah oh yeah the worst tracks what tracks we're the worst we like to start off negative in this Fitness segment right after right after I shout out our sponsors I like to get real negative first off we are going to have to talk about this brand new track from wolf Alice don't delete the kisses oh oh it hurts to even say that title um wolf Alice in my opinion in the past has released some pretty lackluster dreamy rock music with a bit of a pop flare to it that doesn't have much flavor to it in my humble opinion but it's almost like they figured out a way to get worse on this new track over here because not only are those elements still alive and well on this new track but also the lyrics on this thing my god the chorus the refrain on this thing is unbearably corny as unbearably corny as the title of the track itself I really don't know I mean a lot of people have been pushing wolf Alice to me saying hey you know make sure you try out the new stuff it's better than the last album into the last album didn't do too much for you but this is this is for me moving even further away from something I may even be mildly interested in you know if you love dream pop if you love that kind of easygoing laid-back very reverb II indie rock that people are so into right now you may dig this but this is not for me at all also the case for the brand-new Tyga track moved to LA which is off his forthcoming project bitch I'm the shit - and this song is basically it for me just making me wonder why does anyone listen to Tyga in 2017 like he literally has nothing special about his voice his delivery his style he just writes the most cliched generic pop rap I've heard in my life and he's basically continuing down this road and unfortunately he's pulled ty dolla sign into the mix on this new track as well you know in the nut not again nothing against I I do think he's a great vocalist but I do think he could be working with some more interesting artists you know because Tyga like is his 15 minutes have pinned over for 30 minutes now and yet it's like still somehow just extending moving on from there believe it or not Ringo Starr has a new track out titled give more love which is just as saccharine and as summit earning as I guess you could expect a song with that title and from Ringo Starr at this part at this era in his career to be I will never be listening to it again at least not of my own free will Oh moving on from there unfortunately was kind of disappointed and let down by the new Kamiya track build you up one of the artists that from this recent double XL freshman cover I had some somewhat high hopes for felt that there was some potential there that wasn't fully being realized and I don't think I don't feel like it's being realized on this new single over here this is not sort of the gritty good fundamentals rap track that I thought that if she continued to work at it she could put out this is more of like a pop rap tune with a bit of a splash of R&B kind of a bit of a throwback vibe to like a bit of salt and pepper the chorus and really all the verses are super bland super forgettable like nothing all that exciting no highs and lows it's just this constant like Girona I don't know very run-of-the-mill very dime a dozen nostalgic pop rap vibe that it really is doing nothing for me whatsoever in the music video for Maya in my opinion is is even harder to watch so I don't know man just uh unfortunately just disappointed we're just going to have to move on from here to the new for tête song which unfortunately I did not dig either Four Tet is an electronic music producer whose output I could typically look forward to and typically expect like some good moments out of it even though I don't enjoyed this new track over here maybe there will be some other deep cuts off this forthcoming record that I do connect with but this new song over here seems to show for Tet going into a weirdly ambient direction that doesn't have that much in terms of I mean really anything I mean of course there isn't a strong beat a strong melody to this track being that it's more ambient in nature but I don't really find any of the textures or any of the sound scapes on this track all that intriguing either it just kind of seems like some really uninspired electro-acoustic new-age music that I don't know doesn't really have anything worth writing home about in it so I don't know just a really let down by this new track unfortunately but you know if you are a hardcore Four Tet fan and you're open to him going into a more ambient direction give it a shot make sure it doesn't slip through the cracks for you moving on to the mess section these are tracks that I didn't think we're done don't think we're terrible they weren't amazing but you know certainly worth highlighting and pointing out to you guys I want to give a shout out to Ted Leo one of the most prolific and you know energetic and passionate songwriters in the indie scene in the 2000s who I guess it's kind of a bit under the radar for a little bit and has been kind of hanging back from you know putting out new music he has a new album on the way he has new output on the way new single new track out sounds just as energized and as sweet and as direct and as catchy as Ted Leo's songs typically do sound I'm not like a huge Ted Leo guy I'm not a huge Ted Leo fan but you know it does sound like he's a very much living up to the talents and expectations that he has set so far with his music in the past so shout out to Ted Leo make sure you know if you are into his music this does not slip by you and if you're in indie rock as well and Ted Leo's one of those artists who never heard of this guy make sure to go back in his discography because he has some good stuff some Ted Leo and the pharmacists records are actually a pretty great next Joey badass excuse me excuse me so much I'm a little congested here Joey badasses come out with three tracks count them one two three uh five five hundred Ben's love is only a feeling and to let those are the three tracks that Joey that ass has released over the past few days and um you know they're decent none of them really stuck out to me as being as great as any of the cuts off of his latest record that he just dropped a lot of them just kind of seemed like very introspective very self-reflective laid-back excuse me mid-paced jazz rap you know I kind of feel like one of those Joey quote-unquote fans that you know kind of sits here thinking what does it be put out a burger why doesn't he go like all hardcore hip-hop a book like you know these tracks are you know one of those moments where I finally like kind of feel that vibe a little bit like I get where people are coming from when they say that you know because not only to me does this feel super laid back but there's not a whole lot here in terms of you know like concept of these tracks it's like really winning me over allowing me to be quite honest you know if you are interested in just kind of hearing Joey take a little bit more personal angle kind of a diary angle with three new sort of offshoot tracks then give these songs a shot they're by no means terrible moving out from there French Montana bring dem tings uh wow man French Montana and this song features Pharrell I never imagined him coming out with the track that was so eccentric and bright and wild and hard-hitting to me he was always just kind of a bit of a bargain barrel rapper with nothing all that special and his artistic repertoire and maybe most of the color and most of the vision and most of what makes this track so fun could be attributed to Pharrell you know that there that is potentially true but actually you know his flow and his delivery on this cut I actually didn't think it was him at first because I'm typically used to him coming at the mic like sounding so lazy and so slack-jawed and so I don't know off-kilter that it just kind of sounds like he's not trying he really sounds pumped and energized on this new cut over here and like I said it's really bright really eccentric it's really a fun track not what I would have expected at all and hopefully I'm you know on this forthcoming project he brings more of that because that would that would certainly be interesting but still I'm not going to hold my breath because you know Pharrell when he does land on a track when he does get introduced into a track he does kind of have a tendency to change the whole vibe to reinvent what's going on and while there are a lot of characteristics I do like about the track is going to be one of my favorite singles of the year most likely not but it does have me sitting here intrigued and just sort of wondering what's happening next Coldplay miraculously came out with a pretty decent track as of late titled aliens which is like I don't know this kind of Spacey somewhat sci-fi and weird cut that I think sort of makes use of very bright and shimmering and you know larger-than-life elements that Coldplay typically works into their songs in like a really positive way not in a way where it just kind of feels like they're trying to impress a bunch of you know drunk people in a stadium or something you know I actually kind of get this feeling of like intergalactic euphoria as I'm listening to the instrumental on this track is some of the best songwriting I've ever heard Coldplay put together no not necessarily but you know I actually like like the way that they make use of their sound and the width they make use of you know a lot of these effects in post-production on this cut you know this is a lot of the same stuff that I enjoyed so much off of X&Y when I enjoyed a lot of cuts off of that album back in the day you know not that I expect Coldplay to go in this direction into the future kind of seems like they're more interested in trying to come out with their next top 40 hit to be quite honest but this is like a you know very nice Pleasant sort of surprise from Coldplay so don't miss out on this track you know it's not like the rest of the bland dancey stuff they've been dropping as of late believe me and that's going to do it for the mess section I believe and now we're going to get into the tracks that I thought were the best tracks this week also again linked down there in the description okay so if you want to check out any of these tracks they're down there let's move on to the first best track oh this one's pretty good zombie juice of Flatbush zombies Fame with of course you know Eric on production over here so it's not really that far removed you know it's not like he's going purely solo and it's like you know really out there and totally unexpected or something so zombie juice solo effectively on here and it's actually not like a bad track like he kicks it off really well like you know it's not the most amazing song I've ever heard but there are a lot of interesting moments where he changes flow or adds in like some cool little vocal quirks like you know where the instrumental breaks away a little bit you get some layered vocals pop it in there for a second like there are a lot of cool vocal ideas that he hits the listener with across the entirety of this of this pretty long track you know so I like you just dipped in for two minutes and disappeared you know it's a pretty like sizable song that he's presented us with here and you know flow is always intense always energetic as you would expect from juice and I don't know I'm just like pretty impressed with the track all around you know he brings the flow brings the energy some of the bars aren't too bad instrumental is certainly there though it's not like you know the hardest or the craziest eric has ever put together but it leaves like a lot of space for zombies delivery for his performance on this track you know and which is not a bad thing because he really stilled the show he really kind of keeps you on the edge of your seat with his energy level from the beginning to the end of the track and again sort of those weird vocal little tricks and quirks that he places throughout the song are really interesting as well so you know I don't really know is a you know he'd gearing up for some kind of record in the near future if it sounds this good I hope so so really digging on that digging on Olga Bell she has a new EP out titled the America EP which is you know obviously based off of a track from her record that I reviewed not too long ago but they're actually a few like non album b-side cuts on this EP two one specifically titled special leave that I would love to point out to you loved to highlight for you because you know her very angular and very odd vocals play out very beautifully over this driving and very bustling and very intricate and layered and dense and complex dance beat that's pretty polyrhythmic you know there are elements of I think like I don't know some of the polyrhythm sort of struck me as like [Music] being a little African I could be completely wrong on that you know but that's just kind of my assessment but then you know kind of the main percussive element of the track felt like I was listening to you know some house music or like some garage music from the UK or something so it seemed like there were a lot of different elements to be instrumental to the rhythm on this thing that I thought were pretty awesome but really it's sort of her vocals that steal the show you know I'm sort of recalling in my head I remember of listening to the track for a few moments but uh you know check it out for yourself I was certainly impressed with it when I first hit upon it again it's titled special leave moving on from there Milo excuse me there my computer farted Milo has a new track out that I think dropped last week unfortunately I forgot to mention in last week's best worst tracks I'm mentioning it here Milo new single new record on the way check out his band campus link down there in the description and this new track of his is fantastic I've got to give it to Milo on this new track like everything that I liked about his last record the fact that he went a little more aggressive a little bolder this time around on this cut he's doing like some really weird experimental edits on his voice like some really cool production trickery on this track everything that excited me about his last album seems to like you know increased to threefold on this new track over here and if this song is any indication of what's to come like this new record is going to be absolutely exciting so again shout out to Milo over here make sure you don't miss out on this track he's one of the better underground rappers out there you can listen to he's one of the better rappers in the left field that you're going to come across in today's day and age so uh don't miss that moving on from there Kesha new track out like I legitimately enjoyed this new Kesha song called praying which if you know anything about why Kesha has sort of disappeared from the limelight for the past few years you know I mean she has been in the limelight but not for music you know so I mean if you've sort of followed that whole story the song can be a little hard to listen to I think to go into this song reading the messaging of it the messaging of forgiveness hoping that this person who she has in mind can find peace or whatever it's kind of hard to go into this track and not sort of read some of that in the song could be totally disconnected I'm open to that but knowing what I know and what and what most people probably know going into this track it's kind of hard to listen to and not at least read some of that in the song and you know that is truly how she feels I mean it's a beautiful sentiment but on top of it you know even separating the song from that narrative and separating the song from its you know potential sentiment it's actually like a really beautiful and powerful like little piano ballad I didn't know she could sort of hit these vocal highs present these moments of vocal drama because typically I'm just hearing or hearing her over you know it's really hard hitting crazy you know just a very uh brash and bratty pop music you know um forgive me you know I'm again I'm not a huge Kesha fan or anything like that I'm not like some expert on Kesha's back catalogue you know but I know what I've heard as far as like her biggest singles you know every single time she has something to drop and you know I've never been like pulled into a Ke$ha record you know via her teaser tracks you know I have enjoyed some what she's done with the Flaming Lips you know when she's collaborated with another artist that I like but you know again never been a huge cash fan but you know very much won over by this new song over here like it's a very powerful song amazing climactic ending on this track just great all-around performance production on the song is great too good tune good song thoughtful lyrics I really don't have anything bad or negative to say about this track I do think the music video is a little weird like the more I watched her paid attention to the video the more I felt myself being uninterested in the track I just felt like it was trying to do too much but when I was actually just kind of simply just paying attention to the song and sort of getting the music video out of my freaking face again I was just really impressed with pretty much everything that the song had to offer so you know if you want to be kind of loud and by something maybe a little unexpected here do give this catcher song a shot if you've never sort of been big into her music before and that definitely have to give a shout-out to this new DJ shadow track over here which is from a new DJ Shadow EP one of the tracks features nas but the track over here that I want to highlight features Danny Brown amazing track it's titled um I believe it's titled Horror Show yes horror shows the title of the track and it is so it is so hard hitting it's so grimy it's so gross it's so fantastically filthy and uh just ah the energy the viscera is amazing you know DJ shadow comes through the song it really supports and amplifies and almost multiplies the the energy that Danny typically brings on a track I love these two work together I love the the the the collaboration they've come through with here has sort of shown flying colors you know it's really fireworks in my opinion and you know if you're a fan of either artist you cannot miss out on this if you're a fan of hip hop you can not miss out on this if you want to hear something in rap that's you know off the beaten path and crazy you do not want to miss this and finally why not give a shout out to a Blue Ivy Carter for what I've been hearing on the Internet is like this weird little one-off freestyle that you know could end up you know it's rumored to be ending up on the physical version of jay-z's 444 which if you have not checked about my review on this album please do I do enjoy the record quite a bit but Blue Ivy Carter what's been floating around the Internet is this little recorded freestyle that could end up on the physical version and you know it's actually really cute you know there's what this one bar in there about how she's never seen or you know known a ceiling in her whole life like oh damn that's a bar that's a bar you know already is such a young age she's got a few bars she got a few bars you know I mean on it you know if we're being honest here you know she could work on the flow a little bit but you know she has her whole life ahead of her to work on that if in fact that's the direction that she wants to go in if that's a passion that she wants to continue working on you know because and honestly I'm not trying to not try to be hard on a little kid over here I'm actually like you know trying to give a legitimate criticism because I believe what Blue Ivy has brought on this track and brought in this freestyle is just as worthy of consideration and just as worthy as grow of criticism as anything else you know you're hearing out there these days you know so I'm just giving her the same respect and attention to detail as I would any other artists and you know as in fact that should be obvious because I have placed her in the best track section over here okay okay because I thought I thought it was a tight cute little freestyle which you know if I do end up picking up a copy of this I'm looking forward to hearing it within the context of the entire record and that's going to be it for this video guys you're the best that was our weekly track roundup remember that Amazon Associates link is down there in the description that turntable lab link is down there in the description pick up a t-shirt - those are backordered a little bit I do want to let you guys know we do international shipping you know just so I get that out

how many gets sold so you know I am doing all this myself so do keep in mind that you know do you got to give me a little bit of a leeway over here as far as like time frame um you know especially if you're overseas you know where it can take even if I do send it out ASAP like three or four weeks to actually reach you and that's going to be it guys you're the best I'll catch you in the next video all these songs are linked down there in the description hope you got some good recommendations out of this and love you love you love it Loonette whoo forever Oh [Music]

luMD_geVp_M,"hey everyone Anthony Santana here Internet's busiest music term you know who it is doing a quick review over here of the onion no I'm referencing over here there's nothing over here I'm going to be talking about the brand new Denzel curry EP 13 this Florida rapper new release over here a lot of people asking me whether or not I'm digging this one especially since I loved his imperial album that dropped last year in the bird shows last year yeah it was a was a 2016 release and that was a pretty aggressive one at that yep so really enjoyed that album please listen to that record if you haven't already it's like one of the most gritty and hard-as-nails rap albums you're in a hear of 2016 and it would certainly you know prepare you for your in here on this new EP now as far as the material that's presented here I believe that Denzel liked ease toward this thing with like demo versions of these tracks or at least you know as songs from this thing we're being uploaded they were labeled as demos or something all I know is that listening to this EP I'm a little bit more impressed with what I'm hearing here than what I was with some of those promotional tracks and yeah you know it's hard-hitting its gritty a lot like Imperial but there's something a little bit darker a little bit more aggressive a little bit noisier about it especially from the instrumentals like some of the instrumentals here especially I hate government for example like kind of distorted really textured very out-there you know I wouldn't call it industrial hip-hop and you know I would wince at anybody comparing this directly to like Death Grips or anything like that you know but it's definitely kind of following the trend or at least on that wave of a lot of weird out there left-field very grimy trap flavored hip-hop that we're hearing like mostly from SoundCloud right now you know but the thing is Denzel is kind of cut from that cloth he kind of comes from that scene so it's kind of not really that surprising here moving in that direction though you know the thing about these tracks so they may all be hard-hitting bloodshed great track hate government so hard-hitting so grimy wish it was longer its criminally short but that's the thing with these songs in general like a lot of them aren't very lengthy a lot of them aren't very satisfying I would say the most developed of the five tracks on this EP would be equalizer with Ronnie J and Zell Tron 6,000,000,000 which has a fantastic little ugly main feature on it but still not to take away from like hate government because that track has you know an excellent little refrain on it that's very sticky just wish the track was longer the weird kind of odd man out on the EP easily has to be the song heartless which when it originally hit me with Denzel performing these like really weird shouty sung vocals I was like oh man you know there's something like so energetic and passionate and insane about his vocal performance on this track but then as the song kind of drew on it like grew a little old for me I feel like maybe he needed a transition out of that and bring us into something else and then come back to it later just to like kind of keep the sound of that of that type of vocal he was bringing fresh but still I commend that track for really trying something different you know definitely hit me is like well this new exciting crazy thing that Denzel is trying to do with his voice that you know I've heard him do to a degree before but he's like really pushing it to 11 on this track you know overall production solid you know the songs on here that are more well developed are solid as well the lyrics and Flo's vocal performance of vocal performances from Denzel not disappointed by any shape or means you know it just kind of seems like I'm listening to a bit of a taster here you know a bit of an introduction you know could be like some b-side or cutting room floor stuff that's teasing toward a direction that Denzel is pointing to in the future or something you know or it could be one of those one-off EPS that we never hear anything from ever again in terms of like stuff of this sound stuff of this nature I would hope not you know I do like kind of this uglier more underground sound that Denzel is pulling together on this project although you know in the future it would be interesting to sort of hear him kind of balance that out a little bit with some sounds from kind of the other side of you know of the sonic spectrum stuff that isn't quite as dark or Gras you know here you're a nice balance on whatever project you has coming out in the future but so far really impressed what he did on 13 you know but again it just kind of feels like a taster but it tastes good "
320eVDw8UGM,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd going to do a quick review of this new Calvin Harris funk wave bounces Volume one out now on Columbia Records Columbia Records coming through with this record in the midst of summer hoping that I guess this is going to be the summer album the summer record for a lot of young dance music fans out there and going into this thing I had high hopes because seemed like Calvin Harris was making such strides changing his cliched EDM production style into something that was a bit more tried a bit more true this synth centric funk with like a bit of a disco twist in there too with like a totally star-studded tracklist like guests on guests on guests from you know the beginning to the end of the project ranging from genres such as contemporary R&B and top 40 pop music and you know even contemporary rap to so you know pretty interested to hear all these voices come together pretty interested to hear the new sound the new direction and interested to hear how it all kind of works together you know and also the length of the record seemed really tight and really to the point you know didn't seem like it was going to be this awful flabby like bloated I want to die 90-minute experience like the new dj khaled record was Calvin seemed like he was going into this project a lot smarter he was at least from the tracklist pairing some interesting artists together that I was like okay you know who's how is that going to work but you know I'll go into it with an open mind to just kind of see how it functions certainly tracks like the one with Frank Ocean that leave the entire record off has grown on me a little bit I was kind of underwhelmed by it the songs slide as I was initially hearing the single and the track with Pharrell and Katy Perry toward the back end of the project feels actually like quite a bit - now that I've had more time to listen to the song and it's had an opportunity to grow on me a little bit more even though the Big Sean verse tour at the end of the track is a little shaky that being said though so I'm listening to the entire project and I'm kind of hearing a really nice sense of consistency coming out of the instrumentals again they all kind of stick to this very summery beachside synth funk with you know very gentle very nice very smooth disco grooves um and you know the artists that are featured on the track some of them go over really well some of them complement the the style of music here some of them complement the instrumental they bring a great performance you know again notably Frank Ocean schoolboy q kills it on his feature like he's great him partynextdoor and DRAM actually do very well together like as a cohesive unit on the song cash out there's not really an itch that that song doesn't scratch and schoolboy q comes way more like smooth and sensual and like easygoing than I thought he was even capable of you know like usually that dudes like a junkyard dog but he complements this style of music so much um you know there's also kind of like a bit of a inherent kind of you know West Coast g-funk sort of vibe to the some of the instrumentals here so of course Snoop Dogg does really well on his feature too this is like this kind of instrumental this is very much Snoop Dogg's old stomping ground so of course Snoop Dogg is going to sound totally natural on this kind of instrumental young thug surprisingly is pretty good even though I do think hearts heat stroke rather is one of the weaker tracks in the track listing here I don't think ariana grande does too much for the track in my opinion it's one of the few moments on the album that to me just reads like okay this is like too much of Calvin Harris just going for this is going to be the real like top 40 pop tune there's going to be the real top 40 dance pop tune not to say the deeper cuts on here or even the other singles are all that alternative you know but there were a few moments here where Calvin was really hitting me like okay now it's going to get super formulaic just to kind of like you know dumb it down for everybody and you know that's not to say that the album itself is it formulaic in general or that Calvin's albums aren't formulaic in general it's just he's kind of swapped out formulas and this is a formula that in my opinion I like a little bit more it's a little bit more flavorful it's not quite as obnoxious or as glitzy or as over-the-top as some of the EDM stuff he's released in the past now to kind of get into my annoyances and my you know gripes or rather my main gripe with this project it's that while there's a lot of star power on this album I don't think every single guest here works over these kinds of instrumentals you know I don't think every guest here has the talent has the fortitude has the experience has the musical ability to really kind of ride these types of instrumentals and compliment them vocally like me goes on the very intro of the album on the song slide sound absolutely out of place and ridiculous as does future futures voice futures singing style the hood does not sound good or this kind of instrumental he sounds ridiculous you know young thug again I will say surprisingly I do think he worked a little bit more but the thing is you know there's always kind of bit of melodic quality to young thug voices young thugs delivery excuse me getting a text over here but the thing is you know that that's never really kind of held Sabbats that so um a young thug you know has always kind of had that melodic delivery to his voice so of course you know he's gonna do pretty well over this kind of instrumental I'm Travis Scott know he's just so far gone he's just so far gone this is just not this is not Travis Scott's vibe at all and the album is very consistent instrumentally up until the song skirt on me featuring Nicki Minaj we're of course Calvin Harris has to go for a dancehall cash grab and Nicki of course has to be soaked in auto-tune it just sounds awful you know really ugly really gaudy just so cheap just so like everybody's got to do it now everybody has to do it in 2016 and 2017 just everybody it's almost like a mandatory for anybody coming out with a pop record or a rap record on a mainstream label you know I do think that the album you know tightens up a little bit more with that feels track coming in but the final two songs don't really do too much for me it's kind of a metric or you know I mean there are a couple songs that I think through-and-through are very solid very enjoyable but I do think a lot of the the album's lackluster qualities do come down to not every single guest on here doing justice for these types of instrumentals vocally they don't bring the talent and just as far as the tone and the delivery of their voice is like you know they're they're more suited for a trap instrumental they're more suited for contemporary hip-hop instrumental they don't sound all that great over synth funk but I'm going to leave it at that let me know what you thought down in the comments about this album did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and I will catch you guys in the next video forever

NLgzRn_dgc8,kissy-kissy hi everyone kissing kissed Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd my little puppy is afraid of the fireworks sounds so she needs to come in here and coop with Daddy she's kind of put there daddy it's time for another installment of the y-you know review you guys know where I go through a series of Records that I didn't get a chance to give a formal review over the past month but now they are sort of in a short-form gauntlet format here for you to sort of digest in this one string of short-form videos it's it's it's shorter all the album's I talk about in this segment are listed down below in the description box and that's it alright let's just get right into the video enjoy have a good one here are the reviews does every single song on this thing need to have some overly dramatic vocal a spacious kind of glimmering shimmering verse a boom-boom drumbeat and then just an overblown chorus does that need to be the formula with nearly every track here it can imagine dragons can they - nothing else there seems like the drums are really kind of taking it back to basics on this one so if you really loved the sound of that debut album and I did I would say this is worth a listen there are at least a couple of tracks here there are some decent highlights you know gone is kind of the dark weird or experimental sounds over the last couple of records that I think came off kind of awkward this seems so much more punchy catchy poppy to the point direct fun and exciting but you know at this point is it too little too late you know the drums sound in my opinion it was so skeletal and so simple and so primitive to begin with now so many years later it just seems way less exciting you know way less refresh but uh you know that being said if you are sort of you know dying to hear that sort of twang II very sparse indie pop indie rock almost post-punk II type of sound and you know you you sort of wonder what what could have been if the drums sort of stayed on that path and you know stayed focused and on the straight and narrow and didn't kind of veer off after their first record maybe this album is the answer to that question maybe this album is that answer that then check it out then then just check it out I can't believe how bad they are at some it doesn't really help that a lot of the riffs are kind of awkward and they're very static - yeah yeah yeah this listen to something else [Music] I've never really been much of a pond fan and I gotta say this album is not really swaying me the band sort of made this transition on the cell P from being sort of a straight psyche and garage rock outfit to come through with a lot of synths doing a sort of very vintage flavor of pop music that's a little anachronistic reminds me a lot of Ariel pinko the hip the hypnagogic pop music that all the kids are listening to these days and ponds approach to it is is really far from unique or refreshing you know they're more there there are moments where the songwriting is okay but generally the album really just has nothing in terms of like a unique flavor or personality for me nothing really to keep me coming back I guess I could see why someone would be into this if you're just like really desperate for some Canadian post-rock but for me the album kind of served as a reminder of why the the genres not really a much of a thing right now indie pop fans indie flavoured singer-songwriter fans you know you're not gonna find anything altogether new on this record but you know I will give it to America there are some very lovely and pleasant songs and vocal melodies on this thing you know the tunes are solid some of the lyrics are pretty good too again sonically it's not going to WoW the indie set you know especially if you've been around the block for a while you've probably heard what's being offered on this record before but you know the instrumental palette the production it's all pleasant and sweet enough to at least warrant this thing a solid listen all the way through just to see if you're just to see if you're into it you know it is a solid record it is a consistent record does seem like a focus record it's just not all that distinct you know it's well put together - again tunes well written but uh you know it's just not wowing me on the style side of things that's all big boy talented rapper but I feel like this is another album where his songwriting abilities just kind of art up to snuff not only that but I just feel like since his debut solo album he has a hard time pulling together an album that is consistent from start to finish it's just kind of a nother potpourri of hey we're gonna have these hard tracks he's hardcore hip-hop tracks right have these southern tracks we're gonna have these obnoxious pop rap tracks and we're gonna work in some kind of crossover for you know like the indie kids or something though that doesn't happen here although you know the he did do that on his past work but now you know these days that any kids are listening to hip hop so he doesn't really need to do that part you know but the killer Mike track on here is OK that oh god the Adam Levine track well in my mouth little bit just just remembering it again it's a potpourri and and it's just what big boy continues to sort of paint him in the corner with despite the fact that you know he's incredibly talented artist he doesn't need to make these concessions he doesn't need to jump all over the place he has the ability the technical ability and the track record to to make a consistent solid focused record yet he just refuses to do it you know I don't think it's a terrible project there are definitely some highlights on here a lot of songs that I think are pretty great the song Gucci Mane is fantastic too but uh you know again it's just all over the place and there are too many cuts that are just middle of the road and really disappointing too I I think we should just leave Nickelback alone just just leave them alone stop bullying them just just let them live Wow such alternative very counterculture this is not a pop record this one's for all the technical death metal fans the vocalist used to sing for the faceless the bass player was in The Dillinger Escape Plan and you know you're talking about some off-the-wall zany super aggressive technical death metal here very colorful I love some of the guitar work on this thing it's amazingly intricate and darkly harmonious you know I will say in the grander scheme of tech death you know is that all that special is it reinventing the wheel or you know doing anything all that different I wouldn't say that but there are a lot of good performances on here and it's not like you know some of that technical death metal that turns me off where it's just endless wanker II and there's nothing really all that you know blood pumping about it that's that's very much the opposite with this this is a very visceral visceral listen you know while there is a lot of flashy playing on this and very good playing you know the the rifts being visceral and you know sort of body rocking head nodding that sort of seemed to take priority and I like that about this I like it at at one point I just thought this banded like you know schultzy swing and Dixieland covers and that was just kind of their whole shtick their whole their whole spiel their whole gimmick but now with this new record over here we kind of had this punchy groovy sleek modern take on a Latin jazz for a majority of the album like super surprising not only that the band is this versatile but they pull it off so well on a lot of these tracks I mean there are a couple snoozers here and there and it is sort of disappointing that the record is just 35 minutes long especially since some of the tracks on this thing are so good I feel like there was so much more potential here than what the band actually dug up just in terms of the track length you know in the end the album length but still there's a lot of good things about this and again if you know if you're looking for somebody who's just coming through with some funky groovy Latin jazz give this thing a shot I feel like I'm listening to death from above 1979 if they were trying to appeal to jet fans or Queens of the Stone Age fans I'm sure I'm just I'm just really not into it I'm just really really really really really not ah I wanted to like this so much there's so much hype behind this record with music writers they like love the out of this thing because I feel like there's a cool story behind this album with the crossroad of influences on this thing you know you do have kind of those Eastern and like Indonesian and Indian influences popping into this really gritty and crazy and wild style of electronic music based in Chicago you know obviously footwork and I do like the aesthetic I like the vibe that those influences create for sure without a doubt but the more I listen to this album just the rhythm sequences the patterns or the lack thereof on some of these tracks because a lot of the songs are very linear as far as composition goes it just felt so methodical and cold typically I like footwork and I like Juke for its groove and just how peppy and insane and off-the-wall and energetic it is I didn't really get that same visceral feel off of this at all it was very cold and very calculated very mathematical which you know definitely has an appeal of its own did appeal to me not particularly but again if anything I described so far sort of interests you you know the the influences that go into this thing um just how sort of strange and robotic and rigid a lot of the tracks on here feel give it a listen you know it is certainly going to be one of the most unique electronic music albums of this year it just didn't really gel with me I don't know this ended up way more inconsistent than I would have liked I just kind of got the the vibe off of this album that Amber didn't really know where she wanted to take it as far as the songwriting style the musical style it just doesn't seem to know what it wants to do with itself and not in the best way I wasn't even awake to start with this album I was I wouldn't even wait to start Oh what why his dad decided to come out with a really like quaint cutesy sort of like indie funky pop singer-songwriter record it's so not his style this vibe does not fit him at all and I don't really think he does the sound much justice either like it feels like he's intentionally trying to make a record for that NPR crowd that for some reason buys a she and him album every single time one comes out yeah it's it's it's it's it's it's it's dad pop its dad pop you know I like Christians last album so much I was pretty excited to see whatever he was going to do next of course and like with his last LP he continues to bring in elements of sequence beats and electronic music laying some of his trumpet performances and you know also the backing musicians on this record with a lot of reverb and some strange effects but maybe he sort of just lays in a little too heavy on this record at least for my taste this album in comparison with his last comes off so new agey semi ambient at points you know it has been a while since New Age jazz has been a thing has had sort of a following and you know has has kind of been active as a genre at least on this kind of level of visibility so maybe it's time for some artists to bring it back and just kind of you know try their hands at it once more now that we live in a new age of kind of studio trickery and post-production you know some interesting sounds could kind of come out of it however I wouldn't say that they're necessarily coming through on this album but you know with each new release I'm pretty sure that Christian Scott is going to be going a different direction trying something new doing something refreshing so I'll just see if the next one you know appeals to me any more than this one did but you know if you are a jazz fan and you're looking for an artist who is taking risks and you know doing something different doing something off the beaten path try this out ition have you given any of these albums to listen did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and thank you for watching and sort of sitting through this wine you know review here's another why you know review next to my head that you should check out subscribe to the channel too and make sure to stay hydrated your fruits and

let's get into the worst tracks of the week oh my god oh my god the worst tracks of the week okay we're going to kick it off with unfortunately you know didn't want to throw this group in here but I'm just so underwhelmed by this track to be completely honest the new Shabazz Palaces song effeminate Shabazz Palaces at this point there there have been some songs from these two forthcoming albums because rapping two albums this year via Sub Pop Records some tracks have really kind of been hits for me others have been misses this is one of those misses because it's just it's just kind of like weird Spacey hip hop navel-gazing you know there's nothing really all that significant about the track instrumentally the flow and the vocal performance from Palliser Lazaro really just kind of left me cold and I feel like topically lyrically what he's trying to get across in the track isn't anything altogether new you know a lot of these same kind of shots and observations about music and are in the hip-hop genre at large I feel like he's kind of said again and again and again on previously released material I'm just kind of failing to see what makes them special or all that intriguing here and it's just kind of disappointing because Shabazz Palaces they came out and they were one of the most unique hip-hop groups to hit at the moment that they dropped and now it just kind of feels like they're kind of paying themselves into a corner a little bit despite the fact their sound was so adventurous they're just not venturing out of the little kind of trademark vibe and aesthetic that they created for themselves or that Pels here created for the project itself and I'm just kind of waiting for the the project to kind of evolve past that or present something you know as radically new and exciting as black up but you know I I digress they're moving on from there the new Liam Gallagher song Chinatown unfortunately did not hit me as hard as Liam's past single really just kind of a middle-of-the-road acoustic ballad here with not a lot of passion not a lot of flavor not a lot of excitement hopefully maybe it sounds a little bit better a little bit more interesting within the context of the entire album that I'm sure he has coming out soon moving on from there the new designer song of life featuring Gucci Mane designer essentially continues to sound just like future in his songs you know sometimes he's not really on the future train other times he very much obviously is Gucci Mane feature on hair is okay but you know honestly it really comes down to designer here and it comes down to the fact that there's just such a painful lack of vision and originality to a lot of his songs to his style to his whole aesthetic and I'm just wondering how long he can continue to just drop these forgettable middle-of-the-road singles without actually releasing an album or like a definitive mixtape for us to could just kind of like BAM this is his sound this is his style this is what he is and now we can like finally come to a conclusion as to whether or not we're really into designer at least I feel like people like me are sort of on that fence I mean there are countless others who have already made the decision like okay it's taking you too long there are only maybe a couple of tracks that you've made that are mildly interesting Panda is just kind of bit of a one-hit-wonder sort of flute kind of situation like where are we going from here however you know while I have been disappointed again and again and again I am still waiting I am still just kind of here patiently sitting and just thinking when are we going to hear that commitment that full project commitment and you know if they're going to be loaded with whatever projects would be loaded with tracks like this it's going to be a bit of a downer moving on from there an even bigger downer would be this new azealia banks track escapades my god the most horrible vocals I've heard on any Azealia Banks song ever I don't I really don't you could say anything else about it like her singing on this track is horrendous and there's no amount of vocal processing or anything that you could do to not make her vocals sound like garbage eyo on this track I just don't know why she doesn't take singing lessons you know or just like dude do another take do another recording the singing really is that awful it's to the point where it's comedic it's like you know the worst person who showed up at American Idol that that day like level of hilarity and you know I'm just kind of wondering when she's either going to pack it in or really just buckle down and just be like you know okay really I'm going to come out with my best album I'm going to come out I'm actually going to care about the sound of my vocals I'm actually going to care about the quality of the song because that's the thing you know I just hear one is Elia Bank song or project after another and it's just like mmm like there's some good ideas here but I just kind of get the vibe that you don't really care and that you're just kind of going through the motions and doing this because you kind of can and you're like this minor music celebrity and and someone will someone will write about it someone will make fun of it someone will talk about it and I guess I guess that's true I am and finally unfortunately the new Arcade Fire song is in this section of the video signs of life yet another in my opinion disappointment from Arcade Fire who continue to just undyingly just rock it forward into this hey guys we're going to do a disco album direction and and not only that but they're just like trying to force these really I roll were the somewhat cringy political lyrics into nearly every single song that they're putting out here so they're really trying to go super political super conscious but give you a dance record to you know a thinkin person's dance record and it's just such a lackluster it's just such a lackluster combination and not only that but I just feel like Arcade Fire they're not the best they're not the best at making dance music I mean hey I like reflector as a single great single their fantastic song but you know for them to continue trying to hammer and push down this road and not really in my opinion having anything to show for in terms of like hey wow this is their best material or Wow like good thing they went down this road because they're really kind of forging a new exciting direction here I really don't feel like that's the case it's just so wash rinse and repeat like these dance music songs there's there's nothing really that deep or that profound or that exciting about them in my opinion and that this one is just as underwhelming as any of them that I've heard so far but those were the worst tracks of the week let's get into the songs that I felt we're just kind of you know met a little on a little on the on the fence with all of them but certainly worth mentioning certainly artists who are worth highlighting here want to highlight the new Saint Vincent song sync Vincent New York guys listen this is in the mess section I don't think it's a terrible song but I really wanted to love this song I really wanted to be excited about this song you always want to be excited about brand new st. Vincent but this is such an underwhelming ballad it's such a it's it doesn't hit hard the lyrics I think are a little melodramatic they're a little like lovesick to the point where like I don't know this this feels a little cliche to me and I feel like she's almost underwriting herself annie is kind of underwriting herself in terms of the lyrical quality here and not only that but I find the instrumental kind of bland of course when I was digging into this track I found out that Jack Antonoff of bleachers Fame produced this thing so you know of course it's going to have that kind of glitzy sleek almost 80s inspired kind of ascetic and vibe to it unfortunately I feel like it kind of takes away from st. Vincent more than it adds you know while I do like Jax production with Lord you know Lord's latest record you know I believe he's worked with Taylor Swift - I think he's worked with Carly Rae Jepsen as well if I'm not mistaken could be mistaken but you know if I'm not mistaken and I've enjoyed his production at other places not enjoying it here you know to me Annie st. Vincent has always been an artist that sure while she writes great ballads she write she writes great stuned she writes great tunes excuse me she's always been an arts that no matter what direction she goes in she's a little bit of an alternative and experimental and a bit of a you know like a little bit of a left-field edge to her that doesn't come through on the song at all unfortunately you know the track just really kind of feels or just kind of wishy-washy to me but moving on from there the new national song guilty party these new national tracks you know I've while they're they're not in the best section in my opinion they've been they've been like a little impressive to me I've been like whoa I'm not like listening to this and feeling like completely despondent and like I want to run away from my stereo right now you know it's like the especially on this track over here I believe the the pianos on this track are really rich the ballot is very nice sure you know it has the kind of same very gritty very very kind of vibe to it like you know most new national songs do but I'm actually kind of liking the tunes that are you know hidden beyond the very dreary and despondent vibe that the National continue to bring in their music so you know I'm just kind of sitting here and waiting to see if maybe the songs come together into a record I'm actually like super impressed with because it's been a while since like maybe their first couple of records since I've really been down for a national album but moving on from there let's give a shout out to the new Mogwai song a party in the dark they come through with a vocal lead track on this one surprisingly a Mogwai typically instrumental typically a post rock band and still I guess in spirit on this song a post rock band but the vocals on this one just kind of lead the way I'm not going to say it's you know reinventing their sound or making it all that electrifying or new or exciting or anything and you know I do think compositionally the guitars could have been a little bit more intriguing could have done a little bit more but still I think the band takes a risk on this track that for the most part pans out you know it's a pretty decent song and looking to see if on this forthcoming record Mogwai continues - you know forge ahead and experiment a little bit more try some new things and if you haven't listened to any Mogwai albums please for the love of God listen a young team excellent record future has a few new tracks out most notably this song with Chris Brown titled pie also one with yg titled extra love not going to say these are the best songs future has ever released however I think these are two of his tightest and Poppaea stand most focused and most well structured singles he's put out in a long time again they're not entirely my vibe excuse me their screw that up I'm not going to say they're entirely my vibe but I think future doesn't just feel like he's just kind of washing and rinsing and repeating a little bit here the guests on the tracks you don't have a good kind of feature spot carved out for both of them I think they both add to the songs especially yg on his feature again it's not the greatest thing I've ever heard but you know certainly a refreshing and again a more structured and more focused direction for future hopefully he sort of continues to do that because a lot of the time I just kind of feel like he just kind of grabs a random ass beat and just sort of does this little warbly auto-tune thing with little to no attention being paid to what he's saying or how he sounds and if a song is a hit then a song is a hit if it's not it's just going to kind of fall into the background because it all sounds mostly like background music anyway these two songs over here they very much sound like foreground music you know it sound like you really kind of focused on these tracks tried to build these tracks out to just be kind of well groomed radio-friendly again well structured and you know looking forward to looking forward to him in the future possibly getting more ambitious in in that regard so that was a surprisingly okay and this new Deerhoof song over here Deerhoof have a new track out titled I will spite survive featuring genoise snare of a white oak now this new single this new track over here is a kind of interesting song for gear for numerous reasons it's very kind of clean very pristine very poppy track definitely not as rough and as distorted and as brittle as a lot of songs from the band's most recent record and not only that but there is a blatant political angle to the lyrics sort of saying that with the powers that be trying to grind us into the ground with either pollution or stripping us of health care or so on and so forth we're going to find a way to live anyway so you're sort of surviving out of spite that's the entire concept of the song and it's actually pretty hilarious so you know listen to the lyrics pay attention lyrics it is kind of funny Jenna Astra I think adds a lot to the track instrumentally production wise I do think it is a little cleaner than I would like a dear hip song to be the little poppier than I would like a deer have song to be and not kind of in a quirky sense you know more like in the Wow I think like almost like our mainstream rock fan could appreciate what the band is doing here on some level you know kind of that wild idiosyncratic character that deer have typically brings to the table not so much here but I still think it's a solid tune still think it's a decent tune and shout out deer have for you know putting this together and um given us some new excuse me material this year let's get into the tracks that I felt were the best tracks of the week whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo first off let's give a shout out to this first one's pretty funny so ugly God ugly God um much respect too ugly God dude's a meme I'm a meme too you know don't think that when I call people a meme I'm insulting them your boy is a meme your melon is a meme so I can't I can't just call somebody else in meme and just inherently have that being shitting on them you know ugly God is a meme I would mean to obviously water great tract and you know killed it on his double XL freshman freestyle happy for him to get on the cover and you know sort of wondering and waiting whether or not he's going to drop a tape or an album soon or something this year I hope so you know it would be awesome to sort of see him kind of transcend that meme status a little bit and sort of become a more legitimate artist but this new single over here that he has out fuck ugly is him recording and writing a literal diss track to himself it's actually ingenious because nobody knows ugly God's flaws better than ugly God and of course the approach that he takes on this track while tearing himself a new one is utterly hilarious and I don't really know what else say beyond that it's just kind of geniusly hilarious it's completely hilarious I love the lyrics I love how wild and kind of crazy sounds on the track really just kind of sounds like he's trying to go in on himself and really sort of like tear himself apart I love it really energetic track lots of fun shout out to ugly God moving on from there Tyler the Creator tired of the Creator he got into the best tracks section with who dad boy good I bought and 911 one slash mr. lonely these two new singles from Tyler they're excellent they're like two of his best songs in a while I do think some of the beat transitions on who that boy toward the end of the track were a little awkward a little weird but I still like this is one of his best songs in a long time this is easily the most excited I've been about a Tyler single in whoa I mean like since Yonkers since um since Wolfe honestly so you know let's get into a little bit of why here beat bangs be is insane Tyler especially on 911 seems like he's been working on his lyricism a little bit like there are actually some bars there that did not blow me away but I actually feel like whoa I'm kind of actually like emotionally connecting here with what you're kind of putting out there doesn't just kind of feel like some weird angry bitter teenage egg sort of phase thing that you're going through especially on who that boy where he legitimately comes off angry dark villainous at a lot of points in the song I'm kind of getting those real vibes of evil from him coming off that track and I like that you know that's obviously what Tyler has been implying a lot of time with his music but in my opinion has been falling so short of okay and now here with his lyrics with his flow with his delivery it finally feels like he's hitting that mark and he's hitting it hard you know I've been sitting here awhile thinking like isn't highly going to put out music soon is there to be a new album soon why is it taking so long why are we waiting so long and now it just kind of feels like okay you know the wait sounds like right now it's becoming worth it it sounds like you spent this time kind of honing your craft a little bit sounds like you spent this time kind of working on this and I think the work is showing you know I think the effort is showing especially on these two new tracks nine-one-one obviously going into a different direction instrumentally and you know sonically much more smooth much more funky strong sense on that track bit of an R&B vibe on there too but Tyler pulls that off too with a really smooth catchy flow you know definitely showing a little bit more versatility because on his last record Cherry Bomb I remember some of those smoother more soulful tracks that he was trying to pull off we're really awkward and did not go over that well sound like the exact opposite in this case so man - great great singles from Tyler here all he needs to do is sort of you know deliver a 10 to 12 other fantastic slap a mod and album and we've got we've got a fantastic record we've got a fantastic record actually like again legit excited for what Tyler's doing here it's really good alright a toukyo has a new single out titled drift or Tokyo rather Tokyo has a new single out title drift his wave theory mixtape that came out a little bit back wasn't too crazy about it just kind of felt a little all over the place but I'm kind of liking what he's doing on this track over here even though the music video does look really silly and ridiculous I do kind of like the way that he's got like kind of fusing this hard modern banging very aggressive hip-hop with elements of like house and EDM music on the course because this dance groove comes in it's like so invigorating and so fresh and so exciting I'm not going to say that Tokyo is like the most original or interesting artist I've come across or anything like that I'm mostly enamored with kind of the hook and the instrumental here you know not to not to say it's all about the production you know certainly it seems like he had a hand and just kind of making sure like hey let's kind of go in this weird direction or just kind of like bring these worlds together on a track very seamlessly that you don't typically get on a single track so you know I certainly can commend him for the single I think it's a decent single and you know looking forward to seeing if he you know some other kind of weird interesting genre fusions coming up in the future so shout out to him for this cut over here drift again drift Lunas has a fantastic new track out titled distrust featuring Denzel curry JK the reaper and now this is a dark grimy banger awesome verse from Denzel curry shout out again to Denzel curry for this great verse on this thing super dark super grimy super gritty make sure you get your ears on it want to give a shout out also to Liars for their track cred woes new album on the way this track it's not quite as darkly synthetic as many of the tracks off of mess or you know weird ambient Spacey very very subtle like off of wish you you know I kind of like the way this two albums kind of complemented each other and was wondering where the band would go next after that this one over here kind of seems like they're going back into the little bit of a post-punk direction excuse me a little bit of a post-punk direction with their sound it's kind of low-key but I kind of like the oddity of it you know it's very it's very oddball it's very kind of unsettling it's very dark I think the appeal of the track lies more in its vibe than it does you know what it's doing with the beat or what it's doing with the vocals or anything like that the tracks got like a strongly unsettling vibe about it that I like a lot and just sort of looking to kind of see that I guess kind of develop and pan out on whatever record they have coming out with it with this weird this is weird ass some weird ass are over here look at this shit this is weird alright let's give a shout out to cara cara benito for their brand-new single forever summer holiday a bright sunny fun quirky silly tongue-in-cheek track kero kero bonito continues to kill it with the summer jams over here you know honestly like how can you have a whole summer go by without a new single from kero kero bonito because like their music is so perfect for the summer you know love that last record of theirs awesome record you guys are the best you know keep killing it keep being sunny keeping talking directly to cara cara benito here key being sunny keep bringing those smiley glitzy glamorous multicolored vibes in your music and it's it's just going to it's just going to continue to go because you guys are just killing it and next I want to give a shout out finally to the track that Boris dropped this week memento mori there are two tracks out from the sports coming record that they have on the way again you know this track and all the others are linked down there in the description this to me is a pretty interesting one for Boris in a while you know as you may know they've been dabbling in a lot of different sounds and a lot of different vibes over the past couple of years you know a little bit of j-pop here a little bit of sludge metal a little bit of pop rat a little bit of pop rock excuse me they've been all over the place stylistically this this song this new track over here really goes into a direction and gives me a vibe from Boris that you know I look for and I typically love in their music it's super heavy it's dense its menacing but it's not just simply this for Rey and to do metal once again you know this is like a really tortured this is a really insane song but they're just like some some oddly melodic and harmonious moments in the track that are like strikingly beautiful the band sort of does something that in my opinion I don't know if they've done this well on this track I don't know if they've done to this degree sort of taking those heavy menacing sounds that they're known for doing so well on a lot of their early work and then combining that with like you know some like really beautiful and again harmonious and rich and smooth their textures and tones to kind of like get this really weird ugly heavy gorgeous Beauty kind of dynamic going in the track but I think you know juxtapose these two sounds these two vibes kind of juxtaposing one another off of one another I don't know how to use that word properly right now really well and that's going to be it guys those are our best and worst tracks of the week again all of those songs are linked down there in the description make sure again to hit up the good people over at seat geek because their app is good good good and fantastic and they sponsored this segment also hit up our amazon associates link as I told you guys our turntable ad link and those shirts that I mentioned at the very very start of the statement there they're right here and they're on the website again the link down there and I will catch you guys in the next video thank you for watching hope you got some good recommendations out of this for ever 
n5C1u86b6Rg,
pejfwSOez5w,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is doing a casual Friday quickie review of this new Portugal two-man album Woodstock Portugal the mana band hailing from Alaska that's been at it for a while now they have numerous records under their belts my favorite of which has to probably be censored colors I love you dramatic and epic and grand instrumentation and songwriting on that record but part of my issue with the band is that they kind of departed from that sound a long time ago and have for record after record kind of gone for something a little bit more underwhelming and straightforward but not necessarily like hard-hitting you know that I guess I've sort of failed to really find my footing my passion in the band's music ever since they kind of change sounds after that record however I was kind of excited to listen to this new album over here because it sounded like they're really kind of reinventing themselves the singles sounded like they were going in a totally different direction Danger Mouse was coming into the fold to do production on this thing the really edgy and crazy album cover also the title and sort of the the rumors and the talk around the record of the band like being hugely inspired by Woodstock in the music of the 60s on this new album over here not only that but some of the political sort of angles that sort of seemed to be coming through on the promotional tracks and you know music video the band had a beef with Infowars of all places so there seemed like you know there were a lot of stars aligning behind this album and you know things that we're telling me hey this is going to be interesting this is going to be like a new era a new page in Portugal demands career so you know I do try to album and you know certainly it is a different record for Portugal the man they do surprise they do go in a different direction but it's not really the kind of surprise it's not really the kind of direction that I personally am looking for I mean easily this is the band's most poppy and accessible album yet while those over Woodstock and sixties references are peppered throughout the album here and there in like a baseline or a guitar line or in a sample or something there's very little about this album that sort of brings the consciousness the rawness the freedom and the freewheeling experimentation of the music of the 60s did because in fact at its core this is just a kind of really safe pop album you know with some rock elements kind of peppered in this wouldn't be the first time in my opinion that the inclusion of Danger Mouse kind of made of bands or groups sound a little blander and I think that's kind of the case with this new record over here the beats don't really do that much for me I don't really think they do much to compliment Portugal demands like songwriting style you know the late the few moments on the record where it's like they're sort of shooting in more to hip-hop direction just kind of feel a little awkward to me the vocals you know while they do kind of have that nasally falsetto that I have kind of come to expect from the band sometimes they don't really hit me as distinct as they had distinctly as they have in the past and I'm just kind of sitting here thinking man if I didn't know this is a Portugal de man album I would have never guessed that this was the band and again not because they're going for something so wildly different than I'm like whoa amazing it's actually because I'm just having kind of a difficult time like pinpointing like man where did you know where did this with their sound go yeah you know it's just kind of a really underwhelming album for me it's kind of odd that they're trying to I don't know celebrate the spirit of this era of music and yet I can't find the spirit of it anywhere on this album it just kind of sounds like a rock group making concessions to the landscape of contemporary pop music and kind of just coming through with more lackluster project as a result of it I'm not really sure what else to say about this album it just really underwhelmed me songs didn't stick with me the instrumental palette you know while it was punchy I just felt like the tunes and the performances weren't there you know the performances are just kind of mild you know they didn't really hit me with all that much fire certainly not as much fires what is featured on the front cover of this thing and again to you know sort of see the cover sort of see those over in those direct references to Woodstock and sort of that the style of music sort of predominantly ruled that festival to sort of see them you know play out on this album is such a watered down sort of uninspired way is just kind of disappointing you know some of my disappointment with this record and maybe even a great deal by disappointment of record with this record most likely comes down expectations because you know the I did expect the man to really kind of try something different and wow me on this record and while they did I guess it was just not what I was interested in hearing as opposed you know again not only that but I feel like they really failed to connect with in any significant way outside of like a little bit of window dressing and pastiche with you know this style of music that they're you know allegedly pulling so heavily from I mean if anything Danger Mouse is inclusion into the fold here seems to influence the album's direction more than anything in terms of just the balance of the instrumentals and kind of the punchiness of the beats you know that again that sort of seems like to be the the ruling factor of the way the music sounds on this thing not the whole Woodstock you know inspiration but I digress yeah just really underwhelmed by this thing you know there's not really much material on here that's allowing me but let me know down that let me do it out booth can't even talk let me know down in the comments what you guys thought of this record did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next and I will catch you guys in the next video there's a video next to my head over here of another review that I think should check out keep watching and have a good one forever 
Kum_z3Mvh8k,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here doing a raw casual Friday review quickie review of this new dj khaled album Jesus Christ that's not the title of the record but that's that's what I want the title of the record to be Jesus Christ this thing is such a mess how did we get here I mean not that dj khaled in my opinion has ever been in albums artist but it certainly seemed like major key was a sign of him taking a step in that direction coming through with a more cohesive project you know there were a lot of decent singles on that project there were a lot of decent tracks on that project but now it just seems like dj khaled much in the same way little yadi did with his last album has completely lost control and it's just like like you know put out anything put out everything just throw anything at the wall that we can produce and just like see if it sticks and maybe that's a decent strategy if you're just like hoping and just praying that anything that you come out with is like accidentally a hit and don't get me wrong there are a few tracks on this thing that going into the album I liked a lot I mean I like that track with Rihanna sure the the Santana guitar lead has worked in there a little a little rough it's a little rough but I like the song generally and also that track I'm the one with you know Justin Bieber quavo so on and so forth like that track quite a bit too I like the sunny fun-loving kind of feel-good vibe of that song you know I think it's a little underrated against this you know for the snobbish set you know I think I did I think it is a little bit of a summertime Bop however beyond that this record is like such a mess like not only in the grander scheme of things because it's 90 minutes long and you have tracks on this thing that are totally unnecessary they're totally throwaway moments where DJ Cal is just like not even you know every once in a while dj khaled just like every once in a while you know popping in every once in a while no I'm talking about like he's yelling all over the song and basically forcing his own meme it's like geez dude you're already a meme you're already a big meme everybody loves your meme status you know how to force it down hard you know we get it your meme you don't got to shove the meme down throats obviously we're here for the meme if if we weren't then we wouldn't be listening to the album you know you don't got to force the mean that hard but geez beyond that there's so many songs on this thing that sound like they're in a rush to be over like they really want to be done the hooks all sound rushed or they just kind of sound like super plugged in super rigid super robotic especially the one would Beyonce and jay-z on here this tractus is dying to be done like this track is like as soon as it starts it's like can't wait to be over can't wait can't wait not be playing it or any when you do get like a decent verse because there are a lot of throwaway verses on this thing a lot of artists phoned it in on this record like Nicki Minaj phoned it in on this album there are a lot of performances that are totally phoned in on this record but even when you get a decent performance like nods you know did a pretty decent verse on this record even when you do get a decent verse a decent performance it's really everything else around it that suffers you know that everything else around is just not salvageable like on that nas track the hook is trash the beat is just okay I don't know how he managed it over that instrumental I just that instrumental pretty mediocre instrumental I would not have done anything with that instrumental but hey you know him and dj khaled they have a thing going i guess they're just going to kind of keep it going again that's just one of many examples on this thing of tracks that just sound so wash rinse repeat you know there's not really a moment on this thing where you know these grease grease grooming screws which you know while they sounded promotional sure like you know jay-z and future they certainly had a chemistry on that track and they complemented each other pretty well on this album I just don't feel that same kind of electricity and chemistry between the guests between the features you know maybe a little bit on I'm the one you know again Bryson tiller Rihanna sure worked you know they complimented each other but there aren't a lot of moments on this thing where I feel like the guests complement each other there aren't a lot of moments on this thing where I don't feel like the beats are just generic pop trash there aren't a generic pop rap trash excuse me and there are a lot of moments on this thing where the hooks actually like impress me or stick with me or feel like hey that was like a bit of a stroke of genius there you know that happened with me every once in a while on major key didn't happen at all here and again I kind of feel like dj khaled is really stretching the capacity of his meme on this thing you know because I feel like he's just really like I'm going to shove it down your throat by the time this is over you're going to be tired of it I guarantee it although I'm sure that most people are not listening this record for beginning to end they're kind of just like you know picking their favorite tracks picking their favorite singles listening to the songs the feature their favorite artists you know and anybody who listens this thing from beginning to end and and loves it I commend you my my hat is off to you I didn't even start this review with a hat that's how that's how off my hat is to you I didn't even wear one I salute you as well but if the thing is just a mess the thing is a total mess it's too long there's so many filler tracks so many throwaway tracks both so many throwaway hooks and just so phoned in like DJ Khaled if he's going to continue to put out material like this in the future continue to put out albums that are this big into the future he's going to have to demand just a little bit more from his guests you know he's going to have to demand just a little bit more from his producers a little bit more from the rappers the singers that he has on the project because you know some of them are not doing their best work here they really aren't you know what the thing is like dj khaled as popular as he is he's still kind of over a barrel because you know he's still at the mercy of the people who he works with you know he doesn't produce he doesn't rap he doesn't sing you know he sort of like collective eise's everybody which is fine thing is like you know he can't just be like well screw you if you're not going to rap on my record all rap on my record like he that you know he can't do that you know he can't just say like well nas if you're not going to be on my album I'll replace you with this other you know you can't do that so I don't know yeah I'm disappointed with this although I don't know why I had high hopes in the first place well it's a mess it's it's a mess

-J85naYNmck,hi everyone big city fish Hannah here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this brand new Fleet Foxes album crack up this is the third full-length album from Washington contemporary folk outfits tweet foxes it's their first album in six years which is kind of long considering the band only took three years to follow up their debut I mean LCD soundsystem broke up and reunited the band and pretty much the same span of time regardless I'm excited to hear this new album even if it did take a while to get here not only because I kind of enjoyed some of the songs leading up to the release of this album but also helped us miss blues was my album of a year in 2011 by Algar there now if there was one thing that struck me about the tracks leading up to this record it's that they were a little more obtuse than I was anticipating new Fleet Foxes songs to be but that's kind of this new album in general while the band does kind of keep their trademark aesthetic the bright very cavernous reverb the dense layers of guitar and vocal harmonies and strings but much like on helplessness blues the band shakes up their songwriting fundamentals a little bit for a fresher approach even if it is a little more difficult this time around crack up doesn't depend on the rustic and root seafolk isms of Fleet Foxes debut record nor is it as grand and dramatic and driving and focused as helpless as blues crack up is a slightly more experimental venture probably the most experimental Fleet Foxes record so far leaning a little bit harder on linear and winding the song structures repetition to at points to kind of lull the audience into a hypnosis sudden shifts and volume into sound like the band are starting to incorporate electronics into their repertoire - I mean right from the start of this record it should be no surprise that this is going to be a different fleet foxes album because Robin hits us right away with these weird whisper quiet vocals it's it's kind of like right here in front of our very ears he's inventing mumble Foulke then all of a sudden were hit with this sudden rush of panoramic instrumentation we get more very quiet vocals we're getting hit with that loud dynamic again it's kind of like a sonic roller coaster I don't think it's an entirely perfect experiment and it does leave the album off with kind of an awkward introduction but as a fan I'm at least sitting here wondering where is this going am kind of intrigued now there are other tracks in the track listing here that I find equally entrancing like 3rd of May where the band aggressively hits these instrumental highs with just hard steadily strung guitars and some furiously bowed string sections later in the track the first half is complemented with this really dreamy instrumental soundscape of like fluttering pianos twinkling guitar or Peggy of the soundscapes on this thing almost have like a Godspeed Ian post-rock Ian kind of flavor to them I'm also kind of impressed with how organic and natural some of the electronic sound at the introduction of the song Casius there's also a really subtle like lapping water sample at this point the song too and it's cool that Fleet Foxes can essentially make folk kitronik music at this point on the album without losing the original kind of rootsy appeal of the band it's not like the moment any electronics or keyboards kind of come in things go kind of static or stiff or digital I love the wood wind and string interlude that this coasts into later in the track mean the band is really flexing their instrumental muscles on this thing and it sounds great I mean there are numerous tracks on this thing where we get some kind of grand instrumental interlude or some kind of unexpected surprise like the pretty electric guitar leads all over a 1-point in mere Ixtapa or at the very finish of this track where we have a huge building wall of instrumentation at the june phase of the song on another ocean the band essentially breaks into a a kind of swagger infused full croc groove definitely did not expect to hear something rock this hard on a Fleet Foxes album I mean it you know if it comparably iraq s-- kind of hard and i also like the way that the outro of the song if you need to keep time on me sort of submerged into this fluttering wall of pianos and just melts away there are a lot of experiments with song structure on crack up to there at least four tracks on this thing that work in two major musical phases and tracks two and three are extensions of one another lyrically the song if you need to keep time on me is kind of referencing the yearning for friendship on the previous track so this album is far from just a random collection of songs or anything like that you know there's some deep and lovely and gorgeous connections between each song on this record whether that be lyrical or instrumental there are a handful of songs on here though they seem to be kind of sturdy standalone ballads that have very clear and definitive beginnings and endings they're a bit of a nice breather from the heavy and dense and winding songs that make up a bulk of the album I love the grand fool's errand this epic sweeping ballad that makes for one of the few moments on this record that would have fits snugly into helplessness blues there's the very wintry and beautiful kept woman which is actually so gorgeous almost like a religious experience and the song if you need to keep time on me you know it's a pretty simple refrain and ballad you know that there is something about it that is maybe a little too primitive I do wish there was a little bit more instrumental progression to this track it feels a little bit like a motif but you know I still do enjoy the sentiment of the song there's so many great tracks in the tracklist I still am kind of slightly baffled by I should see Memphis which is a kind of drained very downtrodden ballad it's a little patience testing but there is something kind of dark and unsettling about the tone of the song - that keeps me somewhat drawn to it might grow on me with more lessons in the future and the title track on this thing is the grand epic finish that this record deserves the start I will say is a little inconspicuous but eventually the song builds into this grand marching procession of instrumentation that eventually coasts out into a somewhat ambient horn outro overall I thought this was a really great 55 minute record for Fleet Foxes the band really came through after having the wait for 6 long years for a brand new record by will say it did take a little while to come to that conclusion because this album is again instrumentally dense the song structures are not easy to get a grip of kind of make familiarity difficult but once I got a hold of the twists and turns that this album took me through I really came to love it this record became as inspiring as any Fleet Foxes album I enjoyed in the past and I loved the band was able to take so many structural and instrumental risks on this album while still maintaining a lot of the core fundamental ideas and sort of trademark sounds that make fleet foxes Fleet Foxes not only that but I feel like the band has arisen as a slightly more consciously foxes on this album as on the track Casius there are some very clear references to the death of Alton sterling and black lives matter protests Robin expresses sensitivities and concerns about the way society treats women on the following track and the track kept woman but much of this album actually deals lyrically in themes of isolation and loneliness friendship distance from others and that need for other people to be a part of your life and that for me philosophically is kind of the big takeaway from this album which is you know actually pretty great because you know the philosophical take away from helplessness blues as part of made helpless as blues so powerful to me now keep in mind I don't think this new record is as focused as helped missus blues the beginning and ending I think could have been a little bit more sturdy clearer more decisive and there were at least a couple of songs in the midst of the track listing that I was somewhat cold on but outside of that I'm really loving this album you know it is a difficult and a dense listen but a very gratifying one too and I'm pretty excited to see Fleet Foxes continuing with new studio material I'm feeling a decent strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best for the best what should I review next over here next to my head is a review of the previous Fleet Foxes album love that record again my album of the year click on that video watch that video stay locked in with your melon or you know there's a link over here where you can subscribe to the channel too and that's it I'll catch you guys in the next video stay hydrated get some sleep forever 
YAmxuIITQeA,ah hi everyone poppy here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new Vince staples album big fish Theory Vince staples is a Long Beach rapper this is his second full-length commercial album following up 2015 summertime oh six album which he hit pretty big with and last year's prima donna EP which were you know a collection of a handful of tracks tied together pretty well and was easily one of his darkest and most gritty and weird projects yet now as you may already know I liked summertime oh-6 but I was not as crazy about it as some fans and critics were a major issue for me on this album came down to structure and organization of the songs while there were a lot of great flows and instrumentals on this thing a lot of the songs structurally just kind of felt half-baked just under written not only that but all of these flimsy songs kind of compiled on top of each other for an entire hour across two short discs and big fish theory over here feels like in my opinion it could have been the third disc of summertime oh six on this thing vince hands us another 36 minutes of material instrumentally I think that the sonic palette is a little bit riskier boasting beats from the likes of PC musics Sophie who on the song yeah right combines his bubblegum bass style with like a little bit of trap Zac set off whoo I have not heard of up until this project provides quite a few instrumentals that have more of a dance music vibe to them at the very intro of the album Zac provides like this UK garage style groove which I couldn't even imagine been staples ever wanting to rap over and the beats he provides later on the album actually come from an array of dance music disciplines for Vince to be going a little dance here on this new record over here is kind of a surprise to me especially since his bars and delivery are usually pretty cold and gritty and cut through I don't know what initially sparked the desire to go into this groove your direction especially since if you isolate his rapping his flows his delivery outside of the context of the instrumentals he doesn't change up his style all that much here the speed he's spitting out on the intro song crabs in a bucket is certainly impressive but kind of sit here and wonder if the droney ambient intro the very soft quiet interlude the somewhat hypnotic and very airy and ethereal female vocals that kind of cast the song out at the very finish do these sounds really compliment Vince's style especially considering some of the grim visuals and racial tensions brought up in the lyrics and the song structure on this thing I wouldn't call it basic or run-of-the-mill but it certainly is odd and awkward and somewhat primitive in that it doesn't really do much in terms of building up tension or interest or excitement it just kind of lies flat there the whole time as Vince kind of raps over it structurally the song love can be is even stranger as it seems like Vince's playing second fiddle to his own instrumental and his own vocal guests as the only point on the song where he really has any presence is on a sweet 16 he drops at the very end of the song it's like he gave himself a feature on his own album which is actually not a bad idea considering a feature spot is usually when I enjoy hearing Vince the most and undeniably he does drop one of the tightest verses on the entire album here I mean I love that bar about never letting a bitch little bow-wow him never a lot like on summertime oh six I still feel like the ability to build a sturdy song that is engaging from beginning to end is still kind of eluding staples it does happen occasionally the song big fish I would say is a prime example probably the most satisfying groove on the entire album excellent sticky ear warm hook gummy bassline you can really tell that this is an instrumental style this is a style of rap that Vince is just at home at he dominates this song so much his flow his charisma on this track makes it so attention demanding from start to finish unfortunately everything great about this track is contrasted negatively on the very next song the Elissa interlude it has this Spacey instrumental that really kills what little momentum the album had going so far this weird vocals snippet from this girl that really adds nothing to the context of the record or anything that Vincent raps about for a great deal of the album and also his awkward singing at the second half of the song just makes me want to get the entire track immediately Vince tries going long again on a fully fleshed-out song with the track 7:45 ultimately a thankless track I'm having a hard time finding the right context for it's too slow to dominate the dancefloor it's not gritty enough to come off dark and it's way too stiff to sound sexy the track is intentionally skeletal and kind of spacious but Vince's voice just sounds kind of lonely and unsupported in the instrumental and lyrically I mean the song is about him driving a 745 picking up a girl at 7:45 they go to a restaurant she hits the oyster bar I'm not exactly at the edge of my seat thankfully there are a few more solid songs deeper into the tracklisting here namely yeah right with Kendrick Lamar definitely the most insane and forward-thinking track on the entire album sure because of Kendrick Lamar's appearance and as I said earlier Sofie did be instrumental there are these weird warped kind of metallic snares all over the beat the bass is huge and distorted and almost envelops and covers Vince's voice and Kendricks voice it's just kind of swallowing everything but bass on this thing is a monster there's some weird disorienting edits that I like a lot to Vince's first verse is pretty much about vain rappers the second vain women lyrically the hook is kind of basic but at least it's super catchy same oh and party people I kind of like these songs there is something that's kind of like I don't know a tongue-in-cheek or intentionally or bad about them but it's kind of being self-aware about how clunky and awkward they are samo features all these gritty bars and rattling high hats and weird squawking synthesizers and it's almost like ironically weird because Vince staples confidence is really the star of the show on this track it makes all of the song makes sense and sound like yes this is this is convincing and his voice just feels so much bigger on this track than it does on so many other cuts it's like he's really just in the microphone space swallowing it in the listeners hole and the weird the do the same thing like course other thing is it's just a hilariously lazy again it's like Vince's making a unlistenable track on purpose I guess playfully unlistenable I'm not I'm not on the song it is a fun track it is an entertaining track but but only for who do have an ear for the weird party people I think runs a similar racket it's a party song but it's intentionally so dark and weird that you wouldn't necessarily want to party do it the hook also is just super spacious and does not hit hard most of it is vents shouting into what sounded like an empty room you're saying party people yet these tracks seem to have so much quirk and personality and alternative ideas packed within them that the fact that they're built on such simple plain aibee aibee structures that they kind of transcend it they overcome it however the songs surrounding these tracks at this moment in the tracklisting maybe not so much especially the song rain come down not only am i floored that this was a single to this album because it's such a I don't know lackluster uninspiring track in my opinion but it's the outro to the warbly shouting auto-tuned hook just really does nothing for me whatsoever and I don't really think Vince gives one of his best performances at this point on the album either in my opinion the album is ok just kind of like summertime oh-6 I guess in a way it's less testing and taxing because it's half as long without question Vince staples is a talented rapper he has flow he has personality he has delivery and just like on his last record I still think he has a good ear for creative and off the beaten path production he's certainly more adventurous than his contemporaries in that he will wrap over instrumentals that take him outside of his comfort zone but it's not like the instrumental palette of this record is so adventurous that the styles of music instrumentally on this record have have not been found before don't exist anywhere else it's just unlikely to hear a rapper at Vince's popularity level pulling on these types of beats which is nothing to be discounted ultimately I think some of the experiments and tracks on this record don't pan out and on top of that Vince to me is still more of a rapper than he is a songwriter because Vince is still pulling out quality verses he's still getting quality rap performances but he encases them in these really weak flimsy song structures with mediocre hooks some of which I don't think are that sure of themselves imagine being solo on chorus ideas that you have to rearrange a Rick Ross hook for your record that's the point that we're at given that Vince has two solid albums out so far what his strengths and weaknesses are at least to me are pretty clear which is why I'm kind of confused why he doesn't on what is most likely an endless sea of talent I mean Justin Vernon is on this thing the endless sea of talent willing to work with him to kind of bolster up the things that his songs kind of lack that's just me getting into hypotheticals though the album is decent the album is fine I think there are a lot of potholes and it does have some clear weaknesses to it I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next and there is another event staples review over here next to my head that I think you should check out my review of his last full-length album summertime of six give that a watch and I will catch you guys in the next review stay hydrated eat your fruits and vegetables big fish Theory forever 
ymZpSOlOUSs,ah hi everyone I'm Vinny back tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you of the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album murder of the universe murder of the universe is the second full-length album this year from Australian psych garage prog rock band king gizzard and the lizard wizard who is in the middle of a pretty ambitious commitment to release like four or five albums this year and between the all acoustic paper mache drain balloon and the throttling seamless experience of nonagon infinity and the band's recent foray into microtonal tuning I think they've been on a bit of a creative streak as well too so of course because all of that I'm excited to listen to this new album excited to get my ears all over the band was releasing huge chunks of this three-part album prior to the official release in stores I tried to spoil as little of the album as possible for myself and yes like I said this album is separated into three distinct phases separated by tracklist and by title and it rounds out at about 47 minutes but the tracks on the album still come together as a pretty holistic experience much in the same way that they did on nonagon infinity which instrumentally is pretty similar feels a little bit like a sister album in a way I mean the title nonagon infinity is even referenced in the song Lord of Lightning just like on nonagon infinity with this LP we're talking about fast performances driving grooves linear song structures that are just propelling to their next musical destination of course a lot of these grooves are topped with sharp burning soaring guitar leads that are really angular really catchy also if there's something that makes this album special instrumentally is that there are a lot of kind of dark weird very sinister keyboard embellishments and passages too which adds to an overall darker tone to this album as well darker than anything I think the band is put out so far and this is a mood that's enhanced by these spoken word passages they're very morbid very apocalyptic and they're littered throughout most of the record and I say littered to illustrate just how many of them there are on this album it's not like you get a few here and there and it's not even like you just get one per track sometimes there are multiple spoken word bits within a single song honestly the album can't really go more than two minutes at a time without at least a little spoken word either by way of the nearly monotone young woman who has a very cold chilly delivery in the first two parts of the record or in the third where we kind of had this male voice that sounds sort of warped a little robotic he's essentially playing the part of a cyborg in the last leg of the record and honestly in theory I don't mind spoken word passages in fact I love spoken word passages some of my favorite albums have them some of my favorite albums have very long ones some of my favorite albums have a lot of them but god this is this is too much which is unfortunate because I like the three separate narratives of the record I mean the first part of it being much about transformation divine transformation with a lot of themes of evil and power and control being addressed in the second part it seems to set the stage for like an epic battle I think between this creature called the Balrog and the Lord of lightning and the last bit of the record seems to take almost like a bit of a sci-fi turn with a very dystopian outlook toward the future of featuring the cyborg character who wants nothing more than to experience death and he also yearns for the ability to vomit in fact that's mostly what he's yearning for for his section of the record but the placement and mixing of these spoken word passages is really disruptive how often they pop up where they pop up how they're mixed there are only a few moments on the album altered beast to being an example where the spoken word passages actually feel like they're mixed they're blended properly into the instrumentation they actually feel like they exist in the same space as the music most of the time they're just tacked on top of the music as if I'm listening to some kind of poetic director commentary over the album itself it's really to the point where it sounds like someone just won't shut up while the music's playing and the thing is these passages they don't they don't always turn up in spaces where the music sort of opens up and provides them a platform like on the song altered beast 3 all of a sudden during one of the Bands slowest heaviest and most gratifying crochet on the entire record of course we get a poetic spoken word passage which just sucks the momentum and the energy and the excitement out of what should be an amazing moment on this record there are moments where these passages are placed that seem to make more sense than others either where we have a bit of a downtime instrumentally or toward the beginning or toward the finish of a track or maybe over one of the many one-minute segues in the tracklisting of this thing but even when the these passages are placed well because they're you so awfully on most of the album whenever I hear one I just want to escape I just want to get away and this is pretty much the case for each leg of the album to varying degrees it's terrible at the first leg it gets the worst at the last leg the second leg for me is really where some of the compositions shine through the spoken-word passages or we're just not getting that many balrog Lord of Lightning loved those tracks and in the last leg you know digital black excellent song too and don't get me wrong it's not that I think the album is unlistenable I think what king gizzard attempted here is really ambitious really creative pretty unique on paper it looks amazing but an execution it leaves a lot to be desired not only because of what I said but sometimes I feel like the spoken word passages while I do love that they bring depth and context to King gizzards usually straightforward and very blunt lyrics sometimes I think they're just over contextualizing everything by the point of vomit coffin I feel like the spoken word passages aren't really establishing anything that hasn't already been established up until this point at least not anything I really care about hearing other than the music you're talking over I will admit the finale which is a detailed description of our cyborg protagonists death via puking is is hilariously grim but by that point I'm just sick of these spoken word passages I really am for me this album just could have been so much better is it rushed is it unrealized potential is it just doing too much maybe a little vol 3 for me despite that I think that King gizzard are recording and penning some of their most fantastic instrumental bits in their entire career the album again has been released with such a glaring and obvious flaw to it an annoying flaw to it that I'm just surprised got completely overlooked and left on the record it's just kind of like the definition of overkill I'm feeling the lightest of sixes on this album transition have you given the south of Melissa did you love it if you hate it and so on and so forth you know they'll deal next to my head over here make sure you check out my last King gizzard review

H7Jh2STd06A,hitting mute guys with another quickie review in the hotel room this new 2 Chainz album pretty girls liked rap music they like that trad music don't they 2 Chainz as you most likely know is a southern rapper who broke pretty big with his debut commercial album based on true story which if you remember I talked about recently in my video where I was discussing 10 albums that I kind of changed my mind on over the years and I did certainly change my mind on that record because in retrospect it was really funny really entertaining 2 Chainz came through with an incredible amount of personality and you know I just don't know what I was thinking at the time I apologize it's a decent record and I think 1 the 2 Chainz yeah I wasn't the only one who disliked the album but I don't think he gets enough props for the record ok now this new one over here it's almost like the album that if I had heard it back when I didn't enjoy based on a true story maybe I would have liked it more than I do now or loved it you know you could certainly say that this is maybe his most solid album considering how long it is a very long record and considering how long it is it is pretty solid in terms of tone an instrumental character kind of sticking to a you know sort of moody sort of Spacey trap sound and it is I think it sounds like his most professional project you know there's not anything all together goofy or absurd like much of based on a true story was uh but you know now that I kind of have had a bit of a 180 with what works for me with 2 Chainz and what doesn't you know I'm kind of sitting here listening this record sure you know there if you stand there's some standout tracks certainly the opener is easily one of his most lyrical kind kind of like narrative based songs OG Kush diet really gritty grimy track that I thought was great 4 a.m. with Travis Scott is pretty good as well Travis Scott you know with his usual vocal schtick brings a lot to the song trap check is pretty dark and nasty and dank and and so asleep with his sleep when you die you know a grind anthem if you will you know 2 Chainz and he plays it pretty much too you know the the moody somewhat Spacey trapped sound of the now not so much the banging and super aggressive and you know rattling and very noisy sound that trap sort of broke in with you know trap for whatever reason over the years the the mainstream sound of it you know with latest releases from egos especially with culture has grown kind of mellow you know at least in the mainstream you know you do have those underground artists that are greatly influenced by the sound and you know a little pump for example and and xxx who are super aggressive super distorted you know off-the-wall insane but a lot of the mainstream artists you know future to have grown increasingly mellow with their sound I think 2 Chainz gives into that a little bit and I'm kind of sitting here thinking you know where the earworm hooks where are the bangers you know the features are ok but they just seem like a little too trendy and very agreeable the entire album for me feels a little middle-of-the-road and there's not anything on the album that hit me out that hit me as being all too outlandish or fun I mean sure with based on a true story I didn't love the record but there certainly were tracks that exemplified a you know an incredible amount of character and quirkiness on the part of 2 Chainz that I did enjoy at the time like dope peddler you know there's not really a dope peddler on this album you know the the most sort of fun and witty and hilarious the album gets is every once in a while you know to chain sort of throws us a bar I mean there was one boy album were in the middle of in the middle of a verse he's just going all that mumble you know so it's like he's literally making fun of it impersonating mumble rappers you know before he just sort of tells that to off again you know a very solid consistent and professional sounding project very focused sounding project you know but where is sort of the vibrant personality and sense of humor that 2 Chainz wrote in on you know that sort of seems to be kind of gone on this album and it hasn't really been exchanged with anything because it's not like this album in response to that went super aggressive or super great you know again it just sort of feels a little too smooth it feels a little too middle-of-the-road and so many songs kind of breezed by without leaving all that strong of an impression in terms of a really great hook or a fantastic set of hilarious bars so you know again I don't think it's a terrible project you know it's very listenable and I don't foresee this project getting a lot of bad reviews because there's not really anything that stands out is altogether horrible on this thing but there wasn't really anything that stuck out to me as being terribly unique or amazing either you know it has a decent vibe to it but definitely doesn't bring the heavy-hitting personality that I love hearing from from 2 Chainz but you know those are my thoughts on the record let me know what you guys thought down in the description there's another review over here I think you should check out check out that review watch it watch it watch it you can actually watch it'll be my other 2 Chainz review for based on a true story you know you can watch me be a jackass and sort of change my opinion on that record you check out my old opinion on 2 Chainz other stuff and that'll be that ok I will catch you guys in the next video forever 
oM9eEHyr2xI,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here you know who it is and hey even when I'm here at VidCon a music nerd has to stay busy and hit you guys with a a quickie review on the old I and I'm here to talk about this this new Isle wise record you guys have been you know asking me repeatedly and understandably so you know for my thoughts on this album for weeks and weeks and weeks and you know I have already reviewed or touched upon the previous two projects obviously the Isle wise is a side project spearheaded by Andy Morin and Zach hill of Death Grips Fame you know Zach also telothane and much more now this new record over here you know I have great respect for two of these guys I love the last Isle wise record of course you know I love Death Grips material I have great respect for their creative process you know what they've created up until this point and I've just been kind of sitting on this album for weeks and weeks and weeks just waiting for the moment when it's going to sink in there's going to be an aha moment like it's all just going to make sense it's going to sound it's going to sound great to my ears and it's just not happening it's not happening I'm just so incredibly disappointed in this album but but not really in the project itself because up until this point I all wises have proven themselves to be a project that sounds like Andy and Zac just kind of use it as just a bit of a weird run off creative outlet where they just do whatever they feel like doing I mean the first record was kind of a weird noise poppy lo-fi rock record the second record had elements of progressive rock of art rock it was really absurd and off-the-wall and hard hitting there were some incredibly brutal moments to the production too that reminded me a little bit of Death Grips and this new record over here it's got kind of a bit of a watery strange garage' and kind of psychedelic quality to it too and while I do like some of the instrumentation on the visceral tracks you know the more hard-hitting tracks and more aggressive tracks and I do think some of the studio trickery is kind of cool with the way that they kind of make the drew the the beats and a lot of a synth sound really wavy and watery and like a little trippy very synthetic the album just sounds so hideous to me I'm the slower tracks are as boring as watching paint dry and it's like Andy and Zac did their best to only include the most horrid hideous and unlikable vocal melodies that they could in every single song the melodies on this album are absolutely like a chore to listen to I don't know it's like they were intentionally trying to make every melody sound as ugly and unlikable and unlistenable as possible and you know again I don't think it's really a mark against either of their talents because I don't really use iodized as a representation of Andy and Zac's potential it just kind of seems like again a weird side project that they just kind of let off steam in and if it's good it's good if it's bad it's bad you know it seems like obviously a project that doesn't really focus on focus and they're just kind of playing with lightning in a bottle and if it works it works it doesn't it doesn't we're just kind of recording just a record here and just kind of exploring different avenues and different sounds every with every single record with every single project we come out with this just happens to be the one so far that was an incredible mist to me however that doesn't really mean anything in the future of Eyal wise because I'm banking on the next album sounding completely different than the previous one as has been the case with every project so far you know I'm kind of disappointed that you know they didn't continue with the sound that they forged on the sophomore record but you know I mean it's like I just got to respect the fact that they're just trying something different with each record obviously and this is just one that did not click with me you know the songs fell really flat for me melodies again horrible and while yeah sure you know I thought some of the production you know some of the just that the the tone the tambour of the instruments the way they were kind of manipulated in the mix sounded pretty cool it did get old after a while you know sonically I think the album is a little bit of a one-trick pony so you know this one is just not for me just not interested in this one at all and I'll just try out the next one and see if I end up digging that one yeah that's going to be it you know over here is a another you another quickie review that I think you should check out and I will see you guys in the next video I hope you're doing well and regular review schedule come back soon forever 
hDYjI2WpMe8,so ii what was it going to say what was it what was I going to say I don't know I'm you I don't know what you're doing what was in you're messing this up no one's going ever taken seriously as music reviewer again hi everyone single payer here the Internet's healthiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new elder album reflections of a floating world these guys are a Massachusetts band releasing their fourth full-length album here and for over a decade now the band has been building one monstrous album after another off of the sounds of stoner and psychedelic rock of doom metal now previously I have not been that big into the band's music because I have felt that some of their stuff has been like a slight exercise in nostalgia you know though I completely understand why albums such as dead roots stirring would resonate so deeply with metal fans who prefer maybe a more purist approach in their doom the solid riffs the tripi guitar leads and solos the very dense thick heavy mix the head banging grooves what's not to like but on the band's next album lore elders started dabbling a little bit in more gloomy moods on their record more melody more mid pace riffs and passages were worked into tracks like dead weight so even though that LP did not wow the band was certainly pushing themselves outside of their comfort zone a little bit they continued to do so on this new LP over here with the sound that is more diverse more mature but not in such a way where the band loses their original appeal elder is still bringing the massive riffs in the dark grim atmosphere they introduced on their last album but everything this time around feels a little more intensified a little more fine-tuned the sound is a bit more dense the performances are more visceral the space here more subtle moments on the album feel just a bit more delicate on the introductory track of the record the band comes back at least a couple of times with these rib cage rattling riffs right after just a very very quiet very very small and very tension building our passage the band is really doing their best to make the song sound and feel dynamic I would even call some spots on this record like kind of catchy thank you Anna which is actually a pretty sticky refrain on the record also we have a very intricate and hard-hitting introduction on the next track the falling veil which features these busy busy rhythms that syncopate very tightly with these harmonized guitar leads previously I didn't even know Elder was capable of or really interested in writing metal music that is this lively it's moments like this on the album where elder is actually working in elements of progressive rock into their repertoire and fusing doom metal with prog rock was a trick that I enjoyed a lot earlier this year on the new pallbearer album too though elders approach is noticeably different while Paul bearer's incorporation of progressive rock leads them to I guess a more antenna k-- and a more melodic conclusion elders answer to that mix that formula is to play more flashy play more aggressively this is not one of those patients testing stoner or doom albums that basically redundantly lull you into a boredom induced hypnosis with the same two or three riffs for like 12 minutes straight now don't get me wrong the songs on this record are long you know most of them are above 10 minutes but while they are long-winded they're also electrifying and blood pumping their ever-changing their versatile it was even a moment toward the end of the second track on here where the soaring guitar leads in the mix we're kind of whaling away almost as if they have been lifted out of a post rock song or something and the keyboards that are suddenly incorporated into the song blind are surprisingly great considering that this is not usually an instrument that elder has been known to make a focal point of in their music the amount of structural detail that the band works into a ten-minute song track after track after track is incredible it's like on each song here they're trying to embark on a massive but mini metal opus that is until the song Sonntag which feels mostly kind of like a impromptu jam extension off of the previous track which is not necessarily a bad idea this point on the album and certainly I don't think the results are horrible but they're certainly more underwhelming than the previous four tracks not only that but I think that there could have been something in the way of like a a strong ending on this cut still at this point on the album it is nice to hear the band performing in a much more fluid and loose setting especially after the very dense four tracks that preceded this cut it's kind of a very necessary breather before the band comes through with the finishing track which I'm actually just slightly more disappointed with because considering everything that preceded this moment on the album and you know that sonntag interlude type track I'm hoping for and crossing my fingers for just like a huge finish a big finish something epic something grand something's going to melt my face off unfortunately this is not really the pull out all the stops moment on the record that I was hoping for though it does seem like the band does try to some degree we get surprised touches of string sections during a few points on the track which are nice in theory though I wonder whether or not they really elevate the sound of the song all that much considering just how saturated the mix is with guitars it's like the strings barely carry any weight still though this track does feature one of the stronger vocal performances on the entire record I guess while I'm picking apart the album I will say that there were some tracks toward the beginning of the album that I wish had a stronger larger louder vocal presence but the longer I listened to the record the more I noticed that hey it's almost like the vocals are getting more aggressive and a little bit louder in the mix as the album goes along and they pretty much come out on top in the end the very end of this song though is very solid one of the more epic moments on the album it definitely gives me a sense of closure for the record and I don't know what else to say man this is just one of those records that you listened to it and everything about it that is great is just so obvious from the get-go you know it did nothing about what makes this album a fantastic doom metal album what makes this album just a great metal album period is just right there it's on the surface it's plain as day the band's just hitting you with BAM this is what's so great about what we're doing this is what's great about the record and we're just going to wow you with it for almost an hour very great adventurous do metal record with some strong notes and elements of progressive rock really impressed with the band's performance and writing and the production on this thing and it's pretty amazing elder was able to reinvent themselves and the way that they did for this new release over here I'm feeling a decent strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't die or cry

WxY7yOmZs4w,hi hi everyone best need teeth tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lord Alba melodrama Lorde is a New Zealand pop singer and songwriter who hit it huge off of some breakout tracks from her debut EP of the love club EP specifically the song Royals when Lord started turning heads in 2013 she was an exciting new voice in the world of pop music but the start of her career was very much obviously that of an artist who wasn't planning on becoming an overnight sensation because the sudden rush of attention thanks to the track Royals created this instant demand for more music by the summer we were hit with the tennis court EP and then later in the fall her debut album pure heroine which contained highlights from the previous EPS including Royals and I get that Lorde and her label were doing their best to take advantage of the first year of hype behind her music but the finished product on pure heroine was a little rushed it sounded like a loose collection of tracks that were just too uniform and sound to skeletal too basic too simple to really work as a full record and despite the fact that I saw quite a bit of potential in her singing in her voice in her style she did kind of come off like a one-trick pony which is unfortunate because I thought most of her songs at least the best songs off of this album sounded incredibly mature considering what age she was when she wrote and recorded them and that it would be great to hear whatever she had to offer several years into the future when she had improved her skills at songwriting and performing and here we are several years into the future brand new album melodrama which was teased toured with a handful of singles the biggest of which has easily been the song green light which is kind of funny considering that is maybe my least favorite of all the singles on this record mostly because it feels like kind of a disappointing departure from what made Lords music appealing to me in the first place the stark minimal beat driven instrumentals the very dramatic vocal performances essentially finding power in simplicity which is certainly the case for the introduction of the track but it does not take long for the song to start introducing these four to the floor kick drums and these very very dance music friendly piano chords ten tenten tenten tenten tenten tenten there's some zany vocal harmonies happening in the background at some points the track for me for a lord song it just kind of feels overkill the lead vocals which are really the selling point to me in Lords music just feel like they have less prominence they're sort of awkward place especially as this dance kick drum starts going and immediately Lord starts writing herself a little out of her vocal range with a low point in her singing all these sounds in the bond that final note there being one that she grazes more than she hits I'm similarly cold on the song sober the track seems to build up a lot of tension with these subtle verses and a very cerebral beat and this tension is never really quite resolved even on the hook even on the groovy beats which up toward the end of the track even with some of the steamy horns where the record really gets going for me is on the song homemade dynamite it's a track that's really coy and playful and built upon the strengths that I think made Lords music great to begin with but now they're elevated with better production better since cool little weird experimental synth embellishments and a very soft breathy but incredibly sticky hook to dynamite things also get playfully cute on the song to do a song that features the soft but driving guitars that take us through these endearing lyrics about a young love figuring itself out and again the lyrics a little flirty talking about how we're so great that they'll hang us in the Louvre in the back but still the Louvre and the hook the refrain on this thing is actually pretty funny to the broadcast boom boom boom boom and make them all dance to it the production at this point gets all kind of distorted and overblown I kind of like the sound play here definitely a bit weirder and off the beaten path than I would expect a top 40 pop record to be and the sound change here is huge it's totally different it's a big stark contrast from what the verses are doing with the guitar and the vocal melody but even so it works this is the kind of experimentation these are the kinds of surprises that I was looking forward to hearing this record and I'm getting them and I love it the song liability is a passionate and intimate piano ballad that I was deeply impressed with going into this album and in the context of the tracklist I still think it sounds amazing the simple piano and vocal combo is great but it's really about the lyrics on the song which is pretty funny now that I think about it because if I recall correctly I was not all that impressed with some of the lyrics on pure heroin I went away from that record hoping and sort of crossing my fingers that lourd would progress further on that record that she would mature a little bit lyrically and get a bit more adventurous a bit more intimate a bit more detailed and what she's singing about and that's definitely the case especially on this track where she is singing about sort of the position that her fame puts her in making her a difficult lover a difficult friend because you know sort of being in that limelight once people in your life family whoever be is also in that limelight with you just by nature of being with you being connected to you by blood or by love you become sort of a liability it sort of makes life kind of weird as she says people pull back they make other plans it's a really interesting take on the way that Fame can impact a relationship an interesting angle not only for her but for pop music in general I'm equally wowed by the recreation of the rush of memories that hit you when you think about an old relationship that you you know have a lot of sentimental feelings about on the track supercut there's something kind of anthemic 80s arena pop arena rock about the way the song is built up that I like a lot it's awesome to sort of hear this style of music ring so true in Lords music not only because I think she does it justice but it's kind of a aha moment for me like of course like this sort of music of course this sound would be such a huge inspiration to not only what you do on this record but earlier on in your career too Lord seems to be lamenting the death of the same relationship on the track writer in the dark where what really makes this tracks out for me is that there is a sudden vocal change on this track where she goes into her upper register and hits this inflection that has a very very Kate Bush sort of tone to it there's a vil strings here some sad simple piano chords and I like the passion in her voice I love sort of how cracked and sad and depressing it sounds and with even funnier as the song is about how the guy who she used to be with I bet he's regretting the fact that he kissed a writer kissed a songwriter kissed an artist a creator because now I'm writing all these songs about him and now everybody is hearing all these songs and our relationship is kind of being put on blast certainly more self-aware than a Taylor Swift who will just continually pump out song about shattered relationships like she's a human assembly line but as long as Lorde is being a little self aware about this I wish she kind of took it another step further because in the internet age in the Information Age other artists rapping or singing about their exes can be kind of odd because the moment that one of them does instantaneously loads of gossip sites troll the internet do their research and sometimes they find out who these people are and post articles about them which in a way can be kind of I don't know embarrassing or as I said before abusive even if the relationship did kind of end on bad terms but to get back on track I love the very heavy and intoxicating hard feelings which features an odd instrumental with a bridge that has all these shrill loud metallic tones sort of battling it out over the instrumental that I feel like almost like I'm listening to poltergeist yell at each other I should probably stress here that this is a really odd thing to happen on such a big big pop record while again there are some songs where Lord is obviously making some top 40 concessions there are quite a few tracks here still where weird stuff like this occurs and not only does it sound really interesting it sounds beautiful and it sounds exciting I'm so happy to hear that Lord is continuing to take musical and sonic risks in her music while still delivering an album that overall is pretty accessible now there are a few reprises on the album where she references back to previous tracks of the songs over to as well as the liability reprieves toward the end of the album which is something that I like on this record it says to me that Lorde is thinking of this entire album as a continually flowing as a linear experience not simply just a collection of tracks even if I do think some of the weird trap percussion on the song sober - is kind of off however the clothes are perfect places might be my least favorite song on the entire record to me it seems like this track is just trying way too hard to define a generation as it were by making partying sounds super deep and serious as well as trying to deliver this huge just mountainous but also very empty oversized chorus that invites everyone in to not only sing but think of themselves and everyone else listening to this song and everyone else is a part of this millennial generation just one big collective where we we all love each other maybe I'm taking that a little too far but the instrumentation is kind of overkill especially for a tune that isn't really that significant in Lords Canon and the beat Christ I mean it's just a deja vu of another beat of pure heroin maybe I'm taking that a little too far but the song really does epitomize the the title of the album melodrama and not in the best way however despite the weak moments at the very start in the very end of the record I think this is a really solid pop album certainly a sign of maturity and growth past her sudden appearance in the spotlight several years ago Lorde seems really be growing into her sound growing into her voice growing into her style and expanding upon it - and at this point based on what I've heard on this record it sounds like she has many more solid records to come I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing

AnqPrqA23lg,heyyyyyy it's Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new moon Mountain Goats album goth gods the mountain goats are a long-running musical project spearheaded by a singer-songwriter storyteller extraordinaire mr. John Darnell who has been recording albums both lo-fi and hi-fi since like the early 90s since then John has amassed a discography that would most likely make a newcomer turn and run in the other direction out of fear of getting lost or just not knowing where to start if you want to listen to some of the projects modern classics though I guess I recommend tallahassee or the sunset tree though i personally feel the band has been on a bit of a creative streak as of late to 2015's beat the champ did have a few musical duds on it but it was a record that was passionately and dramatically dedicated to the world of professional wrestling making for one of the Mountain Goats most fun and exciting releases goths is also deeply thematic but centers around a topic that is likely to not garner quite as much attention God literally goth-like is a subculture the clothes the makeup the time period the music the major artistic figures the locations Jon touches on all of these topics and more in a series of tracks that feature lyrics that read as if he's getting a chance to write about his favorite thing ever and Jon also uses the goth concept to explore other themes such as individuality transformation darkness getting old becoming irrelevant and the world forcing you to become something that you don't want to be for a bulk of the album Jon deals with characters who are having a tough time for one reason or another staying on the dark path the song Andrew eldritch is moving back to Leeds is about these Sisters of Mercy frontman returning home and reconnecting with his roots his old friends after the golden years of goth were up John symbolically referencing an old fog machine that nobody wants anymore to sort of drive his point of irrelevance ehome on the grey King and silver flame attunement our protagonists are dealing with a relevancy but fear fear through an initiation that brought them to a near-death experience the person John is narrating from the perspective of just kind of sits there and wonders whether or not he has the capacity to live up to the extremity of this lifestyle in the chorus when he repeats I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore which as the song progresses he gets more and more sort of emotional and subtle and quiet delivering it I got that hardcore the song unicorn Tolerance seems to play with the other side of this dynamic with the protagonist being so wholeheartedly devoted to the darkness that he can sort of stay in that mindset in the face of unicorns basically just a symbol for things that are bright are pure are friendly are good so they're staying goth in the face of good and staying goth in the face of ejection out of the music industry on the song shelf which seems to feature an 80s goth musician trying to transform transition into what the 90s are demanding of him he says he doesn't want to write songs with this clown he's been paired up with by his label in some LA music studio he says he doesn't want a tour with Trent Reznor last on a bill of three in the final verse of the track he comes to terms with just giving up on the entire thing talking about going to write code for Lucas arts of all things which is pretty hilarious but it's still kind of a song of devotion because the protagonist here would much rather just give up his vision entirely then change it or alter it or water it down just so that he could stay in the industry there are similar themes on the song abandoned flesh which is a track Center specifically around one group in the goth movement Jean loves Jezebel a literal footnote in the encyclopedia of goth in this one song John seems to tell what is at least most of the Bands unsuccessful life story making tongue-in-cheek references to the singer leaving to the band's Wikipedia page and contrasting their lack of success with an artist like Siouxsie Sioux who John says has enough hits so that the their bills continue to be paid this is the finishing track though when the finishing words of this song I think sum up the entire theme of the album better than the finishing words of any other Mountain Goats record however big that chorus base may throb you and me and all of us are going to have to find a job because the world will never know or understand the suffocated splendor of the once future goth band it's just all about this sound this culture this movement that just kind of came and went it had its time it was here and it was gone and John's obsession with most of it is those kind of transition points the difficulties artists had transitioning into this world transitioning out of this world there are other deep cuts on the album that deal in other facets of the culture the song we do it different on the west coast is kind of about a bunch of different goth scenes cropping up all across America Europe the song stench of the unburied is basically a vivid depiction of all the minor and very funny and entertaining details of a band in the midst of a tour in the song where black is all about kind of embracing darkness in the face of hardship and turmoil specifically wearing black to the intervention probably one of the most darkly hilarious moments on the entire record but despite the lyrical themes of this album the music on the record is decidedly not goth at all the closest John and company come to doing this is when all of a sudden in the second half of the song shelled this swing dance beat pops in a driving bass line and a vocal melody that seems like it's been pulled out of the new order playbook that being said though God's is easily one of the Mountain Goats most musically diverse albums yet I was kind of worried going into this record once I heard the entire album was going to be guitar less not that the mountain goats have written songs before sans guitar but it is kind of John's main acts you expect to at least hear a handful of times on an album so a bit of an expectation curve there compound that with moments like where black where you have like this gospel style chorus kind of working its way into there this Rangeley poppy and sweet instrumentation on the song unicorn tolerance and the really jazzy horns and chord progressions on the track Payton cocaine as a longtime fan I needed a little time with this record to adjust and just kind of acclimate myself to not only the instrumental palette of this record but what John was trying to say with the theme but once I got a better grasp of that I warmed up to the instrumentals on this record quite a bit because some of them stylistically play off of the theme or the story of the song ingeniously case in point the very laid-back and chill funk of the song rage in traverse which when I first heard it I wished was a little bit more lively urgent wish it just had more teeth or something but then once I got into the lyrics the track is essentially about an aging like hard rocker from the 70s having a hard time finding relevance in the 80s and when he happens upon this goth club he's sort of horrified by what he sees not only because of just the darkness and just kind of how wild and weird it is but also having to come to terms with the fact that he is just not as relevant as he used to be there are a few tracks in the track listing that just kind of sound like mere average mountain goat songs but just no guitar has been placed into the mix but they're definitely more musical hits than misses on this thing mostly the song rain in Soho incredible opener undeniably one of the goats most powerful songs to date thanks to its grim pianos and something kick drum and really epic choral contributions which are not only beautiful but add a lot of character to the mix especially as they're chanting in unison no no no no the mountain goats really do take advantage of the lack of guitar on this album by bringing in more horns more woodwinds more piano more bass more background vocals all the stuff they've been incorporating into their recent work but you know just upped a little bit a gradual and finally executed increase in a way all of it kind of seems like an overly ambitious self-reference to the band or to the album itself because on the song shell you do have a moment where the agnus cries out about wanting to play his guitar but he can't because goth in the 90s and early 2000s was kind of transitioning into something completely different than what it was in the 80s I'm most likely giving the album a little too much credit there and not that it doesn't deserve it this is probably one of my favorite Mountain Goats albums in a while I definitely enjoyed it a shade more than beat the champ musically it installed me more and topically being more of a music nerd myself I guess I probably got more out of this than I would an album about wrestling though I mean I love the fuck out of wrestling when I was good my point is I think this is one of the Bands better records topically musically however the mountain goats will never get credit for it because unfortunately John album after album just refuses to fold to the typical cliches of the singer-songwriter which audiences endlessly demand from this particular artist base to the point where I wonder if they're even half aware of just how cliche and redundant their desires are is it any coincidence that two of the mountain goes the biggest record center around a crumbling relationship and John Darnell's traumatic youth if you think this is because John's best song has just happened to land on those records uh in my humble opinion you are sorely mistaken long before John recorded either of those albums to me he was just a really great and adventurous storyteller that is what originally attracted me to the mountain goats and that is what is attracting me to this album over here this record in a way is almost an extension of one of my favorite mountain goat songs of all time the opening track to the album all hail West Texas song about a death metal band that basically folded because the entire world around them just said no you're not doing this this isn't happening and John kind of paints these guys as underdogs as unsung heroes two guys who fought with all their might but eventually lost in the Battle of being themselves that very same battle is being played out on gods but on a much grander and sort of niche scale and it does so with creative instrumentation with great production John can certainly still act his way through a song he's not really phoning it in here in my opinion and at least from the perspective of this music nerd some of his most intriguing lyrics to date I'm feeling a strong eight on this record Tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it did it turn you a little gah let me know if it turned you a little goth made you want to be a little bit more goth and I will catch you guys in the next review anthony Fantana

bus8_zwTQD8,hi everyone basin eBay Stan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of young thug's new project beautiful thugger girls young sug is a singer rapper hip hop eccentric down from Atlanta who has been at for a while now he's been causing quite a stir in the rack community with his unique approach his unique vocal style its yell P it's strange it's odd it's very nasal I mean it's pretty much singing not to discount it because in comparison to thuggish contemporaries I do think his vocal abilities are a little above and beyond he certainly sounds unique in the current hip-hop landscape however I think that uniqueness has been kind of dampened by the fact that he has released so many projects so many mixtapes that are so chock-full of filler he goes from project to project a project with very little in the way of any kind of artistic or sonic progression one major exception in my opinion though was his Jeffery album that dropped not too long ago which not only has a very odd cover for hip-hop oh but also I think suggar on this project took his largest musical risks to date genre hopping from one track to the next and strangely making his vocal style applied to every single thing that he attempted very effectively now this new project over here beautiful thugger girls or easy breezy beautiful Picard curls also marks a bit of a change of pace this is supposedly Fugger's singing album his is his ballad album which I was kind of skeptical of at first I mean if we look at the the front cover here he's holding a guitar upside down it's upside down instantaneously I'm having like flashbacks to little Wayne's rebirth and I was catching all these comments online you know approaching me and getting frustrated with me saying and why haven't you reviewed the new young thug yet it's a country wrapped epic only to end up trying the album and lo and behold it's not nearly as revolutionary as a lot of the people hyping it up to me May that to be not only that but this whole country rap shtick only applies to a small portion of the record still though as I got deeper into casual listens of the album it actually started to grow on me and where this fits into suckers discography sort of started become clear because again this is young thug's in my opinion his most melodic album his most ballad centric album his Poppaea sweetest and most pleasant album nearly every track here has an incredibly strong melody locked into either the verse or the hook which is nothing altogether new for young thug but there's something just particularly sweet and accessible about this album in comparison to his other projects the instrumental palette on this album generally is pretty beautiful I caught some horns on this thing there are at least a handful of tracks the future acoustic guitar and the way thug errs wild vocals intertwine with these instrumentals occasionally is pretty magical so just from an auditory standpoint if you're into thug errs vocal style this album should be a breeze for you I get why people are excited about this project it sounds like no other thugger projects so far and it's really intoxicating but once I got past this casual listening phase and I really had to listen to the album in order to write something down or come up with something to say about it that's when my honeymoon phase with the record kind of was over still at this point though I do like the intro track family don't matter I think it's a beautiful mix of kind of those country and those pop rap elements that you know do occasionally come together here really well lyrically I think it's one of the more personal tracks on the entire record which honestly had me kind of in the mood in the mindset that hey maybe lyrically maybe thematically this is going to be a very different record for thug or two but immediately after this the same mediocrity that plagues most thugger projects starts creeping its way in we have this generic pop rap ballad on she want to party with these prominent acoustic guitars that you know really aside from sluggers vocals there's no personality to this track at all I feel like I've been taken into a time machine like 10 or 15 years ago to list some subpar pop rap in the 2000s and the song daddy's birthday despite the song sort of implying this is going to be a really personal track a referencing fatherhood from the instrumental to some of the opening lyrics instead we just get a couple generic verses from Fugger that don't really see much about anything and I get it this is a young thug album I guess we're not supposed to care about the lyrics that much and I have overlooked lyrics in the past when listening to young thug's music I get how this works however with the type of instrumental that he's rapping over the way the vocals are presented on this album the way the album is mixed and the fact that thugger I think lyrically is clearer here than on most projects I mean that's exactly where your ears kind of go to what the lyrics are because while Fugger's voice is unique it only carries the album so far I get that he sounds different than any of his hip-hop contemporaries but given the fact that he's singing he's just singing why should we only observe him within that sphere especially when there are albums out there that are equally as poppy as this one with more interesting singers with more interesting things to say I'm sorry but as much as I like the way the vocals and the instrumental play off of each other on the song you said it's kind of hard to listen to young thug cry out into the night about his dick and nuts getting kissed if I was sitting here listening to it for any other reason than to review it I would feel like an idiot the song get high featuring Snoop Dogg I'm not really sure young Snoop Dogg Styles really complement each other all that much so I guess it is cute that they decided to get together the the verses on this track completely bland boring nothing happening at all it's really only the hook that sort of makes the song interesting the other matchup with future though on this album though is a really underwhelming and that actually has nothing to do with young thug or the instrumental at all if there's one thing I can compliment young thug on with this melodic style of trap music I think he's one of the better performers I think he's one of the more entertaining singers and vocalists miles ahead of a guy like future even though you know he's certainly a pioneer within this sound and why that is case in point this track in comparison to young thug future is a terrible singer so bad that the auto-tune can't even cover up how crappy the tone of his voice is there are at least a couple tracks from the track listing of this thing - that don't really strike me as all that special just kind of instrumentally topically and vocally just merely average for young thug the record really could have done without them the song feel it for example but immediately after this track is on me Russ is a conundrum it's an anomaly for a few reasons not only does it feature an acoustic guitar sample from brighteyes first day of my life but then there's the lyrics on this thing the hook who you loyal to me or us who you trust the most me or us who you want to  every night me or us who you want to take on your flight me Russ that makes no sense who do you want to every night me or us like like I'm  you or I'm me and you at the same time if I bring you on our flight as opposed to bring us on our flight do I have to pay for an extra ticket is me trusting us different than me just trusting you because I mean you you are in US and the line on here about  on your daughter and on my brother is so borderline incestuous and weird that there's no other line around this that surrounds it that brings greater context to what's being said here so it really is it brings new meaning to keeping it in the family I really have no idea what's going on there I'm so confused the second last track is a pretty bright pop rat ballad about all these sacrifices that are made in life for the people who he loves the people around them it's a kind of inspiring track and one of the few songs that actually like focuses on an idea topics one of the few moments on the album that feels like genuine with love and passion as opposed to the song do you love me which is not only a really bad cash grab at the whole dancehall thing but the song is utter trash because while thugger does seem to like sex he sort of lacks the language of love and you know honestly I don't really mind freaky lyrics out of my vulgar lyrics I don't mind explicitly sexual lyrics but pretty much all it has to say on the topic is you know suck me me  me me basically the vocabulary that you get when your pool is limited to groupies yeah it's basically just sex music for straight guys to listen to because I have no idea why women would want to listen to a song where the lyrics are basically unit you know if you want to catch lyrics like this go read your inbox over on your OkCupid profile you know check out some of the guys are like hey bitch suck you know I don't really know what to think about this record I'm honestly torn on I'm kind of torn on it I like what's up with his voice on this album I like the melodic qualities of this record again the vibe the aesthetic of the album is pretty pleasing and is very pleasant it's intoxicating I think that's you know again mostly because I do enjoy young thug's voice if you don't it's probably going to be a turn-off but again there are some filler tracks on here there are some pretty basic and plain song structures on here if we're going to take this album and bring it outside of you know sort of the hip hop vacuum that most people have placed it in into the wider world of acoustic music and pop music it's clearly mediocre and there are a lot of lyrics on this thing that are pretty terrible just straight trash and again I know they're going to be people out there like we're just not the point of view you can be triggered all you want about somebody bringing up a lyric that sucks that's totally fine but effectively on this project suggar has stepped over a genre line into styles of music that put more of an emphasis on lyrics and unfortunately he did not step up to the plate on that front and the album suffers because of it not to mention the fact that again vocally thugger is unique but that unique tone that unique sound of his voice only takes this album so far you know he had some wild vocalizations but as he's improvising his way through some of these tracks is some of those little embellishments are kind of goofy and sort of terrible and borderline hilarious again song structures instrumental palette while it is popular it is sweeter in the grander scheme of things it's kind of bad I mean nothing really to write home about outside of hey Duggars doing something a little bit different but once the novelty of that wears off and it's not really that refreshing I'm feeling strong for two la-5 on this thing transition

JiXWqnT-NCg,ah hi everyone mine's a change can oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a video about ten times I've changed my mind on albums I have a lot of strong opinions on music and I delivered some opinions on opinions over the years as well since I started and one idea one thought or theory have had about opinion since I started doing this that I've held very closely to my heart and have mentioned at least several times in a variety of different videos is that opinions change opinions are merely based on perception and your perception is due to change as you age as you gather and gain new experiences in life finally starting to get to the point where I have so many records in the past that I've reviewed that now that I look at them like hmm I feel kind of different now I feel kind of different so don't consider this list as me kind of re reviewing these records because honestly I'm completely happy with the reviews that I put out at the time that I drop the reviews you know I may have a particular perception of these albums right now that I'm about to tell you but even that is due to change at some point in the future but let's get into it these are ten albums that since I initially heard them since I initially reviewed them my opinion on them has changed yes 2 Chainz based on a true story I remember my initial reaction my initial review of this thing was really really negative very negative I was talking about probably how not lyrical the album was how quickly the album kind of gave in to all of the trap cliches and so on and so forth I probably saw 2 Chainz is really silly as well but now that I revisit the album there are a lot of bangers on this thing even the buttery smooth tracks like no lie and that one song with the dreamer aren't that bad either but the thing is what really ended up selling this album for me is that it's so funny it's hilarious 2 Chainz is at this point in his career was a really entertaining Sharpe and I don't know like very charismatic off-the-wall bit of a goofball I guess you know they're still tracks on this thing that I liked initially when I heard it like the song dope peddler that sound even better in roar to my ears now but there's so many tracks on the thing where he just sounds like I don't know a southern madman like the the the things lyrically that he comes up with are so ridiculous they're so over-the-top they're so silly that I don't know I can't help but find it lovable you know obviously I'm not saying this record as any kind of film attic or something like that and I wonder if I really thought about it would even end up very high on my top 50 albums of the Year lists if I were to rewrite that but what I'm merely saying here is that I don't think I gave this album the credit it deserved for being as funny and is unique as it is Danny Brown the hybrid an album that I initially did not review I didn't cover this album at all the year that it came out but I remember hearing this record the year that it came out because Danny Brown himself emailed me this and when I heard it I thought it was okay you know but it didn't really stop me in my tracks enough to want to talk about it in a formal review but then out of the blue Danny drops this mixtape this xxx this xxx mixtape on fool's gold records and it's kind of funny it's like he's kind of reinvented himself like everything that was eccentric about that hybrid project which was a little faint is just turn up to 11 on this new album over here I actually had to do a bit of a double take because I was like wait a second do I know this guy have I heard this guy's it's the same guy who emailed me that like a little while ago because this is crazy this is insane and obviously I loved xxx I gave it a very positive review upon upon its release with my initial reactions to it but this is one of those instances and I'm sure you guys have had this happen to you before this is one of those instances where a newer record kind of makes you rethink the past work of an artist so the new record is great it actually makes you take the artists a little more seriously than you did before so then you go back to the older material that previously may have underwhelmed you or maybe you didn't really know how to feel about it and all of a sudden it just like clicks it's like damn this is great this is amazing I don't know why I didn't see what I see now in this you know because so there's some days where I don't want to listen to at route to the exhibition I don't want to listen to xxx there's some days when I just want to listen to freakin the hybrid because it's so raw it's so gritty it's so like direct and to-the-point danny's hooks despite them being very simple a lot of them just click a lot of them just stick with me really hard I also think with Danny coming off a little less eccentric on this album the storytelling element was turned up a little bit and there are some really like grim dark stories on this thing that you know still stand out to me as some of Danny's best work really again if you haven't heard this thing and you do enjoy Danny's music don't miss out on it like I did or don't write it off like I did initially this thing is great the knife shaking the habitual you know it's pretty funny some of you may be scratching your heads thing what why is this here why it why is this here Anthony you you love the out of this come when it came out well this isn't you know just a list where I'm talking about records that I love more than I initially did when I first heard it this is an example of an album that maybe I'm a little less hype on in retrospect because honestly while I did really love this record when it initially came out and you know there's still a lot of exciting tracks on this album for me for sure with no question I can't remember the last time I've listened to this album all the way through especially without skipping like that 20-minute interlude drone like very experimental sound piece in the middle of the record the centerpiece of the album still I think this is a very good knife record I think 90% of what I said in my original review still applies to how I feel about the album today but you know there are just some glaring spots that I think initially I kind of overlooked that or like wow this is this is super indulgent and kind of a turn-off Tom Waits bad is me not one of my more popular or controversial reviews I don't even think a lot of you guys have probably even seen this review but uh Tom Waits is one of those singer songwriters who at one point in my life like college or so like he was a god to me he was a god I thought he was just a genius of songwriting of production of instrumental palette loved the versatility of the man's voice and at one point I think I own like every CD or Alfa thing you had ever put out so of course getting into my reviewing on YouTube this is my first opportunity to review a Tom Waits record so I'm really excited oh hey what the hell I love Tom Waits or it's been a while actually at this point since I taught me to put out a full length album of new material so I think I ended up giving it a 7 and you know I thought it was pretty good but now that I revisit it and again not that I was crazy about it initially but I feel like the things that sort of paid it sound somewhat weak in his discography in my append and sound even weaker right now I actually think it's one of his worst albums to be completely honest I think there are very little in the way of compelling unique instrumentals on this thing actually as far as instrumental pallets go it kind of feels like Tom Waits is just kind of playing the hits as it were from beginning to end on the record this is actually Tom Waits first album in my opinion where you know since he kind of really reinvented himself on records like sportfish trombones as well as Rain Dogs where he didn't come through with a new sound a new concept a new idea he didn't Forge any anything in terms of something refreshing or creative so again he's rehashing a lot of ideas instrumentally and I think some of his worst songs and vocal performances turn upon this thing I don't know purely if it's his singing or if it's the production but a lot of his performances just sounds so out of whack and overbearing on the instrumentals it feels almost disconnected in a way kind of like he's doing like just some some bad off-kilter karaoke over some generic Tom Waits Ian's musical pastiche their songs that initially I didn't like had like even less now like last leaf' which i think is probably Tom's most patience testing and long-winded and corny ballads to date but really sort of like burns me is that on sites like rate your music this album is rated higher than albums of his in the past that I think are semi objectively better or at least more consistent or at least more refreshing in terms of new sounds and ideas of real gone heart attack and vine please yeah I don't know but given my opinion change on this record I wonder if I'm even like excited for another time wait two album again because in retrospect to me it just kind of sounds like he was phoning it in and I wonder if he'll ever be passionate about putting out a new album again because it certainly doesn't sound to be the case here radiohead the King of Limbs the last time you guys saw me talk about Radiohead was in my Radiohead worst to best list where I went over all the band's major works and ranked them from what I thought was their most superior to their least superior records and the King of Limbs to kind of spoil it for you if you didn't already know did rank at the bottom the bottom bottom bottom of the list going under even Pablo honey so some of you may be pissed off about that I understand and that's fine but the reason I add Radiohead onto this list is because if it wasn't already obvious from my talking points in that video while I was never crazy about the King of Limbs to begin with it's clearly one of Radiohead's weakest releases I think I like it even less than I did when I originally heard it I think I gave a 6 out of 10 to this thing which you know it means I came out of it sort of enjoying it sort of liking it but nowadays the record just seems so scant it seems so rigid it seems so flat it seems so lifeless it seems so non essential to the band's artistic progression it seems like a weird dead end or detour that wasn't really complete or was like a little ill-conceived the fact that there was a mob of Radiohead fans who assumed that there was another album or EP or some extra tracks that were going to release from this thing around the corner coming out of nowhere is sort of indicative of that I'll say again like I said in my Radiohead worst the best video that the live version of this album that they dropped not too long after Zach Chua Lee I think superior in terms of performance the mix the sound of the instrumentation the visceral feel of these songs so it's not like there are no great ideas here I just think the execution really left a lot to be desired so yeah I like it even less the Beastie Boys hot sauce committee part 2 the Beastie Boys final record MCA rest in peace I made it pretty clear in my best albums of the Year lists when this album dropped that this record did not sit with me as positively as it did when I initially heard it so that already has been kind of made public but I wanted to include it here because you know this is just one of those moments and I'm sure it's happened to you to where you know initially an album hits you and it's sort of exciting it's crazy especially when it's an artist - just like Tom Waits the Beastie Boys were a group who I grew up listening to and I own and admire a great deal of their discography you know even hello Nastya which you know a lot of people aren't that crazy about but you know this one I really wanted to love I really wanted to be excited for it you know I was technically very early on in my reviewing career as it were and um you know there's a lot of good things about the album I think the production is really creative and detailed but you know lyrically hook wise this is not one of the Beastie Boys more solid releases you know certainly it's better than the five Burroughs but my opinion on this album will most likely forever be not quite as positive as it was when I initially reviewed and initially talked about the album c'est la vie Earl Sweatshirt I don't like I don't go outside this has been one of those albums that um for a little while after the release of my review people were dogging me and dogging me and dogging me and being like I had been he doesn't like Earl Sweatshirt I don't like it's so great it's so great it's so great my opinion on this record though hasn't chased after me in the same way that like My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy opinions have but you know there have been some moments when I've been curious to come back to this album and in doing so I realized some things about the record that I don't think I initially gave it credit for sure you know there's still some moments with the songwriting and with the lack of you know real tangible structure to these songs that is still kind of a turn-off but at the time I didn't quite get into just how dark and nihilistic this album is and I got to tell you that quality about it I think not only makes it really unique because I mean Earl's perception on the world and kind of just the nastiness of his attitude on this album really stands out really makes him an artist marching to the beat of his own drum I'm pretty sure I critique the production pretty hard when I initially reviewed this thing too but listening to it now I admire more just like the nihilistic mood of Earl's lyrics and the album overall I just kind of like the lo-fi weird wonky kind of noisy very skeletal aesthetic of the instrumentals here I think it adds to that nihilism I think it adds to that nastiness and I guess another thing it hit me about the album and maybe not necessarily a good thing is that a damn there are so many moments where there's like violence toward women on here it's kind of interesting now for me to think of this record in context of The Odd Future hypetrain because Tyler certainly made his concessions to make his music just a little more palatable not quite as politically incorrect as his career and his visibility in the music industry grew and grew and grew Earl meanwhile from his debut mixtape - this only seems to have gotten edgier and darker and more disgusting and more vile and if I can praise Nick Cave or GG Allin for trolling the dregs of depravity then I can praise Earl Sweatshirt for doing it too next Mac DeMarco - is big breakout album you know I enjoyed some of the stuff off of this previous project and his makeout videotape material but when he broke with this album it did kind of hit me in a mixed bag sorta way there were some tracks that to me felt kind of redundant like Mac was going for this uniformly bland kind of jangly dreamy sound were some tracks some songs didn't really stand out really paled in comparison to others of course there were some tracks on here that I really loved and still stand today as some of my favorite Mac DeMarco tracks my kind of woman being one and it's these cuts that actually made me come back to the record years later and actually come to realize that you know actually it's a bit more diverse of an album than I gave it credit for you know it's way more solid of a record than I gave her credit for again I don't know if I revised my year-end list would it rank that high but my feelings toward this record are definitely more positive than they were when I initially reviewed it and I mean I did like it overall I think I gave it as xxxxX or something and I would say today I'm a little higher on that scale this is also thanks in part to me having to relist into the album when I reviewed Mac DeMarcos latest record which I really enjoyed you know very good album but when going back and listening to the old stuff just to kind of you know get a grip of where he was at back then and how he travelled to get where he is now I was just like wow you know there's some really great tracks on this that originally just didn't really leave that much of an impression on me and you know what there are some albums like that you know sometimes you just got to come back to it with a different mindset just be in a different place and all of a sudden it just kind of clicks for you I got a shout out Death Grips government plates on here yes Death Grips government plates um you know probably what my poor infamous Death Grips reviews because I guess it's my most negative Death Grips review I caught a lot of heat on this I caught a lot of heat on this review I don't quite get so much harassment over my thoughts on this record today but originally there was a huge backlash with Death Grips fans with my opinions on this record and while they're still tracks on here where I am somewhat disappointed with a ride kind of repeating a verse or repeating lyrics or just simply being copied and pasted onto another section of the album or just kind of his lack of a vocal performance that's really all that compelling where with some of the instrumentals being super repetitive super obnoxious super uh guy I don't even know what to say to describe feels like a wheel still don't like that song to this day and I still don't really like the title track I still don't really like big house but having said that I still think some of Death Grips most iconic tracks turn up on this project and in retrospect I think the positive moments on this record outshine the bad moments I guess I came away from this album originally understanding or feeling that way but I guess that opinion is even stronger today because Anne Bonny and birds and you might think he loves you as well as who's watching are still some of my favorite Death Grips tracks today and I cannot deny that drop on I'm over flow that that is just amazing finally on this list it's mi A's Maya which on a couple occasions in the past I have admitted and already said that I've rethought my opinion on this album I enjoy this album more than I did originally before the release of her latest album Maya was consistently seen as mi A's worst project and in retrospect I could kind of see why people received it that way it came right off of Kahlo which is easily her most I guess accessible and radio-friendly record had the big hit Paper Planes on it and then she follows it up with what was essentially at the time her most experimental off-the-wall abrasive insane and challenging album of course the response was going to be negative among her mainstream fans but even music critics hated the thing and I feel like my enjoyment of this album now is due to two things having to revisit it to review her subsequent projects and also Death Grips because if I'm being honest with myself a lot of the bombastic off-the-wall loud buzzing abrasive production on this project is kind of a precursor to what Death Grips has done on multiple records sure there's some moments on this thing where lyrically m.i.a is not delivering her best is delivering her brightest but instrumentally this is so ahead of the curve not only that but I think mi a was also ahead of the curve on a few tracks when she was kind of diving into the topic of internet culture in the way that it was affecting our society the way that we communicated the album art itself is kind of a play on just how overwhelming the information age could be and I feel like instrumentally she was trying to create that same sense and had done it successfully even though at the time I and many other people didn't realize it and I'm going to leave it at that you know this was not me trying to re-review these records or anything like that this is me just simply stating you know outright that my opinions have changed just like your opinions have most likely change on a variety of Records however since there are over a million people who watch this YouTube channel I figure I would just kind of lay down some significant moments on some high profile and not so high profile records where you know that has happened to me and just kind of you know reach out to you guys well you know this is a normal thing and I feel like you know if you're going to be a critic or a reviewer of music you have to constantly be thinking and revaluated the way that you listen to music and what music you've heard in the past and how you felt about it and so on and so forth because times change perceptions change people change the artistic landscape changes and if you're going to continue to be relevant continue to be on top continue to grow you have to kind of go along with that evolution and that's the video I hope you guys got a lot out of it and I enjoyed making it too and I will catch you guys in the next one to Ranch and I've given a listen to any of these albums where your opinions on you love them hate them why do my thoughts changing on them make sense to you do they anger you does it give you hope for the future are there any albums that you wish I talked about in this segment I'm sure there are and let me know down in the comments other videos next to my head I think shake out just rather the channel and official would say to forever 
Qi6YXRBXRhI,ah hi everyone wrinkly shirt tan oh here the internet specific there and it's time for a review of the we're not doing a review at all it's actually our weekly track roundup where I go over what I thought were the best and worst tracks of the week let's get straight into it with first amend and is on associates link down there in the description box if you live in the u.s. you click on that anything you buy on Amazon after that we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price supports the channel supports this segment we also have a similar thing going on with the good people over at turntable lab we have a link down there in the description for them anything you buy on their site we get kicked back from that you can buy some excellent vinyl pressings of very colorful vinyl pressings of albums that i have reviewed and more as well as like some audio equipment turntables speakers for your budding record collector okay alright let's get into the tracks with what I felt were the worst tracks of the week just a few tracks this week just if you don't want to torture myself too much in the track this week they're not even the worst in the world I heard there was a new Jake Paul song but you know who wants to torture themselves on purpose who who wants to hurt themselves on purpose you know honestly I'm not a I'm not a masochist is that the word I'm looking for I think I'm looking for that word so I'm probably not going to talk about that but I will talk about the new ASAP ferg and little yachty song oh yeah again not the worst in the world not the worst I've ever heard from Ferg certainly better than a lot of what was off his last album but definitely disappointing considering the kind of chemistry and excitement that I wanted to hear with these two names on a track for I think the first time number one and number two the beats kind of bland beat beats kind of weak and there's not really in terms of funny or memorable or clever lyrics across this track especially from little yachty it just kind of sounded like sense Ferg's last attempt to go blatantly commercial with his last record he's trying to go back more to that sound he forged on trap Lord but everything he's coming up with is noticeably weaker and paler in comparison to that material so I really don't know what he's going to do can he go back to his old sound but make it sound as exciting as it was originally maybe but I kind of doubt it at this point given this track and two other tracks because you drop three tracks in one day and you know the other two were slightly better than this but nothing that I'm really thinking about returning to so that's kind of my feelings on this track moving on from there we have a new track from Jaden Smith titled Batman which who man is if you want to cringe watch the music video for this song with the sound off if you want a double cringe watch it with the sound he's so crazy and not in a good way in the kind of way that you're crazy when you're sheltered off from reality and I I really don't know what to say or what to do other than just to laugh this because there's really not anything else you can do and finally I'll mention unfortunately here the new Action Bronson single love let me breathe which despite being labeled as a single unfortunately is not a single at all it's actually just a throwaway freestyle posing as a single not a whole lot here memorable you know in terms of bars a lot of singing across the track is pretty weak not a strong hook on the song either the beat is kind of quirky but that's really the only thing it has going for it kind of unfortunate considering the amount of potential I saw in Action Bronson early on and he's come out with some very good projects but it seems like every single time he gears up to drop something like big and commercial it just sort of falls short for me in some kind of way and for me that's kind of happening on this track to hopefully you know whatever he's gearing up to release in the future is better than mr. wonderful but this single that does not have my mouth watering and I'll leave it at that alright those are the worst tracks of the week just keeping it short there let's get into the songs I was kind of man kind of kind of got on the fence with but still wanted to mention I want to give a shout out to of it eel egg that's not a band that's not anything that's just my like being itchy I want to give a shout out to one the horrors with this new track titled machine the horrors are finally returning back to a noisier darker more dense sound on this one they're sort of mixing some of the shoegaze elements and the dream cop elements they've been toying with with like a little bit of noise a little bit of distortion while again it's not as frantic and it's not as intense and it's not as powerfully dark as some of their earlier material they're moving back in a more aggressive direction with this new track over here and I'm liking the sound again I'm looking how dense the track is like how noisy it progressively gets a lot of cool qualities about the production on this track though I wouldn't say I'm like completely sold on the lead vocals the tune which is kind of buried on the song moving on from there Calvin Harris new track feels featuring Pharrell Pharrell Williams Katy Perry Big Sean it's not a bad single funky kind of irresistible dancey disco beat Pharrell and Katy Perry complement each other pretty well on the hook and the big sean verse toward the end is sort of Corning leaves a lot to be desired but it is a decent single one of the better singles I've heard from this Calvin Harris album so far Dizzee Rascal has a new track out titled space which is just bars bars bars bars bars some really impressive lyrics on this thing cool instrumental some little a little left-field production on this thing some of his delivery on this track I think we've something to be desired it's a little middle-of-the-road it so you know it's kind of hanging in the yellow I wish it was a little bit more intense but again lyrically there are a lot of cool things on this track and again I think the production adds a lot to the mix as well you know so again if you're looking for those UK bars some flashy UK lyricism and flows then check this track out everything everything has a new track out titled can't do which unfortunately I was pretty excited about considering how much I loved the band's last record how much I liked a lot of tracks from the band's debut album but this new track over here you know despite the band being on their last record in my opinion one of the more interesting groups in music because their approach is so progressive elements of math rock getting worked in their elements progressive rock getting worked in their elements of art pop getting worked in their but on this new track over here it sounds like they're just kind of playing it really really safe I mean of course you know the really strange nasal lead vocals are still there but that's actually kind of other one of the problems with the track because the can't do the can't do hook on this song it's really incessant to the point where it's just like giving it like a little bit more space here in between each repetition of that refrain in between each hook a bulk of this song is kind of taken up by the hook repeating again and again and again and again you just can't quite get away from these very shrill nasally vocals which you know again has been an eccentric quality of the band that you know while it may come off as annoying to some people you know and I acknowledge that they're weird I never felt like they sort of overdid them so much that their songs weren't listened Abul over here I feel like they're kind of bordering on that and you know again it's kind of especially a bit of a disappointment to hear the instrumentation kind of becoming a little less intricate a little less progressive a little less adventurous and kind of swapping all of that out for something a little more simple and straightforward and playing so I don't know hopefully this is just kind of the vibe of the single and the deeper cuts are a bit more intriguing and you know those kind of help build up this track in the context of the tracklist but as of right now not that excited just based on his track alone The Killers having to track out title demand which surprisingly I thought was pretty decent had a an irresistible funky and danceable kind of instrumental a little bit of rock and a disco vibe in it some of the vocals Brandon Flowers is bringing to the table in the first part of the track had a real like David Byrne kind of vibe to them in the second part of the track that kind of melts away a little bit but it still sounds pretty great yeah I mean the lyrics kind of leave a little bit to be to be desired on this track but you know outside of that it's a decent cut am I anticipating I'm going to love the new Killers helm or something probably not but you know this song is actually not really all that bad considering that I've never really considered myself a killers fan next the pains are being pure heart have a new song out titled when I dance with you which is actually one of the projects more synth-pop oriented tracks really busy like unrelenting beat on this thing the song is just so impossibly feel-good the chord progression is a little familiar sounds kind of like your run-of-the-mill 80s pop tune but I actually think it's one of the one of the hearts I guess or the pains rather better singles in a long time so I don't know I guess I'm kind of looking forward to the new record you know the song is certainly sweet and you know very pleasurable very enjoyable it's it's not like the greatest thing I've heard in the world but you know it's certainly a great track you know as far as like the first thing in a while I've heard from this project that's a been exciting semi exciting and finally I want to shout out the new Arcade Fire track creature comfort in this section of the video which man Arcade Fire are really not they're really not giving up this idea they're going to do a dance album they're going to do like a synth pop album they're going to do like a kind of indie tronic sort of album again it's it's not a phase mom this is what we're doing now you know as much as I was disappointed in reflector there were some dance tracks on that album that I thought were pretty great and I'm yet to hear a dance track on this new album as for our singles thus far that is fantastic that's amazing to me you know I loved reflector as a single but I feel like everything I feel like everything I've heard so far from this forthcoming album is at least slightly disappointing you know at least slightly disappointing you know this track over here creature comfort I think instrumentally is certainly superior the than the flaccid disco of the last track the band released but lyrics on this track are so supremely cringe not that I disagree with the the the sentiments of a lot of the lyrics that wind sings on this track but it seems like he's just throwing them out there so plainly unpoetical II that he's just trying so hard to make a statement about these issues you know just to just to kind of get people to agree with him or just kind of like you know because it's so in vogue right now to be saying like hey here I think this about this I think this about that when you know previously you know I mean Arcade Fire not the most political band I mean you know certainly you know they made some cool statements on the suburbs which you know do get kind of rung again kind of on this new track over here but to a less poetic and a less I guess I want to say I'm graceful degree but outside of the instrumental this track is kind of a mess you know I do like the sense in this thing the the bubbly beat is really fun if I ignore this lyrics I kind of want to dance to it but um you know outside of that I'm not really big in this track you know I am kind of semi intrigued to see where Arcade Fire takes this new album because it seems like they're really going to want to resent go into this dance synth-pop direction but again the substance of the songwriting and the performances are leaving a lot to be desired and let's get into what I thought were the the best tracks the week one Algiers Cleveland this band is back with a new track they're continuing to blend elements of gospel of soul of post-punk of electronic music hip hop as well as like protest music into an Azeri of things that just should not should not work and yet they kind of do I mean I will say that I think the vocals are a little much on this track at least they were for my first couple of lessons but as I started a climatic myself to that and kind of got more into the lyrics and you know sort of sort of started eating apart or pulling apart rather what was so interesting about them the instrumental because there are a lot of cool like choral vocal samples on it a couple B switches which are pretty cool I actually became pretty enamored with the track again try for yourself really cool song Algiers continuing to blend John Rose in a way that no other band is with some really great performances to I want to give a shout out to Chelsea wolf for her new track of 16 psyche I'm on the way horrifying cover it's horrifying and this track over here is one of our heaviest in a while kind of has like this weird alt-rock very goth metal inspired verse and then when the chorus flies in man the guitars are so goddamn heavy and powerful and her voice really kind of cuts through them like a like a blade right through your skin and blood spills out everywhere it's it's gory it's ugly it's dark and it's beautiful from there I want to give a shout out to the new DJ Khaled track wild thoughts featuring Rihanna and Bryson tiller yes I actually did enjoy this track quite a bit I think the Maria Maria Santana guitar piece that's working to the track is a little awkward it's not as smoothly incorporated into the instrumental as I think it possibly could be but I loved it a quick little bass line and groove the track a lot loved the instrumental it's very simple does a lot with a little rihanna is incredibly charismatic on this track I think she's great and even Bryson tiller is like okay I mean the vocals are not the vocals whereas the lyrics are super sexual super vulgar I don't know if that's going to turn some of you on or off I thought it was a pretty sexy track pretty nasty ass track and moving on from there washed out has a smooth house inspired new track titled hard to say goodbye love the beat on this thing the vocals are okay I mean as to kind of be expected on a washed-out song but I was so enamored with the hypnotic and dreamy sensual groove of the song I just couldn't say no had to incorporate it in this part of the video I want to give a shout out to the new Queens of the Stone Age song the way you used to do I like this track I think it's a good song I'm excited to hear new Queens of the Stone Age want the new record to be great I guess I will say I do have a slight reservation with this song though you know it is one of the better singles of the week no doubt no question one of the better singles of the week I do wish it sounded less like you know I was listening to a really like sleazeball type of ZZ Top ish type of song you know but it but it is a decent tune you know yeah what I loved so much about the band's last record is the guitar tones the production was so heavy was so awesome not so much the case here you know I think the sound is a little bit more flat you know definitely not as heavy or as the sick and is vivid you know but still I think the performance is there I like some of the vocals on this thing I wish it sound a little more devilish too but I don't mind it cleans the stone-age going into a different direction you know obviously they don't want to write another like clockwork I'm willing to sort of hear the band out the tune isn't bad and you know again willing to hear the band out and sort of see through what they're doing in this different direction this slightly different direction bones has a new track out from a new project and the single or rather one major track on the Ana's latest project you know check out the team team sesh SoundCloud or check out team sesh on Twitter if you want to keep up to date with every single thing Bonz does because I know he puts out a lot of material I don't review all of it because you know he's very prolific I don't cover every single thing he does but I do want to shout out this huge track he has out over here titled Sean Paul was never there to give me the light featuring Danny Brown this track is in this section of the video the best tracks of the week best tracks of the week because the chemistry on this track is amazing the way Danny and bones play off of each other on this track is fantastic I'm actually really like impressed with Danny's verse here I think one of his better features in a while the beat is monstrous bones does this thing as well as he typically does it you know as a lyricist as a rapper you know but just the fact that he sort of conceived this track and quarters kind of orchestrated it and pulled it all together I think is sort of a another stroke of genius for him so again fantastic track love the way that they played off of each other here great production good lyrics and make sure that you know if you hear any track this week that I recommend to you make sure it's this one and finally I want to give a shout out to the new guerrilla toss song skull pop guerrilla toss sounding way different on this new crop of tracks from the forthcoming record definitely not as shrill noisy or as you know difficult to digest you know still though sounding very experimental very post-punk inspired very odd this new track over here has a lot of like very tight danceable beats slightly electronic some of the guitar work on here sort of off kilter off be purposefully to kind of be a little disorienting and the vocals the lyrics are you know like really odd and abstract and weird you know this is like exactly what I like to hear from my left-field post-punk bands and you know just kind of excited to hear the new record you know I've always sort of seen excuse me a lot of potential mcgrill toss is done but I've never like loved an entire record you know this sort of sounded like to me that you know this could potentially end up happening you know based on what I'm hearing so far from these singles and I'm going to leave it at that guys those were the best worst and kind of man songs of the week again remember our amazon associate link is down there in the description as well as our turntable lab link hit those pick up some stuff for yourselves treat treat yo'self and I will see you guys in the next video you're the best grabber 
sFZgERqFK4g,hi everyone know that the enhanced ham here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Karen J Kalinin album bravado this is the latest full-length album from Australian musical eccentric and songwriter Karen J Kalinin four years after his breakout record for XL Recordings embraces him an album that I hadn't heard the year that it dropped in 2013 until I think a year later I did a speaking engagement tour in Australia and one of the kids who showed up to the show brought a CD copy of the album and handed to me and said boy yet can't listen to Karen jcalahan and I was like okay you Vegemite munching kangaroo Jackie I'll give this a listen and I was actually pretty floored by this thing this is a really cool album it's really all over the place but the songs are consistently great stylistically it sways between being and Emily catchy and impossibly dark grabbing the ugliest characteristics of humanity by the air and just throwing it up in the air a very weird dynamic to the tracklist yes but Karen's eccentric nature and is very expressive and strange vocals tied the entire album together into one very tight underappreciated package so of course I'm excited for whatever his next album is going to be even if it is four years later and my excitement for this thing was heightened by the fact that every lead track a teaser track that I heard up to the release of this thing was fantastic living each day sad a bravado down to hang but simultaneously I'm kind of confused by the massive featureless on this thing it's rare that artists making pop music or in the indie scene go to such great lengths to bring on so many collaborators onto a single project and slap all their names right there in the tracklist we have psych folks tour wise blood who dropped an album not too long ago that was somewhat well received the equally trippy and odd Conan moccasin is on this record Jorge el Bronx whose name I'm sorry I can't pronounce correctly he has Clyde in the past with Ariel pink he's a multi-instrumentalist - producer songwriter we have no way veteran James chance on this thing and equally eccentric indie songwriter Nicholas Savage is on this album as well and those are just the characters I was somewhat familiar with going into this project given the variety of extra personnel on this thing it should be no surprise that stylistically this album is kind of all over the place just like its predecessor but even though it's similarly unpredictable it's also kind of a departure which I know doesn't make sense but bravado in comparison with embraces 'im is nowhere near as dark or as primal this album by comparison is noticeably brighter smoother more synthetic sexier with a bit of pristine New Wave Sheen on some of these tracks but somehow Karen manages to bring over all the weirdness and all the oddity from the previous record and also kind of make it function on this new one - this album is so visceral it's so exciting to me it's so energetic it makes me want to parade around in my underwear strike and dance poses it makes you want to sing my heart out makes me want to shake my ass and you know maybe just like start start a coke addiction just start a good steady nice coke addiction we have the song song about drugs on this album which is like this freaky lush arena pop rock tune that I'm totally addicted to and orgasmic chorus that gets bigger and bigger and bigger with every time it's repeated on the track and a series of tension building verses that aren't so much verses as they are like these freaky sideshow detours of strange vocal effects and just kind of a weird singing detour some of my favorites being wrapped up in plastic thrown down the stairs feeling fantastic or this is a good one I love you this track is blissfully melodic it's hard-hitting its grand is triumphant it is the definition of flying your freak flag high I also have the smooth funky southern rock vibe of the song living each day select guitar licks on this thing uplifting chorus with some odd falsettos worked in there a very assuring mantra about living each day like it's your last but under the glitter and glam of the feel-good instrumental and in the message of the hook there are some dark points in the lyrics like using this will to live each day like it's your last to shrug off the urge to systematically kill there's also a weird line about a sandwich a sandwich the song bravado is the lead single to this album works perfectly in the context of the tracklist as the closer easily one of my favorite singles of the year I've had months to listen to this thing and I'm still just kind of speechless about it honestly I have the lyrics memorized by heart but yet I'm still kind of yet to fully and completely decipher exactly what the the statement or the point of the song is or rather what the point of inspiration may have been for the sentiment of the song the track features these glassy epics synth chords an irresistible groovy beat and easily one of Karen's most passionate vocal performances on the entire album the build-up to the chorus is great the instrumental passages are amazing it's rare that I use the phrase perfectly crafted pop song and this is maybe an instance where I'm tempted to do so the opposite of the pop spectrum on this album though has to be the song down to hang a very tense noisy and freakish rock track that features James chance so of course it's going to have a little bit of a post-punk noise rock no wavy kind of vibe to it this is the one track on the album that I think would have fit kind of snugly on the last album with the exception of moments on this track where you're getting kind of all these funky bass lines and slick guitar licks that are kind of playful and bright still though this track is definitely Karin embracing his darker side on this album and I love the lyrical theme of the track talking about meeting a girl on the Internet and she's down to hang with you and then beyond that the song is a series of comparisons of things she is down to hang like she's down to hang like Jesus Christ like a Picasso painting like a carcass in the butcher's freezer it's a really freaky song and I love the intensity of it too that's kind of a sound kind of a vibe I expected to hear going into this album the unexpected though comes in the shape of tracks like my moment or big enough for this whole town all three of which at some feature these huge glistening something euro dance beats which kind of take me back to to high school or junior high I can't quite remember whenever earlier in my lifetime when this was popular on the radio I found myself kind of getting a bit of a touch of nostalgia for the sounds I was listening to it kind of replayed on this album revived on this album but actually think hearing repurposed it in a really creative way kind of using this sound as a vehicle to release a very tense build-up for the first portion of a track because in that context the beats and everything that ends up happening once this explosion once this crescendo has occurred is actually pretty gratifying this whole town and big enough are equally beautiful visceral grand demand that the listener lose control but they each have their slightly different approaches I mean the former has a kind of sensual and subtle introduction ballad before the kick drums really rock it off the latter has more of a duet quality to it thanks to some singing from star and while we're talking about duets on the track friend of Lindsay Morrison that is where we get the vocals from wise blood a track that I think is kind of a funny meditation on Karin's own relevance in the music industry either they're just kind of throwing that out there just a funny aside and decided to sort of name the track after it I liked the instrumental to track a lot I liked the first half of the song quite a bit but I do think some of the vocal chemistry between him and wise blood does get kind of awkward at the tail end of the song and as long as I'm complaining the track family home is the album's sole slow burner and nothing wrong with a slow burner I like where it's placed in the tracklist I like the build-up to the chorus which is really gratifying but the ending kind of fizzles out not only that but as captivating as some of the lyrics and interesting and some of the lyrics on this track are the story just feels kind of unfinished and really esoteric at least too esoteric for what it seems like Karen is singing about which has an incredible amount of gravity to it I don't know if it has something to do with young love or infidelity it seems kind of like a situation that Karen doesn't fully paint a vivid picture of because he has maybe some sort of regret over it or this is like a really traumatic or embarrassing time for some of the people who he's singing about that are involved in the song despite those complaints though still thought this is a really impressive record on par with embraces 'm if not slightly better i do have those couple of tracks i didn't care for that much the flow of the album is really strange and like embraces 'm a little all over the place kind of feels like compilation in a sense the only kind of you know there are some sonic themes there are some production themes throughout the record that I think tie a lot of the album together instrumentals are great vocal performances are great a bulk of the songwriting is really good Karen continues to be a really captivating vocalist and thankfully the risk that he took not only stylistically with this record but also by bringing on all of this extra personnel bringing on all of these fellow creators these fellow musicians paid off big time I'd say I'm feeling a decent a strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate here the

iNGIJ0GG77o,haha hi everyone softening Zatanna here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new susan album control new jersey native solana and ma nero is back with her debut commercial album on Top Dawg entertainment she remains to be the labels sole female artist she joined up with the label back in 2013 surely after released an EP a commercial u P in 2014 titled Z the EP while it did get her a lot of attention in my opinion that it left a little bit to be desired it was kind of under written kind of under produced felt more like a demo or a mixtape than a legitimate commercial project not that I didn't think that there was potential there on the CP there was it's just that I didn't think this was the label putting their best foot forward with scissors music patiently waiting though three years finally here debut album and I am very pleased with the results not only is what Sousa doing on this album miles ahead of anything on Z but in between these two releases she has developed this really smooth sensual modern sound that I love she didn't get nostalgic and throw it back just to rehash a bunch of old stale R&B isms and she didn't go the all R&B route either and just drench everything in too much reverb and call it a day on this album scissor rides a series of instrumentals that are very refined very detailed Basie textured layered very melodic the instrumentation is really tasteful and just progressive enough to sort of push her over the edge and separate her from her contemporaries now vocally says it is still not the flashiest singer not the craziest or most fiery singer that you're ever going to hear this leaves at least a few songs in the track listing here maybe a little mild at points like love galore or prom but it's actually sis's song concept and her songwriting her catchy melodies and her lyrics which are occasionally very raw intimate and erotic that really sell the album drive the personality of the wreck the LP does kick off in a really odd way though with set a very slow sour lazily strum guitar chords that are very stark a little bass in there too and when scissor pops into the mix and she starts singing she seems to be delivering more of like a musical rant than a consciously penned tune it's like her singing and almost her lyrics are just her venting stream-of-consciousness about her emotional insecurities being left by her lover in response to that she angrily admits to sleeping with his friend really bitter nasty way to start off an R&B record but this song effectively sets the tone for the entire album because every track to follow is emotionally complicated dynamic this is not just some breezy lovesick casual R&B album listen this album varies between being intensely sexual and a sad emotional mess throughout the first half of the record there is a constant theme of being the side chick and she doesn't just portray the side chick as some kind of sex robot or a motionless or thoughtless person rather she explores the emotional complications the secrecy the feelings of loneliness of neediness that fueled this position whether it be on the highs of sexual ecstasy on love galore or on the very desperate lows of the weekend where sisse basically portrays herself as being that other woman who only sees this guy on the weekend the song is written almost as if she's writing a letter to or singing directly to the other woman the main chick and when communicating to her in song she takes almost this defeatist tone like she's just taking this guy for the weekend in the same way that someone might who takes their kids after they lost a custody battle and they only see them for like several days a week the instrumental is so fantastically dramatic and Susan's singing on it only enhances that quality of like I don't know two-fold threefold fourfold however many folds you want then on this album we get the politics of with doves in the wind I love how blatant and straightforward and direct this track is lyrically of out the world of basically sexual economics I love the dreamy keyboards on this thing the thick bass-heavy be the clunky boom-bap style drum production on this thing scissors frankness in her lyrics is amazing and I love a numerous points up a track where she's like it but I say it's given me the vapors great kendrick lamar feature in the second half of the track that adds to the frankness the humour of the song it's just so great to hear scissor finally drop a commercial record where she is putting out her best material also on the track drew Barrymore where she takes a more refined approach emotionally a more introspective approach the track is more beautiful instrumentally features a lavish string section on the chorus on this song we see Sousa dealing with emotional insecurities physical insecurities worrying about living up to that image of the female ideal I'm surprised to hear the musical direction that she takes on the song prom the gentle drumbeats on this thing the driving bass and the sparkling guitar is almost got me like a whiff of a beach house but vocally very different tune and from what I was able to gather from the lyrics and just listening to the track repeatedly it feels like I'm listening to a song about young love or somebody who is very young and in a relationship and is kind of worrying about that and more as they feel like they are about to transition into the next phase of life and they worry about whether or not everything they've known is going to come along with them or you know what's going to change as she is inevitably going to move on to become a different person I'm a little cold on the ending of the track just being a lazy fade-out though but you know like the EP that preceded this album there are a couple of spots that do feel a little under written a little short we get some abrupt endings or the tune just feels more like a motif or something that could have been a song had it been fleshed out or just developed a little bit more namely tracks like go Gina or the song anything which for me was a shame because I thought that had one of the more out there instrumentals on the entire record that being said though the production on this record is miles beyond a lot of what was on Z so even when a track is you know a little so so as far as the song where I it's still pleasant to listen to as long as I'm complaining though I do wish the instrumental vibe of the song broken clocks was a little bit more experimental a little bit more colorful you know while I do like the tune of the track again the instrumentation hits me is just a little bland but the song topic the theme of the track is something that I think a lot of young people could relate to the struggle of the day by day grind of fighting to just be a financially independent person still though I think the final moments of the album are really strong and are indicative of a really important emotional and mental transition that isn't exactly highlighted in a really obvious way you kind of have to take the general lyrical tone of the tracks in the latter half of the album compared to the first half and you'll kind of see there is a bit of a night and day difference I think it starts with broken clocks it goes onto the song normal girl which is a fantastic ballad has one of the best most passion of vocal performances on the entire record and features scissor singing about just wanting to be a girl who could be in a steady relationship being taken home to her significant others parents she seems to be kind of floating away from the needy clingy insecure lustful and impulsive tendencies that she showcase for a great deal of tracks on the first half of the record on the song pretty little birds we get what feels like a lot of themes of devotion within a relationship where Sousa seems to be kind of going out of her way to make herself more desirable to her significant other and she feels really confident really strong in this relationship that she's singing about this is contrasted pretty starkly with the song garden earlier on the album which in a way is also a love song but when you read into the lyrics on that track while the instrumental does kind of feel like a very beautiful dream state you have to kind of take that in in in sort of a negative sense because it's a dream state in that what you're listening to might not be real because there are a lot of implications especially in the hook that this love is kind of a fake love it's an empty love she worries about finding out whether or not this guy who she's with is in fact a different person not who she thought he was and she seems to imply at numerous points on the track that if he knew who she really was that he would cut things off those feelings of fear and paranoia on pretty little birds just seem to has evaporated completely Isaiah Rashad's verse at the end is kind of odd it's layered in so much reverb and it's kind of distant that you know I like the sound of it I like the tone of it I like the texture adds to the track it just kind of seems like a weird Spacey detour sizzle Eve's us on this album much in the same way that she introduced us on this album with some raw vocals over some guitar chords but the ending of this record is noticeably sweeter than the beginning was here we have Sousa in a much more positive mindset but she still kind of feels like she's in a position where she is really unaccomplished she's young she's a twenty-something she doesn't have anything she says in her name but ultimately she showcases that she is wanting to grow she's wanting to move on she's wanting to progress as a person while this record is a vast improvement for Sousa in terms of production songwriting performance it's by no means a perfect record I do wish the obvious concept of this record was a little bit more fluid and linear and focused the flow of the album is a little spotty especially around the middle Point and the interlude track some songs really do feel underwritten in comparison to others either by way of being short or just kind of based off of these really mild vocal improvisation rather than you know really focused writing all that being said though very good album from Sousa and pretty impressive for a debut and looking forward to whatever she does in the future feeling a decent strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

yuKEu22_lcM,hi everyone sweaty bandana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review for the new Sufian Stephens Bryce Dessner Nico Muhly and James McAlister album Planetarium this is a new collaborative record from all the people I just named an album that is so immense enlarge in scope that it's it's a little difficult to sum up this thing is a 75-minute album about our solar system and its planets not only that but the lyrical concepts of the tracks are derived from the mythology of the names attached to the planets Venus Uranus Jupiter so on and so forth soufiane then ties this to a series of personal experiences and passionate thoughts put poetically on sex war his father and of course given the names of the creators of this record there is a wide array of musical styles on this thing instrumental palates singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Sufjan Stevens has covered a multitude of musical bases over the years and he continues to do so here given what I know of Bryce's work in the national I wasn't expecting too much from him on this album to be completely honest but his guitar work is actually so versatile it pops up almost everywhere on this entire thing you know there aren't too many moments here where he isn't finding you know some kind of pocket or some kind of place where he can provide a little bit of color a little bit of texture some extra melody or counterpoint Nico Muhly is the person who I was most excited to your contributions from and I was not disappointed given his background in classical composition of course you're going to hear orchestral horns and strings and a variety of other pieces of instrumentation on this thing to enhance the bassline of vocals guitars keyboards drums and drummer James McAllister I'm sure is bringing all the acoustic percussion on this thing but there's actually quite a bit of sequence beat synthetic production on this album as well that sound kind of akin to that of what you might have heard on Sufjan Stevens age of odds record so to recap the percussion on this thing both electric and acoustic Sufjan Stevens vocals which you know usually are delivered in that really kind of chilly hushed but occasionally fed through a vocoder or hit with a dash of auto-tune nico muhly Zoar kestrel contributions to the record all the guitar work on this thing and the intertwining planetary and mythological lyrical concepts flowing throughout this thing it's 75 minutes 17 tracks and it is the definition of ambitious or at least the definition of indulgent and I'm not gonna lie this album was not easy to digest definitely one of the more difficult lessons in any of these artists discographies not only because compositionally and structurally these songs hit the listener with so much that after multiple listens it's kind of hard to gain any sense of familiarity with a lot of what's going on but the flow of the album is kind of confounding - that doesn't really seem to be any practical reason to why the songs are ordered in the way that they are at least in regards to the planetary concept of the record maybe I'm wondering on this but I think the tracklist is ordered purely for aesthetic purposes but that's also kind of confusing because I don't think it runs all that fluidly there are various short interludes throughout the album that feel almost unnecessary and insignificant shouldered in between these like hulk-sized massive musical pieces with black energy and Sun we see two of the album's most prominent ambient ish droney tracks put shoulder-to-shoulder and I don't know I'm just not really sure why I guess I could kind of come to somewhat of a guess based just on the titles alone but listening to one track after the other I don't really hear kind of a night-and-day difference between the tone of the two songs if you weren't paying attention you would probably assume that they were just an extension of each other you could most likely arrange the songs on this tracklist into a variety of different orders and you would get roughly the same lost in the woods experience while the song Neptune is pretty beautiful and I think guides listeners very gently into the planetary concept of the record once Jupiter comes in that track really smashes any hope of this album being manageable especially what they're paying a sudden 30-second interlude right after and honestly I like the song Jupiter a lot I love the heavy hard industrial kind of flavored pieces of percussion that fly into the latter half of the song that are really aggressive really exhilarating there's a nice catchy refrain on this track too and I think it's one of the more fluid compositions really visceral comes to a great climax but the progression of the album overall is just sort of spotty sprawling and inconsistent the tracks don't really reinforce each other all that well at least not in the sense that the album as it progresses gets more powerful wondrous there are a couple exceptions I like how the immense orchestral beauty of the song Pluto melts away into some bustling electronics that set the stage for the following track who Weber belts but then why does the song black hole just hard transition into another drone at the start of Saturn these two drones that sort of end and start their respective tracks don't really feel all that similar to me in tone there are a handful of songs in the tracklist that create an incredible amount of momentum within themselves Jupiter Mars Uranus Pluto I think the most glaring exception to this is maybe the song earth which is the longest track on the entire record and I think embodies the somewhat disjointed feel of the entire album as a single piece and since that's the case since planetarium is not a very holistic listen the tracks individually are kind of left to fend for themselves which is not very good for an album so long and with such a bold and in-your-face concept to it the songs on this record should obviously be without question greater than the sum of their parts instead I felt like I was left to just judge each song individually because they didn't build off of each other all that well and that's not really all that great because some of the songs in the track listing here don't really make all that much sense as standalone pieces the songs overuse of auto-tune and flickering electronics is really really grating I'm actually kind of sick of it by the time the song is over that being said I do like the inclusion of vocoder at the moments it is used on the album it actually kind of takes me out of the mindset that I'm listening to another soufiane album really I enjoy kind of the cold robotic tone of those vocals to me that's something I would love to hear on an album that's about the solar system you know there are a lot of very big ambitious beautiful and wonderful ideas on this album they're just not really all that organized all that well as a collective record I think if a lot of these songs were being composed with the rest of the tracks in mind they would have flowed into each other a little bit better some tracks would have been pared down just a little bit in order to get people's mouths watering and hold attention spans for the next track I feel like I'm listening to some very good and some very large ideas just cobbled together to create this giant Frankenstein monster that's moaning and wobbling around and not sure why he exists or where he's going or what he's doing which is actually not the vibe I want to get at all from an album with this concept because when you look at the way our solar system works especially in terms of orbit and a variety of other things there's actually quite a bit of flow and harmony to the system I don't get that on this album I don't get that vibe on this record for me this was a really tiring album there were a lot of spots that I liked but overall I did not feel good coming away from this record at all hardcore fans will most likely love the out of this thing and forgive its lack of a coherent direction most likely people are gonna love this thing because it sounds big and its intentions aren't all that clear so as a result it must be deep but for me all I feel like I'm hearing is just like a lot of winding compositions that don't quite know when to stop case in point the final track mercury who's trailing guitar interlude that closes the track out does nothing for the second half of the song and nothing for the final moments of this album it's just like this extended thing that's like okay all right wrap it up you know I'm kind of indifferent toward it there are things again that I really like some of the orchestral instrumentation some of soufiane songwriting I like a lot of the lyrics that he includes on some of these planets when he's talking about the the God mythology and sort of how that relates to his feelings on the things that they represent I like the idea of the concept I like some of the guitar work I actually like some of the electronic percussion on this record more than I did on the age of odds where you know it was a little bit of a turn-off for me I think the inclusion here is a little bit more refined and noisy and crazy but overall as an album especially an album that's supposed to have such a clear concept to it it just feels really flabby and indecisive long winded and I'm just sort of indifferent toward it I'm feeling a light too decent five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leaving angry comment in the comments if you're angry

yxPYzOB8rew,hi everyone Anthony 810 of the Internet's head her dias music hurt and it's time for review the new Katy Perry album witness going to power through this review Katy Perry is a pop diva she is a chart topper and this is her first record in four years following up 2013 prism which is an era in Katy Perry's career where we saw her writing all of these really huge overblown epic self-empowerment anthems on tracks like roar as well as Dark Horse also the euphoric triumph of the song walking on air while you know it's more of a party track still kinda has that same vibe and looking it's kind of extended on to her 2016 single as well rise however on this new LP of her she seems to be turning a new stylistic leaf the lead single from this thing chained to the rhythm is a bit of a dance pop throwback with a synth funk blare which is mostly a very good sensual and glamorous track that instrumentally is very feel-good despite the fact that the hook is multi-phased and kind of clunky swish-swish however is my favorite single from the bunch on this album and is easily one of the most fun songs Katy Perry has released in years the tracks chill throwback house beat deeply pitched vocals and braggadocious lyrics just ooze swagger and charisma all over the track just how Katy delivers that swish swish fish another one in basket it's just a moment on the album that I like so much of course Nicki Minaj tying up the back end with a feature only adds to the swaggerific I can't believe I just use that word vibe of the track and then we have the song bone Appetit featuring migos which was a bit of a snooze fest similarly chill and groovy but not quite as compelling from a writing standpoint migos his appearance on the track was okay of course some trap style high hats fly into the instrumental at the point where they appear of course lyrically on this track Katy hits listeners from beginning to end with all of these food to sex symbolic the tie-ins they're all really obvious and get really old really fast for me it's pretty fair to say that going into this record given these singles I had some expectations in terms of the instrumental palette and the musical vibe of the album but Katy smashed them right away but not necessarily in a bad way on the intro track witness which is very dramatic and piano led ballad about needing a companion or a witness in your life it sort of seems like Katy is speaking from the isolated position of Fame and as a result of that and the loneliness due to a lack of romance I guess needing some kind of connection needing someone who speaks her language so to say this is kind of a phenomenon that I saw Michael from Vsauce talking about in the first episode of his new YouTube series on YouTube read nobody's paying me to talk about this by the way I just watched it and I really liked it and on this particular episode he talked about isolation going as far as to hold himself up in a very small room for 72 hours within a matter of hours he lost all track of time and after a few days he had actually lost track of his own thoughts and experiences he wasn't able to decipher whether or not something he had done had he actually done it did he remember it this experience sort of taught him and me and probably anybody else watching the episode the importance of validation for your experiences and the things you do from other people other people kind of verify that what's happening around you it is in fact happening around you this is an attribute of companionship that's not often explored in mainstream pop music and it's pretty interesting to hear Katy Perry approach it the fact that the tune is very catching and melodic and the production is pretty sleek only adds to the appeal so you know a nice surprise to kick the album off but it does not take long for the surprises on this record to turn sour the song hey hey hey not only feature some of the worst lyrics on the entire album please share some of these lyrics guide you you don't even need to try to look for them there's all over the place Katy is making all these ridiculous comparisons of herself to Ella Rose it's sweet or a thorn it's it'll pinch it ouch it's like she's doing this in an effort to try to impress the audience but none of the comparison she makes are actually all that thoughtful or impressive but the worst thing about the track is this stale dubstep ish instrumental that man is anybody singing over this kind of stuff in 2017 it's just funny to hear how badly stuff like this has aged in the few years since it's been relevant the buzzing bass lines and the punchy very cavernous snares just sounds so old I just have no idea how this track made the cut on the record same thing with the song mind maze which may not be dubstep but it is similarly gaudy and horrendous I feel like I'm caught between listening to an EDM nightmare and some kind of wintery auto-tune power ballad from Kanye's 808s and heartbreak and the two do not come together very well at all if we take it from the start of the album it's actually not until track 5 deja vu that I hear a song that stylistically I expected to hear going into the album not only is it great to hear a track that actually reinforces this new direction for Katy Perry but it's a great track with the driving house beat elongated notes coming off of Katy Perry's vocals which are very epic very grand very expressive it's super chill there's something that's laid-back but also kind of tense about it too you know so like five tracks in the album is already super inconsistent not really a good look however I do like the song power that comes not too long after this it's kind of an R&B tinged self empowerment anthem with huge epic instrumentation given that it is a Katy Perry album you have to kind of go into the record expecting to hear at least a couple of these and this one isn't that bad I love the steamy distant horns that kick the track off Katy Perry's vocal melody is pretty solid the swelling burning synth layers that pop up on the hook to sound really great as well there's something kind of a little lazy and a good way about the beat that kind of reminds me of like wonky music a little bit almost like her or one of her producers we're listening to the last flume album and caught a whiff of inspiration I also have a punchy dirty fast rough and dramatic drum filled that segues from verse to chorus and back to verse again throughout the track that sound fantastic I get a similar power ballad vibe on the song miss you more but this song while it is grand it's very sad as well seems to be Katy singing about the demise of a relationship that I think she still saw more potential and in retrospect between the huge booming be in the soaring strings and the very large pianos on this track this song is about as big as an emotional statement in mainstream pop music gets it's like listening to this song and watching Katy Perry from a second-story window and she's down there on the lawn with a big sign that says I miss you and mascara is like dripping down her face after this I'm happy to hear another track that sounds like a bit of a vintage dance throwback on the song tsunami this one has a bit of an 80s vibe to it though you know I love hearing these songs on this album there's something about this style of music this style of instrumental that complements Katy's singing at her vocal style so much her singing just soars over these kinds of beats with like such grace such theatrical bah it feels powerful I'll use that word again and I can't help but feel like indulging in songs like this is allowing Katy to connect with an era of music that she has a lot of passion for it's just kind of a shame she didn't indulge in it more or just kind of keep her indulgences to that because this album really is I think one of Katy's more bloated albums because there are so many cuts on this album that either seem a little bill conceived or don't complement this sound at all and this is kind of the dominant vibe of the record you know this thing is more than 10 minutes longer than Teenage Dream and it actually feels like it's longer than that you know what is the song bigger than me really adding to this album that the previous tracks didn't already and given the lyric on this track about evolving it's kind of funny this is one of the least adventurous songs on the entire record and the closing track on this thing Jesus it is this long-winded thankless piano ballad that just does not know when to stop and I was shocked to see that Hot Chip had a production credit on this thing much less soul production credit on this thing also shout-out to purity ring for producing miss you more that was good the song pendulum that perceives the closer on this record is so much more of a superior ending to the whole thing not only is the instrumental ER one of the most gratifying on the entire album yes some dirty marching snares are driving kick a good chord progression that's punctuated with these staccato changes and given the sentiment of the track about everything coming back around in the game of life this song just feels so much more fitting as a parting goodbye to the audience this is just a mixed bag of an album and not because the risks that Katy Perry took on this record didn't pan out the opposite the moments where she played it super safe doled out the cliches that she sort of known for or indulged in sounds that are stale or would have fit better on her last record those spots are really what way the album down I'm still happy for the most part with the singles I loved that I heard some really gratifying deep cuts when I heard the entire album like tsunami and deja vu but I can't help but feel like there was so much unrealized potential with this record which could have been at least partially reached just by cutting out some of the fat from this record the very obvious fat I did however end up enjoying this record overall I'm feeling a light 2006 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best true the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in

iBHjkRZQbv8,[Music] hi everyone its Anthony Fantan oh here the internet sweatiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Brock Hampton project saturation Brock Hampton is a hip-hop outfit that was once based down in Texas I think they relocated to the internet or something I think they have seven members or nine members or 12 members or like 15 members not entirely sure oh it's it's I know I'm trying to be festive over here because this is a very good project and I did want to have the yellow flannel on here you know just to make a little appearance but it is hot it is very hot and I'm just going to be super unprofessional and wear my undershirt okay now if you weren't already aware there's some notable underground names already affiliated with the Brock Hampton project that is one Kevin abstract down McLennan both of whose solo material I have been aware of I have heard much of it admittedly more of Kevin's music has stuck with me than Dom's especially his American boyfriend project that dropped not too long ago a lot of fans and music writers hype up the fact that he is so open about his sexuality in his music is like this big selling point but I think what makes him unique as an artist runs much deeper than that just listen to American boyfriend and see for yourself I'm not going to talk too much about it here I'm just going to say make sure you've heard it if it slipped through the cracks for you because there are a lot of elements to that project a lot of ideas forged on that project that do show up in spades on saturation quite a bit there's actually one track the last track on the entire project waste which is this deeply melodic and passionate guitar ballad that would have fit snugly on American boyfriend and I think will remind some fans of cuts that were on Frank ocean's blond all that being said though there are other names affiliated with Brockhampton that you're going to get to know just because of how much talent they bring to the table on this thing just because of how much they steal the show on these tracks whether that be Java or net champion or Merlyn would or mere van just to name a few and this is not Brock Hamptons first rodeo either I remember first hearing about them back in 2015 when I heard that dirt single played on ebro's beats one show or whatever and I thought that single really hit hard it was a hard as nails track it was wild it was youthful it was off-the-wall it was crazy and then the subsequent mixtape all-american trash that the group dropped not too long after really underwhelmed there were some hard gritty tracks on there but much of the project I think was bogged down with a lot of impersonal slow burners that really took the wind out of the sails of the entire tape and I most likely would not have looked for another Brockhampton project ever again if it had not been for the fact that teasing up to saturation they released one fire single after another there was out a bad track promoting this album it was actually not a track that was not excellent promoting this album whether it be fake or gold or boys or heat or face or star it was just like non-stop fantastic tracks coming out with this much material you could risk spoiling the album experience once you actually hear the entire thing but you know going into this at least I thought I knew that I'm that most of it was going to be good but now that I have the entire thing in front of me this thing is 17 tracks it's 50 minutes and there's only like a couple skits and you know all American trash did have a few duds on it so I'm coming to this thinking is Brock Hampton going to consistently deliver great material for the entire e of this thing somehow they do shockingly this up-and-coming group has delivered one of the most consistent rap projects I've heard this year consistent in terms of quality this thing is wall-to-wall creative colorful visceral bouncy sweet catchy hard production and the music they create on this thing runs deeper than rap like that's on waste that I mentioned earlier the song swim is this dreamy serene kind of sensual auto-tune ballad that is beautiful it's feel-good I love the distant tones whaling way in the background very faintly they kind of sound like horns kind of I'm not saying they are but they're very beautiful I love the sentiment of the track too coming through in the lyrics and the vocal effects don't exactly take away from the emotional performance of the singing either the string sections that were worked into the song cache various points are gorgeous as well the song bump is easily one of the biggest bangers on the entire record but the hook is very unique because it features kind of a breakdown a breakaway every piece of instrumentation melts or disappears just so we can hear this one lonely tiny guitar line with Kevin abstract singing over it he takes on most of the song hooks if not all of them on the entire project he sings very well but match with this guitar line it's almost like I'm hearing some kind of sad angsty guy alt-rock from the 90s or something and that's not the only point on the album where the group seems to pull some very clear influence from rock music ten to twenty years ago the song milk might have a sequence beat and other fundamentals of hip hop production worked into the instrumental but the lyrics and the vocal melody sounds like I'm listening to the limitations of some kind of 2000 Zehra emo band singing about struggling to be yourself and wishing you had a friend you just kind of hang out with and be on the couch with there might not be an overall scheme or theme to this album or whether it be conceptually or lyrically or even musically sometimes but again I think in terms of quality song quality production quality lyrical quality every song is so high there are a few tracks on the back end that feel kind of way out in terms of musical style and stick out like a sore thumb a little bit but even these songs for me are not really skippable there's so much great material on here and I haven't even gotten to the core tracks yet like the opener heat I really don't know what to praise about this track first the insane aggressive in-your-face off the wall animalistic verses and rapping throughout the track or the instrumental which features this clunky heavy drumbeat that just knocks this fuzzy somewhat distorted bass line and on the hook this wall of shrill ear piercing noise and sinister melodies like flies in and creates this loschen of sonic mayhem the song gold is much lighter and smoother and catchy er by comparison kevin's hook on this thing is one of the best on the entire project keep a gun chained on my neck sighs again boy I bet a trim you ever spent Brockhampton here effectively proves that they could dial it back from 11 to a very chill laid-back 5 but still come through the track that's very sticky has a lot of personality a lot of character in a good sense of humor to the song star features all of these hilarious pop-culture references from music to movies and so on and so forth Kevin abstracts verse toward the back end cleans up shop and is a little more personal in the previous two talking about how he needs to get his teeth fixed and his association with Vice Land the beat on this thing is a nocturnal trunk knocker that segues seamlessly in the next track boys the following track Tupac might just be like a bit of a one-minute instrumental but it's still one of the most emotionally compelling song within the entire album Brockhampton isn't just dropping aggressive bangers on here they are very versatile group they are great at dropping those aggressive and kind of mid paced tracks though because these guys go into each track with a lot of chemistry lyrically they play off of each other so well and extrapolate fantastically on whatever flow that they have chosen on a track it gives each song a lot of momentum to the point where they don't even really need to go into a track with so much in the way of a super strong lyrical topic or concept for it to be entertaining case in point Bank case in point fake not to mention the fact that the forward-thinking production and quality hooks also add to the winning mix of these songs but to get back to my earlier point about sad songs on this thing these guys don't just drop bangers their real moments of personal turmoil on here they're really introspective tracks that seemed to reflect at least a little bit on the current political and social state of America being yourself loneliness struggling through a thankless and unforgiving economy love being unsure of your future in a way Brock Hampton more than any of their contemporaries I think has embodied the woes of the average millennial and they've done it without making an album or making a project that is overly political or is like Trump Trump Trump we don't like Donald Trump yeah I mean I assume that and my point here about these woes embodying them is especially true when you consider that the last gang of young upstarts rabble rousers to take the rap game by storm was Odd Future whose rage just kind of turned out to be a phase fueled by their teenage angst and I'm not saying that as a slight against odd feature or as a slight against Brockhampton but I can't help but feel like listen to this as much as I enjoy it I feel like I'm almost listening to an odd future for people who went to college or graduated college because I feel like Brock Hampton in a way is delivering what so many music writers and fans had banked on odd future doing as a collective delivering these perfectly crafted energetic crazy forward thinking ahead of the curve posse tracks with each member having their own distinct personality with each member functioning on a similarly high level of talent Odd Future unfortunately as a collective did not do that that's not to say that they weren't an incredibly influential group and that they didn't have talent at their disposal I just thought each member saw more artistic success individually than they did as a group because Tyler has come out with his solid projects so his Earl Sol has said I don't mean to turn this whole review into an odd feature conversation but I can't help but feel like they kind of set the foundation for what Brock Hampton is doing here on this project I mean certainly there are a lot of verses on here that I think give off a little bit of an earl vibe Brock Hampton though seems to gel in a way that no other group their size has in a long time which is what makes this album so electrifying because the quality of the songs here again is so fantastically consistent you have so much diversity across the album in terms of emotion musical style the personalities and lyrical styles of each member also the producers on this thing bring an incredibly large amount of talent and creativity to the table too and this thing is so dense and detailed in terms of each verse each be what each member is overall adding to this project individually as much as I have talked about this project I feel like I've only sort of scratched the surface of what makes this thing so good so I mean I'm just going to leave it here and say this is fantastic sure you listen to this it's an excellent project and I am feeling a light nine on it transition have you given saturation to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which guy are you next to like if you like please

CnBrzOCbShc,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another one of our weekly track round ups where I go over what I thought were the best and worst tracks of the week as you know to support this segment down there in the description is our Amazon Associates link you click on that if you live in the u.s. anything you buy on there we get kicked back from it uses to buy some stuff you were going to buy anyway also down there is our link to the website turntable lab comm they're a fantastic site where you can get great colorful pressings of records that i've reviewed and more as well as turntable and sort of audio equipment for the budding vinyl collector I see that a lot of you guys have been using that link in fact a lot of people sort of transitioned over from the Amazon link to the turntable lab link which is actually pretty cool you know for buying records and buying music and buying a turntable stuff which again very cool because uh Amazon and you know I I do like my Amazon link I do like that you guys support us through the Amazon link but Amazon is they're slightly saying you know I'll just leave it at that but Amazon you know keep doing your thing alright let's uh let's go on before I get myself into much trouble love you love you Amazon so both of those links again down there in the description at the very top of the description let's get into the tracks with the worst tracks of the week we're going to be kicking it off with the brand-new death from above 1979 track freeze me this track is not at all what I look for or enjoy from a death from above a album but the thing is this is inevitably what would have happened had the band just continued originally when they you know we're at their creative and artistic peak because the drum vocal bass guitar combo at least in the case of the style of music they were writing you know was going to run into its limitations and here we see less emphasis on the bass seems more like they're making just a straight dance music track with a more normal and average balance of instrumentation a lot of the lyrics are awful in fact the rhyme scheme is really bad I would say just just very basic to the point where it's obnoxious you know there's absolutely nothing special or captivating about the songwriting either it's just like a really average sounding song from a duo that originally sounded very special and again you know this is what was going to happen unless they somehow you know found a way to get more experimental more wild more out there but death from above they were never one of those kinds of bands you know they were never like a lightning bolt or something like that you know which even in that case you know you can run into limitations you know sort of with such a simple and straightforward you know instrumental build instrumental palette but you know it's it's totally fine though because that's part of what makes them unique but I'm not going to go on a diet tribe about bass drum vocal combos I'm just going to move on so the death from above track very underwhelmed very uninterested in it next the new car seat headrests songs Stoney baloney featuring featuring Sam Rea this track is terrible but it's not really meant to be good it's a diss song directed towards Sam of the musical project teen suicide because Sam released this long think piece esque diatribe on the Internet of him sort of like critiquing car seat headrest and sort of making fun of wills music under the name which is really odd because pretty much everything he accuses will as far as an artistic shortcoming like he's guilty of two three four five times more because I have not heard a teen suicide album that was listenable or entertaining all the way through you know as as clearly as will sometimes where's his influences on his sleeve he can at least pen a somewhat entertaining record especially in the case of his last one in my opinion teen suicide not so much so with that in mind the think piece is even more hilarious and you know I'm just going to leave it at that you know obviously the diss track is very bad it's very corny but it's sort of tongue-in-cheek to you know give it a listen if you want a good laugh the new Torres song skim unfortunately has made it into this section of the this episode was anticipating the song to be great especially since there were at least a couple of tracks off of the last Torres album that I thought were really good however in the case of this new song this just sounds like a really awkward like a ripoff from the last st. Vincent record and combine that with some really awkward squawky very melodically deficient guitar soloing throughout a good chunk of the track and it's just one of the weirdest and I guess most unsatisfying songs I've ever heard Torres put together I can commend the fact that it seems like she's trying to go a little a little bit more experimental but the influences that are kind of pushing her in that in that direction are super painfully obvious and she's not really transforming them into anything I find to be all that riveting or exciting or the final word I'm looking for is a I guess kind of distinct you know it just seems like oh well you know I've already heard this before but much better and not that long ago either so I mean I'm just going to leave it at that you know I do think there are probably some people out there who will dig this track more than me give it a shot you know especially if you love last album give it a shot next Jay electronic a letter to Fallon you know this track to me is the exact reason why we have not heard a Jay Electronica album yet because this track is terrible between the bad Kanye impression with the awful auto-tuned intro the completely uninspired and basic couple of versus on this track that are loaded with these generic motivational bars where I don't know where this dude is getting this passion to rap about motivation where's his motivation been for the past I don't know what decade as far as like where's an album is there is an album on the way is it an album where's album is an album around the corner where's the album J so this not interested in it totally done with it get out of my face it's terrible moving on from there Miley Cyrus with the song inspired ironic because the song does not sound inspired at all it just sounds like more bland a white girl from the country pop rock with her last song Malibu it's it's a little corny too with all these like personal allusions to her growing up and her family and her dad and the I don't know where she got this terrible 90 sweater in the thumbnail of the the YouTube video the sort of rainbow logo with the emcee on is even more confusing but I'm digressing her and not even talking about the music at this point and that's because there's not really much to talk about you know there's not much in terms of like substance here Miley is getting really personal and I think only her most hardcore fans who care about her personal life will even be mildly interested in this I don't know man it seems like she sort of made this really fast transition from total pop icon's psycho to like i'm just going to go back to like party in the USA Miley but you know like turn into somewhat of a hippie and now I'm super mellow you know it's kind of like that same level of innocence and like oh you know everything is bright and sunny and you know cool now and I don't really need to uh you know over-sexualize myself or you know wear any gold in my teeth or you know be really gritty or naughty or anything like that I'm just going to play a real cool real chill and you know smokeable and just chill move on from there the last track I want to put in this section is the new dnr and scissor sisters song swirl I will give the song credit it is one of the most gaudy tracks I've heard in a long time and then this may be one of those instances where you hear a track that it's so bad that it's good it is this balls and vagina to the wall to balls and vagina you know not just balls to the wall but vagina balls and vagina to the wall dance track with this driving dirty rough beat and the the vocal gimmick or hook on this song is kind of like this combination of twerk working it what what swirling it and so it comes it out in this weird mutation of a word swirl and that that's basically there were you know the the gimmick it's the hook it's the refrain the swirl you want to swirl so um I don't know sounds like a bad name to me sounds like they're trying to make a bad mean but again could be one of those situations where it's so bad that it's good you know maybe you guys next week it's going to catch on and come that time you'll be on the dance floor swirl paying yourselves but that's going to do it for this section of the other video let's get them in the met tracks the tracks that I wasn't super crazy about but I still want to dimension I thought that you guys might be a little more into them than I am for some good hardcore with a bit of a throwback vibe you know that there's a turnstile connection here as well so the turnstile fans check this out and who trapped under ice track no relief really hard really aggressive it's kind of got that you know old school 90s Oh super macho kind of quality to it it's pretty funny iron and wine call it dreaming its pleasant track I've never been a huge iron and Y fan but this track seems okay Christian Christian Scott Sunday ad WA has a new track titled the walk Christian Scott's last album stretch music I enjoyed how he worked in some elements of like synthetic percussion and electronics and - you know this great jazz instrumentation to me it was really creative it was really kind of pushing things forward a little bit he tries to do the same thing here with some synthetic percussion in the background kind of patting away very lightly I wish it was a little heavier a little bit groovier and there's some pretty wild background vocals or sort of guest vocalists on this thing that i like quite a bit too this track is a bit of a mixed bag you know the performances are good I wish the percussion was better you know but there is some eccentric qualities there and the vocals definitely give it a shot you know he's trying to push some interesting ideas in jazz right now I think it should be supported I think you should be you know getting some ear ear time from you guys moving on from there the new always track undertow the you know it's it's kind of like their last album in my opinion in that it is you know just an okay kind of jangly dreamy pop rock music there's nothing really there in terms of like a distinct or memorable sound or persona or character or anything you know that it's kind of melodic it's you know very bright it's very pleasant very easy to listen to I don't know you know people are going kind of crazy for it I think it's just kind of merely decent you know not that it's a terrible thing to listen to you could do far worse just letting you guys know that it's out and you know people are enjoying it new album on the way - same thing with Chaz over at Toro y Moi who has a new song that titled girl I like you and it's a synthesis last album you know definitely one my favorite Toro album so far but you know if you know anything about chances music he comes out with a totally new sonic direction and palette with every new record this to me isn't hitting me quite so hard the hook seems kind of flaccid to me very weak very deflated the groove the instrumental is decent probably the best thing about the entire track I guess I'm not really all that enamoured with the vocal performance on the song you know or the lyrics and the chorus as I said you know I don't mind him going into this direction musically stylistically but I feel like if he's going to you know rule number one the songwriting has got to be key the songwriting has got to be strong and I don't think that that is the case in this particular track you know I think this could have been a better written tune but moving on from their last track in this section of new Lord single sober which honestly I don't really feel anything about you know there's some moments where the horns pop into this track and the instrumental gets kind of huge and epic that I like quite a bit but I don't think this is one of the better Tunes that Lord has teased toward her latest album with and I feel like at this point she's teased with so many tracks that she's almost kind of spoiling the surprise I actually don't want to hear any more music before this album is physically completely out so um you know this track I'm not really all that nuts about it but hey you know it might grow on me in the context of the record which I'm just looking forward to hearing and just kind of you know getting that review out and being done with it moving on from there let's get into the best tracks of the week the tracks that lab me the most aerial pink comes through with another new single new project on the way I'm sure this one is titled another weekend not quite as synth driven or even as dreamy and nostalgic as Ariel's music typically is this new song over here you know it seems a little bit more modern in terms of the recording and the instrumental vibe though it does kind of have a jangly quality to the guitars love the tune love the vibe of the track Ariel's taking a little bit of a different vocal approach to I actually you know wouldn't have once I knew it was Ariel pink I was like okay you know cool but you know at first it was like this is an Ariel song you know it does feel like there is something a little off about it but not in a bad way you know not in a bad way he's doing something a little different and the tune is still there production is still there so you know no reason to fret or anything like that looking forward to what he's doing moving on from there Emily Haines in the soft skeleton fatal gift this is a great tune great kind of abstract multi-phased piano ballad which Emily Haines you know as you know she fronts metric you could not pay me to want to listen to a metric record to be completely honest but emily has been known in the past to release some great solo music under this sort of you know Emily Haines in the soft skeleton banner I've been impressed with her music under this name in the past and I'm very impressed with the song too she really seems to let her creative side go and lets go of any you know semblance of a straight pop formula when she's kind of in this sphere in this creative sphere and I like that I think her vocals come off really well and lyrically the song seems to be kind of a bit of a meditation or her waxing poetic on low wages on an economy that doesn't seem to work for the lower classes and only for the 1% and so on and so forth it's an interesting track and I like the way that she kind of laments these issues and you know puts them in a way that it seems like I guess a little bit more relatable kind of making the political personal in a way enjoying the track like what she's doing here liking the instrumental liking her vocal performance like in the production like in the lyrical themes here so I'm looking forward to what she's doing with this don't miss out on this track the very thoughtful song moving on from there young thug with what the you doin featuring quavo Duke and rich the kid banger alert banger alert it's one of those young sub tracks that's a fantastic banger I'm not really going to say too much more about it than that own that it's a great bang or a bang bang bang bang bang bang bang nu Zola Jesus song exhumed Zola Jesus previously have not been like head over heels for her music have not been a huge fan but have always kind of you know given her stuff shot here and there because I do like kind of that dark occult you know left-hand path kind of vibe that her music sort of brings you know it does make me curious I am intrigued by it and I'm really liking what she's doing on this new track over here like this is much more dramatic than a lot of what I've heard her release in the past and there's almost like kind of a an industrial tinged heaviness to the song to that I think is really great I don't know what else to say it's like one of the most powerful songs and singles that I've ever heard her drop and it has my mouth watering for this new album like it is so powerful it is so hard hitting on her voice which has always had a very kind of dramatic tone to it feels so much more enhanced by the instrumental backdrop that she's given herself here you know really hoping that she follows through with this sound whatever record she's about to drop because this is this is great some creative stuff this is some heavy powerful potent stuff that she's dropping here with it zoomed a few more tracks gorillas with sleeping powder apparently this is like a b-side from the humans album it's more of a 2d driven track and it's kind of a quirky fun left-field playful and very catchy a style of songwriting that I've enjoyed previously so much in gorillas music and I'm just kind of blown away as to why I got that in spades on the debut on demon days on Plastic Beach and why it almost completely evaporated on humans this track is better than more than half of the tracklist on humans and that's including the bonus tracks the deluxe tracks yeah I don't know what to say man this it's it's it's a great song you know I love this track it's a fantastic track but it's so disappointing to hear that this is like technically a b-side this is a leftover like this and potentially more material like this could have been on humans but instead we got Damon Albarn just kind of like playing producer for too many freaking vocal features too many artists that it just seems like he wanted to work with just to work with them work with them to get the name slapped onto the record and that it's like oh that person's featured oh that person's featured I got to check it out because in retrospect it seems like that drives the creative spirit of the album more than anything because it just kind of feels like and I'm going to rant again because you know I still am very disappointed by humans it feels like a compilation of just a bunch of random tracks that it's like hey I gotta work with this guy and this guy and this guy and this guy and this guy because you know even though he did a great job of sort of working in those names and working in those guests on Plastic Beach there was a lot of star power on Plastic Beach I feel like that the the other edge that star power played out very hard on humans in such a negative way but you know whatever going to move on got a shout out ghost mane and clams Casino on this new track kali-yuga Stanger alert another banger alert but this one's like really trap inspired and heavy and dark and really cool claims casino kills it on this track like I did not know his production could be this diverse this hard-hitting this crazy and to keep in mind here that this is a part of the new ongoing series of Adult Swim singles previously Adult Swim would just drop singles for the duration of the summer or a little bit longer than that now the Adult Swim single series for this year is 52 weeks long this is the third single out of all the singles are going to be dropping for the next 52 weeks so an entire year of Adult Swim singles which is actually pretty exciting there's actually usually some some pretty cool stuff that comes out of the single series you know the past couple of tracks have been ok but this one is fantastic this one's Bangor supreme so um I don't know man just looking forward to seeing what other tracks drop out of this series especially if they're going to be as wild and is interesting as this and want to shout out one more track this new song from Oasys formerly VOCs john dwyer and company have decided to change the band name from VOCs just overseas they have new projects on the way this new track over they over here that they have dropped with this new album announcement and this name change is kind of like a weird wild experimental extension off of what the band was doing on their last record a weird exits they're not going back in that kind of fuzzy weird noisy direction you know this is very much hi-fi this is very much like crazy vocal performances this is very much just like gee any tense you know insane lots of chemistry and kinetic energy coming into the performances with the band just sounds really great sounds really fantastic sounds like the OCS are kind of getting another breath like the second wind or the third wind or they're just kind of like turning another page in their career and you know hopefully hitting a new kind of creative streak you know at least at least that's what I'm hoping for you know I loved a lot of their early releases they kind of lost me for a little bit there personally when they kind of went into that brittle cyclo fire Oz era you know where I think a lot of their material ended up sounding very redundant but now between this last album what they're teasing toward with this new track with this new record it seems like they're going in a totally different direction it sounds really creative it sounds really off-the-wall and I'm just loving it and that is going to be it for this video I hope you guys got some good recommendations out of this video again all those tracks are linked down there in the description along with our Amazon Associates link along with our turntable lab link to hit those up especially the turntable a blank get yourself some vinyl beat yourself a turntable get yourself some speakers and that's going to be at guys I will see you guys in the next video bye-bye forever 
53Nve24_204,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd you know who it is doing a quick review off the iPhone of the new Omar Suleiman album to Syria with love Omar if you're not familiar with him is a Syrian songwriter is a Syrian singer he's been recording performing creating music for a long long time he's had quite a bit of positive press over here in the States but now with this latest record over here this is his Mad Decent Records debut previously if you've been familiar with Omar's music he creates this very electrified very amped very energetic brand of Iranian pop music of almost like electrified dabke which is actually like really fun to listen to especially on this album over here because with him bringing Mad Decent into the folder maybe sort of vice-versa his music has become even punchier and more amped than ever like it is so loud it's kind of like everything that has made his music fun and great before has now been infused with like this electro sort of quality to it that's really aggressive it's really punchy it's really kind of turned everything about his music again that is fun up to 11 um I will say kind of the downside of that though is that I think some of the subtlety of the songs is kind of dropped off a little bit as you know now everything is just so punchy it's so bright it's so loud it's so compressed so in-your-face but for me it just kind of makes the album you know even more fun it's a little bubble gum for me and I do think a lot of the tracks I mean they may be a little formulaic I mean you know you're talking about a lot of driving rhythms on these cuts Omar may throw a lyric or sort of a vocal melody out there and then that will be sort of book ended with some you know wild keyboard leads or Reed instruments or something like that just sort of add a little bit of melodic counterpoint to that then the vocals will pop back in and you kind of get that trade-off throughout almost the entire track that's kind of the structure again a lot of these songs with the exception of like one slow burn or cut toward the end of the record but aside from that this thing just wall-to-wall Arabian pop bangers like it Syrian pop bangers this is so fun it's so crazy it's so again it's so non-stop I don't really know what else to say about other than that other than you know if you're looking for electronic music that has a lot of energy to it something's really fun to listen to something's going to get a party going something that you know for most audiences probably gonna feel a little eclectic a little out of the ordinary but still delivers you know a clear groove a clear vibe you know really kind of sharp visceral feel to it then don't miss out on this thing don't skip out on this album because for me it was really fun again you know it's probably not something I would want to put back on unless I was back in sort of more of a party setting or if I was just looking for something kind of quick and fun to listen to um you know because it does tend to I think wear on you when you know you're not really doing anything other than just kind of listening to it on headphones you know this very much like a sound system kind of album not really that much of a headphone listen you know not really so much of a I'm by myself I'm just kind of chilling with nothing else better to do sort of listen you know this is something that even if you are listening to it alone you want to put it on a big stereo big listen big energy on this record lots of fun very strong foreign flavor on it and I'm definitely liking it and I think that you guys should again check it out if you're looking for something that is maybe a little bit more out of your comfort zone but it still going to be you know an uplifting sort of very um hey let's have a good time kind of listen and we're going to leave it at that cool give this thing a shot link to listen to a track down below and I will catch you guys in the next video 
SWPNCQYO4uw,hey guys wanted to do a quick mention a quick review of the new bleachers album gone now bleachers obviously is the musical project of multi-instrumentalist producer songwriter Jack Antonoff a fun Fame also he's he's like lena Dunham's significant other I'm pretty sure and this is his second album under this name it's been getting a lot of hype a lot of promotion even from yours truly because I think some of the singles leading up with this thing have been really good I miss those days and uh everybody not somebody uh just like with his last album you do get a lot of those uh very strong notes of 80s arena rock and pop music in there obviously a huge Springsteen fan jack is and then again those are still here on this record but I think the production on this record the way the songs sound it's a little less I guess contemporary commercial you know certainly the music here would be commercial by 80 standards um you know it's not exactly trendy by the standards of 2017 so you know Jack is definitely sort of outside of that or rather above that musical freya of the pop mainstream I guess you could say even though he's writing you know pop music that is just kind of just defined in another era though I will say that the production on this thing and this is maybe kind of the Achilles heel of the record it's very compressed it's a little overblown I think kind of smothers the dynamics of these songs which is kind of a shame because I do think some of them are really well written something that wasn't so apparent to me as I was listening to one track at a time of this record but as I listen to the entire thing there are a lot of moments were here where I think the production does kind of wear on me as I sort of listened through to the entire album it gets a little tiring just with everything being so fat and so loud and just so especially kind of like the with these some of the songs feeling as dynamic as they are um you know it definitely feels like Jack could have eased up on the compression a little bit on some of these tracks and I I guess while I'm complaining I'll say that some of his lyrics are maybe a little overly sentimental a little overly sweet especially kind of Let's Get Married track however again it has been nice on this record to kind of hear him write songs that are a little more mature sonically and musically straight off the beaten path a little bit and also in his music I'm catching like more influences from like you know some of the indie elite of the 2000s there are definitely moments where his vocals remind me of that of David long strength of Dirty Projectors Fame maybe not quite as eccentric or as nasally but I'm definitely catching an influence there and he is certainly um you know smoking whatever the hell Vampire Weekend is smoking on this record because you know there's certainly uh I think a strong note of like Ezra's songwriting influence on this record I'm pretty sure um but outside of that um you know just kind of feels like another standard record for Jack you know when comparing to his debut album you know if you like the debut you're probably going to like what's going on here you know it's far from a perfect record it's you know definitely a flawed album not only with the production not only with you know some of the lyrics being the way that they are you know also the track on here about not selling out I mean dude you write songs for like big pop stars like you're you're you're so well ingrained into the entertainment industry that I mean you know you don't need to worry about selling out or you're not in a position where you know you you probably even feel forced to sell out so it's kind of weird to hear him sort of doling out that message um but uh you know whatever I guess if you're going to you know put on a pop record that has a bit of a vintage vibe to a bit of an 80s vibe to it and you're not going to think too hard about sort of the particulars of the production you're not going to think too hard about what's being said in all of the lyrics you'll most likely enjoy what's going on here you know it's a solid pop record it's just not really I guess a thinking man's pop record I guess and I will leave it at that it's it's it's not a bad listen you know definitely some good tracks on here you know some good singles you know just there are some kind of shoddy deep cuts I guess I'll say and I'm going to leave it at that um definitely came away more impressed with this than I did the last album so I you know I guess that's something to hope for something to look forward to in the future and hope you guys enjoy this record a little bit more than me let me know what you thought down in the comments and I will catch you in the next video bleachers the forever 
vQAKOLE_JR4,hi everyone I know I haven't said this in a while but this is the best singing of games you know when interviewing a better case and it's time for a review of the new Beach fossils album summersaults Beach fossils are a Brooklyn band that debuted with a self-titled album back in 2010 that was at least partially responsible for the influx of jangly dreamy lo-fi indie rock that has been plaguing the music scene for the better part of a decade it honestly led to too many bland reverb so beachcombers to list out in a single video Beach fossils though kind of showed themselves to be above the fray with their follow-up record a few years later in 2013 clash the truth and I actually loved this record even though at this point in 2013 I had already decided that I didn't like most groups sort of chasing after this sound but be trials really came through with an album had a wider array of guitar tones than most of the band sort of approaching albums in this style I would also say some better production - definitely a wider array of influences as well as it seemed like Beach fossils were pulling post-punk into the fold on this album not only did I like the music but certainly I commended the band for building on the very simple and highly copied blueprint that they delivered on their debut album that they simply could have repeated on their next record and had pretty much gone away with it and of course since I enjoy the band's last LP I'm looking forward to the next LP even though it did take four years to arrive and on this one the band seems to be treating listeners to yet another change in sound indie rock and jangle pops still very much seem to be a cornerstone of the group sound that has not changed but the stark dark and kind of moody post-punk edge of the Bands last record has kind of evaporated it's been swapped out for something that feels to be more akin to the sunshine pop of the 60s a good chunk of the tracks on this album are delivered with this kind of very bright very blissful aesthetic occasionally some arranged instrumentation or keyboards pop into the track - just to add some extra texture and some depth there's some subtle nods to psych pop on the album as well I would say on tracks like closer everywhere and tangerine and saint ivy which also has like subtle touches of baroque pop as well and of course these tracks set shoulder-to-shoulder with songs that have a more pure jangle pop sound but the band still makes sure to work in more instrumental detailed and a lot of their contemporaries to keep things listenable and engaging it's not just simply a plain drum beat in a driving baseline and a 20 repetitive guitar lead that becomes mind-numbing before the song is even over Beach fossils are doing much more than that in fact I would say the closest they come to even phoning it in on this album is probably the track May first or the song down the line which is like borderline that as it is the most scant track on the entire record and with the inclusion of tracks like rise on this record which features these jazzy saxophones and this completely unexpected sensual and very romantic spoken word passage as well as the song be nothing which is this hard driving and very brittle and distorted at points tense piece of rock music that reminds me a lot of New Wave music krautrock music - beach fossils continue to prove that they're not just trendsetters and certainly not trend chasers either they're working in details that they're similarly dreamy contemporaries aren't like the song social jetlag which is mostly built off of like these easygoing very funky drum beats and grand slow piano chords you know there are a lot of things I could compliment this album on I can call it Beach fossils most instrumentally lavish album because it is I can call it Beach fossils most mature album because it is I could say that I really like the flow of the album because I do think there is a lot of sonic variety here some of the tracks segue into one another decently but very little of this album is actually exciting me lighting a fire for me really begging me to come back honestly because I don't really enjoy much of the 60s pastiche that the band sort of paints these songs in I think a lot of it feels really surface level just like window dressing and the rise interlude as out there and as bold as it is it's a really silly moment on the album that I can't take seriously I think really kind of derails the vibe of the record as it's just so alien to the rest of the album and I find so many of the vocal performances on this thing really drab too and I get it Beach fossils have never had the strongest vocal performances but I guess the vocals felt at least a little more direct on the band's last album I mean part of the appeal for that record for me was that sure it was trainee sure it was kind of easygoing but there was just enough bite to it to make it a little sticky a little catchy kind of addictive the tension in the performances also gave the the tracks here a bit of momentum a bit of energy summersault is so much breezier by comparison which is not necessarily a bad thing especially if the bliss the record is delivering is intoxicating but not necessarily the case a lot of the time in my opinion there are a few moments where the bullets of a track really hits me and sort of seems to make the song worthwhile like tangerine and sugar but a lot of the songs here for me they just kind of feel like a cold fish even though I do enjoy a lot of the instrumental and musical extras throughout this album which again they're good but uh they're really kind of just a distraction at the end of the day from the fact that the very core of these songs the lyrics they're writing it's it's just okay it's a little bland it's kind of just standard jangle pop shtick you know I get that the band is trying to do something a little bit different they are experimenting they are adventuring they are taking some risks but not all of them pan out into truly compelling songs especially in the second half which i think is noticeably weaker than much of the material the band delivers in the first as far as records in this style go you could do way worse but personally I'm just kind of indifferent toward it I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this speech fossils album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best which should I review next if it likes you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry videos next to my Heather you should check out subscribe to the channel official website too and I will catch you guys in the next video stay hydrated and get a good night's sleep and you're free vegetables forever 
hCy3_Fosq2g,ah hi everyone does the baby she can't hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Roger Waters album business life we really want progressive in art rock legend Roger Waters he is back with his fourth full-length album solo album he was once the frontman hand bassist primarily of one of rock's greatest groups of all time Pink Floyd he kind of has a reputation that precedes him I'm not going to bog this review down by trying to recontextualize Pink Floyd's greatest hits I will say though after Floyd was pretty much kaput after the final cut came out it didn't take waters too long to start dropping solo records and prior to the release of this album I hadn't really given any of it any airtime although once I dived into it I came away pretty impressed with just how passionately waters had stuck to the vision that he was chasing after during some of Floyd's golden years in the late 70s especially on the pros and cons of hitch hiking and amused to death which if you're going to listen to any past water solo effort to kind of prepare for this new album I would definitely recommend that that will most likely give you the most insight to what he's trying to do here although even if you miss out on that it's not necessarily a bad thing because if you are just a hardcore floyd fan and you know those big records you know those classic records what waters is doing on this new LP over here is not at all going to feel really alien to you because in fact I think one of my favorite Pink Floyd's albums animals is a very much kind of a kindred spirit to what waters is doing on this new LP over here down to the core progressions some of the lyrical topics and even some of the sound collages that turn up on this thing to the animals the bombs blowing up the radio broadcasters talking which for me is not necessarily a bad thing the material left floyd put out during this air in their career the wall animals on and so forth still feels to me to be some of their best and given the political climate that we found ourselves in between Donald Trump and the migrant crisis and the perpetual war on terror that were in the middle of and so many more things beyond that I personally am curious to kind of hear waters frame much of it in socially charged songs that he writes and records today not that I expected him with this record to come through with a perfect album or to approach these topics with the same sharpness that he had back in the 70s after a very short and abstract introduction the album kicks off with the song deja vu because when I first heard that song it really cut me especially with how waters voice cracks as he's kind of reaching up vocally along with the instrumentation and that's the thing a lot of the singing he does on this album it is passionate it does have a lot of character but his age is certainly showing but not necessarily in a bad way you know it's very worn it's very weary and at this point the fact that he is still singing about a lot of these topics he's still on the war he saw on the violence he's still on the greed that's poisoning our societies or politics that to me feels like at least part of the reason that you could title a track like this DejaVu lyrically the song is pretty interesting as well with waters singing about how he could have done a better job had he been in the position of God a pretty bold claim that some people might disagree with but it's really his wholehearted belief in what he's saying and the passion he's delivering on this track that really sells the track then shortly after this he starts singing from the standpoint of a drone making mention of his electronic eyes later in the the same verse I believe he bombs a woman at a stove which if you don't remember over the course of the Obama administration we had learned that a vast majority of the people who are struck by drones are just innocent bystanders they're the wrong target knowing that it's not hard to understand why drones and drone strikes are actually referenced multiple times throughout the runtime of the album I also enjoy the Panos on this track the arranged instrumentation here not only here but other tracks too not only is it lavish it's tasteful it's beautiful but it's not unmanageable it's not too huge it's not overblown it doesn't take away from some of a raw and worn and tattered kind of feel that I did off of some of these songs and especially water singing another thing is that the more I listen to this record the more I came away with just being enamored with the flow of this album I mean after all these years Waters has still kind of retained this knack for writing a very holistic and a very cinematic album with a laser-like focus on production aesthetic on instrumental palette on lyrical topics each track on the album just complements the other before and after so well whether it be the throttling picture this square Waters is delivering all these very direct and very bold images in the lyrics mostly reflecting on the horrors of violence and politics that we find ourselves dealing with right now and I love the way that this transitions into the very epic and dreary ballad broken bones which is a really well crafted and memorable despite just how much of a slow burner this song is tune that lyrically laments heavily mankind's inability or I guess refusal to learn from the mistakes from the horrors of the past making direct reference to world war two at one point which you know if you're a Pink Floyd fan you know that the band has pulled a lot of inspiration from that in their music things take an even dreary er turn on the title track here we have a very eerie eerie guitar line and some hard and heavy string licks and over this waters delivers this totally fluff --less diatribe making reference to our rigged economy to the way our fear dictates our politics our warming climate as well and with the track bird in a gale which is like a bit of a kind of a centerpiece or introduced on the record with some sound collage passages toward the beginning and toward the end maybe not nearly as gratifying is like an instrumental jam that you would have caught on a classic floyd record which my mouth is kind of watering for it points because this album really is jam-packed with floyd isms but still these moments do add quite a bit of texture and grit to the album and to what our waters is singing about I also enjoy hearing him try to take the political Internet so on the song the most beautiful girl in the world which you know from the title you think is a love song or something but and in a way it is you know waters is kind of forcing the audience to entwine themselves emotionally with this woman who we learned toward the end of the track is the victim of a bomb attack it is a little overly manipulative it is a little ham-fisted it is a little long-winded a lot like track the last refugee which I wish had a stronger course to it some kind of stickier refrain or something I do like the melodies of the track I do like Rodgers passion on the song I do like the dystopian and post-apocalyptic vibe of the lyrics but again it does feel like one of those moments in the record that could have been written to be a bit more direct and as long as I'm complaining the track smell the roses from the bass line to the keyboard embellishments is like pure classic Floyd all the way to the point where it is so deja vu it is so distracting I do like the grim groove I do like the grim lyrics though I do think what Watters is singing about here does feel super general this song almost feels like it could have been a classic Floyd song and yet lo and behold it just kind of still applies today I don't know it's more messed up that he's kind of just copying himself or that we're just kind of copying ourselves the song wait for her is a very pretty and gentle ballad where we have a lot of instrumental bits that are lifted and repeated again from the song DejaVu obviously and intentionally it's a bit of an instrumental reprieve and we have some of these same musical themes running throughout the interlude track right after and the closing track part of me died although lyrically here we don't have waters lyrics this is in fact a poem of the same title pulled from a Palestinian poet mama Darwish and it is a lovely poem it is a lovely moment on the album although I'm not entirely sure as to whether or not the her that is being talked about in the poem is being used with the same symbolism and the same context in waters case especially as he brings us into the interlude track and into the final track we're still making reference to that same her to very directly at the end of the album saying that it would be better to die in her arms than continue to linger with regret and that's another thing you know in waters lyrics and in his voice there is quite a bit of regret I would say bitterness and resentment too it's almost as if he's kind of put the responsibility at least a little bit for just kind of all the bullshit that he's singing about on to himself and another thing that I like about this album is you know really just the age factor the worn sort of very weary quality of this album I think adds to again that bitterness factor that I think lends a lot to the emotional dynamics of this record I can understand some people coming away from this album underwhelmed because you know it's not really anything new it's not really anything all that surprising if you're looking for a surprise going into this album you you will be sorely disappointed but if you're in the market for a very finely crafted art rock and progressive rock album with a very strong vintage feel but you know the production the sound quality the aesthetic of the album is very dusty old you know does feel kind of like it has this modern contemporary grittiness and gnarliness to it not to mention the fact lyrics kind of are delivered with a level of perspective and experience that only someone of water's age could deliver feeling a decent too strong seven on this album I'm going to leave it at that definitely think you guys should check this one out I liked it a lot again and we are going to transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments

ka1Ko6n9FW0,hi everyone Shana is here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new alt-j album relaxor UK progressive and art pop outfit all today this is their third full-length album which I was really excited to hear due to my enjoyment of their past two albums and I thought the teaser tracks from this record leading up to the release we're pretty decent and if you would ask me about alt-j back in 2012 when they released their first album and awesome wave I most likely would have told you that they were one of the more unique groups to debut an album that year with their kind of seamless and very inventive blend of hip-hop and pop music electronic music as well with a touch of bulk their sound was really idiosyncratic not only with the blend of styles but the band's approach to groove also the very yel P nasal lead vocals from the band's frontman Joe Newman and yet the band's music was so freakin catchy not an easy balance to strike now the band's follow-up record this is all yours took a much more obtuse and subtle approach this album was the definition of a slow burner a lot of tracks on this thing were not consistent sonically with a lot of what was on the band's debut which in my opinion was okay because the band had proven on their first record that they were so above the fray that what was their sound really I mean alt-j conceivably could go in a million different directions with their sound based on what they had given us on their debut surely I couldn't expect the band to give us one more in awesome wave after another for the next decade so going into this new LP I wasn't entirely sure what to expect maybe just another direction entirely something completely refreshing I do know that going into this album I did enjoy for the most part 3ww in cold blood Adaline but now that I have the entire album in front of me I'm kind of surprised to find that it's just eight tracks in 39 minutes and as I moved along the tracklist I kind of felt that this was easily all Jays most inconsistent album to date not just in terms of sound from track to track but that also holds true for the songwriting too you know even though this is all yours was a bit of a challenging listen at least that album felt like it had a focused sonic calm except from beginning to end by contrast there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to what's happening on relaxer whether it be why on the third track were suddenly treated to a really blobby and kind of tensionless cover of House of the Rising Sun yes that House of the Rising Sun all Jays version here really leaves a lot to be desired and then suddenly we are transitioned into one of the kookiest and more hard-hitting songs on the entire record hit me like that snare where I think the band mistakes effortless awkwardness for swagger so not only do we make some weird surprise transitions between tracks and songs but occasionally some of the tracks themselves within the song are kind of difficult to follow or sort of tedious like the finishing Pleader on the album while the end of this track may have some really grand choral vocals and a really beautiful instrumental presentation the very sleepy lead up to this moment makes the end feel almost inconsequential trying to get the band to deliver one of these more instrumentally lavish songs in a direct fashion is kind of like getting someone shy to start a conversation occasionally I think the band's roundabout approach to songwriting on this record does kind of work out I mean I do still like 3ww especially as an opener I do think it kind of sets the tone for the record as on pleasing as that tone maybe as I listen to the entire album the folky acoustic guitars and very serene sound palette at the start of the album reminds me a lot of yellow house era grizzly bear while these subtle touches of piano and vocal harmonies kind of transition me into a beautiful lullaby the song takes a pretty intriguing instrumental turn after this and the inclusion of vocals from Ellie Roswell sort of turns the track really sensual but the song trails off and fizzles out not too long after this and looking at the runtime it's kind of hard to believe that the track is five minutes long because I feel like there are just so many different parts of the of the song that hit you so quickly you know developed for all that long you know there are a lot of parts on this song and I feel like there's a lot to these parts on the song but when they're added up I something I feel like is missing I could say that the band is maybe just being intentionally esoteric here but even the moments on this record where I feel like they're being really straightforward don't pack that much punch like on the song in cold blood while it's still one of the better tracks on the track listing here I will take many songs off of an awesome wave over this any day though again the boomy percussion and the epic horn sections on this track the groove the kind of tinny very bright synthesizer arpeggios that they're definitely a saving grace among some of the paler songs in the tracklist dead crush is easily another pick for me as a favorite on the album while I do think that the synth bassline is a little lazy and that the guitars that are driving or a bit plain you know the atmosphere isn't the most colorful or eccentric as far as instrumentation when it comes to alt-j but the lead vocals I'm especially the falsettos are very kooky very fun and incredibly catchy Adaline still stands out as one of my favorites on the album easily the best slow burner here it feels like a really gradual cinematic ascent into the night sky with all these hypnotic percussive taps and swelling orchestral instrumentation that's really cloudy and pillowy and beautiful some of the wild background vocals and the last half of the track I feel like is is one of those moments where all Jays sort of weird strange very cartoonish musical ideas are at their best is it too much to ask for a strong ending though the song last year is really Pleasant but it's easily one of the most half-baked ideas in the entire track listing the lyrics are very poetic at times incredibly moving sort of detail what seems like month to month month of the last year in Joe Newman's life a lot of very personal moments sung about in this song I like the closing duet in the second half of the song as well but again it just feels like a linear moment where the band doesn't really stick to or develop any one idea long enough for anything to stick or have a significant amount of consequence to it I'm not really sure what happened with this album I can't help but feel like the band put some kind of strange and very unorthodox limitations on the writing and maybe the recording of this record in order for it to have turned out the way that it did because it feels like a lot of the ideas a lot of the writing feels really fly-by-night lightning in a bottle again the band doesn't stick to any one idea long enough everything is sort of progressing in a linear fashion not too much in the way of repeating choruses refrains which I don't necessarily think are bad limitations to put on an album that is if the progressions and the direction that you're going in is a purposeful one is an urgent one is an engaging one unfortunately without a modus operandi to a lot of these tracks it seems like alt J's writing and performances have turned really flaccid standoffish kind of disengaged very forgettable and in contrast with their past work especially their debut somewhat unsure itself at points yeah this this was a really strange listen I mean I might you know be interested in listening to it again if I understood more maybe about the process of what the band was trying to achieve going into this record just to kind of maybe hear what I think they were trying to do but honestly just as a raw kind of listening experience from someone who's enjoyed their past two albums this was a really lackluster and underwhelming experience for me I'm feeling a like five on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love did you hate it what would your a to hear the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry hit up some of the videos next to my head that I think you should check out subscribe to the channel to official website as well link in on the screen and alt-j relaxer

IWDe_s6cpsM,hi everyone its Anthony Fantan oh here and welcome to another installment of stink peace where I reacted bad music writing on the Internet today's publication is salon.com who posted a lovely piece coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the Beatles seminal sergeant pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band which recently received a new deluxe edition treatment with all sorts of remixes and extras really an essential listen for any hardcore Beatles fan but of course we couldn't just sit back and enjoy this moment in pop music history had to be sullied with amanda marcotte reminding us the Beatles classic made Pop's email nerdy and important and that wasn't a good thing what are you doing it's headlines like this that get me kind of depressed thinking about just how much disingenuous clickbait has grown like a cancer on the face of mainstream journalism but when I actually read this article I think Amanda might just be crazy enough to think what she's what she's writing here this article starts how you would kind of expect with Amanda cynically citing a bunch of male music writers who are really serious and penning these celebratory pieces about sergeant Pepper's Oh sound the alarm men like something stop it now then Amanda right away gets into making stupid assertions about the cultural shift that the album represented as well as rock music in general like this quote over here I I just do not even know where to start with this amanda talks about sergeant pepper's like it's super deep and how it's pop music's answered a high-art not only do legitimately pretentious music critics and listeners disagree please cue that pretentious scruffy quote that that everybody posts everywhere god damn but the cultural and historical ignorant of this paragraph is actually astounding I'm pretty impressed by it as if the Beatles weren't still a youth-oriented group when they released sergeant pepper's you're telling me as soon as they released this album it was just old white men who were super into the Beatles all the hippies and all the teenage music listeners at the time they just they're Beatles records out the window thinking yeah man the Beatles that they're just dad rockers now and as if young women didn't still continue to listen to the Beatles music at the time and as if there were no male Beatles fans like pre Rubber Soul and then there's this delicious quote sergeant pepper's was the point when rock stop being the music of girls and started being the music of men uh yeah if you think rock music started in 1960 and you completely erased the very male and very black history of the rock and roll and rhythm and blues music that directly inspired the Beatles the stones and pretty much every fucking British Invasion band Amanda then goes on to lament what she sees as an all-too-common progression of teenybopper oriented groups going from making very light-hearted very youthful music to something for old serious men who are stuffy and nerdy and don't care if a song as a beat you can dance to but in the process of supposedly defending young female music listeners amanda continues to stereotype them again and again and again even admitting that the hysterical and lustful obsession that young girls had over the Fab Four back in the day was embarrassing and then acts like young women would be almost completely incapable of looking at John George Paul and Ringo in their multicolored regalia on the front cover of sergeant Pepper's itself are you a woman can you look at this cover it like does the their outfits on this cover make you turn away like no I can't I can I'm just a woman I can't look at these clothes like these outfits are some kind of female kryptonite I even questioned Amanda's ability to even listen to music when she says that there's little on this album that would get a lady on the dance floor aside from Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds yeah you know the weird slow LSD trip of a pop song that's like really warped and strange with all those lyrics about cellophane flowers and marmalade skies real dancefloor banger you're trying to defend bubblegum pop music for young women and you pick one of the least bubblegum tracks on the entire record when lovely Rita and getting better are objectively groovy the preposterous paragraphs in this piece continue with the assertion that there's music for young girls and there's music for men and society takes one seriously and thinks the other is silly now what exactly makes a piece of music for men and a piece of music for women Amanda doesn't really define all she can really tell you is whether or not a particular genre had a predominantly male or female audience in retrospect but of course she doesn't provide anything in the way of statistics in this piece to back up any of that but even if she did I don't think that's really the standard that she's working with because at one point in the piece she complements the Ramones for obviously taking influence from the girl groups of the 60s who were produced by the likes of Phil Spector despite the fact that the Ramones and many of the early punk groups had predominantly male audiences the closest she comes to defining this bullshit is when she basically implies that music that has kind of a bubblegum quality to it is inherently female meanwhile I could list dozens of females who make abstract aggressive or very experimental music who might disagree and so might they're leagues of female fans I mean the sheer existence of Riot girl bands d legitimizes like most of what you're saying here never mind the fact that she never acknowledges the irony that a lot of the female friendly music she lists throughout this piece is predominantly written performed and produced by men some of which has some kind of sexist undertones to in the middle of the piece Amanda tries to use disco as the shining example of a moment in music history where you had this musical movement that was predominantly loved by women men came along ruined it they hated it and they made liking it seem really lame but then later men kind of embraced it as disco went on to inspire so much that came after it when in reality land Amandla people got sick of disco because it reached the same peak of cultural saturation that a lot of musical movements did before and after disco and it wasn't just the music it was the radio play it was the way that disco was everywhere in the media it was the culture it was the clothing you couldn't escape it much in the same way that you couldn't escape new wave or grunge and angsty rock guys in the 90s or um you know fucking euro pop it wasn't a bunch of long-haired Led Zeppelin bros blowing up records in the middle of a baseball field that made disco die it was the fact that the genre had its 15 minutes of fame and then lo and behold something else came along synth pop new wave record labels started marketing other things did in sync in the Backstreet Boys call it quits because all the record execs and the labels and everyone in the boy bands and all the teenage girls had finally said you know what guys the teenage boys the men they don't like us you know we just have to call it quits if we can't get the men on our side what are we doing Amanda also fails to acknowledge that there is tons of music out there that is marketed toward or sells really well with men young men even teenage boys that is just as much a product of the same kind of commercialism the same kind of marketing that a lot of these female oriented groups are you could talk about fuckin all those new metal bands all those hair metal bands Jesus Christ kiss also to act like disco was the inception of something or the teenyboppers or just somehow like the early adopters they're ahead of the curve disco was very much inspired by the funk and soul that preceded it which I mean the audiences of those genres very male very female too but very male I mean a huge influence for Michael Jackson was James it's a man's man's man's world Browne I'm pretty much done with this dumpster fire of a piece but Amanda does save some of the juiciest quotes for last so now 50 years on it's easier to evaluate sergeant Pepper's on its own free of decades of weight assigned to it for supposedly saving rock music from its female fanbase except you just assigned a bunch of weight to the album by putting it as the centerpiece in the midst of this cultural battle that only exists in your head Amanda goes on to break the record as a b-plus for some reason which I mean that's fine that's her opinion I don't think it's the Beatles best album either but then she kind of undermines her own opinion by admitting that because of the way she perceives the album culturally she's always going to have some kind of gripe or bias against it and finally she decries Oh world where certain kinds of pop music were treated as inferior for decades just because its fanbase was mostly people who looked like me but you spent almost this entire piece trying to tear down music listeners and musicians who look like me so are you really coming out ahead here in the end I mean I feel really bad for Amanda whether it be because maybe she's just kind of disingenuously writing and posting this piece and she finds herself in a position where she has no other choice than to write a piece like this just to make ends meet I don't know or I feel bad that she legitimately feels this way and can't listen to a pop record without like assigning a gender to it kind of depressing just not to be able to enjoy music for music sake but that's my take on this horrible boring aggravating and very draining think piece which required very little in the way of thinking but that's that's it that's it for this installment of stink peace thank you for watching let's just transition what do you think this thick piece did you write it and what do you think this video does this video make youtube seem smart and nerdy and male if it does let me know down in the comments with an angry comment that would be that would be wonderful and I will catch you

you know categorizing the best mare worst or anything I want you guys to check out this new denzel curie ultimate BB ng sessions video slash track denzel curie performing the track ultimate with bad bad not good sounds really fantastic really good performance good recording the video is sort of fun as well everybody seems like a little bit out of their element but again the sound is great the performance is good i'm pretty happy with how it came out so much so that i hope that there is more coming down the pipe with this whole be BMG sessions thing and next Radiohead I promise Radiohead are coming out soon with a 20 year anniversary edition of their fantastic seminal album Ok Computer this song I promise is being released alongside that this is like a new sort of unreleased track the Ben's been playing live for a long time and it is a grand antenna k-- marching beautiful anthem toms vocals on this track are incredible powerful and heart-wrenching do not miss this song if you are a Radiohead fan but most likely a you're not going to and again keep a lookout for this for this new deluxe edition of the album that's going to be dropping alright let's get into what I felt were the worst tracks of the week some interesting tracks here some disappointments as well unfortunately I'm not really all that enthused by the new Arcade Fire song everything now Arcade Fire essentially doubling down on this track and saying it's not a phase mom we really are dance music band they go full disco on this track without any of the interesting production or grit that the band sort of had on the album reflector with some of those singles the James Murphy sort of on production I don't know if he's on production again here most likely not given the sound of the song and it's kind of this really glitzy glamorous dance beat that reminds me a little bit of ABBA and I do like ABBA but I can't be the only person coming away from this track thinking that I feel like wind Butler's vocals and lyrics especially at the very intro of the song leave a lot to be desired like aside from the dance groove which eventually as the song progresses along gets really bland the dance group is okay you know it's decent but there's really nothing all that special about the lyrics in my opinion you know and typically the lyrics are something I can really hone into and enjoy on an arc a fire song but the the lyrics the melodies come and lead vocals to again just really underwhelming the only thing I could really say is salvageable about the song is the groove but I'm really not into what the band is doing on this one and from the sound of it it seems like they're just going to drop a weaker repeat of what they did with their last album and I'm not even really that into reflector honestly I know a lot of people enjoyed it more than me but not really a reflector fan finally no not finally one more thing I have to mention although I'm not going to call this up by name or anything there is a horrible alt metal slash screamo cover of like a little Aussie vert song that I've been seeing floating around the internet I've even listened to the whole thing it's it's so terrible I could barely even sit through it I'll just kind of leave it down there in the description box for anybody who's morbidly curious and finally I have to give a shout out to this song it's everyday bro featuring team ten by a Jake Paul who refers to his fans as Jake callers and this new single he has out again featuring team 10 is really a peak trap I would like to say this is point where trap has permeated the mainstream and popular culture so much that someone could come along make a track that is this garbage and it still Garner's like millions and millions and millions of views now listen it's not like this was destined to happen I mean the the talent level required to like make a really hard-hitting trap song is like super low so of course you're going to have like some kind of mediocre child actor slash YouTube prankster eventually make a really crappy trap song and it makes it pretty high on the music charts like the iTunes charts and God the verses on this thing or cringy and the music video is mega cringe as well like just every time I watch this I kind of want to die so I'm going to stop talking about it a really terrible song again the listener beware I wouldn't spend too much time listening to this or really too much time like focusing on or anything like that maybe just like kind of a quick in-and-out you know just like just give it a taste and then spit it out right away and move on with the rest of your day and those are the worst tracks of the week in my opinion let's move on to the tracks that you know aren't my favorites of the week but I still want to mention RL grime has a new one out featuring Miguel love the glamorous sort of bright very hard-hitting and epic instrumental and in my opinion on this track Miguel gives one of them one of his most fiery vocal performances that I've ever heard that dude give period even on his own records so I'm actually liking this track quite a bit there's not really much about it that makes me think I'm going to care about it like next year or come here to some now but you know still a decent track and I think you know definitely gonna be a high point in 2017 for both of these artists Liam Gallagher surprisingly has a pretty decent new single out titled wall of glass don't pay attention to the music video too much because it is kind of corny but actually didn't I actually think the tune here is like a really solid piece of pop rock that isn't loaded down with the kind of nostalgia that you would probably expect somebody who was connected to oh it feels a good modern punchy very colourful and catchy a piece of rock music that's really enjoyable and doesn't feel you know stale or old or anything like that you know just feels like a very contemporary smart and fun piece of rock music of the solid hook on it too I want to give a shout out to the new Foo Fighters track run has some ultra aggressive moments here you know with some very slow and sort of melodic endemic chorus but we've done really effectively like it doesn't really take away from the intensity and momentum of the song too much not as exciting quite as exciting as like white limo a track like that but is definitely one of their most biting and aggressive songs I've heard them ever release Dave Grohl's vocals on the track or how he's just a monster on this track the music video is really fun though I will say I feel like they did kind of ripoff revocation with this music video concept like they already did that concept like a while ago but on a much lower budget Foo Fighters definitely take it to new heights on this one the concept of the music video being like hey we're a rock band but we're like geriatric and we're inside of an old folks home and old people are going to go crazy once they hear our you know really heavy hard-hitting metal rock music so you know it's okay it's it's a pretty decent track but again you know check out that revocation song and music video if you've never seen it because it definitely seemed it seems to be a point of inspiration I think want to shout out the new Lord single perfect places which I thought was ok not my favorite single of all the tracks that I've heard so far from her forthcoming album but you know it's alright 21 savage with all the smoke definitely better than a lot of songs I've heard off of his sort of mixtape EP thing that he had out with Metro boomin not too long ago you know it is cold it is a very dark 'it is very gritty it is very murderous I wouldn't say he's doing anything all too different you know than he usually does but sort of as a standalone single I think it's a good track and want to shout out the new Beth Ditto song we could run which is a sort of really epic and passionate and piece of a rock music from Beth a lot of conviction to this track I'll say and I'll leave it at that make sure to give those tracks a shout out not shut up if any of those artists sort of have slipped by you this past week because of their you know a lot of shit coming out recently all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best tracks the week a 2 Chainz featuring Travis Scott the song 4 a.m. I don't know man 2 Chainz Travis Scott there's a lot of chemistry between both of them on this track you know the way that they trade off on this song and what each of them provides on the track I think is really good two chains I think his lyrics are a bit funnier than I've heard him as of late and I love kind of kind of hearing that element of comedy come back in his music I love how melodic the instrumental is and you know like a lot of good trap songs it's part pretty with its melodies it's part gritty with its lyrics and with its kind of a you know vocal tone and it's part hypnotic as well and I think Travis Scott kind of has the tendency to sort of bring that oh and he happens you know upon a track so I'm kind of happy to hear all those elements coming together really effectively on this new track over here really enjoying it one shot up a new war on drugs song holding on of course those crack rock influences those psychedelic rock influences those Bruce Springsteen influences are coming together once again on a new war on drugs track but in a good way you know I'm enjoying this track just as much as I as I enjoyed a lot of songs off of war on drugs last album all of what I will say about this song is over here that I thought the vocals stood out a bit more you know weren't exactly as obscured or as cloudy in the mix and I don't know definitely a little bit more visceral than I've heard a lot of war on drugs songs be from the past couple of records so I don't know you know I feel like a lot of those original sort of characteristics about the band's music are still maintained here but now they're just a little bit more biting they're a little bit more exciting a little bit more punchy I like that so I'm looking forward to this new album I've got to give a shout out to this new single from todd worrell excuse me it's a cover of a song called mash mash mash condense which is this little Norwegian sort of new wave since pop sort of post-punk gem from this group that I'm not even going triangle which apparently a vocalist of that group who when I lifted them up I could only find the single for this track like so their past seemed to be very sort of small and obscure so we're you know Todd even found this song to even cover I have no idea but the song is actually really cool and has kind of a milky old-school post-punk you know a very disco inspired bassline as well I would say and I don't know man just kind of reminds me of some old-school factory records stuff to a degree I like the song a lot I like what Todd has done with it again sort of those post-punk influences the punchy beats the really cool groovy drum sequences a lot of cool things about the production on this track I like how sort of rigid and you know hard as nails it feels but you know it has a nice smooth kind of groove to it kind of takes me back to the old school of electronic music and post-punk but without just kind of seemed like seeming like a simple exercise in nostalgia you know there are a lot of cool clean modern punchy characteristics about this track too that I think are really great moving on from there King gizzard and a lizard wizard don't want to talk too much about this because it's yet another 13 minutes from their forthcoming album of course it's really good again I don't want to spoil too much about it I want to say too much about it because the review for this album is going to be happening very soon and I'm really excited to reviewed it review this record sounds like is going to be a really good album and you know I'll just leave it at that Benjamin Clementine has a new song out titled phantom of Aleppo Ville which is one of his weirdest songs in a while I mean I like the track the really hard-hitting beat in piano sequences or piano phrases at the start the weird manic vocal passages with like all the shouting Benjamin's vocal performance at this point is awesome as well and then the weird second half where he kind of trails off into these really strange diatribes over you know this really kind of um I guess I want to say refined you know passages of piano it's a really linear very oddly structured track and I'm still kind of confused by it in a way you know there are moments of it that I really love there are moments of them still kind of perplexed by I'm not 100% sure if I love 100% of the track yet but I am really intrigued and I am dying to hear what Benjamin is going to do next in terms of a new album and finally I want to give a shout out to Brock Hampton who came out with yet another goddamn banger with the song star like so much hilarious creative fun and interesting lyrical chemistry between these guys and every fucking instrumental they hop on with these new tracks is great like in the music videos or fun as hell too and they will take their shot on a super low budget and it's just them being absolutely insane and off-the-wall like Brock Hampton is killing it right now and they're in their project their mixtape their album it's not even out yet you know they've dropped the tape in the past which was a little hit or miss but I mean man with every single song here they are fucking on and they just keep dropping some of the best singles of the year and I'm just not sure what else to say I don't want to spoil too much of it because I don't want to you know have said everything that I wanted to say once this album actually drops so there you go those are the best tracks of the week the worst tracks of the week the songs that I thought were okay make sure to check

SCLwyNT25bU,Oh hi everyone 130 million oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of Anthony Fantana Anthony Fantana is a human being from the United States of America born to two parents who for over 30 years now has made it a habit to regularly breathe drink water and consume a variety of nutritious foods these three things have been key to the baseline of survival that is a lot of Anthony to achieve the prestigious title of the Internet's busiest music nerd is known as that and more on his regularly updated youtube channel youtube.com slash the needle drop where he recently reached the 1 million subscriber milestone a slow and arduous process that required him to write and edit and record and upload thousands of music reviews think pieces and interviews onto said YouTube channel for an audience of unrepentant meemers who make fun of his hair line and column a melon it's this constant barrage of harassment from music elitists and Kanye stands and mutants from 4chan and tumblr addicts that have made Anthony's online existence a living hell but it is his deep and throbbing passion for music that has kept this reviewer reviewing and his viewers viewing Anthony's opinions on music may be influential polarizing and dominant over the entirety of his professional career but his interests do extend beyond that of the musical sphere Anthony Fantana was also a man who loves his family he likes hitting the weights at the gym every once in a while so he looks like thick as a brick he enjoys playing super smash brothers for Wii U every once in a while and he's been a devoted vegan for almost 10 years spreading the message for his love of fruits and vegetables whenever he can through these thick vegan smoothies if you throw together some banana some strawberries some blueberries a little bit of red cabbage in there too for your vitamins and minerals with a couple of almond milk a little bit of water that shit is bangin Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Monty Python's Flying Circus ranked among Anthony's favorite television shows but of both of his viewing pleasure is spent consuming the content of his fellow YouTube content creator from gaming to comedy to YouTube politics to movie reviews Anthony was an avid YouTube viewer years before he started regularly uploading content to the platform and his passion for YouTube continues despite a few hiccups recently mostly due to his unwavering faith in the future of new media speaking of which I'm pretty sure Anthony is currently on a mission to destroy his reviewing career and Sully is already mediocre reputation through a series of unbearable attempts at being funny on a second youtube channel that shall remain nameless I'm predicting a YouTube enforced full channel deletion within a year though but beyond fantana's very public addiction to memes not much more can be said about the man as he has learned to keep his personal life mostly personal as YouTube has become his full-time job there's only so many times you can be solicited for nudes before you learn that some things should just be private and that's fine because it's not the intimate and mostly boring details of fantana's personal life that keeps his YouTube channel growing it's his relative attention to detail brutal honesty and prolific output that continues to fan the flames of love but also hatred Fantana isn't entirely sure of his five-year plan right now we'll continuing as the world's most relevant music critic a music critic or a YouTube music critic even be viable or healthy in the next decade I'm not entirely sure regardless Anthony does look forward to growing his brand reaching more people seeing more dank memes on the internet finding more personal time playing more bass keeping up with new music giving more money to charity and trying to be a more functional human being it is with all of that that I feel personally like I can give Anthony Fantana somewhat subjective and very level-headed light 3 a straight light 3 I think that's kind of harsh a little underrated well you know you're not in the best shape right now your your head is kind of messed up with the hair your reviewers they're not that good not as good as they used to be and you you're a little ugly well you're kind of ugly too and you're so boring to watch why do you want you need to see you when they can see big Quinn he dancing he's a funny guy kids like our energy you're just like blablabla blablabla whatever Blanca was whatever but tell me can you see a difference between me and him we're exactly the same right now bleh bleh-bleh went way way Hey don't be sad now you know maybe you're just like you know you're maybe you're you're yet to hit your peak you know you're still growing you're still going maybe from here you get ten million subscribers yeah you host a tech show you you're on SNL think so no it's still probably downhill from here physician thank you for watching everybody for all these years you guys have been just passionately following everything I do and it continues to blow me away just how many messages I've been getting over the past week or so people family hey man I did Washington 2009 but why was in 2010 and not to say that the older viewers are better than the newer viewers I greatly appreciate everybody who's recently stumbled across the channel and are passionately following most of what I'm reviewing too you know it's really hard sort of not only kind of pushing forward into a genre of YouTube video that there really wasn't that much of a precedent for before I started and I'm really happy and proud and you know really excited to kind of see a community growing around that too you know it's awesome every year to see new faces and the music reviewing community and sort of seeing you know people developing different styles and different approaches to talking about music on YouTube whether it be you know the reaction style or sort of more long and in-depth formats where people are you know sort of almost doing a like documentary style stuff in the wake of some of what I've been doing you know it's really again it's really exciting it's really awesome it's real cool kind of see you know this community blossoming you know even even if it is kind of a very loose you know loosely connected one but that's totally fine because you know everybody has their own tastes and their own perspective and everybody brings something different to the table and that's what makes you know the music world so unique and so interesting and so fun so I'm happy to sort of see that you know consistently reflecting in the reviewer community - it's really weird to think that my youtube channel much less any YouTube channel has made it this far just by simply kind of giving you know as best I can my opinion on everything that you know comes down the pipe as far as new music I put a lot of effort into what I do and I'm really happy and I'm really glad that both you and I are able to get something that we feel is both great out of it to the haters to the industry cogs to the jealous cabs I I would write something in depth here but success is the best revenge so I'll just leave it at that to everyone else raise a mason jar of crisp water hi and take a sip here's here's to more music more memes and uh this water is actually from the sink and looks quite dirty so I'm not going to take a drink out of it I love you and I will see you in the next video here's to another million subscribers down the road and I appreciate you appreciate you forever 
UNMoeUn98u8,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd going to hit you guys today with a few quickie reviews on the phone over here the first of which is going to be for the new Gucci Mane project featuring wall-to-wall production for Metro boomin this thing is called drop top wop I actually think a smarter title would have been dropped wop although maybe that would have been a little confusing but whatever drop top wop which is a bit of a tongue twister but anyway gucci mane as you know him a southern rapper he's I wouldn't say fresh out of jail but you know he dropped that project not too long ago you know sort of his return project and he's been pretty busy following it up with one after another this is the latest one and you know in my opinion Gucci Mane is usually a very quantity over quality kind of guy he's very prolific he's always putting out something he's always working on something you know which i think does kind of hurt him personally you know that's just kind of my perspective it doesn't seem to hurt him with his fans his fans love most of what the guy drops however this one really stopped me in my tracks as you may know you know I've covered every single thing he's done since that return album but again this one did stop me in my tracks it is a short project it's just 30 minutes long it's like eight tracks or so but the Metro boomin production does provide a lot of great consistency across this project it's very low-key it's very cold it's very minimal and skeletal a lot like that Metro boomin 21 savage project that came out not too long ago which you know I did like the cold icy vibe of it it's just that 21 savage at least on that project didn't really jump out at me over this production I find Gucci Mane to be a much more animated and engaging and entertaining sort of voice Gucci Mane of course is come through with some solid hooks there's good features on this thing too um you know it's it's a typical Gucci Mane affair as far as the lyrical tone of the album you know you have him talking about sort of his life post-prison sort of the growth and the personal advances he's made since then you have the references to drug-dealing violin gang life so on and so forth but of course you know he's sounding a little bit more coherent and articulate and clever and just more on point since he's kind of cleared his head and he's leading a more straight and narrow lifestyle and with again just the focus coming through on every single track here having a pretty quality hook with all the Metro boomin production here it seems like Gucci Mane is more OnPoint than he has been on his recent projects and it seems like with the limitation of this thing just being 30 minutes and you know just eight tracks it's all killer it's no filler there's no space for him to drop in a redundant song or for him to repeat himself too much or to come through with a really super weak hook it's like you know him kind of grinding it down to the best of the best and only dropping in everything you need and nothing you don't has led to I think one of the most solid projects in a while you know so if you're a casual Gucci Mane fan even if you're a casual rap fan or you know if you find yourself kind of like me and you know you do have Gucci Mane projects that do slip through the cracks for you because not every one of them is refreshing because he comes out with so much music this would definitely sticks out to me this one definitely stand out to me as special I guess one critique I could throw at it is that a lot of the songs on this thing are kind of long it's not these hitting you with a lot of these short punchy songs office is a return album their tracks here that you know almost number close to five minutes which to me is you know a little long for a Gucci Mane song but you know none of them like you know really all that redundant or anything like that you know them and I think that's really all I have to say about this thing it's just a really solid project again short was super solid and worth checking out don't miss it drop the top wop gucci mane and metro boomin again solid features solid production solid performances from gucci mane good hooks don't know what else to say it's good give it a listen 
tSLUWz43kzA,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and I'm doing a quickie review here on the phone for the new Bryson tiller album pure to self Bryson tiller rapper singer whose breakout project his last project traps soul I pretty much skip because I didn't really have that much to say about it it was a big project for him it turned a lot of heads I got a lot of requests for it it really seemed to put him in the limelight and gained him a pretty passionate fan base but actually listening to it I just did not hear the hype at all I mean I guess the one thing I could compliment it on is given the title you really kind of knew what you were going to hear going into it I just didn't know how bland and boring and really sort of forgettable his approach to the whole thing would be you know of course you had skeletal spacey melodic and very I want to say delicate trap style instrumentals throughout the whole project wall to wall and then tiller himself singing over them and his voice is just has such a young mannish dime-a-dozen quality his lyrics are not really anything special either there's really no flavor to his performances I find it would be really emotionally bland there's never a moment where you know it sort of hits me like wow that was like a really powerful moment in his singing or it is lyric writing either it's really just like so passive it's really so I want to say wallpaper it's really so I want to say like greyscale that there's there's very little in the way of color or excitement in my opinion to a Bryson tiller does you know it's it's it's cool its pleasant to have on in the background but there's really nothing so special about it in its writing in its sound that really kind of grabs my attention and puts it at the forefront of my mind and of course since he had so much success off of that album on this latest LP over here true self he's not going to change up he's not going to you know sort of do a 180 with this style or reinvent what he's doing he's just going to kind of just continue to work with doesn't the not and he's going to not try to fix what doesn't seem broken and that seems to be the case as we have another set of very bland sleepy forgettable very uniform songs across this entire LP there's literally nothing special about tillers voice his lyrics the instrumental palette of this album it's really just him trying to write a sequel to trap soul now listen if you loved traps Alif thought trap souls one of the best albums of the year came out then you're probably going to love the  out of this thing I mean you might find that he doesn't very things up too much and you might feel to a degree that he's repeated himself a little bit but if you think that a trap soul is the  then you're probably going to think this is the light but for me personally this is like worse because it's even less inventive and less refreshing than what trap soul was you know relatively because now it seems like there's not only a lack of interesting ideas here just like there were on trap soul but it seems like all of the uninteresting ideas from traps all sort of carried over onto this new album over here as well this thing I can barely stay awake through it again a lack of passion kind of grayscales for as far as the sound the instrumentals really predictable Bryson tillers vocals really predictable nothing special about the lyrics I just fail to see what purposes music serves other than just kind of being a little background music for I don't know whatever the hell you're doing whether it be having a party putting it on little sex going on smokin up you know whatever whatever the hell you do while you put this sort of thing on you know there's really nothing about it again that puts as the forefront of my mind makes me want to focus on it for me this is bedtime music and I'm not really sure what else to say about it you know I'm sure if this was a success and it seems like it is you know it's it's outperformed the new little yachty album by like a mile which is actually pretty good you know not only because the little gaudy record is super mediocre but you know I I don't begrudge Bryson tiller his success it's cool that you know you have somebody new in the music industry who's kind of making their own way and sort of has their own fan base and you know he seems to really kind of be building something that is all his own but it's just not for me you know I'm not really into it I don't see what's so special about it I don't see what's so interesting about it it's just again it's just musical wallpaper for me and I'm just going to have to leave it at that but you know what did you guys think of this album did you let a to why and what do you think I should review next I will catch you guys in the next video forever 
diDkeBYKvK4,No hi everyone Sydney Jen tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sinjin hawk album first opus Sinden hawk is a young electronic music producer that I thought was entirely new to me when I was catching suggestions to review his debut album over here only to learn that I've actually heard his production before because he's worked with artists like Kanye West and Just Blaze and gangsta boo ultimately though it doesn't really matter to me all that much whose music he's worked on in the past it's really actually the individual merits of this album this album being so incredibly entertaining in my opinion that has me talking about it here in this video well hawk is pulled together on this 43 minute album is a pretty tight set of tracks that are part drainie part groovy and present this very melodic smooth and hyper futuristic take on the sounds of wonky and UK bass with some very creative sampling here and there on the album - of what sounds like some horn breaks a lot of vocal samples on this thing which are executed very tastefully throughout the album I would actually call them refined especially on the intro of the track dawn of infinity obviously this is an electronic music album it's a dance music album but it clearly lives up to the name first opus in its grandeur there's something really opulent about some of these tracks even though a lot of the production on this thing takes a very skeletal kind of Spacey approach everything you need nothing you don't kind of a definition of power in simplicity as Hawk guides listeners through one very round bouncy impeccably composed banger after another there are a ton of highlights across the track listing on this thing in my opinion the invigorating horn breaks on the track dawn of infinity but the rough and heavy sub bass kicks on the track don't lose yourself to this or driving they're pushing their propulsive their visceral in a way kind of reminds me of tonight you know that one great EP that they put out I mean maybe not as colourful and bombastic and over-the-top but certainly you know that I think there are some sonic similarities there also on the track they can't love you the the song features all these really pretty lucky sparkling melodies in every direction really nice beautiful arpeggios that kind of remind me of like there is loving you era for tet but of course like this uk-based groove comes in later in the track that brings an entirely different vibe and dynamic and I think fans who like the very bright and glossy scent work on Rusty's glass swords will get into a lot of what this album has to offer to the semi ambient and sparkling shimmer is easily one of the most gorgeous moments on the LP and the track nail gun which comes out of nowhere sticks out like a sore thumb but in a very good way in that it's one of the most unique tracks in the entire track listing here feels like this weird off-the-wall deconstructed piece of techno or footwork I really it's it that there's so much to it from the weird mechanical drum break on this thing to kind of the sputtering Warped sub bass kicks and all the demonic vocal samples it's one of the oddest hybrids of multiple sounds and inspirations on the entire album but yet it's it's so hard hitting it's so gritty it's so fun meanwhile the song by any means kind of sounds like a speedy and chipmunk take on what could have been an instrumental intro on like Kanye's late registration or something with these grand vocal harmonies and driving sub base hits and these really hype wounds worked into the instrumental plot consistently comes through with great ideas on every single track here but if there is kind of a shortcoming or an Achilles heel that occasionally pops up some of the tracks run shorter than others and as a result I don't feel like he abruptly ends any of the tracks like some producers and artists do who do come through the really short track like it just kind of feels unfinished rather instead Hawk has at least a handful of songs on here that feel almost like he jammed packs him with so many ideas which I think he could have extended out a little bit it's almost as if he's in a rush to finish or end some of these songs when he has more than enough progression and detail there to just kind of like let it glide let it ride out a little bit longer and just kind of develop in a more a natural and organic and I guess cohesive way and this is by no means a huge prevalent problem on the album most of the tracks actually do this it's only just a couple it's only several tracks where it actually feels like you know this really could have ended in a bit smoother of a fashion there are a couple of rare moments like Donovan finiti where I think maybe he could have added a bit more detail to some of the progressions there because there's so many moments where I feel like I've heard that same horn hit so many times like with the drum build-up that it's like yeah you know that this could use a bit more variation but outside of that I'm just very generally impressed with the writing with the production with the sound craft on this album especially on tracks like on set which are easily one of the most grand and hard-hitting moments on the entire record so much so that I feel like the couple of tracks that come after this are almost like wow this is like a little less exciting here I feel almost as if the album could have ended or just gotten very close to the ending at this point and that's kind of another thing the flow of the album is just okay I wouldn't say it sounds purely like a random collection of tracks you know but I think there could have been more attention paid to how many songs actually feel like a little redundant or maybe could have been cut from the tracklisting just to make the overall experience of the record a little bit tighter though I will say the closing track on here is easily one of the most grand beautiful and melodic on the entire album I cannot say that the album doesn't end strong it does yeah I mean overall just really impressed with this record really loving what Hawke is bringing to the table first opus looking forward to here in the second 1/2 because this was actually really entertaining easily going to be one of my favorite electronic records of the year awesome to hear some bangers with a lot of detail a lot of color a lot of nuance and I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate

Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the latest installment of the why you know review a series of gauntlet style very short brief reviews of a myriad of albums that I didn't get a chance to do a full length review for this past month so now I'm just dropping them all here just BAM the Bam Bam Bam all of the album's that I talk about in this segment are linked down there in the description box I'm not really sure if there's anything else for me to say or explain at this point so thanks for being here thanks for clicking and let's get right into the reviews I got to get it to Falco on this one he was putting out a lot of solo material under this name and I wasn't so sure whether or not this was like a great direction to go down but now it seems like he's really kind of fine-tune things on this latest record over here because this is the most hard-hitting punchy crunchy and nasty solo effort he's put out under the Christian fitness name thus far so if you're into very jagged angular rock music crazy experimental post hardcore music a little bit and always rock then definitely look this thing up because it is wild it is wild no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no I'm just really not sure how to tape this EP honestly like it's it's the shortest and it's the most Spacey and ambient and super minimal and I guess you could say even uneventful of all the variables recent EPS I would actually say his is an awfully out single he dropped last year at some point actually had like a bit more meat to it yeah I mean there's there's really just not a whole lot to say here because there's not a whole lot to hear here I I'm it I miss old burial I miss it I was so excited for this album and I think there's still a lot of good things about it I think the production for the most part is pretty good I think the drums and the guitar work are really great as well really tight really intricate really detailed brutal as hell and aggressive these guys are amazing elements of post hardcore and punk with death metal maybe a touch of black metal there too mostly death metal though however I do not care at all for the lead vocals on this thing they're like these weird distant shouting groans that don't really add anything to the music at all in my opinion you know when I heard a couple tracks off the record I was kind of like okay this sounds cool this is kind of interesting but then once I heard the entire record it was like wow that's like all the vocals do and it's aggravating this is like surprisingly okay I'm surprised that Foster the people made such a smooth transition to a more modern contemporary pop sound away from their dated upon release stale indie pop sound that they somehow broke through into the mainstream with even though again that that sound was like dead already by the time that they had made a career off of it you know but this new sound over here has like some trap hi-hat on one track would you get it's not bad they're bad tunes I guess I'm just happy that they changed it up when I say it's for me not necessarily but you know it is an admirable attempt at doing something different [Music] hey hey math rock fan hey you you the idiot who likes math rock you're not you're not an idiot listen to this will you listen to this freakin thing because it's good it's super melodic it's fun it's tight I feel like not only is tricot doing some other best work yet on this thing but I feel like the blowing away to a lot a lot of the competition as well if you've watched deeply into my review back catalogue you know that this kind of stuff it's not usually my cup of tea and I'm not going to lie and say that that's the case this time around you know it's still not but I still recognize in terms of the vocals in terms of the performances in terms of the guitar work there's an incredible amount of talent on this album and I would hate for anybody who is simply a fan of this sort of thing to miss out on it because you know they really are doing some special stuff on this album so did so don't sort of miss it bitch in my opinion pretty solid record from obituary over here I mean they're obviously not reinventing the wheel but I do love just the passion and the anger and the fire they bring to this record combining that with the fact that in a lot of ways it is a purists death metal album I mean especially with the first third or so of the record so many tracks at this portion of the album soon be kind of pulling from that era in time where thrash metal and was very much at the beginning of death metal as a stylistic influence there are lots of hard and heavy and in-your-face tracks on this thing a few snoozers a lesson in vengeance and I would skip betrayal if you can but outside of that I think it's a good record good record from obituary [Music] it's the 90s where a lot of planning gets a bread won't be the president oh yeah this is actually one of those instances where a blatant 90s throwback is is really not that bad some fun nasally sweetly harmonized vocals on this thing some sharp hooks it's kind of like a bubble gum approach to grunge yeah I wouldn't say the band sounds all that original and it is a little one-dimensional on this record but it's kind it's kind of fun hell yeah check this band out there from the UK quality instrumental rock over here with elements of art rock and math rock it's really tight battles fans will be into it the again the prog rock fans will be into it there are some moments to me that red is like a little a little drab a little so-so and they do tend to weather influences on their sleeve pretty heavily but all things considered I do think it is a quality EP for for of this genre definitely one of the better ups you're going to hear in this style of music this year for sure all the more reason to listen to it you know there are a lot of terrible tracks on this thing some awful lines and some bad auto-tune layers the lot of unfinished tracks on here there's not enough here to constitute old tape a whole project a whole anything but if you're a music nerd if you're a huge rap fan you're probably going to want to hear this because it's pretty interesting hearing these tracks just kind of unearthed out of the blue they're not perfect they're flawed they're a bit of a mess but there's a lot of cool qualities to them and there's stuff on here that damn like if it if it had been finished it had been fleshed out you know it could it could have been like a really good record or at least a couple of really good sang on here you know I'm not going to try to make a mountain out of a molehill here I'm just saying if you're morbidly curious make sure you try it because there are a lot of cool ideas here what the heck man what rappers can't catch a break and what rappers gets respect in the game please they're just as good as everybody else just as talented just as good Len MGK album lay there why people shouldn't rap whenever they do it sounds like crap white people shouldn't rap whatever they do it sounds like crap white you know I really enjoy cupcake as a personality I think she's very funny I think she has a kind of very unique talent for being able to perform effectively songs that have raunchy sexuality but then also tracks to have very grim realities to them I just wish that she would find a producer or find some production that is more reflective of her unique style sound and personality because a lot of the beats she tends to hop on just read as generic trap or as generic pop rap to me which I just don't think compliment her all that well they just don't reflect how unique her voices in the hip-hop landscape of today if she could just hop on somewhere interesting instrumentals I think it would do wonders for her oh man this is Thurston Moore records not really their book it's like a boring Leary ripoff goddamn God yeah how did they get it to sound so much like it's 2002 you know that's that's what I want to know it sounds like it's still like 2000 it sounds like it's freaking it's still freaking 1999 and that's that's an accomplishment I guess you know not that Oliver has ever had a single sound or style attributed to their name part of the reason I think they're one of the most interesting groups in music period is that they tend to evolve and change so aggressively with every couple of albums you know some of those progressions some of those evolutions not a huge fan of some of them sure great fantastic this is one of the ones where I'm just really kind of on the fence with it over has done a lot of things over the years but I did not expect them to come through the record of grand showy very pristine goth ballads mixed with like Depeche Mode like old-school Depeche Mode flavored New Wave a very funky like synth pop stuff it wouldn't never would have anticipated but here it is and I think they did the style at least a little bit of justice you know does it do them any favors not necessarily but you know over certainly doesn't sound awkward going in this direction I guess I'll say that much um yeah it's uh it's interesting but merely only from the perspective for me of like hey they're trying something different that's worth trying out but um you know it's worth it's worth it's worth hearing for that reason but it's not necessarily anything I'm excited returned to you know I wanted to like this so bad I wanna do like this so bad you know I've been kind of listened to their previous mixtape and EEPs and just kind of waiting for the moment where I'm just like blown away by horrors music and I feel like what has happened on this new album over here is well there there have been improvements I feel like what has kept me from loving the band's music truly and fully has made itself so apparent that I can't deny it any longer and while I love the aggression and the energy that they bring on this album especially on some of the tracks where they effectively fuse rock like punk rock hardcore punk with like newer grime ear louder more aggressive and assorted traps style production which you know I feel like they've done better here than they have anywhere else even though I like that they're kind of pushing forward in that direction and they're inventing some things you know I feel like they're sort of a being really creative with sound on this album in a way that they just have not been in the past a goddamn are the lyrics edgy and cringy as fuck on this album there is a moment where i rana Clee his screamed numerous times let the bodies hit the floor and you know a lot of the straight Punk tracks on this album are still pretty like painfully cliche much of which happened toward the back end of this record I'm not even really sure if I'm down with the fact this thing is like 47 minutes long because there's not 47 minutes of interesting material on this thing you know it's it's bloated there are a lot of lackluster tracks again lyrics way too edgy but I don't know you know there are a lot of cool qualities about this record you know there are a lot of cool fusions of rock and punk and there are a lot of cool moments where actually they kind of strike me as being like almost like industrial or maybe like digital hardcore type shit like you know if you're an Atari Teenage Riot fan you'll probably get down with some of the shit or is doing again you know still interested and still general positive toward what the band is doing but like you know there's some serious turn offs here fifteen-year-old me would love the fuck out of this album though I don't know man I really like the new Sun Kil moon record you guys know that's going to be one of my favorite albums of the year but unfortunately I'm not so much into this new collaboration with with the S ooh I do like it more than the previous one though the instrumentals are not as horrendous on this one however they have a similarly very static very flat synthetic tone to them that doesn't really speak to me there's there's not a lot about these instrumentals that do much for me they don't sound bad there's not wowing me there's not really doing a lot for me however I do think some of Marc's stories and rants on this record are entertaining listen to he is bad if you want to hear mark at his most kozilek on this record it's kind of very mean-spirited and brutal takedown of Michael Jackson and the tracker he's ranting about how junkies deserve fun at Disneyland - that's a good one you know if you're really into alternative R&B to the point where you just want to hear any of it all of it I think this is this is most definitely an album you're going to want to check out there are some very cool progressive and invented things about some of the production on this thing I wouldn't say the vocals are all that strong I mean in my opinion that's really kind of the Achilles heel of the record but um you know who knows this is kind of the first big album sized outing for this project maybe the vocals will you know become a bit brighter this bolder a bit more intriguing with future releases but as of right now you know again if you're into that kind of Spacey experimental alternative R&B sound certainly worth checking out [Music] look if you're in instrumental music very jazzy jammy kind of psychedelic very vintage late 60s early 70s era instrumental music it's it's slightly elevator music to a degree then check this thing out you know I think it's quality it's recorded very well and a few moments on this thing Chaz's vocals kind of take center stage so you know I don't think Toro y Moi fans or anything should sit this out because his songwriting in his vocal presence is a is very much there it's very clear it's very present um but uh yeah you know it's not anything that's going to keep me coming back but it's certainly pleasant while it's on pretty much you know my worst fears confirmed on this new woods album over here and I get that sounds and elements that are in this record have also kind of existed on woods previous records the hippie dippie sort of quality of their music the jam band quality of their music I mean me personally I like the dreary er darker folky ER side of the band so much more and I tend to favor their releases that kind of lean on that side of their influence this one's kind of on that that other side of their influence I'm not all that crazy about but it it's not a terrible record I just don't think it's a woods album for me personally but I'm going to look up their next one because they put out so much material they're always changing they're always evolving they're always doing something a little different incrementally altering their sound so no reason you know not to continue following the band position y-you know review y-you know review I hope you guys enjoyed that one there you go the band banging these things out um that's that's all I have to say right now you're the best very proud of you eat your fruits and veggies stay hydrated hit the gym hug someone you love and I'll catch you in the next video forever 
Gjx2OBFrUAE,hi everyone - yeah channa here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new lil yachty album teenage emotions Atlanta rapper singer eccentric lil yachty an unforeseen cultural force in mainstream hip-hop who floated his way to mainstream relevancy off of his little boat mixtape last year which featured enjoyably awkward hits like Minnesota and one night it also kind of helped that little yacht II was featured on one of the biggest hip hop songs of last year drams broccoli and I'm not going to lie I've enjoyed a lot of what little yadi has put out over the past year but he is not for everybody because music wasn't exactly clicking with me at first either but after a handful of listens to this little boat mixtape I ended up enjoying just how ridiculous and blissful and playful and just kind of silly the whole vibe of the project was despite yachties severe lyrical shortcomings i thought his voice was just kind of cartoonishly unique and his style just brought a new angle to the growing trend of part rapper part singers crooning their way through these ultra melodic trap instrumentals and while i did like this tape and i said this in my review people don't give me credit for this but i said this in my review I had a fear coming away from the little boat mixtape that this was just kind of a fluke because I was just kind of wondering where would little yadi even go from this little boat mixtape because truth be told the tape and from what I can tell little yachty to are not that deep and while I did appreciate the multiple personality concept that yachty brought to the table here I was kind of questioning whether or not he had the vision to come through with a project that was just as satisfying or more satisfying than this boat mixtape my suspicions were kind of confirmed on little yachties summer songs - mixtape although i didn't sort of pin my hope or yachty in the future on that mixtape because it still kind of rushed and it's not an album it's not the debut album which really all of my anticipation has been building for and I'm not alone on that even though I was somewhat confused by the lead single bring it back which featured yachties singing very clumsily over what sounds like this 80's pop rock instrumental although maybe the track would just sound sillier and more fun once I heard the full vision of what he was trying to do on teenage emotions and then we had the song x-men which to me sounded like just a really forgettable throwaway freestyle I was surprised to hear that it was even on the album but then I saw that this thing runs 21 tracks and over 70 minutes of material it sounds like yadi didn't really leave much on the cutting room floor for this thing and uh I don't know what to say this album is such a horrific disappointment it's a borderline dumpster fire yadi falls so short of the mark that he set with the boat mixtape he falls short of a really any mark make a mark anywhere he falls short of it not just in terms of a lack of quality tracks overall but God is this thing bloated there again is 70 minutes of material here but they're not 70 minutes of good songs they're not 70 minutes of worthwhile ideas in a way I think yachties newfound fame kind of caught up with him on this project because the budget on this thing sounds huge and as a result it feels like yadi just kind of lost control of it it didn't need to be like 20 tracks long it sounds way cleaner and more commercial than it needed to case and point the track with Diplo on here IATI is amateurish and silly and kind of free spear appeal has completely evaporated and now he just sounds super awkward and clumsy over a bunch of very expensive instrumentals case in point the song running with a ghost featuring grace as a guest singer and grace she's a very good singer she brings a dramatic urgency to the track it's actually really great but the thing is yadi himself with his lyrical style with his voice does very little to complement this sound and the supposed bangers on this album either they're super short unfinished don't have much in the way of a good hook or they're painfully tedious like the track peekaboo with me goes on these tracks yachties weird and absurd sense of humor is completely gone instead he's trying to sound really cool really cold is not all that good of a look for him especially when he comes out with lines like this this line makes absolutely no  sense and yadi explains why it makes no sense in a rap genius annotation stating that he misconstrued the cello as a woodwind instrument and thought it was a flute because Squidward plays the flu except squid or plays the  clarinet migos do very little to save the track to which it's virtually impossible to because the instrumental is garbage and on top of that the hook is garbage too the peekaboo peekaboo peekaboo but with the like peekaboo it's hardly a hook especially with how clumsily and off flow yadi delivers it probably the most egregious lack of flow on this entire album is the digital mods freestyle where yadi god it's it's barely a rap it sounds like he's just kind of ranting sort of on beat a little bit I just can't I just you know I swear I've heard this dude rap on tempo before why is he completely unable to do on this song and it's funny because after hearing these tracks the song x-men on the record makes so much more sense because in comparison with the other bangers it no longer sounds like a throwaway track it sounds like the most listenable of all the songs that have a more aggressive tone it makes even more sense that it would be treated like a single because there's so many tracks on this record that are so painfully boring lady in yellow moments in time the reggae infused better which is a very tough listen and I don't think there's a song in the track listing here that sounds more aimless and off-the-cuff than fYI there are a handful of songs here where yadi does sound like he is kind of recapturing the original appeal of his music on that little boat mixtape but with a cleaner more glitzy and glamorous instrumentals better mixing like the song Harley and say my name all around me - to a degree although I would take good day and never switch up over any of those tracks on this album and speaking of never switch up that's kind of the problem with this album yadi did switch up in a big way maybe not personally or philosophically but certainly musically the biggest example of this is maybe on the song no more which God this is a terrible track maybe the worst track on the entire album it's basically a few minutes of yadi trying to awkwardly recreate what sounds like when Kanye does that kind of distorted auto-tune effect on one of the songs but here the distortion sounds like garbage and yachties vocal performance is almost unlistenable nevermind the fact that i have no idea what this instrumental is it's so messy and sporadic and nearly groove las' I would hate to think that this was paid for I mean I knew going into this project that there wasn't going to be much to this thing lyrically and I was okay with that I personally believe that there's more to hip hop in 2017 than just lyrics but geez man you got to give the crowd something else you know your lyrics don't have to be super smart but can they at least be funny can they at least be like a a wee bit entertaining or clever or can we at least require the rappers know the difference between a cello and a flute or a clarinet and a flute this is why we need the Arts in schools get to get the Arts back in schools but if you're knowingly going to put out a lyrically deficient hip-hop album in 2017 we need some good beats we need some memorable hooks we need some great features we need some kind of energy or charisma or something to get excited about something to vibe to and this album has virtually none of that and the multiple personality angle on this record is more or less irrelevant it serves more as an excuse to just be really inconsistent and not really stick to any song long enough to finish it I think the song priorities is kind of funny with the old school flow that yadi appears on the track with and the tribute to his mother at the very tail end of the album is kind of endearing but I can't really praise or compliment this album on much more I think most if not all of yachties problems on this album boils down to focus a severe lack of focus it's what keeps him from fine-tuning a verse it's what keeps him from structuring and building out a track effectively it's what keeps him from writing a good hook and clearly nobody on little yachties team is picking up the slack because the result that we've got here is this complete mess of an album if we're going to care about a yachty mixtape a yachty album a yachty anything two years from now the the quality has got improved on all fronts because there's only a certain amount of time in which yachties hype will sort of be able to insulate him from the the severe mediocrity that he's treating his fans to on this album I'm feeling a light too on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're hanging if you are if you're angry okay lil yachty teenage emotions videos next to my head that I think you should check out subscribe to the channel official website linked to for 
17JnPv2fTjw,hey everyone anthony Fantana here the internet's busiest music nerd and I have dirty glasses and it's also time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best in worst tracks of the week I'm going to try to keep my sweating to a minimum in this video because it's it's humid out and I'm feeling sweaty before we get into the tracks of course I have to shout out a few things our amazon associates laying down there in the description if you use that and you live in the US you just click on it anything you buy on Amazon afterwards you know sort of in that session within your browser we get kickback front it does not add to your overall price helps the channel helps the segment use the device and stuff you're going to buy anyway capiche that's it also we have a similar thing going on with the good people over at turntable lab that link is also down there in the description but turntable lab they're a great place very great online portal where it's it's basically centered more around great pressings of Records there's a page featuring a lot of records that I reviewed recently some turntable equipment as well for people looking to get into record collecting and turntable equipment that sort of thing and also finally have to shout out again the good people over at feed bands comm feed bands calm easily the most unique music monthly subscription service that I have caught so far using the power of crowdsourcing to not only get independent artists to put their own music onto the site but then users subscribers on the website go through the music the thumb stuff up stuff that gets thumbed up it ends up sort of in a bit of a competition whatever gets to the top of the heap as everybody on the site agreeing hey this is great hey this is great hey this is great that stuff gets printed to vinyl it gets sent to you there's also a subscription service on the site where you can get a t-shirt opt out of a record get a t-shirt instead but also get a digital download from the band whose t-shirt you receive a lot of different options a lot of cool facets to the website check it out dive into there a lot of layers to this thing that they're doing again most unique music subscription service I have run across that is still the case as they you know are still doing something really sort of abrupt above the fray of a lot of these uh other monthly musics or to the vinyl subscription services that I've seen so far and those are our shoutouts for the video thank you thank you for watching through those alright let's get to the best and worst tracks the week of course kicking it off with what I felt were the worst tracks of the week only a couple here wasn't really that bad of a week for music to be completely honest I actually had to cut a lot of songs that I wanted to talk about but I was just like oh there's just not enough room for this there's not enough room for this there's not enough room for this so I only have a couple tracks in the worst track section this week one unfortunately I have to put a Chuck Berry in here with the song lady be good which is a weird lyrical sort of sister song version of Johnny be good get just a really awkward execution to this right here I mean I get so many years later he tried to do something different with this track you know and I'm not trying to disrespect the man's memory because you know he has passed away rest in peace but this is just probably the most awkward and unlikable track that I've heard from this forthcoming record he has coming out so far you know it's kind of cute what he tried to do with it but just the lack of energy and I would say pizzazz coming out of the guitar leads on this thing with just kind of the ham-fisted transition he made trying to make the meaning of the track completely different or kind of like a bit of a mirror opposite in a way was just kind of weird and just not executed to the way that it could have been I guess moving on from there I have to include here how C's strangers this new single from how C's upcoming record it's okay it's a bit of an overly dramatic ballad here with a duo kind of quality to it and you know while it's not the worst thing that I've heard I have to put it here just to kind of highlight it and Center on it and just kind of say this this is a pop song it's not an alternative song it's a pop song and this this is what pop music sounds like so just in case there's any more confusion hey it is healthy making alternative music is healthy making pop pop music is healthy on an alternative artists is healthy a pop artists this spot spot music all right let's get out of there into the tracks that I thought were decent worth mentioning wasn't crazy about them but certainly wanted to shout them out because I think they may be of interest to you guys one washed-out has a new single titled get lost which is a very sensual house influence tuned with a driving beat very gauzy sort of layers of sound on this thing liked it a lot very pretty on the ears you know it's not one of my favorite tracks of the week but I would be interested to hear this sound pushed further on whatever record washed-out has coming down the pipe certainly a cool sort of transition on this track too you know again a more house influenced sound moving on from there ani DiFranco has a new song a dizzying featuring Justin Vernon which is actually not really that bad of a track I mean I've heard DeFranco put out some you know some really awkward stuff sort of in this is the second act as the third act of her career maybe second act at this point that you know did not gel with me at all but this track actually came together really well I like how detailed and angular a lot of the guitars and instrumentation is on this thing Justin's contribution sounds pretty cool too a lot of great things about this track hopefully you know this record and whatever she has coming down the pipe can help her kind of reconnect with this new generation of music listeners that I feel like she's kind of not say lost touch with she didn't sort of you know from the 2000s I feel like moving from there her music didn't quite sort of grab the ears of the next you know ten years of music listeners and I would love I would love to see that happen and again hopefully this makes it happen especially with that Justin Vernon inclusion there moving on from there chromatics with the song shadow I first heard the song over on Twin Peaks I've been watching the new Twin Peaks episodes and the chromatics appear on the second episode of the series so far the first four episodes they've been released and it's not that bad of a track it's okay at the time in the show I was like oh because uh you know like oh you're really trying to like you know do a little bit of a you know millennial take on what was essentially you know that really awesome dream pop music that was flowing throughout many pieces of the Twin Peaks soundtrack back in the day and now the chromatic schematics are the ones carrying the torch but actually when I isolate the song out of the context of the show and actually just listen to the song itself it's actually not that bad of a dream pop track it's pretty sweet dream pop track and we'll just you know leave it that it's dreamy it's sweet on ears not not really much more that I would want from a track of this style so check it out give it a listen it's good and just and make sure to watch that Twin Peaks you know the new Twin Peaks episodes they're pretty good moving out from there we have twenty-one savage fully embracing the meme on this new esse track featuring Drake and featuring young thug hopefully the link I have placed in the description box is still working because places that I see this online dislike been taken down it's been removed I don't really know why to be completely honest the track is pretty fun you know again there's not much to it beyond the meme you know this is - this is - that is the other thing you know mean that's kind of dogging 21 savage right now but also you know making him more popular than ever but you know still it's a fun track to listen to give it a shot I want to give a shout-out to bad bad not good for there and e-shelf cover of - you they have a new little project coming out that I believe is like going to be other cover songs as well that I think fans of the band are definitely going to want to check out and bleachers I miss those days man I have been like moderately interested - loving nearly every track that has come out from this bleachers album so far I don't say man I've always thought bleachers was sure a slightly quirky mainstream pop project with a kind of an indie twist maybe not you know indie or eclectic enough to really hold my interest but these new tracks over here are certainly doing that you know that's certainly the case for these new cuts over here like the other songs that have come out you know the lyrics on this new track are decent has been of an 80s pop influence going on there you know it's really huge it's got a grand melodic hook to it and I'm just liking what's happening with these new tracks so you know definitely make sure to give this one a shot - now let's move on to the songs that really excited me this week the best tracks this week the favorite tracks this week going down the list this isn't so much a track but I do want to shout it out the new igloo ghost mix the choc mix a lot of different material in here some of which sounds original some which does sound original at all some which sounds remixed definitely give it a shot from what I read online he put it together as a means of having something to run to or to have something a for running and it definitely sounds like you know it would be fantastic for that you know of course the eclectic strange beat music production that you have come to expect from igloo ghost music shows up here too so do not miss it even though it's just a mix not a new single or whatever but he's also said that he has a new record coming out soon the album has done so I'm just going to be sitting here waiting for that although I am standing right now so I apologize for lying a little bit I want to give a shout out to Omar Suleiman chobe Syrian dance music master over here with this new track over here which has actually come out via Mad Decent of all places this dude has come in and of course because linked with Mad Decent he has come out with a supreme banger on this new song which a lot of people who are subscribed to the Mad Decent YouTube channel down in the comments seem to be kind of confused by I don't know if they was a bunch of this guy's music before so they're just kind of like the just kind of flabbergasted and scratching their head and they're like oh this is the worst through mode do some silvertone whoo and that's just so not the case I love kind of hearing this variety on the Mad Decent label and Omar has been putting out music for a long time it's Alec he's just some random Syrian artists that Mad Decent pulled out of the freaking blue to just throw on their label this guy's been doing this for a long time and it's really cool to kind of not only see him get that I don't want to say a you know I wanted to say yeah now it's completely brain farted right here in front of you and it's freaking embarrassing I don't want to see validity because he's always had you know he's had validity for a while now he's been getting coverage for allowing I was we coming out with you know good music for a while now but it just kind of seems like you know it would make sense despite the fact that there a lot of ignorant people in the comments considering that he does make you know some really high pass dance music even if it does have a completely different and foreign flavor to it you know to most Western music it's cool to sort of hear them you know bringing a dance music producer bringing a dance music artist of another shade of another background of another culture into the mix you know who if you open your ears to this and you just open your mind to this you're going to find that it's just as exciting as a lot of the stuff Mad Decent comes out with so just give it a chance give it a shot don't give this a chobe track a pass you know give it a chance moving on from there Carly Rae Jepsen has a new single out titled cut to the feeling a single that really lives up to the title because I feel like the song takes no time whatsoever getting that really emotional powerful hook it's a really good cut it's a really good single and excited to hear what Carly has coming down the pipe in addition to this track you know in a lot of course those uh you know great traditional and fundamental pop elements that were so great about emotion and the emotion b-sides also turn up in this track ok don't miss it moving on from there something that I didn't mention the last video even though it made it into the description box I apologize for that but I want to shout out three tracks right here three tracks ok Brock Hampton the hip hop crew sort of not not fronted by but you know obviously Kevin abstract is the member of the group with the most sort of visibility in you know that genre right now but Kevin abstracts Brock Hampton you know though I'm not sort of attributing everything in the group to him you know it's obviously you know good collective sort of input from everybody because the music Brockhampton comes out was is very different from the music that Kevin abstract comes out with you know just got to just got to state that and make that clear but Brock Hampton had the dropping single after single after single over the past few weeks gold heat and face and every single fucking track has been fantastic you know I've heard some tracks from Brock Hampton in the past some of which were hits some which were a little miss these three tracks so far had been top-notch as far as just like lyrical chemistry between all the members great production that's visceral quality hook the track face that they recently dropped is probably the you know the lightest and those easygoing of all of them but the melodic hook that abstracts things on the song is really great you know I don't really have anything else to say about these tracks other than do not miss them please do not miss these tracks they are really fucking good and they really had me excited for what Brockhampton has coming out around the corner if they keep dropping heat like this this is going to be one of the best kpop projects of the year I'm not joking Karen J Kalinin someone who I think is also shaping up to drop one of the best projects of the year four songs from this album so far every single one of them stuck in fire these two new tracks feature Conan moccasin and the other one features James chance of James chance and the contortions noise rock and No Wave fans unite please and these two new tracks over here they sound fantastic Karen continues to kill it with sort of weird alternative production quirks and you know like some old-school sort of 80s era pop at rock influences flowing through his songs too you know but it's not just kind of this exercise in nostalgia there are a lot of new and sort of very eclectic things about his songs and again production to that I think are very interesting and of course Karen vocally kills it every time I love this dudes voice I just cannot get enough of the students voice he's so expressive he's so raw and animalistic he's so dramatic I just cannot get enough of the student and I'm really excited for him to drop his album got to give it a shout-out to the new alt-j track add a line or Lulu and it's a very pretty little ballad has kind of linear structure to it gets more intense as the song finishes out so don't get you know bored or an interest in the first 30 seconds or so give it a chance to just kind of like move through the whole progress of the time that the track is a lot of itself because the payoff is great and is very much worth it is one of the prettier ballads I've heard from this album so far and finally I want to give a shout out to the new Shabazz Palaces tracks since excuse me man this is going to be one track off of one of the two double albums that the psychedelic experimental abstract hip hop project is going to be dropping this year this one is just as trippy and is strange and as thought-provoking as I would come to expect from Shabazz Palaces they want to say too much about it because I am getting ready for you don't want to like you know spoil too many thoughts about these tracks because they have dropped quite a few songs and that is going to be the best and worst segment for this week guys okay also I guess in the worst Traverse track segment you probably could that put that new migos track 2 2 hotty which is it should also be 2t oh oh ha d for Scotty 2 hotty but also it really boring song honestly yeah I guess we'll put that one in there too we're just kind of off the top of my head and that is going to be it thank you again for watching this hope you got some good recommendations down there in the description again all these tracks that I just mentioned they're all down there in the

-K1Grr32MPA,hi everyone this video is sponsored by the privacy calm more information at the end of the video here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for our great album series it's the end of May so I'm going to go over the releases that stuck out to me as being the most entertaining the most significant over the course of the month and I will link down there below links where you can listen to music from these records or you can see reviews of these records let's go let's kick it off with the new Feist record pleasure definitely Leslie Feist most raw lowdown and dirty and rock and roll album so far love the sound of this record the production had an incredible amount of texture to it the performances felt very live and in the moment and this is definitely one of Leslie's best crops of songs yet as far as like a full-length record goes not really a whole lot I don't like about the album if you're looking for a strong singer-songwriter record this year with a lot a lot of gusto then definitely give this thing a shot got to give a shout out to the new Colin Stetson album all this I do for glory Colin Stetson comes back with his avant-garde his minimal his hypnotic solo saxophone pieces finding some new and inventive ways to add some more sounds and stuff into the mix too he definitely pushes the envelope a bit more with this record although in the grander scheme of things it's nothing altogether new but it is nice to sort of hear him to be able to stick to his guns stick to what he does so well on the saxophone without changing up things too much but still come through with like an entertaining album I would actually say this album is more centered around him than any of the big records in his new history warfare series so far because this is just purely him no guests from what I understand on this record and it just sounds incredible got to give a shout out to to the new Mac DeMarco album this old dog Mac DeMarco while this is definitely his sleepiest album as far as the sound of the record so far I do like the incorporation of more drum machines more synthesizers in the incredibly dark and personal lyrics on this record definitely make this a very sad very personal but very engaging album too somehow I ended up enjoying a new Paramore album after laughter quite a bit definitely the the band's slickest and Dan SIA Strecker are embracing the sounds of synth pop and new wave on this thing was just like a dab of post-punk every once in a while just to give a few tracks a little bit more of an edge you know if you enjoy the throwbacks the recent pop throwbacks of artists like carly rae jepsen for example on her emotion record or you know if you enjoy very poppy danceable post-punk music you're going to dig on this but then i also want to give a shout out to the new perfume genius album no shape oh man incredible record definitely one of Mike's most powerful albums so far as far as a presentation instrumental presentation goes incredible variety on this album so many instrumental risks I feel like not every one of those risks pans out but I still think it's a very very amazing album for Mike I would love to hear him sort of refine down some of the ideas he had on this record and that maybe bring back some of the vulnerable and very powerfully emotional songwriting that some of this past records did so well while still sort of expanding you know kind of on this world of sound that introduced us to on this album and finally I have to shine a light again on the new forest swords album compassion this thing is loaded with some really interesting electronic music mixing elements of like tribal rhythms and chanting with really cerebral and hypnotic and very primal drum sequences and some really interesting sample work on this thing as far as the vocal samples some cool synthesizer patches as well a lot of great colors a lot of great textures I would say for our swords comes through with a strong direction and style on this record it's electronic music that somehow sounds like it's like it's coming from thousands of years in the past from some long lost civilization or something it's actually kind of crazy the vibe that that's that's pulled together on this album you know in the end I did wish there was a little bit more variety to the record but it's definitely going to stick out as when my favorite electronic albums this year and I'm going to leave it at that those are the records that I wanted to shout out for you guys in this segment so again all that is down there in the description and hope you guys enjoyed the video hope you guys got a solid recommendation out of this yada yada yada transition and once again I have to give a shout out to our sponsor for this video the good people over

mNSkoLmqTGc,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd doing another quickie review here of the new Snoop Dogg album never left I've been getting tons of requests to react to to talk about this new Snoop Dogg record and I don't know I'm not really that into it to be completely honest if we're just being completely honest here um and and I feel like that's partially because the title the cover conveys and even the intro track conveys and tells you one thing but I feel like the album actually does another you know what Snoop Dogg and what this album would love you to sort of come away from this record with would love you to think going into this album is that hey man I had my heyday back in the 90s that's when all my classic came out and honestly nothing's changed still the same guy I could still come through the same sound and it'll be excellent it'll be amazing you know nothing's changed still the same rapper still the same artists and here's that here's the proof here's the proof of that when in reality it's very obvious that everything has changed everything is very different things are not the same and we're just trying to recapture some nostalgia here in a really ineffective way you know which is disappointing because I would think that you know if any artist from that era of hip hop on the west coast working today would be able to kind of recapture that magic recapture that sound it would be Snoop Dogg and yet I think he falls so short of doing that partially because some of the tracks that do have an old-school G Funk vibe are kind of awkward but also because I feel like part of the way into the record he just kind of gives up entirely on trying to keep true to that sound and just like okay let me do a trap track okay let me do another song veers off in a completely the other direction that doesn't have anything to do with you know the origins of the sound that I'm trying to recapture here and you know I guess I shouldn't be too surprised that this album came out as inconsistent as it did because Snoop Dogg's last wreck he tried to do a little bit of a throwback thing maybe he wasn't being quite as obvious with the concept of doing so but certainly you know just from the sound of some of the tracks on that record and from the look of the title on that record he was clearly trying to you know recall the doggy style days to a degree at least on this new record over here it seems like bringing things back and bringing back that nostalgia it seems like that was the name of the game but Snoop Dogg couldn't stick to his own concept he couldn't stick to his own theme on this album you know you're telling everybody that everything is the same you know never changed you never left when in fact there are tons of tracks on this record where you totally abandon the sound that you're trying to you know kind of rekindle a passion for you know and honestly like a lot of those tracks were he veers off in another direction or kind of lackluster they're kind of mediocre they're not the highlights of the record you know so again I love Snoop Dogg's old sound there are at least a handful of tracks down here where I think he effectively recaptures that and does a great job you know but it's just kind of sad not only to see him sort of fall short of my expectations for him sort of bringing g-funk back a little bit but also to see him falling behind the ball on sort of the the resurgence of his own sound because they're newer artists who have kind of brought back kind of this West Coast sound and you know they're obviously super young you know they maybe grew up with the sound you know but they didn't grow up in the sound they didn't grow up in its heyday or at least when they were they were super super young you know they're coming of age now and they're toying with the sound that their forefathers had sort of you know brought to the forefront and now I feel like Snoop Dogg is sort of late to his own kind of nostalgia party here and with an album that isn't even fully an embrace of the idea that he's putting forward with the cover the title the intro and uh numerous tracks on here you know it only takes about five or six tracks into the track listing for him to almost completely abandon this idea and then just like start delivering yet another inconsistent album you know but those are kind of my thoughts on it also that that intro track I mean honestly you know it's it's it's cool that he wanted to do what he wanted to do with the instrumental but you cannot hear that instrumental and not think of cream I'm sorry you know I'm sorry you just can't you know it's just too disruptive and it's not that you know he's not enough of a God sort of approach it like that you know but it would just be disruptive for any artist to do it doesn't matter who you are but I digress that was not really a part of the part of my you know issues on the issue with the overall album you know if you're a hardcore Snoop Dog fan yet and honestly you don't really need to be a hardcore fan but if you are a hardcore fan you're going to love the out of this record if you're a casual fan there are a lot of things to like about this album chances are you're going to like more tracks on this album than dislike to be completely honest because even if Snoop Dogg doesn't keep consistently on the theme and the idea of never left and you know the idea of sort of recapturing this nostalgia this is one of his most consistent albums and years but you know my problem is that it's not nearly as consistent as it could have been especially considering what seems to be you know the the bold and straightforward communication that this is me bringing it back this is me truly going back to my old sound and it's like nothing's ever changed and if that's really the message you're trying to communicate here you've fallen horribly short I think the record that he did with Dame funk not too long ago that the handful of songs off of that album you know was a more consistent embrace of an old-school sound you know this again is just kind of all over the place you know definitely more consistent than a lot of his material over this decade and even last decade but you know it's just not where I think it could have been and that for me is a letdown because Snoop Dogg is a great and I would love for him to you know come out with another classic get another class under his belt and I feel like never left is just unfortunately like not really there 
JdvrP_nJYYw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is doing a quick review here of the new waves album you're welcome waves if you're not familiar is this long ongoing indie rock punk rock lava rock project fronted by singer-songwriter mr. Nathan Williams this album is out now via his ghost ramp record label and going into this thing I was really looking forward to it because I liked a lot of the singles leading up to this record and I thought the production coming out of these tracks sounded pretty inventive for guitar music or at least a lot of the guitar music that you hear these days super punchy you know super synthetic at points but still like had a visceral aggressive kind of spirit to it and you know certainly I think the album in a way did live up to those expectations I mean this record is loud it's punchy it's blaring there are a lot of elements that sound like you you know they're they're sequenced there are a lot of elements that sound vaguely electronic but it still kind of has like the fire and the explosivity of a rock album however there are some moments here where I do feel like nathan is coming through with some really weak songs the track come to the valley which sounds like a I don't know like a circus music nightmare or something other moments that didn't really stick with me the closing track what else the no shade track there were there were numerous songs on here that the more that I listened to them and the album has a hole - the more that I listened to them the more grating they got and I think it had a lot to do with just like how brittle and trebly and just again how I guess again I guess again the word is brittle how brittle the album sounds between the guitar distortion between how just the drum sound the timbre of the drums and also Nathan's voice - which is very bratty very nasally very whiny in the past I've only been able to take so much of it too can be to be completely honest but I did but I do know there are people who like waves more than me I do know there are people who enjoy his voice more than me much more than me um you know I wouldn't say it's necessarily a you know a strike against the album or anything like that you know maybe it is for me personally but across the board you know for especially you know modern punk rock listeners it's probably not going to be that big of a deal um the vocals again we're a bit of a turn-off the thinness the treble II sort of tone of the album was kind of a turn-off but still you know there are those elements about the way that the guitars and the drums kind of come together the way the whole thing is kind of mixed and produced that I do think is like kind of weird and off kilter and it does make me you know sort of admire the album in a way you know but coming along coming away from it there's not really much in terms of the tracks here that I really truly enjoyed and loved I loved the track million enemies you know I thought the groove on that track you know I thought Nathan's humorous lyrics just kind of his a personality on that track came off really entertaining that song stuck out to me as as being fantastic the title track I thought was really good too um moments where you know Nathan's cynicism and again his sense of humor really ring through in a very entertaining way it's not sort of bratty to the extreme as some of these Punk tracks kind of come off which um again it was kind of a turn-off for me mostly because they kind of they added to that nasally whitey quality about the record that um just is not gelling with me to be completely honest um you know I I did end up being let down by the album in a way but by something that I didn't really expect to be let down by you know I thought the production was going to be interesting I thought it was going to be good I thought it was going to be pushing the envelope a little bit and it was you know but it just kind of turns out that the the sound of the record and the tone of the record and just kind of the lack of songs that I really truly kind of fell in love with really made the album on the whole as a full the experience just kind of a chore and at the end of the day that's really what's going to end up kind of dictating whether or not I come away from an album with a positive experience whether or not I possible positively review an album whether or not I come back to an album you know which I don't really see myself doing in this case you know maybe a couple tracks again title track million enemies which is actually an excellent music video for two I would say but you know the album on the whole not really but you know let me know down in the comments what did you think of those things you loved it hate it why and I will catch you guys in the next video have a good day 
SVdIzy6ck5c,so it seems that this new Lincoln Park album it's not good Lincoln Park the legendary and chart dominating rap rock and alternative rock outfit hailing from Los Angeles California broke through into the industry with a giant wave of popularity and support off of their debut record the Hybrid Theory back in the 2000s love that album love the hell out of that album back in the day totally spoke to my you know teenage teenage me but beyond that there's not really much to the band's discography living things a thousand suns the the the hunting party that really appeals to me to be quite honest however every once in a while I do pop in on a record just out of morbid curiosity because you know I do have a bit of a soft spot what the band continues to do and goddamn was I disappointed in this new record over here and it's funny because I wasn't even really expecting much out of this album but I guess I didn't think I was going to dislike a Linkin Park album quite as much as I did here oh god this album is terrible and I don't even know where to start explaining why I guess I will boil it down to saying that it's a complete and utter betrayal of everything that originally made Lincoln Park appealing to begin with I think rock music really needs to undergo some kind of revolution or evolution right now if it's going to stay viable in the years to come and I think Linkin Park certainly were presented an opportunity to be a part of that evolution but rather than capitalizing on that and deciding to keep the flame alive for the genre that they build their names on they completely just threw it out the window pretty violently in favor of an album that sounds like it's just a bunch of run off from some of the most cliched and overplayed pop and EDM anthems over the past two to four years it's funny when you look at the Billboard Top 100 right now there's not much of anything on there that sounds like what Linkin Park is doing on this record I feel like a Linkin Park came out with this album like two or like maybe four years ago this record came out in 2013 2014 it would be very now in a way even though this record is like kind of overly sentimental and a little cringy it would at least be like very present it would be very cutting edge but now the type of stuff that obviously influenced this record like maybe a little bit of a vici wake me up or like a little bit of Katy Perry roar that type of stuff even that stuff is like off the charts Katy Perry is onto a new sound those EDM anthems that are supposed to be really life-affirming and meaningful and though it's making me cry uh like that stuff is like they've completely wiped off the map in favor of whatever new song quavo has been placed on god it's it's just so synthetic and you know Linkin Park has always had a very clean sound being a new metal band but there's virtually nothing in terms of like a rock spirit on this album this album is very very very reserved as far as like you know the the intensity of the record it's all about the melodramatic tone of the vocals to kind of carry the song because goddamn that there's really nothing interesting about these instrumentals [Music] it's so obviously trying to shoot for a trend that it's only fitting that it's like nearly gone and out the door right now because you're willing to tell me and lie to my face and say that yeah Anthony this is like really a sound that Linkin Park we're super passionate and excited about okay it's it's not like they they gave up their guitars because they felt like this would be like a good business move there or anything no man this is really a sound that spoke to Chester and Mike okay yeah I'm dying this is the closer oh I I hate this track so much this to me is the track that actually most reminds me of V cheese wake me up because it kind of has that like folky quality to it there are a lot of acoustic guitars on this thing and then all of a sudden you know out of the blue that driving kick drum comes in and then it sort of sounds like some kind of awful EDM hootenanny or some BS like that ah I feel like this is the opposite of what a band of Linkin Park's history and caliber should be doing at this point in their career it's like they're trying too hard to appeal to a generation of listeners who it's it's just not going to happen it's never going to happen all you're going to do is alienate and tick off the listeners who have stuck with you from back in the day and believe me at this point you want those people to continue riding with you you don't want to shake that boat you don't want to kick them off the bus because they're going to leave if you come out with another album like this they're going to go I feel like moving forward is Lincoln Park is to sort of in a way redeem themselves with a new album they're going to have to come through with an album come through the change in sound that's reflective of their origins their maturity their history and also the maturity and the growth of the fan base trying to write another hybrid theory is like not really an option and I feel like trying to completely throw that sound out the window just to recreate some top 40 sound that's two to four years old is it really an option either the slang in park elements it's it's not good

7hT759rB8G0,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music card going to a really quick raw review of this new Death Grips EP mix the Crouching Tiger Hidden Gabbar megamix aka steroids [Music] excuse me I'm disgusting Death Grips if you didn't know is an experimental hip hop trio hailing from California and last night out of the blue they dropped this mix sort of seems to be this ongoing trend for artists to release mixes playlists instead of albums or EPS totally fine whatever it's not like it's anything altogether new lots of artists have been doing it on the Bandcamp and soundcloud platforms for years just seems to sort of be bubbling up into the mainstream right now but I digress this new collection of tracks even though it is labeled as a mix and maybe in some spirit it is it's actually a pretty concise set of tracks that lasts about 20 minutes I would say they're about seven songs on this thing that lasts from the start to three minutes and 25 seconds that is the track my whole life I would call it then from 325 to 720 that to me I would title that tracks squeaky because there's a really strange squeaky sound and noise and the instrumental that sort of stuck out to me is being kind of unique then there is the track I guess I would call bald head girl considering that that's kind of a significant part of the refrain in the song that lasts several more minutes like 722 1141 I would say then there is a track that to me probably is a clearest band going in a direction of like a straight hip-hop song that considering that the high hats on the track is little trap influence it's a little trap influenced okay rides verse on the track is pretty sick as well that one goes from 1141 to 411 then the fifth track I would say goes from 4 11 to 16 16 or so I call it one all-out impact considering that's one of the first lyrics that hits and sort of struck me and that track is different than any other because it doesn't go in hip-hop direction and it's not like a couple others on here where the title of this thing the crouching tiger-hidden Gabbar megamix it's not just some cheeky thing it's not just the band you know taking the piss out of hardcore underground styles of electronic music they actually do blatantly like reference on a couple tracks here especially that third track that I mentioned especially the sixth the sixth track on this thing what I feel is the sixth track Gabbar yeah you know very speedy very intense very dense styles of electronic music that emphasize very high BPMS there are a few moments on this EP where they do blatantly reference that stuff and they do you know really kind of work that sound into their repertoire effectively but this fifth track excuse me is a song that felt like they were making like some punked-out psychedelic rock or something to me felt like like is that very much a Zach Hill track track that would have been on like a Zach Hill project from before um you know this whole Death Grips thing whether it be on a you know like a side project or like a you know one-off collaboration or something like that then there is the six track like I said which does seem to pull a little bit more influence from Gabbar as far as like some of the speed with the percussion and the synthesizers just how busy and dense and dizzying some of these are I would call this track like the black body track because that's kind of a very prominent refrain on the song and there were some elements of the percussion on this track that also kind of struck me as being very Knoll of Deep Web ish and that's another thing about this project it seems like they're throwing it back a little bit at least a little bit in terms of the production quality it is kind of lo-fi it is kind of like grimy and messy like Death Grips older stuff used to be their more recent releases in my opinion especially especially bottomless pit' have been super like HD super clear very clean very well and very well put together very muscular and tight this to me is a little bit more chaotic but in a good way you know obviously the intensity the performances are still there and you know there's still incredible amount of detail to what the band is doing on this thing even though it is a little low fie nothing in terms of what you want to hear nothing in terms of like just how intricate some of these productions are some of these tracks are gets lost in that muddiness and then finally the last track would in my opinion last from 1854 to the very end at 22 31 that would be the track that I guess I would call glitch Futura because it is very electronic it is very synthetic it does very much feel like it's a got a bit of a sci-fi tinge to the sound of the sentence at points you know but it is very glitchy and aggressive and sort of abrasive at points as well and those to me would be the 7 tracks on the on the EP rides lyrics I do like what I hear some of it does get swallowed up in the the the production I guess I will say that I will sort of walk back my comment earlier though wouldn't be you know again the first time that it's been sort of difficult to hear and make out everything a ride is saying on a Death Grips album either because of his performance or the sound quality you know it's just sort of something I guess I'm used to a little bit on this new one you know even though in recent releases it's been much clearer because of again that that improve improvement in production quality but still I digress it doesn't take away from the EP or the megamix or whatever you want to call it in my opinion this thing is still really raw it's animalistic and what makes it exciting is that I think it's really opening up new avenues for the band in terms of you know musical style and sound it's really amazing that they're able to kind of keep the original flame and fire and excitement of the trio alive while still continuing to try new things and experiment which is really something that I wanted at this point in the group's career because while I did like bottomless pit' a lot it did feel like a lot of aspects of that record we're kind of death grips slightly improving on things that they had already done on all of their path records to me even though it is little rod is a little rough around the edges a lot of what they're doing on this new megamix seems like just altogether new just I'm really pushing forward and working out you know some new ideas and diving into again different musical styles and successfully working them into their sound - I really like what they're doing here certainly blows away in my opinion like the fashion week instrumentals the interview 2016 AP you know definitely like tons of potential tons of raw energy in this thing and at least a couple of like you know my favorite Death Grips tracks that I've heard in a while you know sort of reference back to the numbers that I've put up over here you know the tracks here that stuck out to me as being the most Gabbar influence definitely hit me as being some of my favorites the fourth track on here the sort of the trap influence track hit me as being one of my favorites as well my whole life I thought was an incredible track you know my whole life my fuckin life like definitely one of the more iconic intros to any Death Grips project so far and you know even on the tracks where I wasn't as into the lyrics or maybe there was really a refrain that really stuck out to me as far as like you know the the Punk track the punky psych track or you know the second track on here still really walked away very impressed with the instrumental so you know I might even just kind of categorize this as one of my favorite EPS of the year just to kind of like you know toward the end of the year not have it be forgotten or anything like that but I'm really loving what the band is doing here really colorful really creative intense as usual pushing the boundary as usual and makes me really excited to hear what they're going to be doing around the corner because with the release of this mega mix they have announced they are working on a new album - and it would be amazing to hear them continue to experiment with these sounds but on a grander scale greater presentation with whatever album they're going to be releasing in the hopefully near future and those are my thoughts on this mega mix let me know what you thought of it in the comments did you love it hate it why and I will catch you guys in the next video forever

pADx9xggSFI,hey everyone anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week as

little bit of record collecting music collecting that's a good place to start they have a lot of information for people who are you know kind of first-time buyers and that sort of thing as well and finally have to shout out our sponsor continually sponsoring this segment I got to thank the good people over at feed bands com easily the most unique music subscription service I have seen on the

things Adult Swim has a new dream pop compilation out that you should check out link below also the good people over at PC music have continued doing their little thing in May where they're just like dropping music every week of dropping new PC music every week and this new Ursula Missa myth Amalia mix that they had that was actually quite quite excellent quite unique and I will leave it that wanted to shout those two things out okay let's get into what I felt were the worst tracks of the week oh god let me get a stretch here let me get a stretch Li let your boy is stretch because this is going to take a lot out of me oh okay good all right all right I got a stretch okay thank you thanks for letting me get that stretch all right worst tracks that I heard this week for one easily the new xxx temptation song Garrett's revenge this is ex attempting to what what sounds like make some really bad lo-fi bedroom spun like alternative rock or something I'm not so sure not not really a fan it's a bit of a mess I'm sure that I'm sure the fanboys will love it though the fanboys will probably love it moving on from there Travis Scott put out three tracks this week three tracks dropped sporadically and you know they're available for streaming for purchase you put them out over Twitter and they're all just like lackluster unwritten like under written b-side cuts like the the best set of all of them was probably green and purple but a man was easily the most demo quality out of all of them like most demo is out of all the songs and a butterfly effect was the most redundant of the three again in my opinion if you do check out any of these songs try green and purple first probably the most hard-hitting and exciting of all the tracks so I'm not promising the moon and the stars with that cut it still is painfully under written kind of seems like Travis is really selling himself short in terms of you know what his songs could potentially be it seems like he is boiling his tracks down especially with his last record in these three new tracks to the most simple basic and uninteresting elements of his style the most trademark elements of his style you know the the the the the cliche ad-libs the sound of the auto-tune on his voice the the sort of quirks of the instrumental styles that he sort of hops on to you know what I love so much about rodeo is that it showed a lot of versatility for Travis and his last record these three new tracks it seems like he's showing less and less and less of it and again distilling his sound down to the most basic elements and just kind of just rolling through one cliche over another at this point he's only slightly more versatile than future in my opinion but you know that's that's a whole nother conversation which will start a giant argument down in the comments so let's not even go there moving on from there Lana Del Rey has a new track out titled Coachella Woodstock in my mind which excuse me oh no nose itchy nose itchy oh okay Lana Del Rey new song out Coachella Woodstock in my mind a lot of music writers have been kind of building this up to be her political statement of sorts it's a trash song not just because the beat is horrifically generic and when will pop stars and pop listeners learn that you don't need an 808 on everything because it just kind of sounds like some generic you know kind of whimsical the strings hanging in the background to kind of set the set of dramatic tone and the kind of bumpin 808 beat that is true placed against it doesn't really fit doesn't really make sense but the most hilarious part about all of it is what Lana is saying on this track and that is essentially that darn it she can't enjoy her Coachella because she's just too worried about the state of the world to worried about the state of the world oh and she worries about the kids at Coachella she worries it out there perhaps and I don't know I it's it's really funny because I feel like in this attempt to write a song that is less self that is less self-centered from from Lana Del Rey's perspective she's only exposed how self-centered she is because uh god damn there are people who are suffering a lot worse right now then all the kids hanging out at Coachella believe me the kids who are going to Coachella were fine eight years ago they've been fighting for the past eight years I think they're going to be fine for the next eight years to tell you the God's honest truth if you want to worry about anybody there are people who are refugees who are starving they're people who are unemployed there are people who are going into debt because they can't afford their crushing health care bills there are a lot of people to worry about and and and that's been the case for a while now so you know if you haven't been worrying about the state of the world please don't start writing songs about how you care so much about it now because then they turn out like this they turn out like this moving on from there grizzly bear has a new song out titled morning sound which to me is easily one of the most underwhelming singles that the band has ever dropped that this track is so nondescript in my opinion to the point where I'm just really not sure what to say about it it's that lackluster it's that uneventful it's that flavorless it's that style deficient there's there's really nothing special about the song in my opinion and in these past couple of tracks that I've heard it seems like the influence of Daniels side of the songwriting is completely gone and I'm not exactly sure what his input on this new record is going to be if there even is going to be any input I don't know I guess we will see when we see moving on from there Muse has a new track titled dig down which is as disappointing as a muse song typically is maybe it's actually less obnoxious and some of the more electronic music influenced tracks that the band is tried to pass off on their past couple of Records but still in it's a muse song and we'll leave it at that and those were the worst tracks of the week let's move on to the tracks that I thought were worth mentioning but were you know kind of man still though you know you might be into them a little bit more than me the band guerrilla toss has come through with a surprisingly just like non abrasive track titled the string game which has a bit of an 80s kind of experimental post-punk II sort of sound to it that I thought was pretty decent looking forward to seeing if maybe this brings them in a new direction that's a little more exciting or a little more I don't know I guess tolerable I've always thought their sound was interesting and exciting and entertaining but only in small bites hopefully maybe whatever they come out with with this new record I like it for the entirety of the album and believe it at that secret circle which is the rap outfit featuring lil ugly Mane Antoine's in there too they have a new track out titled tube socks which is pretty entertaining kind of tongue-in-cheek very funny very grimy very low-key Roger Waters the last refugee very epic ballad from Roger but considering the I guess the the subject matter of the song you'd think that his point would be a bit more direct or his I guess message here would be a bit clearer would um I guess have a bit more impact but it just kind of felt like he was kind of stepping around what he wanted to say at some points on the song he wasn't coming through as strongly just making the statement as he possibly could I feel like his last song day job there was so much bolder statement I feel like this track would have done much better kind of being on that level of directness but instead you know it does kind of have a bit of a erik quality to it at least to me that hopefully you know doesn't continue into the deeper cuts on this new record of his because I feel like this new album I would love to be to the point I would love to be direct I would love for him to just kind of really where his heart where his message where whatever he's saying on his sleeve because those to me are some of the best moments in Pink Floyd you know and and those are also shaping up to be some of the best moments on this forthcoming record but but we'll leave it at that elder has a new track out titled stating off truth if you're into doom metal stoner metal slow heavy psychedelic sounds you're going to want to check this track out tricot melon soda definitely look up this band's new record that has just dropped I believe it's titled three if you're looking for some very colorful creative angular and fun math rock moving on from there little yachty has a new track titled x-men featuring Evander Grimm which is a decent banger very grimy good flows on this track but not much in terms of writing or structure just kind of seems like what could have been a throwaway freestyle some of the lyrics are kind of underwhelming to the lil yachty we all know never been lyricist extraordinaire and we'll leave it at that and get into what I thought were the best tracks of the week let's kick it off with Katy Perry swish-swish with Nicki Minaj yes I love the new Katy Perry single God is it good I love the house beyond this thing I'll have sexy and sensual and just Dancy this track is Nicki Minaj's contribution it is eccentric it is kind of you know it is slightly obnoxious but when does Nicki Minaj at least not a little just like a touch obnoxious it's kind of her it's kind of her personality it's kind of her style it's kind of her tone but I think it works on this track easily the best of all the singles that I've heard or dropped thus far liked it more than the migos track liked it more than chained to the rhythm felt like most cohesive fun catchy and physical song she has released thus far from this album cycle and hoping that you know I hear more like this coming in the future Danger Mouse has a new track outfit set to be on a forthcoming soundtrack to a film that I'm not going to get too deeply into just gonna let you know this new track shtetl chase me features run the jewels features big boy it's a banger it's great give it a listen moving on from there poppy oh god poppy computer boy brand new single I love what poppy is doing with our music right now I'm so happy about it I love how poppy is finally kind of taking some of those elements of her old sound and you notice like generally making quality catchy pop music but throwing in these lyrics about the internet age about the digital age and that is certainly the case on this new track over here I love what she's doing with her vocals on this track - I just love how fun and creative and reflective of the now reflective of internet culture and reflective of kind of that creative bubble that her character exists within I love that her music is representing that is reflecting that so strongly and I'm looking forward to hearing this new album AFER's really excited give the song a listen if you listen to any song on this list give this on a listen Lou the human new track that I'm shouting out in this segment loved Lou the humans last big single this new one is titled McLemore just as grimy as the last single just as nasty music video kind of the same in terms of tone and visual quality and kind of the you know whole 1 shot and we're walking along with Lou you know he's got a bit of a gimmick going right now but I think his lyrics I think is grimy tone I think his personality come out great on this track so I'm kind of looking forward to hearing more of that and hopefully hearing more depth to that in the future I would hate for him to keep coming out with songs like this over and over and over over the course of his music career I think there could potentially be more to what he's doing I'm just kind of waiting to hear that but so far these two singles that I've heard so far from Lou are sounding great and finally Vince staples big fish brand new single slick sexy banger smooth west coast tune I love Vince's flow on this track the hook is OK the beat is great the music video is fantastic you stuck on a sinking ship and and I think it's one of his better single certainly I like it more than a lot of the tracks off of his latest EP and I'm just kind of looking forward to seeing what this new album of his is going to be shaping up like and that's going to be it those are all the songs that I wanted to recommend to you guys those are the best tracks of the week the mat tracks the worst tracks remember down there in the description the amazon link the turntable lab link and hit up that V band comm slash needle drop to get that free trial of that monthly music subscription service try out that website try out that platform get

2w4wi19KBEE,hi everyone food poisoning here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of new b.o.b album ether [Music] hey what's up ed okay yeah but what's going on yeah I mean at the end of the day the sounds really just not for me b.o.b is sounding corny er than ever on this record painfully out of touch too like he seriously thinks that he and this album are way deeper than it actually is way way way deeper than it actually is which is probably I probably get that strongest on this album than any other album he's put out thus far but you know what can I say this is a probably feeling like a zero because that's the shape that the earth actually is or maybe one because that's the flattest shape or maybe a two or maybe three maybe a four it's it's it's a b.o.b album ah position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and cry cry cry down in the comments it's it's okay we can all have a cry videos next to my head you should check out subscribe to the channel official website to forever 
z5BqausZu0E,hey hey hey the hey Hanna you're the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the brand new forest swords album compassion forests words of the musical pseudonym mr. Matthew Barnes this is his second full-length album under the name following up his surprisingly popular engravings in 2013 I say surprisingly popular because it's rare that you have a new face sort of explode out of the experimental or ambient electronic music scene especially since it took him a few years to follow up the EP to sort of put his name on the map in the first place and on this latest record over here he's still offering a plenty of stimulating ideas what's a sophomore slump this LP is filled with a brim with all these dramatic textured meditative and primal electronic music pieces that fuse acoustics with electronics they really march to the beat of their own drum they don't seem to stick directly to any ongoing trends right now happening in electronic music or beat music ambient music you can clearly hear the DNA of those things as well as like IDM running through this thing but Matthew has blended all of that and more with a comprehensive approach to sound craft which is made for a pretty dynamic and beautiful album not to mention the whole thing rounds out at about 45 minutes and this thing is just ten tracks long so even though Matthews approach to musical style and sound may be a little experimental the way he builds these songs out there pretty direct I'm a song war it we're hit toward the beginning of the track with all these varied roni epic what sounds like porn samples or maybe a horn synth patch all I know is they sound great and they grow more and more intense as the track progresses incorporating the cycling tinny kind of brittle sound effects that kind of have a rhythmic quality to them I like them a lot these panoramic chorus samples come in and make the track feel even more grand this kind of a dystopian or apocalyptic tone to the instrumental reminds me a little bit of Tim Hecker except for the fact that these heavy tribal rhythms come into the track which kind of ends up being a bit of a calling card or Matthew on this album these are really kind of a staple for the record I also like the quiet before the storm effect in the last third of the track there's a nice quiet somber interlude right before the song gives us a big finish I feel a similar sonic recipe on the song the highest flood right right afterwards there's another epic chorus line here there are some more cerebral rhythms but this track is played out with a bit of a like some glitchy piano samples they're kind of disorienting and sporadic but the core Alliance smooths things out that there's just so many things to say about this track and other tracks too to the point where I feel like I can't talk about all of it there's just so much detail here I love how again these piano samples are disorienting but the Coraline kind of has this effect where it smoothes that out and this track and compare some of the intro is way more direct the track panic is equal parts trippy tribal epic and psychedelic featuring all these twinkling pieces of metallic percussion these moaning elongated melodies that sound like they're coming from a string or a reed instrument I can't quite tell they're they're kind of dirtied up worked in a way where it's hard to tell what the source material is is that original is it from somewhere else I really don't know but that's a part of the magic of this record there is kind of a bit of a how do you do it factor to these compositions and there's something about the relaxing smooth simp Keys along with the kind of very busy rhythms on the track arms out that reminds me of Fever Ray's album I can totally see Karen singing over this instrumental and had it not been for the male vocal samples that are very beautiful all over the track now the final three tracks on this thing I think make for a very strong finish the track shook sugar sugar rival is a very eerie interlude complete with this haunting moaning lead melody that sounds like if a horn could cry and the song raw language is probably the closest the album comes to either delivering a banger or just being directly aggressive there are all sorts of driving handclaps on this thing very decisive string melodies and a fat round bass line that I love there are numerous phases to the track too and it gets especially powerful as the densely layered vocal passages which are deliciously chopped up and sampled fly-in which again is one of many vocal passages many choral vocal passages on the album that feel like they have kind of a tribal tone to them or like they're they're almost coming from a record of chants or something but this one is easily the best and grandest of them all Matthew really saved the best for last on this thing plus the saxophone interlude on this track not expected in nice touch the song knife-edge is a beautifully strange piano piece that I think finishes the album off really well it's a nice lighter touch on the album without falling prey to so many of the usual clichés that typically come into play whenever an artist takes a more subtle approach with the final track on an album now I do have a few reservations about this record as experimental and I think as unique as Matthew's sound is on this album the more I listen to it the more apparent it became there there was really a formula to how he sort of built out the rhythms the vocal samples the sense what synth patches he chose on this album given just how colorful and creative what he brought to the table was on this record I think he really could have done just a bit more to add a touch extra a variety to the album just to give the the record just a bit more depth and breadth and while I don't mind an intra specially on an album of this style the song border margin barrier just felt like an entry that went on way too long or maybe a track that wasn't fully fleshed out or complete and vandalism was one of the few moments on the album where I felt kind of disappointed by the structure of a track suddenly the rhythms and and much of what was making the song interesting from the introduction sort of breaks away for this long gated horn interlude that I think really kills the momentum of the track doesn't really feel like as a strong sense of direction and the song never really recovers from this point in my opinion regardless I still thought this is a very great and very solid record a lot of interesting elements again of IDM and ambient music of dub again so many things going into the recipe of this record especially love Matthew's approach to sampling on this thing the the sequencing of the rhythms the the synths on this thing I'm just enamored with so many elements of this record the sound of this thing was great and it's easily going to be one of my favorite electronic releases of the year I'm feeling a light decent eight transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry for swords compassion check the album out other videos next to my head I think you should check

eGYRq0ywrq8,what planet am i on I feel like I I feel like I'm out of touch oh it's good eating me you're gonna like it don't worry about it it's good you like this too oh you're thinking about it too much just let the music take you baby and get a goal we came oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand new Paramore album after lasker it just occurred to me just now that that rhymed Paramore ever-popular pop punk and power pop outfit who have been releasing albums for over 10 years now which is kind of crazy to think I've always considered them to be a very very young band or at least a band that has a very young fan base most likely to snag up Warped Tour tickets the minute they go on sale so I personally don't really feel weird at all saying that I've never really been a fan of the band never really got that into their music really because I'm not really in paramours demographic you know whether they're consciously writing music for the group of people who their music appeals to or not so as a result I've always kind of taken their existence for granted until I saw the new single that they released for this album hard times on the fueled by ramen YouTube channel morbid curiosity got the best of me and I figured hey why the hell not let's give it a shot and I'm really glad I did I will admit maybe I was slow to admit how much I liked the song when I first heard it but god damn hard times is a good track in this song and this new album is marking a musical sea change and potentially a new era for Paramore the sound of this song and generally the album here is kind of like disco infused dance pop with a bit of an indie twist to it it's nothing entirely new there have been loads of bands that have come and gone in the 2000s that had a very similar sound but what Paramore presents here is not simply just a rehash of what happened about 10 years or so ago because it seems like they're pulling a little bit more from a place of experience on these tracks not only do I get a bit of an indie pop or an indie tronic vibe on some of these cuts but also as I said Disko new wave synth pop I think the blondie fans will catch you know some risks of that in the mix there's even a touch of talking heads on occasion tracks like pool remind me of a very sleek modern beautiful pop production that I enjoyed so much on carly Rae Jepsen's emotion and the kind of subtle ska reggae influences that turn up on the track caught in the middle a song that I love in the track listing here one of the best hooks on the entire record sounds like I'm listening to no Doubt's first album to a degree I would say there's even a kind of confessional emo vibe coming out of some of the lyrics on this thing which I think ramps up all the way to 11 on the song no friend which is a song that features from beginning to end the lead singer of the band me without you Aaron Weiss a track that I admire for the risk it tried to take I think it could have turned out so much better than it actually did but Aaron's vocals are mixed in such a muddy fashion they are so low volume wise in the mix I could barely make out anything he's saying I'm a song and Aaron is the type of singer the type of lyricist to whose words you want to hear so I just feel like I'm hearing this obscured ramble over this kind of angular semi copy semi post hardcore rock music that I really I rather that it not be on the album at all you know if the band wasn't going to do it to the best that they could have if the band wasn't going to give it the production that it needed to sound great it's kind of weird that this track turns up toward the very end of the album as well I'm not really a big fan of The Closer either it's one of the few moments on the record where the lyrics really do hit me in a somewhat melodramatic way as Haley is singing about her significant others silence being the most violent singing about how the cold-shoulder in a relationship can be one of the meanest and most black-hearted things you can do to someone but beyond this track I actually enjoy quite a few of the lyrical themes on this record the song idol worship is all about being put on a pedestal and sort of the pressure that comes along with that not being able to fail not being allowed to make mistake and hailey sort of struggles sort of demands and cries out for just the ability to be a flawed human being the song fake happy is obviously about putting a smile on things when you really don't feel like smiling and what's also great about this song is not only does it talk about Hailey's personal feelings on this matter but she kind of called this out as being a more common occurrence than most people would probably admit the song forgiveness is obviously about being able to forgive other people give other people another chance but reminds the listener that forgetting is not necessarily for getting it's not erasing the past it's not allowing horrible things to happen to yourself over and over and over it's not allowing yourself to be used or abused again and again and again of course there are songs on this record that are about love and relationships but there are quite a few tracks here that try to push beyond that or if they do delve into those topics they add an interesting twist or dynamic into the mix like on rose-colored boy where hailey is singing about sort of the struggle of being cheered up by another person when you yourself have kind of a negative or pessimistic attitude now while I do enjoy a lot of the lyrics on this thing it's really the production and the instrumentation that totally sells it the funky and irresistible hard times I mean as far as the grooves on this thing it's incredible be very sweet and sugary angular lead guitars on this thing but I do love them bass lines great the chorus grooves so hard I love the weird rhythmic quirks that are kind of placed throughout the song to Kaylie's vocals on this track are particularly weird and expressive at points I love the layers of kind of dark heavy background vocals that pop up periodically throughout the song it's a near-perfect pop banger rose-coloured boy instrumentally sonically I enjoy for a lot of the same reasons though this song feels a bit sleeker has a bit more of a synth pop influence there's a tad more urgency and tension in the verses on the song told-you-so which transitions gracefully into this shimmering bright beautiful hook with a lot of atmosphere once the band transitions back into the verse things get groovy again and the verses are perfectly punctuated on this track with all sorts of synths and rhythm guitars add those with the percussion on this track it's just hard for me not to want to move this song and the song forgiveness stays compelling throughout despite the fact that the band is taking a more subtle approach on this track didn't really expect going into this album that the low-key cuts would be just as enjoyable as the tracks that are really kind of running on all cylinders however we do have the acoustic and string back 26 on this album which I don't really mind it as a ballad I don't mind the sound of the song but there's very little about this track that matches the aesthetic of the album so far the kind of sad somewhat whimsical baroque pop tone of the song just sticks out like a sore thumb and doesn't add much to the flow of the record especially after a song like fake happy the second half of the record is okay it definitely pales in comparison to the first there are a handful of great tracks here but there are songs that pale in comparison to others as I said earlier that no friend track is just a no-go for me the ending is kind of weak and I feel like at this point in the album Paramore stops pushing this new wave inspired disco inspired since pop inspired sound forward they're not really continuing to bring up new sounds at this point on the album at least ones that are panning out successfully it's really the band continuing to deliver good courses and interesting lyrical themes that keeps the second half of the record alive but despite those critiques I think this is a very good album and is easily my favorite Paramore album yet however again as I said earlier I've never really been a fan of the band up until this point I would hate to hear that fans of the band's original sound the band's older sound are kind of disappointed by this record not into this record I do feel like there are a lot of elements of Hailey's lyrics and personality this that's still shine through on this record you know if you're a fan of that if you come to pair more albums for that I don't think you're going to miss out on this album it's just a different dance ear poppier sleeker more synthetic sound with some incredible grooves and it's impressive the band was able to make the transition they did on this album with relatively no hitches I'm feeling a decent of strong 7 on this album transition have you given the sound than the listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry if you're angry just leave an angry in the comments other videos and stuff next to my

A8ObXvF_vhg,come on camera hi everyone company on Panem here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new self-titled Harry Styles album it's it's cell title Harry Styles is a singer-songwriter known for his tenure in the international singing sensation known as one direction whose lifespan was cut kind of short with the departure of member Zayn Malik back in 2015 now the group is not officially broken up at this point I understand that they're on hiatus for the moment but they might as well be broken up because how can they continue without saying he was the tall dark mysterious sexy one something I could rant about for hours believe me now nearly every member of the group is splintering off to do a little bit of solo music and there's no real news of a One Direction album coming out of the works any time soon not surprising Zayn was the first one to come out with a solo record which was shooting first sleek and spacious and kind of Moody very sexy somewhat edgy but ultimately it just ended up being a very flaccid very humdrum debut record meanwhile Niall Horan has been trying to build himself up is like this folk pop acoustic ballad bro I don't know when or if an album is coming out from him all I know is that his singles especially his latest one has been gaining that much traction outside of some initial interest because hey I'm I'm embarking on some solo music stuff guys now it's Harry Styles turn to drop a solo record which he created an instant demand for with the release of the incredible and hard-hitting an epic sign of the time single which was this grand piece of piano rock with like subtle glam rock undertones to it the gorgeous layers of instrumentation on this thing the somewhat serious tone to the lyrics that had some palpable anguish to it over the current social strife the modern world finds itself in right now the lyrics were a little repetitive and I do think that there was a bit of a lack of detail to them considering the the serious tone of the song but overall I really loved the track and for the most part I liked the very acoustic and sweet ballad sweet creature it was a little safe but the gently finger guitar chords and very passionate vocals on this track were more than enough to win me over going into this album I had no reason not to look forward to this thing no reason not to expect it to be good Harry seemed to be living up to every expectation that I would have for a singer-songwriter and it seemed like he was bringing a more mature sound than his fellow One Direction members who were releasing solo music and even though going into this record I was looking forward to hearing a more mature sound hearing a more mature direction maybe Harry went too mature on this one meaning there's not really anything about the songs on this album in my opinion that sound young and risky and exciting meaning Harry is a musician in his 20s and this is his first album and yet he already sounds like he's over the hill especially when the dad rock songs on this record come out to play in the second half the song only angel the song Kiwi tracks that are loaded with all these hard rock riffs over which Harry howls away like the the lead singer of a band who plays for beer tickets every weekend at the local pub really how is this any better if like jet came out tomorrow with a new single it was like hey guys we still want you to be our girl I can appreciate that maybe Harry is the old soul of one direction but he just kind of buffet picks his way through a bunch of sounds from the 60s and the 70s on this record and presents them with a really safe bland radio-friendly sound the song to ghosts has a little bit of a country twang to it but that twang is so faint it's so bland it makes John Mayer's country stuff sound like I'm listening to some Merle Haggard the vocal melody on this thing is kind of dime-a-dozen I do like the lyrical twist in the song about how the track is singing about two people who just kind of feel like ghosts of their former selves who no longer have a heartbeat it's one of the few moments on the record where the lyrics actually strike me as likable and endearing though I do like the lyrics on the track meet me in the hallway but for a totally different reason they're very dark they're very eerie maybe the edgiest on the entire record it's a very strange introduction to the entire album very easygoing track with a bit of a 60s psych pop vibe to it I like the watery kind of warped guitars and bass on this cut and the lyrics depict Harry almost like going through some kind of hard drug addiction he's meeting this person in the hallway it's almost framed as if he's going to be buying drugs but the track is obviously about love it's obviously about a relationship and because this relationship this love has has left him it's departed him he's kind of like looking for a thick's I do like the track even though the ending really trails off it's one of a few moments on this record where I feel like Harry really fails to seal the deal on a good finish for a quality track and as long as I'm praising songs on this record I do want to give a shout out to the track Carolina which has this really cool laid-back sexy swagger to it there's something about the instrumental here that almost reminds me of like Booker T and the MGS also the way the instrumentation transitions suddenly on the chorus and starts just really pushing starts giving a lot of shove a lot of oomph and those little background vocals they add so much to the tension of the instrumentation at this point I think this track is so well produced it sounds amazing so much so that I'm not really all that turned off by the ridiculous refrain that Harry brings on this track like she's a good girl oh she's a good girl III would not let anyone who I know in person catch me enjoying that but with the songs I like on this record I feel like I'm constantly having to squint at them to make out and sort of see what Harry was trying to do with them or just force myself to be a little more excited for them than I actually should be but you know my pop Tim ISM can only go so far because there are some tracks on this record that again like the dad rock songs I think are just true-blue awful the song ever since New York this thing is a gutless Moody jangly piece of pop rock with a horribly cliched chorus the prominent Tom's all over the verse on this track don't really make much sense to me and the tell me something I don't already know Coris gets really stale really fast the song is just painfully under written as is the song woman which the only thing I like about this track is the instrumental but everything Harry brings to the track vocally and lyrically it's just like oh it's cool that Harry went for a somewhat glammy Elton John knockoff with this track but there's this weird uh that kicks off like tour the beginning of every bar or every other bar on this track that that makes me feel like I'm about to hear a really bad Drake verse pop in any moment literally it sounds like some rappers looking for that moment looking for that in where you can just jump on and and just kick a verse and the hook on this thing it's literally woman woman woman woman how long did it take them to come up with this hook cause it's awful and it's not even that the hook is underwritten when I look at the lyrics of the entire song I'm kind of reminded of some of the lyrics off of the last Zane record not that I think that the the the writing style is exactly similar but the the lack of meaningful and interesting and descriptive lyrics is is kind of the same not to mention the stomach-churning Netflix mentioned at the very beginning of this song to and from the dining table which is this very low-key subtle acoustic cut very subtle acoustic cut that ends the entire album off the vocals are literally like a volume notch above a whisper there's something kind of Elliott Smith ish about the track how intimate the song feels but Harry isn't really pulling us in close on this song as a means of telling us anything feeling uncool because you woke up alone got drunk before noon and jerked off isn't exactly hitting rock bottom if you think that's a hard time you've never had a hard time the even my phone misses your call line is kind of cute but just like Harry once again didn't commit to a solid ending on this track there's nothing really on this song that's worth committing to memory which is kind of the case for much of this album honestly I like some of the vintage instrumental pallets that Harry brings to the table on this record overall I think the production sounds great but the lyrical shortcomings that I was of catching whiffs of on sign of the times really do hurt I mean to the point of like cutting a jugular because some of these tracks just bleed potential in every direction but Harry doesn't really effectively use word play or vivid descriptions or colorful language or any sense of danger or personality in his words to kind of stitch these songs together into something personal or powerful or meaningful Harry played a way safer than I thought he was going to on this album and now that I've heard it I don't know why I expected anything else this record really falls apart in the second half - um I don't know if there's anything else I can say about this record honestly I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you're angry

let's get into the tracks okay worst tracks of the week we got to kick things off with as usual rip that band-aid off do the worst of the worst first and got to kick it off by getting a shout out to my girl Miley Cyrus with the song truly honestly it's not the worst Miley Cyrus song I've ever heard mostly I've thrown the song in here because god damn has she done a 180 from dead pets to this now she's looking like just just a not just like a normal country girl like what what happened what happened man it's almost as if it's almost as if everybody who over the past few years was saying oh she's so cool she's so authentic she's so unique it's almost as if everybody who was saying that through the whole bangers era was wrong because it was all just an act and it was all just to get people's attention and it was all just a PR ploy what remember what someone in the music industry in in the mainstream in the papa sphere doing something to manipulate people's emotions and get attention and make money well I can't I can't believe it I'm such a pop to missed that I trust everything in anything that the industry throws at me as authentic that's how much of a moron I am um not not to say that this is necessarily Miley's a natural state of being but consider the whole I can't be tamed the era of Miley Cyrus that was Miley Cyrus trying to be edgy and then the trap thing happened and I'm sure her and her team or whoever the hell she works with decided hey let's jump on this and do something super freaky sexy quirky and your face lewd and crude and there you have it there you have Miley Cyrus just sort of grabbing the attention of America through those couple of years and of course you know there's only so long you could do it before it's just like okay you know we've seen you twerking on a giant fire hydrant that it is is spurting out pink goo or something but whatever the hell she does when she's playing lives however the live show does look insane you know does look like a lot of interesting you know creativity visually at least goes into that live show so I will say that I will give my leave that but the music has been trash especially dead pets and now for her to kind of come back to this regular ol sorry you know sunny rock music with a little bit of a country twang to it and you know a lot of West Coast I'm just chilling just a chill person survives to it it's kind of annoying she really cashed into that whole trap hip hop trend man she really cashed in hard she cashed in hard make that money and it's funny because like everybody who was in hip-hop who was endorsing her just kind of left holding the bag meanwhile like I said the previous week Katy Perry now switched and it seems like she's sort of doing what Miley used to do which is kind of weird kind of awkward like you know when you go to a party and you catch somebody in an outfit that you wore last week it's kind of awkward it's kind of weird but anyway let's move on Fetty WAP of the new track hey this track is terrible Fetty WAP I could see why he sort of you know was leaning mostly on the whole singing thing when he initially broke because he was trying to write more of the same hit over and over now it seems like he's trying to lean a little bit more on his rapping and it's just really generic and what sort of convinced him to title the song a and because that's sort of technically the hook of the song but it's such an awful hook like dude you really got to go back to the drawing board on this one and write a chorus if anyone's going to remember this song psy has a new track out title I love it I found it annoying within the first 30 seconds and wanted to end my life Tim Heidecker has a new track out titled 4chan which of course is about a lot of the ugly racist troll loser people who come off the pole board but he's kind of like in a grand stereotypical you know brush of his artistic vision here has painted the entire board see here's the fact of the matter the the video board the video and television and movie boards they're probably enjoy Tim's work the poll board is most primarily what Tim is probably dealing with in terms of like when he's talking about Oh people are trolling me and the rest of the board doesn't know who you are and probably doesn't give a about anything that you do Tim so for you to sort of paint this online community as like everybody is a fat racist loser it's really petty you know like for you to go through all of this effort just because you know some people are trolling you and your friends online a little bit it's really petty you know and it's really annoying yeah I like I like that Marlow go track you wrote that was pretty funny you know in some of your other tracks that they do strike me is kind of boring but this song was really petty that's that's really all I got to say about it and the new Higham song right now surprisingly I've liked almost everything that I've heard from this forthcoming I am song breakfast excuse me record and this track over here there was like a weird studio session cut a bit of a live performance of this song that was released before the official studio version which it seemed like a very patient slow passionate ballad that I really liked and this studio version is awful it's like I'm listening to a deconstructed version of that studio Mormons and there's all these weird gimmicky noises and sound effects surrounding the song that I mean really impact the progression and the intensity of the performance and it just seems like disconnected it just seems like a lot of weird bells and whistles sort of color the background to keep people from getting bored because honestly I don't find this particular take of this ballad to be all that exciting seem like that session take was way more I guess had more conviction to it was more engaging but um this weird again deconstructed version with all the random noises that don't really add anything to the song anything that the track really is not doing anything for me and that's going to do it for the worst tracks of the week let's move on to the track so they thought were men but the left but we're certainly worth mentioning check out my goddamn new order shared everybody damn yeah that's a nice shirt but moving on from there Danny Brown has a track on what seems like this new soundtrack to this HBO series that there was a track I think from last week that featured nas as I said this new one Danny Brown really wild performance from Danny on this one sort of sounds like a track that could have been from the the old era except a little bit crazier on the vocal and the chorus side not a bad track at all pretty good track this band which blood doomed in the realm of the dead this is some nasty grimy horrid bloody filthy disgusting death metal I wouldn't say it's all that unique you know maybe it's a shade or two cleaner than like that pissed grave album I reviewed not too long ago which you know the death metal fans you remember that pissed grave record it like some parts of it were awful but some parts of it were filthy amazing I should call your return to that album few shades clean than that piss grave record but but for people who like their death metal blood caked and old school you're going to dig on this contries I saw says pay and a new track out over here bit of an 80s vibe too of course vintage groove smooth smooth synth tones all over this thing from the base to the treble really pretty really I guess I want to say hypnotic and uh almost almost utopian in how smooth and gorgeous it is it actually kinda has me semi excited for this new record I'm going to say that I'll leave it at that the National has a new track out the system only dreams in total darkness I thought the instrumentation on this track was weight livelier well maybe not way livelier slightly livelier and then what is usually on a national song which I thought was great a good change of pace but of course the vocals still leave a lot to be desired because they are very drab they are very almost monotone and you know it's it's a national song I've never been that crazy about the band I mean I like some of the earlier work but never been a huge fan of the band this song continues to exemplify why but you know those those slight instrumental tweaks that they made to this track has made you know the drums the guitars everything a little bit more tangible and you know making me feel like whoa it's not just like a soupy moody mess but moving on from there Reggie Snow has a new track out that I wanted to shout out purple Tuesday for you shoot featuring Joey badass and Jesse Boykins not a bad song at all kind of standard jazz wrap affair but a good single Fleet Foxes new track fool's errand you know I really wanted to love this song I really want to be excited for this new Fleet Foxes album but this song has me a little less so because I feel like there's just not a whole lot of I guess excitement in terms of the progression of this track I think the crescendo around the middle point that the dann builds up to is really kind of flaccid it really falls flat on its face makes it almost feel like everything the song progressed up to till that point was almost like for naught because the song is definitely not as I guess uh the word I want to say is um meticulously layered and to the point you know where the crescendos and everything the build ups feel like exhilarating like they did on helplessness blues and their debut - you know I I like their debut not as crazy about it as helplessness blues but it kind of seems like something's a little bit off in terms of the instrumental arrangement much else much of everything else about the track though seems fine I'm open though to maybe hearing the track more once the album is out and then it grows on me a little bit then but up up to this point you know after giving the song few listens kind of like it's not hitting me quite as hard as I would have liked it to but moving on from there Calvin Harris has a new track out featuring Khalid in future and this is actually the first track off of this forthcoming record that I thought was not that bad you know even features contribution was pretty decent and I think it mostly has to do with the lead vocal melody that's mostly sung by Khalid on the track sounds a lot like something Frank Ocean would do it's very Frank Ocean II but it's not a bad tune at all but moving on we're going to get into what I felt was the the were the best tracks of the week here and then close this segment out let's go Maya falak Maya Falak is an artist on the terrible Records label please don't make a bad joke about that because they are a good label and this new song offers from her forthcoming album is titled trouble adjusting and it has a bit of a 90s angsty rock vibe to it but God is there so much guts to her performance on this track I just love it I'm just in love with her performance in love with her voice I love what the guitars are doing on this track - again it's just got a lot of guts and blood all over the mix just so much conviction on this track I just couldn't say no to it moving on from there Roger Waters deja vu oh man considering how so so the last Pink Floyd album was and you know people were telling me you gotta hear this new Roger Waters you got here the rounder waters you know I figured it was just the dad rockers who were making a big deal of a track that wasn't really that good and that there really wasn't much to it but this song is fantastic this is a fantastic goddamn song his performance on this track his vocal performance you know at first it's so he really plays it down but then as the instrumentation grows he saw you know his voice cracks he's going a little crazier the emotion really intensifies on this cut it's actually amazing you know sort of the how much waters kind of bears himself on this track you know there are a lot of singers his age that play a little more reserved because they don't want you know those flaws those blemishes has shown their voice he puts it all out there and I think as a result the song feels so much more human so much more relatable so much more powerful you know instrumentally it's super impressive super well arranged especially you know the extra instrumentation you know melodically it's really impressive as well I'm just impressed with every facet of this song it's easily going to be one of the best singles of the year in my opinion lovely track very amazing track actually very excited for this forthcoming record we have a new single over here from rich Chicka keys ape and xxx tentation gospel banger of the week everybody banger of the week I don't know what else you could say about a track that features these three how can it not be the banger of the week the beat goes hard ex goes hard chigga keith ape and every every facet of this track super impressed with it goes hard a couple more Shabazz Palaces 30 clip extension love the lyrics on this track it is kind of another wonky very low-key should as Palaces strange Spacey instrumental don't expect too much from the instrumental you know it is so low-key that it does feel somewhat underwhelming but I do love the lyrics on this track because it does kind of come through with that usual you know cows ear Lazzaro I'm going to dissect you know how people are consuming most mainstream rappers and rap music and sort of point out the the weird gender dynamic and the freaking you know crazy nonsensical gangster isms and the violence and the this and the that and just makes them very you know funny witty tongue-in-cheek sobs tongue-in-cheek observations about all of it and apparently she has palaces they're releasing two records this year it's like a bit of a double album affair it's going to be dropping very which I didn't know originally when they dropped the track a week or two weeks ago I thought it was going to be one record and now I hear it's going to be two records so I don't know really excited to kind of hear this ambitious move from palace ear and company to hear a you know two projects worth of music on such a short amount of time very again over the top bleachers everybody lost somebody surprise I like this track as much as I did like a lot of bleachers tracks from the previous record you know very strong New Wave vibe coming from the instrumentation coming from the songwriting but I love the chorus on this thing love the vocal melody you know so many quality poppy super catchy characteristics about this track actually kind of looking forward to the new record and we're going to finish it off with my boy Billy woods who has a new record coming out very soon ground hogs day this track and I'm imagining more tracks from this forthcoming record produced by blockhead okay for the hip hop snobs out there block edy the blockhead producing for Billy woods Underground master rapper extraordinaire with a very unique crazy esoteric lyric and I want to say a semi spoken word rant rap style that hits me hard every time I hear it and that's also you know the case on this new track over here and those are going to be my best immersed tracks of the week thank you very much for watching everybody remember that all those songs good and bad have been linked down there in the description for your curiosity whether it be hey I want to hear those best tracks or you know you got a little morbid curiosity one here they've been Miley Cyrus that's fine too I'm not going to judge you okay we also have down there again that Amazon Associates link turntable lab link the link for the slip mats and remember you get a stick or two if you order a signed and the good people over at feed bands comm continue to sponsor this segment hit up their website sign up to that service support them because again they are one of the most unique vinyl and music subscription services I have seen out there on the internet today okay that crowdsourcing that power of the crowdsourcing between getting the music get people involved voting up the song's getting vinyl printed sending it out it's it's unique it's different and we're going to leave it at that that's it for this segment guys thank you very much for watching you're the best I'll catch you in the next video and tell me what tell me in the console you think of my new order shirt tell me in them comments love you bye bye 
GFynn8SlDUo,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here you know who it is doing a another quick review this time of the new at the drive-in album you know the band legendary post hardcore and hardcore punk outfit with elements of progressive rock in there as well of course Omar and Cedric would go on to do the Mars Volta and a load of different side projects and solo projects if you're a fan you know the whole story now given that this is their comeback record it's been well well well well well over a decade since the band released their last album and considering that that record is probably their best without argument their most critically acclaimed their most widely acclaimed album stakes on this new record are high you know you have a time factor you got that last album was the the greatest album factor and it's it's not looking too good you know you already know that I think that that comeback albums can be really hit or miss and this in my opinion is one of the instances where it is a miss but it's kind of just subtleness you know if you're a fan and you listen to this record with your fan visors on shouldn't shouldn't really be a problem you know shouldn't really have an issue getting through this album and relatively enjoying it but you know what honestly it's not the same and I personally was hoping that going into this record the band would do their best Omar and Cedric would do their best to bring back at least a little bit the amazing footprint that the band left us with their older music but on this new record over here I feel like the incredible intensity of the band's past records is gone I feel like the unique approach to writing riffs and grooves occasionally which was very angular is kind of gone and I feel like there's not so much on this album in terms of dynamics to it is a little bit of a thrash and bash fest so I'm not saying that this is the most extreme at the drive-in album thus far not saying that at all what I'm saying is that I feel like the structures are a little bit more plain and basic on this record this doesn't so much feel like a post-hardcore album with undertones of progressive rock sort of mixed in there this to me feels more like an alternative rock album with a punk edge honestly which as conceptually doesn't sound like the worst thing in the world but it does lead to a lack of surprises I think a lack of the lack of excitement it actually sounds more like that anti-mask album that Omar and Cedric dropped a few years back that does any record in at the drive-ins back catalogue which to me and I don't think that's a very good thing you know I was hoping that again the band would bring their sound back with a vengeance or you know I'm not against evolution either you know or bring some kind of radical change that would be equally exciting but instead I feel like we're just kind of getting some paler lesser than take or version of what the band has delivered to us in the past you know I don't really care for hearing this alt rock sound on a on a NAPA driving record and there are moments where the choruses and the risks have this weirdly macho vibe to them which previously I've never really gotten off the band's music before it seems almost like there seems almost like they're flirting with rock a little bit on this record uh which again for me was kind of like a turn-off while I was listening to it I don't really know what to say as far as the you know like the production on the album or anything I guess it's fine you know I don't really think the recording or the mixing of the album is terrible it's not the worst thing in the world you know really it's just that the band's style and approach to writing these songs has fallen so short in my eyes you know again there's not a whole lot of intricacy here in my opinion it seems very basic in comparison with past at the drive-in albums and you know even if it isn't as rough as their debut for example in terms of the sound yeah it's it just didn't really do too much for me honestly I wish it did I did like you know at least a couple of the singles leading into the record but now that I kind of had a chance to listen to the entire album just the the lack of interesting and creative and I guess uh I guess novel ideas has sort of hit me and it's just sort of striking it like why why would you why not come out with another anti-mask record if this is the sound if this is the style you were going to go for you know because to me that that's that's really all you're doing you know you're really just kind of giving us an anti mask record and just naming it have to drive in the to me Omar and Cedric have not written or performed on the level that to me would say okay this is worthy of a comeback this is worthy of this is this is them bringing the band back from the dead like without question this to me again it just kind of feels like another offshoot another side project another something else does not feel like an act to drive and record to me you know only maybe in the sense that you know obviously Omar's playing style is there Cedric singing style is there that obviously is a consistent element that you can compare to the band older records but I feel like those subtle nuances of the way that they used to write their guitar passages the way they used to structure their songs it's just kind of gone and that has always been a big part of the appeal for at the drive-in for me and I'm sure a lot of other people as well so I don't know huh but what are you thinking about this album did you let it hit it why let me do it out and let me know down in the comments sorry and I will catch you guys in the next video forever [Applause] 
pgqm2QdIFXs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd doing a quick raw iPhone review just you know getting some albums out of the way that I wanted to talk about to you guys and make sure I got some thoughts out on in this new Chris Stapleton album I wanted to cover this week didn't want this record too so through the cracks over here the record is from a room volume one now Chris Stapleton a country artist who I'm not going to sound terribly familiar with I mean I sort of listened to a bit of his previous record to sort of prepare for what I was going to say about this album over here so this is kind of my first full album experience with Chris's music and overall I would say it's pretty positive I mean in compare some of the last record this new one seems kind of short I do think some of the ballads on this record are a little too low-key you know could have used a bit more punch coming from the instrumentation and I think could have used a little bit more conviction vocally I'll also say that the death row track that the album ends off with I like the idea the concept of that track but I think the song could have been bigger as far as like a lyrical statement and could have had a grander instrumental presentation I mean we're talking about death row here and it is the final song on the record it does kind of seem like the album sort of goes out with a whimper but the Willie Nelson cover on this thing is great the second one to no track on this thing is great and some of the other ballads are actually really well performed Chris's voices is fantastic he has lots of range lots of volume lots of power I think maybe they try to overemphasize that a little bit by stripping the instrumentation back a little bit more than I think it needs to be so that when he reaches into those highs it seems so much more significant I think his voice would sound amazing with a stronger baseline of instrumentation under him regardless but that being said I do think this is a pretty decent record you know and it's always worth stopping to appreciate and celebrate when you have a new rising star in the contemporary country who's making waves and is getting attention and is winning over country fans left and right but isn't sort of playing by the strict commercial by the number cookie cutter rules because you know he is certainly routier than a lot of those commercial country artists are that you'll run across these days and certainly more diverse and varied too you know if you like that last circle Simpson record that dropped last year you're going to like a lot of things about this album you know not only are going to like the ballads you're like the moments on this record where Chris mixes a little bit of soul into his country stylings and you're going to like the southern rock numbers on this record too or at least the southern rock number on this record too you know he certainly has a lot of tricks up his sleeve it's not just a straight you know plain-jane country album you know if you're looking for an album that's more of a standard country affair you know listen to the new Willie Nelson record you know which is a bad that's a decent record too you know also the the track around these stems at the end of the record - is probably one of the better I guess I guess smoked up country songs I've heard in a while it's been a while since I heard a country song singing about smokin weed probably the the last time I was listening to some outlaw country or something but Chris doesn't really categorized as an outlaw country artist so again all that being said very good record very decent record a lot of good things about this album wish it was just longer wish there was a bit more I guess material here would have made the album more satisfying and I wish there was just a little bit more I guess punch to some of these low-key ballads either flesh them out into songs that are a bit more lively or give us a climax give us some kind of place to progress to in the song but you know regardless of the instrumentation production is pretty quality vocal performances from Chris you know are for most part good seems like you know he's well on his way to continue dropping some good country records and I just wanted to put out this video make you guys aware of him if you aren't already and you know maybe if you are they haven't tried his music out yet please you know what are you waiting for as far as like quality country artists out there today we're doing something that's true to the genre true to the sound well also you know varying it up a bit and bringing in some new you know bringing some new genres are bringing some different genres rather not that he's the first artist to ever mix country and soul he's not but bringing in some different genres you know really uh testing his own versatility as a country artist look him up look him up so yeah there you have it link down below where you can hear some music from this record let me know what you thought of this album in the comments if you gave it a shot and I will catch you guys in the next video forever 
Vnc2tB4Jlmo,hi everyone Anthony Santino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new slow dive album slow dies legendary dream pop outfit hailing from the UK slow dive they're back with the new album of their first in over 20 years following up 1995 as pigment to pig Pigman long which was easily the most eerie experimental and subtle of the three albums the band had released back in the 90s their debut just for a day which I personally think is a little underrated is so powerfully sad and depressing while this album may not live up to the shoegaze ideals that the band's subsequent records would I still think that the emotions of the shredder are really potent most of the tracks had the smooth glistening sub-zero sound that was chillingly beautiful I really like the subtle nods to jangle pop and post-punk on this record too but for most fans slow dives sophomore records souvlaki is the band's masterpiece and it's easy to see why I mean the sounds on this record are dense their blissful their envelope the entire is far more vivid than it was on their debut and the overbearing depression that sort of plagued that album is swapped out for just this supremely heavenly vibe also it's easily one of the most creatively produced albums in the shoegaze and dream pop genres while it may not be as wildly experimental in its techniques as loveless the way the band was able to balance harmony with the subtle chaos of the smudgy sounds and vocals on this record the sound bleed gave this thing a lot of character not to say there was nothing unorthodox about this album I mean the cuts of wacky space station with its dubby repetitive echoes all over the track is really an oddball in the track listing and pretty exciting too while skeletal ballads in the tracklist like dagger found incredible power in simplicity but I'm not here to explain a rank or just go that deeply into the band's back catalogue and here to talk about this new record over here new brand new album its self-titled as if this thing is some kind of manifesto or defining moment in the band's career this is this self-titled album this is the representation of slow dive or maybe it was just lack thereof a better title I don't know so it's been decades since slow dive has released an album and I don't think I need to explain to you how hit or miss comeback albums can be especially when you're talking about this length of time and we're also talking about dream pop here genre that has evolved by leaps and bounds since slow dies initial releases so coming into this new record with slow dive just deliver us their old sound would they try to revamp it and modernize it a little bit would they bring something entirely new and different and unexpected to the table instead all directions with potential benefits but also huge pitfalls but honestly on this new record over here it sounds like slow dive did their best to sort of stick to their guns on this one with the very linear sort of hypnotic song structures that grab on to a vibe and really hold on to it until the songs finish soft layers of guitars that are given at least a couple of coats of reverb and the singing of course is very even very calm the usual elements of slow dives execution are here but there's one thing missing and that's the sound and what is slow dive if not a sound because their first three albums weren't winning listeners over with vocal acrobatics or really newly technically intricate guitar solos and it's not that I'm coming into this review or this listening session expecting slow dive unreasonably to come back with the same exact sound that they delivered unto us in the 90s even if the way that they play their instruments on this new self-titled record kind of demands it especially with how naked and cold the vocals feel because they really could use that thin layer of gauzy pillowy sound is just a bit of a barrier but it's more than just the vocals on this record it's that the top to bottom transition slow dies is made into the digital age is not pretty the soft smooth round dreamy aesthetic of the Bands earlier releases has been completely removed scrubbed clean I actually say that the removal comparing this to their last record is pretty violent like performing a c-section with a chainsaw what we have now on this new record over here is really sanitary it's really crisp it's a very clean squeaky sound that reads like some run-of-the-mill third wave post-rock but without the heavy crescendos there's no sound bleed there's no bliss there's no beautiful little blemishes and smudges the kaleidoscopic rush the heavenly wall of sound it's not here all we have is an occasionally shrill occasionally tinny and and very very thin pallet of sound that feels like warmed-over explosions in the sky leftovers I'm hit with this vibe instantly on the introduction of tracks like sugar for the pill and slo-mo and no longer making time I was sick of hearing these anemic twangy reverb drenched guitars 10 years ago and slow dive is doing little to nothing to make them palatable or interesting again now I do think the driving aggressive post-punk e'er tracks on the record lend themselves better to the production and the mix on this album Starr roving in my opinion is easily the best song on the album by a mile the burning antennae cleave guitar melodies on the song match very well with the propulsive drums and and bass line the way the vocal harmonies on this track melt together just a little bit is nice too but it's not like we haven't already heard sounds similar to this from bands like Beach fossils or dive still though this is a spot on the album where I feel like the production the instrumentation everything about the song gels which is just so not the case on the song everyone knows which is this kind of breezy swaying piece of jangle pop where the vocals come off really calming and really serene but the ultra-bright roaring guitars all over the song had the opposite effect it's like trying to mix oil and water or that this is what passes is a dreamy sound for a generation of music listeners who came of age in the midst of the loudness war I really struggled to find a place where this song sounded good either on headphones it was a little muddy or on laptop speakers or like a Bluetooth speaker the guitars were way too loud way overpowering super sharp super shrill and then on my big stereo it's like I could hear that when they were producing the track they were trying to balance those ultra loud and ultra right guitars out with a lot of bass to the point where the bass signal has just got this really fat ugly it's really hideous it's easily the worst mixed song on the entire record their tracks on this album that are more layered and are played more aggressively but somehow sound less noisy and don't even get me started on the band's awkward attempt at recreating shoegaze on the song go get it I've never identified more with a singer calling out I want to feel it in a song because really I do I want to feel it I really want to feel anything I'm going to stop here I really could go into every minor sonic detail of this record that I don't like because there are that many things about this album sound wise that I don't like and you know I don't think it's that you can't make a great dream pop or a great shoegaze album in the current year it feels like the band took a modern approach to the recording process of this record but didn't use those tools to adequately find or discover the sound and the aesthetic that would truly complement their playing style or would give listeners some kind of modernized or updated version of the sound that fans have come to know and love instead it's like slowed I've settled on super plain reverbs boring distortions compartmentalised mixes with sounds that are more afraid of physical contact than seventh-graders slow dancing at the summer social honestly I don't really know what it is that has made the sound fall so short of what I would feel is even a halfway sufficient replacement for what I would typically find on a slow dive album but just Kubis Outsiders guests here it seems like the band has underestimated a bit the significance of the way that they used to produce things used to record things on their older albums because sort of abandoning that clearly has resulted in a very lackluster sound on this new record over here I'm feeling a light decent 4 on this thing transition have you given this album up listen

h2XMQrZ6Ywk,ah ah hi everyone could be buffed in a year the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's right for her good vehicle of the new full of hell out trumpeting ecstasy full of hell is a Maryland band that has been added for a little while now across their discography the band has been fusing multiple genres of extreme music into a cauldron of pain grindcore death metal black metal hardcore punk some toys rock in there all swirled together into a very sludgy power violent mix however the band's previous records while I had found them powerful I I didn't think they were all that memorable at least the band was living up to their name though but around the corner the group would release some very unexpected but very creative collaborative records of one with MERS bow which I came way very impressed with the legendary Japanese artist used his talents for noise to kind of enhance the Bands really animalistic sound and performance style while the band's collaborative record with the body I didn't find it to be as impressive but it was still a very heavy and massive album with lots of abrasive highlights they also dropped a pretty decent split with nails - that's worth checking out now this new record over here is an exciting return for full of hell - the one band one album one album format and what makes this record even more exciting is that is produced by the one and only Kurt Balu of course Kurt Balu is known as a member of the amazing metalcore band converge but his many many many production credits have gained a following and a reputation all their own helping countless modern bands sculpt these incredibly tight heavy nasty bone snapping sounds and I'd be lying if I didn't say that this was the case for full of hell - on this new record this is easily the band's best sounding album yet their heaviest album yet their punchy esteem yet most precise - it's so crushing and well defined despite how chaotic a lot of the playing is on this record between all the tremolo pickett are and blast beat drumming and can't forget the two vocal approach of guttural death metal growls and black metal style shrill as far as the sound the sound quality and the production the performance is - on this record I came away from this pretty impressed but like with previous full of hell records unfortunately there's not really that much to the band style despite the varied mix of extreme music styles going into this record I'm surprised this album came out the other end sounding so meat-and-potatoes case in point the intro track which is one of the most cliched songs I've heard opened up a grind record in a while from the edgy u Verner Hertzog quote that opens the track up to the flurry of guitars and drums that we speed through until the song finishes off it's clear the band is basically going to be making no effort whatsoever to make this an album that grab the attention of anybody who's heard more than five grindcore records and when the band is doing their best to work outside of the generic grind framework they're only incorporating the most widely applicable elements from other genres into the sound but for the most part I can't say that they aren't incorporated well or tastefully I love the song bound Fink's on this thing it's brutal it's blistering from the perfectly executed drums that syncopate awesomely with the dissonant guitar work the grimy distorted bass breakdown in the second half is really awesome I love the multiple phases and dynamic nature of this track the varied intensity is nice I also have the black metal inspired lead guitars that sear through the mix in the second half of the track the cosmic vein and the descending and sort of ascending guitar leads on the track digital prison are crazy it's so it's it's such an eargasm ik moment for me on the record because that track is so overwhelming it's so relentless the tracks segues really nicely into the chilling intro of the song crawling back to God I also think that it's no coincidence that tracks of these titles would be shoulder to shoulder with one another it's like I'm hearing two parts of a larger idea and that being said the album generally is a pretty seamless listen to the point where a lot of tracks just blur together in to an experience that's pretty holistic which could be a good thing or a bad thing for a grind album I mean you know some people love their records to sound like this endless torture chamber while I personally do prefer my songs on a grindcore record to have a bit of individual flavor or memorability or personality to them the quality production and performances continue deeper into the album but it becomes very apparent very quickly what the band's formula on this record is take some grindcore grooves and blast beats break that up with some heavy riffs throw in a little bit of black metal inspired lead melodies and the guitar work and then top that all off with some very gruff very guttural very deep death metal style vocals which is not a bad mix of sounds if you're talking about a relatively short album or a relatively short song this record is just 23 minutes long however there are a lot of tracks in the final moments of the record that try to go the distance reach beyond the two-minute mark and it's during these moments I feel like the band really fails to justify the length of these tracks on the second half of the song nod flesh the man will Ferrell man will always spell refrain it gets really old really fast I think some of the writing here especially on the longer tracks just could have been more varied more detailed and again since you're already making blatant references to black metal and death metal and sludge metal - why not reach a little deeper into the more complex and unique elements of those styles to incorporate them into what you're already doing on that baseline grindcore sound I'm just surprised considering how much the band obviously knows and is aware of extreme music how uniform this album feels the biggest risk on this entire album comes in the shape of the title track which features this distortion coming from you the guitars or the bass or something else I'm not really sure what the sources but it's so brittle and it's so harsh it has an industrial tone to it especially with yourself Eddy and lumbering and primal the percussion is on this tract this is a direction that you know is not not that I'm saying I wanted the band to do more specifically this sound on the record but these are the kinds of risks and surprises I know full of hell is capable of and I just would have loved to have heard them embark upon a little more often on this record also the the addition of vocals guest vocals from Nicole doll and anger was really unexpected makes for the most tender moment easily the most tender moment on the entire record as her singing is eerily beautiful but moving beyond that does the band really justify their lengths of the 6-minute closer on this record considering that the outro riff of the song starts at about the two-minute mark and goes on for the remaining four minutes with just like you know almost a single drum change up not really this is a pretty okay album it's not awful there wasn't a single track outside of the intro that I was really disappointed in but I did have my fears confirmed on this record and that is that full of hell would go back to a more standard a more dime-a-dozen sound which I guess is fine if you're looking for a more straightforward approach to your sludgy heavy grindcore but if you're going to listen to and praise and obsess over this you might as well listen to the rank and file of grindcore bands the Curt Balu is produced for over the years as well as all the crusty grind acts that Southern Lord has released albums for since about 2010 or so I guess I just expect a little more from full of hell because I know they're capable of it but still you know decent listen of a record even if it is just kind of a short thrill feeling a light decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next hit the likes you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry videos next to my head I think you should check out as well as channel subscription link official website too and I will catch you guys in the next video get a good night's sleep stay hydrated forever 
ICvyW5xGZgs,oh hi everyone but but your goddamn shirt up here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Mac DeMarco album this old dog neck DeMarco was a singer-songwriter white guy from Canada captured tracks artists and a viceroy smoker and now he's back with another album which I have been looking forward to not only because I knew it was going to be one of the bigger releases of the year but this is the record that I was crossing my fingers and hoping that Mac DeMarco would come through with an album that didn't just play like a compilation of songs sort of my primary issue with his album number two his big breakout album though not my only issue a lot of good tracks on that record though I thought the kind of jangly smooth very dreamy pop rock he delivered on this record could have used a bit of variety especially on the follow-up album salad days where I feel like that sound really turned drab very fast I came away from salad days feeling so underwhelmed but felt weirdly hopeful when I read some talk of Mac DeMarco butting heads with his record label over the creative direction of the album a bit thinking that hey maybe if Mac DeMarco had more full control over the record I would have liked it more after all I did end up enjoying that another one EP that he released shortly thereafter and captured tracks dropped quite a few teaser tracks up to the release of this album so it was kind of easy to see where Mac DeMarco was going to be taking this record with the emphasis on synthesizers songs that lyrically seemed way more sad and introspective Mac's usually happy-go-lucky very blissful vibe was kind of melting away a bit and that is swapped out with tracks that kind of reflect the pain of loneliness and Mac DeMarco struggled to grow up in mature to become his own man outside of the shadow of his father who he has a troubled past with given that he abandoned him and his mother when he was young this is a sight of Mac DeMarco that we have not seen explored before we're at this depth and even though it may not seem like much because Mac DeMarco doesn't really tend to load his songs with a lot of instrumentation with a lot of sound he plays it pretty subtle he plays it pretty simple the addition of drum machines and the synthesizers and more acoustic guitars into the mix on this thing actually does bring more variety to the record makes the album sound more dynamic more engaging even if on the whole this album still feels very easygoing and somewhat breezy I guess now that sound makes a more interesting match and more interesting juxtaposition against the increasingly grim and somewhat depressing lyrics that are laced throughout the album like on dreams from yesterday or one more love song as I listen to this record it feels like I'm watching some kind of slow motion video Mac DeMarco descending into some kind of moody abyss whose depth and intensity grows as the album goes on like when Mac DeMarcos vocals are drenched in echo on the very Spacey on the level whose verses swap out with these very smooth elongated and icy icy icy synth lines the song moonlight on the river closes out with this very chaotic and abrasive wall of guitar noise and frightening sound effects as lyrically on the track he kind of reflects on his father abandoning him and his mother which is a bit of a narrative on the record he puts to bed on the closing track where he is reflecting instead on his father dying and even though he didn't really kind of have that relationship with him over the years you never really got to know his father personally like that it still hurts to know that he's not going to be on this planet anymore Mac DeMarco struggles on this track to call him up to really do anything to reach out or even tell him off for all the years of abandonment now this album isn't all doom and gloom Mac DeMarco does still bring a handful of funky playful I guess awkwardly sensual instrumentals that I like quite a bit the song for the first time I think is one of his best love songs in a while really up there in my opinion with my kind of woman it's just like seeing for the first time I love how smooth and sweet that song is I like how the song is just a soft and gentle but there's also kind of something that's playful about it flirty about it but shy too on the track one another we get a little bit of a Velvet Underground vibe coming through on the groove and some of the guitar licks on the track I love the opening of the track of wolf in sheep's clothing at our licks and harmonicas as well kind of seems like as a bit of a classic rock vibe to it and dreams of yesterday has like some undertones of bossa nova to it I'd say there are a lot of instrumental qualities about this record that I love Mac DeMarco seems to do a lot with a little on this album the bass lines and the drums play a pretty straight the acoustic guitars really only serve as a rhythm track a lot of the time it's really about some of these guitar leads some of these siblings mac DeMarcos lyrics and vocals the songwriting sometimes is just so sturdy you really don't need to gussy it up in order to to get across what makes the tune so good however not all Tunes on this album were created equal which is kind of a continuing issue for me on Mac DeMarco albums just the inconsistency in the quality of the writing and not that there's an incredible nosedive with some awful lyrics flying at you in every direction or something like that it's just that some songs here feel somewhat unfinished of the end very abruptly they don't have an ending it all or they're just painfully short like Mac didn't fully commit to just fleshing the song out to its proper finish sister the the wolves and sheeps close the gems track meanwhile other tracks such as this old dog I think could have used a starker course or just more instrumental change ups to make the song feel more dynamic these tracks feel just kind of flat to me like there just wasn't enough progression across the track and on the track baby you're out one of the least pleasant instrumental decisions is made to sort of include this little keyboard part that I it doesn't enhance the groove of the track it doesn't enhance the melody or bring a melodic element to the track that's all that interesting it sort of juts out and ruins the smooth groovy tone of the song is really it's it's it's one of the worst sand corporations of since on the entire record actually the worst incorporation of cents on the entire record I have no idea where this you know sort of comes from it's it's really poison to me every time I hear the song it really ruins the tune for me is something that would have otherwise been a decent track in my opinion while this album may be a bit of a mixed bag you know I didn't come away thinking that Mac DeMarco made the best use of all 40-plus minutes of this album I do think this is his best record since - not only because of the instrumental diversity across this record but also just how interesting some of the the songs and lyrics are on this record I feel like we're just getting a side of mac DeMarco that we have not gone before not to this degree and I've also noticed he's matured quite a bit in his songwriting and his lyricism for this record - something I highly commend but while I like this record coming away from it I'm not so sure if it's you know going to hit if it's going to pop if it's going to make waves like his previous releases did because I do think this is a patient listeners album people looking for those purely feel good vibes from Max earlier releases might not get that on this record not to say this is a negative album but you know it is very introspective and somewhat moody record I think Mac did a good job of mostly getting his sound to apply to this new lyrical direction but you know this is this is not a - still though it's working for me I came away liking this record I think it's very good I'm feeling a strong 7 - a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry Mac DeMarco

jESJJrA5a98,hi everyone every body here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new logic album everybody logic is a Maryland rapper who's been making waves for a while now with album after album mixtape after mixtape he's now on his third full-length record commercial full-length record for Def Jam Records which honestly I've been looking forward to because I really like the sound that he was bringing on the teaser tracks to this record however you never really know with logic going into an album because the devil is always going to be in the details of the of the larger project especially with his last one which was his most conceptual yet and I feel like he's going even further down that road with this new record over here with multiple skits that run across the length of the album featuring Neil deGrasse Tyson playing some kind of God some kind of deity explaining to this Adam character who just hit the afterlife that we're all connected as humanity and we've all been living reincarnated lives until every person I guess or this person sees every walk of life and then what happens after that I don't really know there are lots of logical inconsistencies to this whole explanation I'm surprised Neil deGrasse Tyson would have even agreed to take part in it considering how nonsensical it is I feel like he just brings Neil on to kind of give this weird theory or I guess concept he's come up with on this album more credibility than it would have had otherwise not that I think logic really wants us to come away from this record thinking that we're all being reincarnated over and over and over it's really just kind of a metaphor for explaining to his listeners that he wants people to think about walking a mile in another person's shoes before they cast judgment or take on some kind of prejudice this whole story is kind of like an ambitious attempt to springboarding off of a sort of double life that logic himself feels like he is living by way of being biracial because he himself feels like he's seeing both sides of this incredible divide in the United States right now now hearing his take on this prior to the release of the album on the title track to this record I thought was great even though the instrumental and logics flow on that track reeks of kendrick lamar influence but you know that's the thing about logic he has a lot of heart he seems like a really good dude but I don't think there's another artist out there who comes off to me as being as much a hip-hop artist as he is a hip-hop fan this manifested itself in his early mixtapes as hey he has like a little bit of everything on this thing he has some contemporary tracks some old-school tracks with more of a vintage boom-bap vibe it's really just kind of all over the place and with his recent commercial albums this comes off as him just kind of wearing his contemporary influences on his sleeve the artists he most blatantly bites being Jay Cole Kendrick Lamar and Drake but even though everybody sounded like a track that could have been on a butterfly head Kendrick rapped on it instead logics blatant influences is actually not really all that distracting on this album it's not really the primary focus of the record at least not for me which ultimately is a good thing I think logic is coming into his own a little bit more and it sounds like he's putting forth a big effort to make sure it's really his message and his concept here which are the primary focus for the album and if there is one thing I like about this concept off the bat it does seem less self-serving at least not as self-serving as his past album where there were multiple mentions of logics music across the record where they were trying to oh he's he's the one that saved everything he's what he's one that changed at all I can't remember I'm paraphrasing what I remember being is that on the record but that I remember that is really kind of turning my stomach now even though on this record there is more of an emphasis on message it is still kind of a mess I think a lot of this album sort of boils down to logic just saying okay can't we all just get along especially with bars on this record where he's rapping about our hatred our prejudice our politics our lack of mutual understanding and respect for one another in addition to that our addiction to our phones our technology our need to be entertained there's also a really vague religious component to some of these tracks too that isn't quite explained fully at least it's not tied in effectively with what the skits with Neil deGrasse Tyson are kind of spinning it's like a political album written by somebody who doesn't follow politics all that closely to begin with which is why some of the best moments on this album are more personal than they are political like when logic is talking about his struggle with anxiety on the end of the song anxiety or other song take it back the finish of this track logic talks about his struggle sort of growing up in a world of violence and drugs and racism and just general hatred toward I guess the fact that he was a biracial biracial kid the problem is logic boils these moments down into these really long-winded narratives and monologues at the finish of these tracks when honestly even though they do hit hard on the first listen through on the album the more I hear them the more I think what why aren't these just songs like why didn't you turn these into some verses and into other effective tunes because there's so much of this album already that's just spent sort of talking I mean just look at Killer Mike's pastor like contribution to the song confess or even juicy J's feature on the album isn't really all that hard-hitting Chuck DS rapping on the song America has almost spoken word to an extent sort of underwhelming in my opinion and no ID who we don't often hear rap at the very finish of that same track I don't exactly know what he was getting at here I mean I guess America sort of has this tendency to wall itself up or there's so much prejudice that there's kind of this implied or unemployed segregation going on again like I feel like there's a point to be made here but didn't know ID make it not really so again my point is I feel like there are so many moments on this album where I'm not really listening to a great track a great chorus a well-crafted song again case in point the weird sort of lo-fi j.cole feature at the very end of the album which I'm just not exactly sure what the point of that is other than for logic to be like well I'm a big J Cole fan I got j.cole on my album and that's really cool the suicide hotline track is one of the few moments on this album where I feel like logic took a personal struggle and turned into a well crafted and fully fleshed out song you may not like the buttery smooth melodic tone of the record but from personal standpoint it is one of the more compelling moments on the album certainly more compelling than the moments on this record when logic is trying to take on bigger topics and all he has to offer are just really middle-of-the-road observations and lyrical filler man I swear to god I wish I was living in bel-air fuck Medicaid I just want to get paid with a couple bitches in the Caribbean but like he's not really saying anything of any substance and yet he comes through with this air like this is a really meaningful record this is a really important record I'm saying so much shit on this album hey motherfucker I'm realest shit I say all this shit I feel like the only feature I came by as far as a rap feature goes loving on this project was black thoughts at the end of the day it just seems like logic wants us to stop killing each other which isn't a bad thing to want I just feel like he is a philosophically inconsistent guy he expects mankind as a whole to live up to a higher standard and yet there are at least a few moments on the album where he acknowledges his flaws and just sort of admits or I guess at least accepts that he can't change he's just like a not that great of a guy at least not as great as he would like to be logic tries again to pick apart mankind's follies on the song killing spree but it doesn't seem to dawn on him that the whole everybody is doing X everybody's doing y everybody is doing Z thing has already been exhausted at this point not only in the grander scheme of music but you kind of already did this on the title track and the song black spider-man though I did like it going into the album the more I listen to it the more dawns on me that while it is a track about diversity it only seems to endorse diversity in like the cheapest sense of the word because the whole idea that this hinges on the idea of a black spider-man that you can just make a black version of a pre-existing thing to make that thing appeal to a black audience I mean that's not really much better than tokenism over I just think it shows a lack of creativity and respect on the person who is in charge of doing such a thing the idea that you can appease black people by giving them something that already exists and saying hey here's the black version here is the version that will appeal to you because you're black is kind of ridiculous you must have to think that black people when they wake up all they think is on black on black on black like they have no interests or personality traits beyond their race now can spider-man be black sure he's made up if spider-man can get superpowers from getting bit by a spider he could be from the fucking moon the problem is is that's barely diversity if you want true diversity create universally beloved characters that aren't defined by their gender their race their sexual orientation but transcendent however this is not to say that the whole black spider-man discussion isn't worth having or that you couldn't have a spider-man or a double-oh-seven movie in the future with a black actor playing the lead you could argue that this whole thing has exposed some serious racial tribalism in the way that everyday people consume certain types of media however none of what I've just said here is a point or an argument that logic is even making on this album in the support of a black spider-man it just seems like an idea that he has half-baked support for after a smoke session that he had with some friends of his word it might have been a topic of conversation and I feel like I'm spending a lot of time this review talking about what I think logic is trying to get at with some of these songs and some of these messages because a lot of the time when you dive deeply into what he's saying there's not a lot of substance there there's not a lot of thought being put into why he's taking certain positions or why he thinks X Y or Z is happening the only thing I came away from this album consistently impressed with was logics flow which was really on point all over the record and I really loved the instrumental palette of the album it was really grand really luscious lots of arranged strings all over this record easily logics most glamorous album yet simply from an instrumental standpoint its soulful its powerful it's actually so good that my first couple of listens on the album I actually thought logic was saying things more substance and more meaning than he actually was then once I actually started reading through the verses are really the only solid verse that I came way somewhat impressed with was logics second verse on the song America loved that line about Donald Trump being the sequel to george w bush but overall i mean out of all the albums that rappers have recently released where they kind of felt like they needed to come out with a political record in light of the election of donald trump I don't know I feel like logics so far comes up the shortest just because the message is not really all that consistent and not in the way that Kendricks message was sort of inconsistent it was very clear that there was a bit of a war going on in his mind and he wanted to put that out there for everyone to hear logic is clearly trying to put together something that is cohesive and well groomed and potentially well thought out but there's really no rhyme or reason to much of it case in point neil degrasse tyson's closing diatribe the advice on how to live life that he passes off to Adam before I guess he sends him off to be reincarnated once again he pretty much just ends up saying just live your life to the best that you can live it don't worry about other people's negativity don't worry about the past and don't worry about the days that are going to come after you die too so we're like not supposed to worry about the future now that's something that I I don't think logic would tell you to think if you asked him if he seriously thought that we shouldn't worry or think about the future and that's definitely not something that Neil deGrasse Tyson would would tell you to think if you seriously asked him his opinion the living for others part of this monologue is really the best part of this whole spiel but that just seems like a really vague empty platitude because nothing else on the album reinforces that message at least not in a way that seems directly or obviously connected or thematic and the sleepy Jay Cole feature that ends the entire album off just makes the the finish of this album feel even less tied up oh I mean this album logic really tries to make an album about everything but he just fails to make a poignant observation about much of anything there's just so much more that could have been better about this record there's so much more that could been better about this album I'm feeling a light too decent five on this record transition have you given this album we'll listen if you love it did you hate it

oTYoQs8JWBQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track round a where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week of course before we get into this a few things I need to mention our Amazon Associates link down there in the description if you use that anything you buy in the US we get kick back from it does not add to your overall price use it to buy some  you were going to buy anyway I know you guys are using it I appreciate you guys who are using it if you're not using it look what were you thinking about you know of new album I want on vinyl you know I really wanted those pants whatever just just use the freakin thing thanks we also have a similar thing going on with the good people over at turntable lab there's a page link down there in the description where you can see some albums I've reviewed some audio equipment for people who are looking to get into record collecting and yeah if you get some stuff over from them we could kick back from that too and finally I have to mention the good people over at feed bands calm that's feed bands calm they are using the power of crowdsourcing to create their very unique music subscription service it's a vinyl of the Month Club pretty much and basically artists upload their music onto the website people who are users listen to the music they vote up on the music and sort of in this Democratic fashion it is decided what records are so special that they will be printed on vinyl which is actually like again as I said a pretty unique process when it comes to these vinyl subscription services never heard of this sort of thing before and there's a link down there in the description where you can get a free trial all you got to do is pay some shipping and they will send you one of the records that they have printed so far and yeah just check out the service see how unique the services see what they have to offer because it is kind of a weird special very strange place in a good way on the Internet as far as this big wide world we know as the music community goes so again that's feed bands calm and that is feed band calm slash needle drop for that free trial cool cool all right let's get into the tracks let's kick it off the worst tracks the week as we usually do got to give a shout-out unfortunately to TLC on their new song haters unfortunately TLC just comes off to me on this track is just it's just really awkward it's painfully awkward and not only because I think the song is really weak and it's not really their style it sounds like some kind of sunny uppity radio friendly indie pop hook from the 2000 so what's what's kind of tag on to this song but also it just feels like they're they're trying too hard to speak the lingo of the new generation by naming a song titled haters here and the lyrics really kind of leave a lot to be desired it's it's like they're trying again for another no scrubs but it's just not working I'm not exactly sure if they should try to continue you know to work these sorts of lyrics that are sort of memes in in the modern music community in the hip-hop community into their music it's not necessarily a bad thing it's probably only going to give them more exposure in the end but if they're going to do it it needs to be done in a way that feels more natural and less kind of focus-grouped than on this song moving on from there riff raff Lamborghini leglock Oh riff he's back you know I I don't want to open this wound with riff raff again I like the guy he seems like a nice guy he's very entertaining he's very funny but he's literally made some rap metal over here with this track he sounds like Fred Durst on this song I have no idea what he's doing I mean I'm sure he knows what he's doing I'm sure he's aware of how cracked-out it sounds but it does it's a ridiculous song and I mean I guess intentionally he was trying to make a ridiculous song that's what it is and I guess they're just going to leave it at that it's it's rap metal it's lit biscuit come back from the dead moving on from their girlfriend of the year from the good people over at PC Music PC music check out their YouTube channel if you haven't already they are releasing music pretty much every day for the month of May new tracks and original tracks and remixed tracks and this song to me unfortunately was one of the less entertaining songs have heard them dropped this week it's kind of like they were I don't know coming together with a song that was trying to be so postmodern it didn't need real lyrics like the gibberish lyrics on the song might have been cute for a verse or maybe a few lines or something but it's to the point where it just gets obnoxious on this track which is a shame because I kind of like the instrumental here but what's going on lyrically on this track is just so pretentious I just could not get into it all it was just so oh alright you're just trying a little too hard that it doesn't feel like there's anything natural or interesting about this this is just like you know a weird little process or experiment you held yourself to and it didn't turn out all that well in my opinion but moving on from there the ily is with I Love You Man you know honestly I'm pretty disappointed by these new Isle wise tracks they're not really doing too much for me to be fair and this song especially it just feels like some drab forgettable noise rock really bland really um there's not really much texturally that's all that interesting about it which is kind of strange because it is a kind of lo-fi brittle sort of track you think that Zach Hill would sort of take advantage of this opportunity to do something really weird with the mixing or just the sound of the song but it just sounds really mediocre and just really flat and really lifeless which is just strange because at least the debut Isle wise record was a little colorful was a little kooky and the last album that they dropped was bringing in elements of prog rock and experimental rock and art rock and you know noise rock as well you know some elements of the the production that you usually catch in like a death grip song was turning up in here too but now on this latest track it's just like I don't know it's just a really bland bedroom pop that honestly I would not have guessed that Zach Hill had anything to do with it had I not been told by the name of the band but just really kind of unenthusiastic about these tracks that the band has been dropping but the last track in this segment I'm going to say with a heavy heart with a heavy heart it's it's little yachty it's bring it back this this song is awful I don't know what I've been dying to hear a new single from this new little yachty record this is just so however the more I listen to it and the more I think about it and I'm keeping it in this section of the video I'm keeping it in this goddamn section of the video the more I listen to it the more I think about it it does feel like he's continuing to I guess give us what to me felt like a unique characteristic about his little boat mixtape and that is that he sort of has this amateurish charm about him he sort of has this lovable awkwardness about him this track instrumental he just sounds like of just a run-of-the-mill dime-a-dozen piece of 80s pop with a saxophone and you know kind of like some springy guitar in there I mean the fact the whole video here is shot what seems like in this 80s prom setting is totally fitting it's like you know they knew exactly what they were going to do you know from the inception of this track to how they would connect to the visuals of the video and I do think it's very funny you know there is something very entertaining about it there is something about it that is it's so bad that it's good which is again you know part of the way that I feel like little boat charmed me which you know maybe when I hear this track in the context of the entire record who the hell knows maybe I'll like it you know that there are elements of the hook that I do think are kind of sticky bring it back bring it back but goddamn there are so many things that I think are working against the song that is that little yadi is barely on tempo some of the lyrics on the thing are god-awful the auto-tune on his voice just swallows every and any organic and human quality about his voice to the point where he sounds like a some kind of Frankenstein robot and then on top of that I think the the next worst thing about the song has to be that that all over the track little Yaya is doing these [Music] I can't tell if it's all overdubs or if he's doing it in between you gotta bring it back bring it back and what's funny is that his vocals are barely on tempo so of course these little weird breathy ad-libs are barely on tempo too so this is really there are a lot of awful distracting things about this track that hopefully down the road maybe I end up loving you know I don't I don't want to hate this track but it's just such a like you're really you're really testing me here you're really freaking testing me here and again I think it's funny they're elements of it that I find entertaining but this was just this just felt a little overboard but who the hell knows you know little little yachty he has that x-factor he has that x-factor that um you know I I guess I will wait to hear the entire album for final judgment of course the Sun is disappearing so let me just do this so y'all could see your boy let's move on to the tracks that I thought were we're decent they were okay they were kind of met not songs I was totally in love with this week but tracks that I wanted to mention anyway just kind of get him out there Lydia loveless desire she threw together two covers of tracks from westin room listen Justin Bieber's latest record and she kinda has a really cool all I guess kind of rock all country sort of take on these songs that are very slow very dreary honestly like I wouldn't have even guessed they were just to be her songs that I not been told but I like her renditions quite a bit I thought they turned out pretty good at least much better than I would have expected for anybody doing a Justin Bieber cover in 2017 you know usually it's the kind of thing it seems like an artist is going to do it super poppy and try to appeal to the widest group of people possible it seems like she's really kind of gotten to the core of of the sad emotions on these Justin Bieber songs and have translated them really effectively into this very patient electric guitar music moving on from there Paramore two weeks in a row was it last week I was the leak for I think is two weeks in a row a new song told you so this tract is not that bad either I know what's going on here my world is getting flipped upside down Paramore come through with these Dancy sort of disco fried very shimmering very sleek pop tracks that are actually pretty likable you know I mean I actually think I liked last week's track a bit more but this one over here isn't really isn't really bad either certainly a step up from what I've heard them do in the past and looking forward to seeing what they're doing on the new record I'm looking forward to a Paramore album believe it or not moving on from there Alex G open parenthesis sandy the song brick Alex G is dropping track after track after track from this forthcoming record but this song over here is really making way and and I like things about it it's pretty interesting but it's kind of like a loaf i industrial Punk bedroom spun production here a lot of people who sort of likened it to Death Grips I sort of see that comparison but I don't necessarily think that I mean they may have been a reference point I'm not going to say that they weren't but I think he sort of translates those sounds and those influences into his own little thing here I like the track you know will this new album of his just kind of be a sporadic blend of a million different random ideas could possibly be because of all the songs that have come out so far they're always sort of seems to be a weird experimental quirk or something about them that that stands out from the rest like wow how is this going to come together into a cohesive album it might not it might be a crazy like tapestry of a bunch of things that are sort of you know very loosely loosely connected but anyway this track over here was really adrenaline pumping was exciting it was off-the-wall it was insane and I don't know I'm just kind of waiting to see how this whole album comes together once it's finally out I mean I know this one over here it definitely floored me it for me and I'll leave it at that I'm moving on from there dead cross which is a new project featuring Mike Patton a member of Slayer - someone was telling me like a few member like a member - of the locusts which would be pretty awesome because the locust is a group who's freaky experimental very extreme brand of rock music is something that I think is missing in a lot of modern bands today just something that's so wildly just insane but and that definitely turns up on this new song over here again the track is a from dead cross the song is grave slave maybe it is a little too cartoony Mike Penn's wilder projects do have the tendency to read to me as that but I definitely am looking forward to a band especially with musicians who are so seasoned coming together feels like so crazy and so lacking in any sort of musical inhibitions you know the a lot of musicians tend to at this sort of point in their careers get set get stuck in their ways but it seems like Mike Patton and Dave Lombardo over here really like doing some spastic and crazy and you know really unexpected with this new track or in this new project next in this section new grizzly their song three rings I thought it was okay you know I thought it was okay to me the song reminded me a lot of early early early grizzly bear like when it was like just Edie you know it feels like there wasn't much and I'm probably wrong on this but at least from you know outside perspective here just listening to the song it felt like there wasn't too much influence coming from Chris or coming from Daniel on this track it just very purely felt like an effort from Edie which is fine but I feel like I don't know I mean the songs right where I feel like I'm getting a touch of something from you know each member to me are the ones that really kind of wow me and really kind of hit me and you know Daniels side of the sort of the songwriting really does have quite a bit of I guess I would say it's it's a little more accessible you know it's a little easier on the ears a little more easy to it to digest the song over here has a very linear structure to it I like that it sort of builds to a somewhat intense high at the finish but I feel like it just kind of takes way too long I sort of get to that point or doesn't provide enough in terms of progression as it moves along there were moments of the track that felt kind of drab to me but you know I like that it sounds like they're doing something different I would hate for grizzly bear to come out with another goddamn album that sounds like their past couple of albums which you know for the most part I felt like their latest record was their last record was you know while I am not head over heels for this track I'm at least looking forward to maybe getting to know the song a little bit more when the album comes out and potentially looking forward to something that is going to be a change of pace for grizzly bear because you know do you think they have artistically in a way kind of painted themselves into a little bit of a corner and maybe with this new record over here they're going to be taking the opportunity to reinvent themselves or at least you know that's kind of what I'm looking forward to happening potentially and finally in this section and you know while these songs are okay to me it is kind of a disappointment I wanted to love these tracks but I have to throw in here the new LCD Soundsystem songs call the police and American Dream for a couple of different reasons I mean call the police instrumentally while some people have pointed out the layers upon layers of Robert Fripp Ian's guitars all over the track and certainly the guitars are one of the more interesting sort of experimental elements about the production but to me beyond that the song to me sounds like just a mediocre new order song like a song that would have been left off of power corruption and lies you know it's not really anything about the instrumental on all that wowed by it just kind of reminds me of just some new order runoff moving on from there the lyrics are some of the least impressive I've ever heard James Murphy put together on a track and not that you know he's the lyricist extraordinaire or anything like that lyrical God but usually there's like a bit of sass or personality or you know just like some sharpness some crispness in what he's saying in what he's singing that really kind of comes across in song makes a song exciting I get that maybe this track is a little more forlorn little more serious a little more sad for for two tracks that seem like they're trying to make political statements they just seem like such non statements James Murphy's ability to sort of provide smart funny social commentary the sort of sits above the fray of all the insanity going on sort of in society it's just completely gone on this track and the moment where he's the the rhyme where he's singing about uh discussing the history of the Jews I mean I understand where that line is coming from politically what he's reacting to but the fact that that's giving him the Blues just seems like one of the most ham-fisted rhymes that James Murphy has ever written onto a track that we don't believe in love chorus 2 on the song seems really lazy there's not really much about the lyrics that I like on this song it kind of seems like James Murphy he's got the ear he's got the trunk he's got the tail but he that he doesn't he doesn't know that he's you know grabbing an elephant yet you know it's kind of like he's only got a few pieces of the puzzle and he's just kind of ranting or kind of reacting to those and it's just so not in touch with whatever the bigger picture is you know it just kind of seems like some very lazy commentary not because I think you know he's clueless but because I feel like he didn't put in effort to sort of say the sharp poignant funny witty thing that he typically would say on an older LCD Soundsystem record American dream the only thing I really liked about this track were the layers of synthesizers that kind of synth line that I mean like those layered cascading since on the track to me really both of these songs James Murphy came off to me is so flat so boring so soulless so uninspired I'm not sold on the LCD soundsystem reunion on these tracks guys I'm really not I was barely sold on it before when they announced it you broke up the band you did a farewell tour you sold a farewell tour vinyl box set you did a farewell album band tour movie and now you're coming back with these two clearly mediocre tracks that I again I just don't know where it's coming from and I was hoping the return will be a little more exciting but whatever let's get into the tracks that I thought were impressive this week got to give a shout out to waves don't want to say too much about this song or you know any other song from this album going forward because nathan has come out with so many tracks on this guide an LP after the release of the LP give it give us a surprise dude we leave it leave us we'll give you something to the imagination but I just love how textured and noisy and distorted and crazy and off-the-wall this track is the production is crazy and it's shaping up to be insane on this new record and I'm liking that Harry Styles sweet creature got to give a shout out to this track another passionate and huge ballad from Harry Styles this record could be good guys this record from Harry could be really really good I mean fair the song does take a little bit to get going at first it just sounds like another generic acoustic ballad that could get onto the radio but just like sign of the times toward the end of the track it does kind of hit that big climactic moment that makes the song sort of eargasm ik but moving on from there one lobbed the coup Brewer yes this guy is a rapper who you may not have heard of he's from Ghana and this song off his very long new album sort of debating still whether or not I'm going to cover the record because is so huge you know there are some great moments on it but I may come away from the record just kind of feeling like it's a little bloated it's like an hour and 20 minutes but this new track of his features open mike eagle i think both of them together bring some really great chemistry and if you like this track another song that i recommend you check out off the album is yum-yum-yum-yum which for my fellow vegans out there you'll really appreciate that song because all about how fruits and veggies are so nice but I'm liking this personality I'm liking that he hops on some eclectic and very unique production I'm liking sort of what his perspective and his heritage and his accents are to bring to the table in terms were just kind of like unique characteristics about his musical style so shout out to this dude shut up to one love the Kubler moving on from there the new high in the song light you back to me this song sort of condenses and enhances everything I liked about the band's last record you know it just seems a little more mature this time around like those funky little like Michael Jackson isms or certainly in the track of the passionate lead vocals you know very dramatic loving lyrics very emotional very very emotionally potent and again it just seems a little more grand this time around before I would say you know the the previous singles from the last record just felt like you know very summery still very feel-good you know from what I've heard from these singles so far those elements are certainly there but these tracks feel a little bit more like you know I'm a little a little upset this time around I got some real like emotional I got to get off my chest and I'm liking that you know I'm going to say just seems like hi and as usual but more mature more refined and I think that's you know turning up in some good and creative ways in this new material the band HM Ltd or otherwise known as having a limited have a new song on called music it's very crazy it's very zeny strange post-punk music I will say it's probably not my favorite of the tracks have heard from the band so far but I could see it being a cool little experimental deep cut from their forthcoming record when that album ends up coming out I don't know but you know the sort of music music music like refrains all over the track along with the driving be the you know kind of synthetic fusion of post-punk II grooves and you know strange electronics on the track you know a lot of cool stuff about this song that I like quite a bit now warning on this next track it's from my boy Kieren J Kalinin from down in Australia the song is called sad or s ad or song about drugs and you know maybe go on Bandcamp a listen to this track or you know if you're feeling if you're feeling frisky and if you're feeling bold go check out the music video because it's it's a very fun music video he's kind of doing these weird little solo dance moves in a variety of different outfits and some of those outfits are quite questionable i will spoil it and just say one of them is a is an elephant thong and the trunk a piece of his reproductive system goes into the trunk of the elephant and I believe there is it's it's a very risky video so you know we're just going to leave it at that but I'm liking how funky and off-the-wall and crazy this song is his last single bravado was it's really shaving out to be one of my favourite songs of the year so sexy so sleek but dark too very strong 80s vibe coming out of the instrumental on this song as well but some of the weird pitched vocals all over this track are insane they're crazy and I'm just kind of liking what he's doing sonically and aesthetically seems like a really cool artistic jump from his last album which you know it's a very dark and experimental and noisy rock elements all over it this seems much sunnier but also very experimental also very strange and looking at the album itself has some crazy features on it too from wise blood and James chance of I think James chance in the contortions name so I'm looking forward to hearing this record could be an amazing album one more song I want a shout out from the band knocked him which is on prosthetic records this new single of theirs which is titled a cruise Sallis and this is a crazy blend of thrash metal and black metal but it also got has the the volume in the brutality of like a death metal track and the drumming on the song is insane it's a very dynamic track to a lot of different weird noisy but also subtle and uh somber musical passages all over it that I think are really cool and looking forward to being with this looking forward to seeing what this band is doing going forward because this song was pretty creative and um very extreme very strange very what I'm looking for very technically virtuous very detailed but very animalistic too you know it's not one of those over produced metal tracks where you don't really kind of get that air from it you know there's definitely a rage or real rage in the song that I like quite a bit and those are going to be the tracks for this week guys I hope

8BNtphbNRIE,skinny marked an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the latest installment of the why you know review we're in brief I deliver a series of very badly shot and edited and conceived Twitter videos videos that were originally posted up on twitter at the needle drop show that at thank you very much and I'm not posting these over on Instagram to Instagram you boy a fan tan oh cool cool now I'm just going to basically show you guys all these videos in succession these videos that I wanted to mention I wanted to give a little bit of a nod to but I didn't get a chance to do a full length sort of standalone video on them so you know this is the this is me kind of like for a throne throwing a little a little bone you know being like hey this this is sort of what I thought about it and I don't think I have anything else to say about it other than that maybe check at the end of this video for a playlist of my other y-you know review videos one one one let's go I honestly cannot wait until this alternative weird dark R&B sound goes out of style and just dies so that the people who continue making R&B are the artists who are actually good at it and have passion for the genre and are not just working a bunch of trendy cliches into their music to catch the ears of contemporary pop listeners it's fine yeah it's it's fine nothing really wrong with it or anything it's fine yeah it's it's fine it's completely fine holy shit I mean hi I didn't anticipate this album to be probably Troy abs best I mean Troy have on this thing he is going pin on these instrumentals I mean you've never heard just kidding it's trash but one I don't wanna know given that I do like some of Amy's earlier material I was kind of curious as to how this new album was going to pan out but it's a I don't know it's it's just a one-dimensional in my opinion its pleasant it's sweet on the ears some of her lyrics are kind of interesting but you know it's just kind of like nice friendly lady plays very nice kind of folky acoustic music that's it doesn't kind of have a root seer rustic tone to it it's just very very easygoing and I would I would say it's bull and but like not necessarily in an insulting way it's like bland for the sake of just being very breezy and very I guess calming and very soothing I will say that about it it's soothing it's just that when I'm done listening to it I I can barely recollect any of it I personally am surprised because this Oliver Francis album this is exactly the type of slickly produced atmospheric super melodic not a care in the world sad sing song a white boy trap that I usually outright detest and avoid it all costs is actually not bad this is like very listenable pretty very easygoing relaxing album sound a lot of good things about it you know I could see young lien fans really getting into this this is actually what the the the quality level of performance and production and just I don't know coherence that I would love for you know people sort of affiliated with the whole sadboys movement to be bringing to the table it's it's often the fact that they sound so sloppy and off-the-cuff and totally just like on another fucking planet that makes me so eager to tune out of their music and go listen to something else Oliver Francis actually sounds focused on a track you know as you know kind of a cool and sort of natural he does sound on a song though he doesn't come off like a guy who something is trying too hard I digress if anything I've said so far interests you listen to this hey you got your pop in my palm oh yeah we've got your Punk in my pop buddy oh you got your pop punk in my god I don't like this very much unfortunately this is just kind of one of those EPS where it's it's just a what sounds like a lot of stuff from the cutting room floor of the album that preceded it I mean if you are a die-hard fan this is certainly worth checking out but in my opinion there are a lot of very underwhelming spacey cuts on here than there are other tracks that are a little more bold in-your-face but kind of experimental the beats being weirdly mixed kind of demo quality and some of the more experimental elements of them being somewhat ill-conceived again it just feels like tracks that were not completely groomed not fully finished but they're certainly like some interesting ideas they're ideas that were worth stringing together into a post album EP so you know if you're looking for some experimental out-there odd art pop and you don't mind it being kind of rough around the edges give this thing a shot and please give a note these last album latest album a listen as well because that was that was pretty good [Music] oh it's just so fantastically oh okay and that's really all you can say about it is just so amazingly okay um this is written in a lot of ways is just so average for a chef you know better and gez is on the thing why ah this this was so muddy to me God the the production leaves so much to be desired on this record I really liked artificial brains last album but this album just really fell off for me the the the technical blackened death metal sounds of the band just do not translate through this mess of a mix and I'm not really enjoying the change-up in the Vogel's either the vocals in compares some of the last record now they sound like I'm listening to pitch adjusted pig squeals getting flushed down a toilet not not a good sound I mean the guitar playing the drums the the technicality of the performances sounds really good really tight really amazing but the vocals the recording it's all just so [Music] big rock fans hey baby baby I gotta get to white Reaper on this one I think they really improved their sound on this record this is a pretty solid I'll say very solid power pop record with some antenna k-- weed guitars and like some cool solos too like they kind of brought it back to an old-school radio rock sound it's got a bit of a classic rock vibe but they keep that garage punk attitude that their music has always had there's just so much more detail and I think personality on what they're doing here personally I think the vocals are still you know they leave a bit to be desired they're not that distinct they're not that memorable and for the most part they kind of just kind of fit as a placeholder because there were this kind of music you should have some vocals but as far as the hook writing the guitar work some of the drums on here too because there are some great drum beats especially kind of the fills that bring us from one passage of the song to the next there's a lot of good things on this album you know it's obviously not the band reinventing the wheel or anything like that but I find what they're doing here far more interesting than anything they've done thus far and you know with the album just being around a half an hour so it's like a no-brainer it's pretty breezy fun catchy little listen so definitely on let this album slip by you if you're into classic rock if you're into garage punk if you're in a power pop don't let it slip by you dump dope dope dope dope [Music] uh-uh the the nostalgia the nostalgia my friends used to really like this band in high school and I thought they were decent but I was never a huge fan and this new album isn't exactly rekindling my casual interest in them you [Music] honestly I don't really get the extreme hate this record is getting so far from some people who have seen on the Internet I mean it's definitely not as underwhelming in my opinion as their last record if anything they kind of went back to the somewhat dancer more lively but very cool and sensual sound a ritual Union and I like that album quite a bit but I will admit it does sound like little dragon are kind of striving for a direction to go in there kind of spinning their wheels in the mud a little bit on this record everything on this album I feel like I've heard them do before or do before a little better you know with the exception of maybe tracks like sweet for example which I really liked yeah I mean this just didn't really feel like anything new or exciting for a little dragon and I don't know I'm just kind of hoping for something a little bit more innovative on the on the next album I don't know outside of a couple tracks where it seems like tennis is delivering a some more interesting than usual lyrics this is really the same kind of sickeningly sweet nostalgia that has turned me off of a lot of their past records too with a lot of the songwriting as being so substance less and and boring you know it's kind of like a fake polaroid or one of those guitars that that are Road worn like they're not an old guitar but it's sort of like you know aesthetically fuck twist to sort of make it look like it's old kind of a lie but but anyway yet what what am I even saying [Music] good yeah that that was that that was AI was below me that was below you you deserve better heavy metal renditions of multiple classics from the Disney musical catalog why not why the fuck not it's more entertaining than the edge Sheeran albums more entertaining the more life I should rather listen to Drake go to marsac ha you know I was really looking forward to this thing and I just did not end up liking I revisited this thing again and again and again and now I feel like I'm past the point where a review of this would even be timely it it's an okay tape they're elements of it that I enjoy but I mean this is a real departure from what sort of made this band so interesting in the first place in my opinion I mean not that I think they should totally trash the direction they move in here you know I think they're doing some really interesting fusions of experimental music and hip hop at noise and rock and punk it's crazy what they're doing in some respects but then again like this this this tape is super low fie and it's not so much lo-fi in the way that I enjoy with other artists where they really kind of use the genre they use the style to kind of explore alternative and different sounds that you usually don't hear on a record rather this just sounds like it was recorded badly especially with the vocals a lot of the vocals are mixed completely out of whack with the instrumentals and are just like super clipping over modulated uh distorted just like shrill dude it's it's awful but the handful of tracks on here that are great of the one featuring Denzel curry for example serious highlights this thing you know I'm going to continue to keep tabs on show me the body because I do think they are doing some some stuff that no other group out there no other band out there is doing and that in and of itself makes them at least worth you know being curious about this to me just kind of felt like it was just like a lot of caution thrown to the wind it does kind of make the tape exciting but I don't really feel the need to return because it's just such a mess position thanks for watching this video other videos next to my head that I think should check out subscribe to the channel official website - yeah eat

Z3Yirj5sooU,I love it you can hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new wale album shine while I is a DC rapper whose music I've covered a handful of times before his last album the album about nothing this record was sort of the commercial successor to his very popular mixtape about nothing you know while I had some good material back in his mixtape back catalogue but unfortunately every single time he goes to put out an album a commercial release it's like the the mediocrities just to get to him in it becomes just merely a barely above-average rapper and this has just been the case again and again and again and again and it's it's to the point now where apparently wale on his latest record over here is trying to just really shoot for the stars and do a mainstream grab a more melodic a more poppy album this time around now I cannot just merely get into this album and talk about the sounds because and I was just going to originally do a quick review of this record but there was a bunch of dramatic that ensued on Twitter that I have to sort of address here quickly and waste your time in my time but of course your boy was on the Twitter's getting reckless dropping some hard-nosed opinions about some tracks from this record and of course while they had to respond because he responds to everybody I'm far from the first publication he's had beef with now while I took issue with my opinion that the song my love on this record was sort of an ugly attempt at crossing over into a more Caribbean sound jumping onto that Caribbean craze that's really big right now thanks to a Drake and his fake patois I got this vibe mostly from the fact that while I brought Diplo and Major Lazer on to produce the track and what are they known for fusing house and western pop music with Caribbean music dancehall reggae and the like I'm not going to sit here and pretend like that vibe doesn't turn up in this instrumental just because of what wale and wizkid and the sunny lead guitar sampled all over the track are doing while I knew what he was doing by bringing Diplo onto this track if he wanted this song to be some kind of musical heritage purity test he would invited him in the first place in a recent interview that somebody was throwing around on Twitter in response to this little beef that Wally and I had going of course Diplo and Major Lazer talked about how they're kind of dipping their toes into these afro pop sounds and in doing this working with artists like wale this is not something that they do all the time they're just trying it they're putting their ears to the ground on this sound and of course in making that transition again those usual Diplo and major laser sounds turn up in the mix and this is a vibe that I get from no other track on the album now while I would love you to believe a few things that this track is a pure expression of Nigerian music despite the fact that Diplo produced it and he has a London singer on the track too he would also like you to believe that I'm bullying him and being mean to him and that I have no idea of what afro beat or afro pop music is despite the fact that I reviewed music that has more of an old-school afro beat sound to it pulling influences from not only African music but soul and jazz and funk music but also have worked in public radio for years and have looked up to broadcasters like George Colleen a of afro-pop worldwide one of the greatest programs you can listen to if you want to know anything about West African contemporary West African music specifically afro beat contemporary afro beat and afro-pop which is basically the biggest musical export out of that area yeah I've just I've just never heard of it well they would also like you to believe that I'm trying to step in here and tell him what's what a is a and B is B and C you see when in reality all I'm trying to get him to do is just admit the direction that he was trying to go in with this track I know a Major Lazer beat when I hear one and this one sounds like an international Chop Suey of ideas just like many other instrumentals they pull together for top 40 listeners and electronic dance music listeners who want to feel like they're not in Kansas anymore so really no I'm not telling wale anything that he doesn't already know the thing is Wally doesn't handle opinions very well but speaking of opinions here are my thoughts on this album honestly I think it's Wally's worst album so far because he completely abandons all the things that made him a somewhat worthwhile artists in the first place and instead tries to come through with this ultra melodic super sappy super poppy rap record that I don't know who he intends it to appeal to running back with little Wayne is one of the most mediocre songs on the entire album hands down should not have been the starter for the record it gets even worse on Scarface Rosa Gotti where while a singing is god-awful and goofy it's actually consistently goofy through the entire record I cannot help but laugh at songs like CC white as wale is just crooning out no lumber and maybe I didn't make this clear enough when I was tweeting about the tracks on this album originally but what makes these tracks so bad is just wale singing voice and the lyrics it's not that I have a personal issue with the musical style he's shooting for on this album or even that I think that some publications have said that I'm accusing him of cultural appropriation if you know anything about my opinion on that subject matter you know that's completely ridiculous mostly because I think if you're going to call out wale for cultural appropriation you've got to call out everybody for cultural appropriation and cultural appropriation is the standard in the American music industry and I didn't really think this is an example of it specifically the song my love that I was highlighting not only because wale himself is Nigerian so how can he be culturally appropriating Nigerian elements of music but also Caribbean music and dancehall is a pretty big influence in a lot of modern afro-pop and afro beat music which is a myriad of different modern styles of music the fact that a dancehall sound would show up in an afro beat or an afro pop song these days is not an oddity so how this track could be cultural appropriation it doesn't even make sense all I was trying to say in my tweet is what many other people have pointed out already in their reviews of this album and that is that wale is trying to go for a more mainstream sound a more melodic sound on this record and he's really falling flat on his face because he is not a singer he could have easily brought other singers on to this record to sing in place of him and then maybe he just kind of continued to fill that rap role instead but no he had to sing all over this record and God is a terrible no where is his attempt at singing more miserable than it is on the song my PYT where he basically bastard eise's the legendary Michael Jackson hook with again some really lazy singing their point on the song where the hook goes my my PYT why you would say my and is still out my immediately after and then continue to spell PYT makes no goddamn sense which I mean you know really when you look at this cover doesn't it just look like anything goes it's a chubby baby hand grabbing the moon you know now that I've said that about the track my PYT I I will say I do think his singing is maybe slightly goofy or on the song fine girl then move on girl which if you're talking about modern afro beats this song is probably the purest expression of that on this entire album and in the process while he brings on two artists with Nigerian roots to sort of give the track more stylistic legitimacy which conceptually is fine it's just that wale sounds so awful on the track but in a way though on this track I have to kind of give him some credit because the thing is there are a lot of mainstream rap artists right now who are trying to bring an afro pop sound to the table I'm not entirely sure if a Western audience is ready to jump on this sound yet is ready to embrace this sound in the way that the mainstream has embraced dancehall over the past year or so but it's one of the few things on this album I can applaud wale on because it seems legitimately risky I'm just really not sure what else to say about this album because before while they turned this whole thing into drama there really wasn't much to say about this record wall-e is giving up nearly everything that made him somewhat interesting over the years just so he can jump on these buttery smooth instrumentals this sing-songy pop rap hype train he takes a few risks here and they're dropping tracks that have more of an afro pop influence one of which is a mix of a couple different sounds because he brought in Diplo and Major Lazer but really what he's trying to do stylistically on this album is irrelevant because he doesn't have the singing chops to really execute any of it so I'm feeling a decent too strong opinion on this album because wale this is this is all an opinion nobody's picking on you nobody's being mean to you do i and no other reviewer out there are telling you what to think or trying to tell you what you're doing because you know what you're doing have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and have a nice day I hope you enjoyed this wale album more than me what am I going to say but but forever 
jeHGfiHDwxc,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd doing a quick off-the-cuff review here of the new cashmere cat record 9 cashmere cat producer whose music has usually been pretty I don't know wonky very low-key haven't really been huge on it in the past because there hasn't been you know I guess a great amount of passion it's stirred up within me you know sort of just being very laid-back sort of seems to be the goal in his music that's not necessarily something that sort of gets me chasing after an album but you know I see the appeal however it seems like there's been a big change of pace on this latest record over here not in the amount of excitement that goes into a cashmere cat record this album still seems very low-key however I think he's taking a really experimental approach to a lot of different styles of contemporary popular music right now you know whether that be electronic dance music or just kind of your general top 40 flavored pop alternative R&B there's actually like a touch of that kind of PC music bubblegum bass sound that's really popular right now and I think the results are pretty cool I mean there is something about this record that kind of reminds me of Drake's more life in that each song really kind of feels like a motif like it's pop music that doesn't necessarily pop like there's not a strong presence of a hook on some of these tracks a lot of the songs seem to sort of follow a bit more of a linear structure maybe there's a climax at one point at the song or at the end of the song or and when there is a hook on here like the song with Selena Gomez it's god-awful it's terrible so you know I guess I more liked the idea on this album of cashmere cat playing with these pop sounds but doing something sort of amorphous with it something that's very laid-back something that's very beautiful a lot of the time especially with the the vocal layering on this record especially with some of the synth parts on this record there's actually a song called Victoria where there's actually this really tight and intense EDM stock build-up but then when the drop should come through it's just like you know really subtle very easygoing bass line sort of trails off into something else it's like he's doing everything that he can to not like make a banger on this record so you know it's very intentional that this album be a very laid-back experience even sort of tricks you into thinking it's got to do something that it's not at some points again it is very pretty record I do think you know sonically and in the way he arranges again some of these vocals and synth parts is very pretty too I guess I just wish it was more well groomed I mean he certainly has the sonic palette to come together with a quality pop record and looking at some of the vocal guests on this thing you would probably go into this record assuming that whoa he's like totally turned a new leaf and now he's going to come through with his mainstream project over here but this is that's still very much not the case on this thing it's still very alternative it's still very left-field it's still very kind of dodgy it's trying to do something a little weird with these pop sounds it may sound like a pop record but structurally and conceptually he's doing something really different it's kind of like he's ripping pop music apart and restructuring it kind of in his own image or sort of in a sculpture that he feels is more reflective of kind of what he's shooting for artistically he's not just kind of doing pop by the numbers over here in that respect I do think what this album is doing is really interesting is really creative is definitely left-field but there are some moments where he does kind of fly too close to that pop light and the result is that you're just hearing an awful hook you're hearing a weak pop song meanwhile though I do kind of wish that he was making that full step either toward making better pop music more quality pop music or just doing something else that was just a bit more eventful because while I do like to use doing something experimental and unexpected with these sounds I wish it was just more engaging material on here because there are too many tracks that just kind of feel like you know they're just merely meant to take up time until the next song comes in and that's what kind of reminds me again of Drake's more life playlist album it's kind of like each track is just kind of meant to fill the space in the background and all the songs kind of segue into each other no track has like a really strong demanding sound or personality to it so that you can just kind breezily listen to the old the you could breezily listen to the whole thing and it feels like one uniform experience but yeah I'm going to leave it at that I thought it was decent definitely my I guess definitely the most entertained have come away from a cashmere cat album am I expecting him to go further down this road or make any major alterations to this sound in the future I don't really know but uh you know all I know is that right now I am curious as to where he will go next for sure and I'm going to leave it at that thank you for watching and hope you dug on this album let me know what you thought of it down in the description and I will catch you guys in the next video forever

AKBopAbun5g,hey everyone tobu talking here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Feist album nasiha - pleasure pleasure singer/songwriter Leslie Feist she's back with her first album in six years following up the album metals and believe it or not it's now been 10 years since her big indie pop breakout sensation the reminder now fights last album metals I was pretty lukewarm on that project didn't really care for it clearly she was trying to make a break away from being pigeon-holed into the indie pop corner people were throwing her into in the 2000s personally I guess I just thought the transition she had made to a raw or skeletal sound was just a little awkward but with pleasure over here she seems to be continuing down that road however this time around I think the results are so much more gratifying this record over here it's beautiful its raw it's loose it's in the moment it's enjoyably spontaneous Leslie's music hasn't sounded this rough around the edges since monarch but that record is her first full-length record the difference between now and then is that there's so much more confidence in Feist music there's so much more swagger on this album she's kind of going back to a rougher sound with a purpose now it's not just because you know that's just sort of the position she was in at the time and I'm not trying to say that this is a loaf I album it's so dirty and badly recorded that it's unlistenable or anything like that it's a very dynamic record it's just that you know there's just something very natural and organic about the sound of this album there's a lot of ambient sound around the drums and the vocals there are a lot of very natural smudges and mix and scars to the sound of this record all of it just adds to how intimate and personal feels I really like the vibe of this album the distant drums the kind of messy blemished guitars the layers of background vocals and Leslie's gorgeous voice which is sometimes manic sometimes very reserved in quiet and somber sometimes very passionate tons of conviction and the performances on this record instrumentally lots of chemistry on this thing it really feels like Leslie is letting go of any and all artistic intuitions on this album to maybe be simple is it incredibly straightforward and vulnerable and raw acoustic guitar ballad there's really nothing gussied-up about it but then in the second half we get some nice organ chords and background vocals to kind of warm it up and just bring it some body the song century also features a very strange spoken word passage from Jarvis Cocker at the very end which I absolutely love his voice is amazing he brings so much drama to the track I love the way that his words kind of play against the refrain of you know sort of choral vocals that a play through at the end of the cut and on the track a man is not his song there is a very strange and unexpected Mastodon sample that booms its way into the very finish of the track there's some enjoyably weird ideas on this album that I think bring the record a lot of character but ultimately it's the quality of the songs that I think sell this thing pleasure is the title track of this record that kicks the entire album off and even though it does have a slow burner start for me the song just gets a strong whiff of urgency as soon as the driving kind of route and though guitar leads start popping up in the track and just giving the song a really propulsive rhythm Leslie's anxious vibrato at this point in the song also gives the track a lot of tension even though there's not a whole lot going on I love the way her voice goes dark right before the chorus build up in the way that her guitars just kind of blasts in suddenly with this loud crunchy roaring sound the track smooths out beautifully right after moves through different musical phases seems to incorporate what sounds like either some woodwinds or strings or something at some point just to kind of give it a bit of a more panoramic presentation not entirely sure what that sound is but it sounds great and held the rock-and-roll finish of the track at the very end it has kind of a very Velvet Underground vibe to it there's also something very skeletal and raw about this record that kind of reminds me of some of the more minimalist records in Scout niblets catalog I also think in a lot of ways this album is the kindred spirit to PJ Harvey's letting gland shake I love the chilling refrain and growing emotional intensity of the song lost dreams the gradual momentum of the track is great the droning climax of the track is awesome as well very dissonant and very bright and I love how immediately after the song kind of smoothes out it's very dreamy hypnotic outro the song any party is a big contrast from that because it's not so much smooth as much as it is clumsy almost purposefully so with these guitar chords that are just kind of like stumbling drunk all over the track also these kind of twang II scratch our we're more like a noisy guitar lead sort of weaved into these chords just to give them a little bit more swagger I love how wild and ungroomed the song is I also enjoy the tracks lyrics of devotion where Feist is singing about how she'd leave any party for this particular person who she has in mind even if it's a good party there's a satisfyingly epic finish to the song - that's fantastic and a man is not his song is not only one of the most thoughtful songs on this record maybe the most awful song on this record one of the most thoughtful songs have heard in a while I mean not only is it a bit of a reflection on masculinity and femininity but really it's a strong statement on separating the artist from his art that the person who wrote a particular song or created a particular thing is not necessarily that thing Feist goes on to comment beyond that saying that she is not a story as if she had been sort of the the subject or the person featured in maybe a story or a tale that was a featured in a song that maybe another man who she knew wrote I love the patience and that it beats that pulsate away gently in the back of the wind something that really could have derailed the dynamics of this track big time or made it feel really just redundant and stale but it said the song really is kept fresh with some emotional vocal performances and some subtle embellishments throughout the track of some keyboard some vocal harmonies some horns also fights filthy guitars on this track are really impressive - I just love the variety of textures that consistently pop up in each track it's always a different sound palate while staying true to that kind of raw intimate feel then there's the very bluesy I'm not running away which is an emotional stutter I'd say you know it's just another great addition to the tracklisting there's not a whole lot about the song that in my opinion needs explaining everything great about it is just so there on the surface solid chord progression wailing guitar leads the sassy shots of group vocals pop up here and there in the track how dynamic the vocal performance on this track is I really only had a few complaints walking away from this record I think some of the topics and lyrical subjects of the album could have been maybe a tad more original I think a man is not his song as such an interesting idea for a track I would love to see Feist in the future explore more alternative song themes I wish that I wish I didn't miss you had more instrumental layers to speak of the weird sort of vocal effects thrown on Leslie's voice for me it's just not enough to fill up the track and give it body give it something interesting as far as like a sonic angle I just sort of like something on this track to give the hook a little bit more weight and I'm getting out high and get not low the verses on this track are so tense they're so spacious they're so open I just wish they were a little bit more busy a little bit more active and the verse while it is definitely a bit of a visceral cathartic release you know a little bit of bass pops in a little bit of rhythm pops and I still wish that that drop that progression that that that moment of eargasm could have been a little bit stronger more intense the song is just a little more shy and dodgy than I would like it to be and the closer I wish just had a bigger presentation to it especially since when you read into the lyrics of the song the track seems so confessional it seems like such a strong affirming monologue type moment and I would say even the epic organ chords on the track kind of lend themselves to that emotion lend themselves to that tone to but the song displayed so quietly it's played so subtly it's played so plainly this really kind of feels like a moment that really should have been a sonically a musically bigger spot on the album because emotionally and fanatical II it's it's huge it's so confessional it's spiced really kind of RIP in the closet open and throwing all those skeletons out I just wish it wasn't you know approached in such a light dainty way still though in my opinion 2017 continues to rack up the quality singer-songwriter records this is another good one in my opinion another great one actually and I think one of the best things faces on in a long time definitely worth checking out even if you consider yourself just to be a hardcore fan of her poppier stuff this is well worth listening to don't miss out on this record don't discount this record because of an experience you had with the past Feist album or an assumption you made about you know what Feist is or what kind of music she makes or whether or not she really appeals to you feeling a decent strong eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit

-VC42DX2NZY,hi everyone didn't you smile Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly great albums segment where I go over records that for me personally were highlights over the course of the month April is out May is in so you know what's so let's mention those records that I thought over the past 30 days were something special one got to give a shout out to the new Joey badass album American Badass my favorite project Joey has released thus far are really interesting record in my opinion where he tries to take on a lot of big huge just big-ticket political issues and while he doesn't come to any sort of big solutions or a closure on any of these issues I think it's really more about kind of the struggle or wrestle that he's having kind of working through these problems I don't get how people were kind of ripping this album apart calling it generic and saying that Oh Joey's just talking a bunch of random politically that we've heard a million times before or you know I wish you just went harder all over the album um you know Joey in my opinion has always been a very dynamic artist an artist who is kind of all over the map emotionally he has quite a bit of low-key songs in his Canon especially I'm like the summer nights mixtape so to kind of hear this side this introspective a very thoughtful very political side of Joey on this album wasn't really anything all that new to me and even though there may be a lot of instrumentals on this thing that are really smooth really jazzy they're actually quite a few moments where vocally and lyrically Joey is really passionate and really aggressive I actually like the fact that the beats kind of take a little bit of a step back because it makes his performances seem that much more significant but you know that's just my take on the record moving on from there I want to give a shout out to the new father John misty album pure comedy love this album oh gosh I love it oh gosh I love it so good oh boy oh boy I love it this is one of my favorite singer-songwriter records in a while and I've heard so many good singer-songwriter records this year between this and then Mount Airy album and of the new Sun Kil moon album but this is really just like taking the cake for me I love Josh Tillman sense of humor on this record I love the way that he highlights issues and problems with the human condition on this album I find about the ballads beautiful on this record and I don't know what else to say man I mean it is a long record I don't think Josh really kind of beats the audience over their heads with his sense of humor you really ought to kind of read into what he's saying to get the joke but I love the way that his comedy is juxtaposed against you know these very beautiful and sometimes very sad dreary songs and realizations you know this album very much kind of has the attitude toward the very dark and disgusting world that we live in that I do I can't help but laugh at some of the insanity that the world presents to me every day so you know and I don't know I can't do anything else of that other than laughs so you know this record kind of indulges me in that feeling I guess which is maybe why I'm connecting so much with it personally a lot of people you know I understand that this album is not is not destined for the top of the Billboard charts but uh you know I think if you just kind of reframe the way you're looking at this record a little bit and just kind of see that you know it's it's not that serious of an album it is titled pure comedy for a reason you know you might get a little more out of it moving on from there I want to give a shout out to the new obivious sound machine album yay God oh this this is everything I wanted out of an a video sound machine record and of all the records that I loved over the past 30 days this this one did not get as many views as I wanted so I know they're probably some people go into this video like who the hell's a big Bo sound machine a video sound machine this great band from the UK who are melding elements of electronic music and dance music and pop music since pop disco and afro beat all together at once and it's just an amazing funky physical mix of all these ideas and they just come together so well on the record of course you know groups in the past groups who they seem to take direct influence from have have sort of made these combinations before you know Talking Heads for example I think is probably the biggest standout comparison there but they really take it a step further not only with a lot of the rhythms and tunes and especially the lyrics being of African origin but I think you know sort of being a newer band they're kind of able to have a bigger sort of bird's-eye view of all these different sounds and all these different styles and sort of meld them together in sort of new creative ways you know their moments on this thing where it sounds like they're they're pulling a little bit more from post-punk moments where it seems like the colon a little bit more from synth pop moments or it seems like they're pulling a little bit more from disco it's a really great record it's a really fun captivating colorful vivid listen and if you know you just want to get up out of your chair and just not bad this is the  album - do it - I apologize I'm just passionate about that record that's all moving on from there I want to give a shout out to the new Kendrick Lamar album dead damn I really like this record I do like it it is one of the bigger and more standout records for me of this month I mean I get it I don't think it's one of the best albums he's ever put out uh some people seem to take take umbrage with that and that's fine you know you can be mad at me over that I it's not going to make me like or dislike the album any more any less or whatever I still kind of feel the same way I do about the record though I do think I may revisit the album this coming this month at some point sort of in a podcast doing sort of post Kendrick Lamar autopsy for this record which I think might make for an interesting discussion sort of give the album a month let the dust settle a little bit and sort of have a final word on not just the album itself but kind of the aftermath and the impact of it the ones a hit so you know that should be pretty cool but moving on from there finally I want to give a shout out to an album that it took me a while to sort of get through to finally review it because it is a long record it's two and a half hours long and that is the new magnetic fields album 50 song memoir which was a pretty entertaining record for me given that it is 50 songs there are a lot of duds on this thing but Stephen Merritt does come through with a fun and very entertaining set of tracks it's just that the very tail end of the project I think the album starts dishing out its worst songs and I think only two maybe the halfway point does the record feel even somewhat autobiographical but for the songs on this record that do kind of fit that memoir archetype you know I really love what Stephen Merritt sort of has to say about his youth also his days in his teens and his 20s his infatuation with music and in various sort of music related pieces of music related things like instruments or culture on the second disc of the album a lot of great things about this record it's not a perfect album and I don't even think it executes it's you know it's it's a concept as stated in the title as well as it possibly could have but I do think you know it is one of the better albums the magnetic fields have have released in a while I'll say that and I don't think it's necessarily the worst introduction for people who are new to the band though if you have not heard of magnetic fields before please 69 love songs and you know check out the stuff that they release even before that but there you go those are my thoughts and those are my recommendations for this month I hope you guys had a good month and heard a lot of good records and you're the best I'll see you in the next video transition thanks for watching this video other videos next to my head that I think you should check out subscribe to the channel official website - yeah yeah eat your fruits and veggies stay hydrated and stop wearing tie-dye hoodies forever 
Uooqk3B0kC4,uh hi everyone next and he hurts channa here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new gorillaz album humans gorillas the long-running virtual band masterminded by musician and producer Damon Albarn and comic book artist Jamie Hewlett over the years they've come out with some great music you could actually make the argument that as far as contemporary groups go they have one of the more consistent discographies out there but after their last album cycle there was all this talk all this speculation as to whether or not we would even see another gorillas album again Damon Albarn seemed disinterested he was just kind of focusing more on like solo material came out with that new blur album Jamie Hewlett commented on just the massive amount of effort and production that goes into each album cycle which he seems sort of dissatisfied with along with the fact that it's it's almost as if his illustrations his visuals were playing less and less of an integral role in the existence of the band which is kind of exemplified in our releases like the fall which was very much a bit of an indulgent Damon Albarn stripped-down solo sort of venture as well as even the new music video these guys dropped featuring Benjamin Clementine which mostly featured Clementine in front of a green screen with only a few minor visual references to gorillas the band themselves the visuals for Andromeda work even more uninspired as it's just kind of this spinning redundant CGI animation of a planet and it's orbiting asteroid belt but then we have the video for Saturn's bars which does seem to legitimately follow the usual guerrillas formula the band are out there in a precarious situation they're sort of an evil kind of presence in the video which is represented visually by these monster characters that are sort of embodying popkins voice on the track however do I find this inclusion of these sorts of dark monstrous mutant characters as iconic as previous music videos do I feel like pop kin is even embodying a character on this track I mean I do like the song but it feels like he's just kind of playing himself on the song not some kind of representation of some sort of being in the gorillas universe I know leading up to the promotion of this album there were all sorts of pieces of social media art that were released along with elaborate backstories about each member of gorillas I appreciate that that was you know kind of interesting approach to put out a new gorillas album in 2017 but did I find it as immersive as what the band did with the visuals with demon days or with Plastic Beach and I guess what I'm trying to say is that even though I'm excited that there's another gorillas album in existence I'm wondering is everyone involved trying as hard as they possibly can to make this record the best gorillas album that it can be our Jaime Hewlett's visuals is his input as central as has been on past records and as Damon Albarn in the mindset to produce and write a new gorillaz album meaning considering his past couple of solo records considering the new blur album will the easygoing grey breezy and dreary demeanor of those records also kind of seep into this new gorillaz album - I would hope not and I know that Damon is responsible for gorillas music but the thing is gorillas is not about him gorillas is about creating music for a band that doesn't really exist it's about creating music that's kind of otherworldly it's from a different place and it's so vibrant and it's so creative and detailed that it feels real suspending that disbelief is part of what makes the project and makes the band so intriguing and entertaining and if you think that girl is is really just about Damon Albarn producing some kooky cartoony music you're fundamentally missing what has made gorillas such a unique project in contemporary music now I get that Damon's emotions are going to turn up on a gorilla's album his thoughts are going to turn up on a gorilla's album but when they do they have to manifest themselves through the characters through the world that they existed but the thing is on humans I don't think Damon gives the audience any reason to suspend disbelief it's to the point where the virtual band has kind lost its identity because the vibe is that it's just no longer 2d in the gang it's just Damon producing for a bunch of artists that he likes and throwing them together on to an album that runs sort of like a compilation while also trying to make some sort of statement on the current social and political climate which he doesn't fully commit to because there's been a slew of articles talking about how Damon edited out any and all references to Donald Trump in the album prior to release which I get this is a hot-button topic for a lot of people for a lot of musicians but why would Donald Trump be there in the first place is Donald Trump Gorillaz cannon now there are other tracks on here that make reference to political and social issues but they kind of just dance around the topics that inspire them and I don't know if it's because Damon doesn't have a real opinion or any solid ideas about these problems or if he's afraid of kind of going too hard on these issues because maybe it'll alienate fans maybe it'll be breaking the fourth wall a little too much he clearly uses his guests on this record to make political points that he can't people like push a tee and Danny Brown and Vince staples whose verses are you know very very charged with us very coarse and very socially conscious language right at the start of the record and the vague politics of this album aren't really made any clearer by the numerous interludes that play throughout the album that I don't really think add that much to the record but the thing is the the ideology and the politics of this record isn't as a great an issue as something I caught a whiff of with four of the major teaser tracks to this album Saturn's bars ascension we got the power and the song Andromeda and that is there numerous cases of just bad casting on this album Damon Albarn misplacing guests on this record underutilizing them over utilizing them for instance drams vocal contributions to this record are mere musical footnote he's so faint that he's barely there on the song where he appears in compares and other tracks where guests dominate the entire song to the point where it barely even feels like a gorilla's track because even two DS vocals are not that present also Danny Brown on the song submission really what about the hook here what about the instrumental said you know what Danny Brown needs to be here his wild yell pee delivery does not sound good at all on what could be confused as a little dragon song and not that I think Danny Browns verse is bad on this track I like it it's just that I think he could have been better placed here and I still think Benjamin Clementine on hallelujah money is not really all that well complemented by the songs very stiff and static beats sure the choral vocals sound good in the string section sound great but those tic-tock tic-tock very experienced static beats are really kind of keeping the song from being as dynamic as it could be generally I don't really have any problem with the performances or the lyrics that any one guest brings to the table I mean appearances from Grace Jones and push a tee and Mavis Staples are among this album's highlights but not only is it the placement of these guests that I think makes this album sort of lackluster but it's kind of the production in the writing too it's just not up to guerrillas usual vibrancy and quirk the song moments is the first huge nosedive on this record in my opinion a song featuring De La Soul which when De La Soul turns up on a gorilla's album that should be great news and for the most part it is I love their performance I love their lyrics I love their charisma I love their energy I love their playful attitude I actually love the cool keyboard intro on this track the ROS vocals I think are amazing they're so hard-hitting and exciting and colorful also the crazy picking and vocals later in the tracker great the swirling synth arpeggios are amazing but god damn this kick drum is one of the most hideous things I've heard on any song in 2017 and where did this bassline come from its garish wouldn't a smoother funkier more polyrhythmic set of drums on the track just make more sense instead of this overbearing to me it just kind of seems like damon albarn shooting for zany because he thinks that's how a gorilla's song should sound but he just round up at ugly now there are lots of wild sort of off-the-wall tracks in the first half of the record that i like quite a bit love ascension of vince staples lyrics here like I said bring a sort of dark very political tone almost apocalyptic in a sense a vibe that I wish carry throughout more of the album I think would have brought a stronger more cohesive theme to the record the very driving and danceable strobe light is my favorite track on the album but it's at least likable and I think lyrically it does kind of play into this theme of chaos going on in your life things changing but also trying to get that strobe light off you so that you could lead a more peaceful existence and charger with Grace Jones is incredible I love the booming beat I love how epic and expressive her performances I think the buzzing sort of sampled guitars on the track were I'm kind of revving up all over the song are crazy to Dee's sort of talk some passages on the song come off as sort of sassy and sarcastic definitely the most attitude he brings on the entire album you know if I was talking about the record simply up until this point it's not really that bad in fact it's actually pretty damn good a little inconsistent but that's it but immediately after this track the quality of the album trails off even further it's like damon completely gives up on keeping the songs lively or even completely finished case in point the song sex murder party was this even written their moments on this track where Jamie principals vocals just seemed totally off-the-cuff and improvised there are numerous moments of like awkward silence where I feel like something should be the lyrics seem kind of dodgy to like they're also being made up on the spot if it wasn't for 2ds hook on the track they're literally be nothing likable about the song and in the case of Carnival with Anthony Hamilton I loved Anthony's voice but this track is just so redundant and fizzles out right at the end and also there there are a lot of weird spots on here vocally to where it's like their moments of dead silence spots where I think Anthony should be singing or saying something there are also some very subtle moments on the track where it seems like his vocals getting cut off or edited out or something did this have something to do with the whole Donald Trump thing I don't know but there's definitely something off about the editing on his vocals the song busted in blue just kind of seems like damon albarn taking a quirkier approach to producing what would be another dreary and lifeless I'm so sad ballad from one of his recent solo records and we got the power probably still ranks as my least favorite track on the entire album not only because I think again Jenny Beth serious Mis placement on this track her vocals don't really lend themselves at all to the very triumphant and colorful and over-the-top presentation of the song and the more than I listen to the track it's not even just her vocals that make it lackluster but the mixing is terrible all these vocal layers competing and sort of smothering each other and kind of mixing together in a really ugly way with the synths on this track it's really one of the most cluttered songs on the entire record and I have no idea with just Gorillaz reputation for such clean quality production that this track ended up being such a mess not only sonically but man is this the clunkiest hook that Damon Albarn has ever written for a gorilla's record we got the power to do this thing that we really want to do and we got the power we got the power to do then do of the thing now I have a lot of people asking me to talk about the bonus tracks on the deluxe version of this record I don't typically count deluxe bonus tracks in my overall ranking my overall rating for a record and believe me in this instance you don't want me to still though I do like the fact that Damon kind of provided this interlude to kind of glide us into these tracks so they didn't feel completely tacked on or like a bunch of tracks that weren't worthy of being in the standard edition they definitely feel like they're a part of the world of this album but as far as the quality of the material on this side of the album I don't really think it's much better than all the content that preceded it in some ways I actually think it's worse the song The Apprentice with rag-and-bone man whose solo material I haven't heard too much of uh but this is basically just low-grade synth funk and his performance on this track is one of the most emotionless and passionless on the entire record and halfway to the halfway house has to have one of the ugliest instrumentals on the entire record I don't know if it's the the squelchy bass synth on this thing or if it's the synth lines are just always constantly ascending and don't fit into the chord progression don't fit into the key of the track but something about this song needs to go back to the drawing board it's like I'm listening to odds and ends that could have been on other guerrillas tracks but Damon decided to toss them together into a hideous chop suey the song ticker-tape while it may not be electrifying it is a very sweet and cute and easy going in beautiful laid-back ballad song that I actually would have swapped out for one of the more chilled ballads in the second half of the record earlier on the album and I do like chemo kisses sort of sassy playful rapping on the song out of body quite a bit and another thing that makes this song special and I think more superior to many tracks in the tracklist is that there's this crazy beat switch up and sort of buildup in the second half of the track that's really exciting if only more tracks actually change things up a little bit it didn't try to just give us one groove one beat one idea and just do it to death to the point where by the end of the song just get stale I don't know this is just such an inconsistent lackluster and an almost uninspired album from Damon and company and really confirms almost every fear I had going into this album that you'd have guests that are fine you know are very talented but they're put in awkward places they're not used to the best of their abilities that you have songs that are weakly written our drab are underwhelming because that's how a lot of Damon's recent material solo and with blur has been going an album that would have very little in terms of excitement an album that would only be a gorilla's album in name I'm feeling a light too decent 5 on this record okay well I'm just going to start gathering my things cuz this was a career suicide it's a it's all over guys it's done finished ition have you given the south on the listen is your love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your dire view

happy this week was so much more superior to last week there were so many bad tracks last week I felt like I was going to die but this week it's a 180 it's a total improvement that's not to say that the songs that are bad this week aren't bad at least in my opinion I thought they were lackluster we have a new song from Katy Perry titled bone Appetit I hate this track not because fundamentally I think it's the worst song she's come out with but it just reads like her trying to do a Miley Cyrus song that's how the song feels to me not only that but it seems like she's trying to give that whole vibe with her head and the food and other overt kind of wacky zany and your face sexuality of the track not that inherently I think these are bad things but it just seems like she's doing a total 180 like there's a really significant change to her vibe and her demeanor and her delivery on this track and it's just kind of a I don't know it just seems like somebody's already inhabiting that Lane and doing it pretty fine what are you bringing to this that the other artists especially Miley Cyrus what do you bring this that they aren't already I don't know it just it just kind of seems like a weird change of pace but you know that's just me but even worse than that of course is a brand new Fall Out Boy song Jesus Christ this is are they even a rock band anymore this just sounds like bad electronic music but like like some shitty dubstep stuff like that's how hard and heavy the hook bus in on this track just sounds like a terrible fusion of a dubstep track and an EDM anthem sounds like trash sounds like garbage it's just so overblown it's so overdone the music video is god-awful it's essentially it's essentially about a girl who was raised in a furry compound with people who dressed like yamas and she escapes this abuse one kind of abuse only to end up in a club or Fall Out Boy is playing and did to deal with a completely different kind of abuse I mean if that was me personally I would go back to the llama compound because the horrors of the potential of running into a Fall Out Boy concert is even worse than living in a compound where everybody's dressed like like yamas so I don't know that's that's just me though but the song the song is god-awful and I don't really know what else to say other than that but moving on from there we have some meant tracks tracks that it was kind of on the fence with but are definitely worth mentioning worth endorsing maybe you guys did a little bit more than me got to give a shout out to the new Dan Auerbach track or our back track king of a one-horse town I like the lyrics of this track I like what Dan is trying to do with the narrative with with the story of this track I do think instrumentally it is still a little corny cutesy schmaltzy I feel like em word and she and him are doing this kind of stuff so much better and have already done it to death why is Dan trying to put his two cents in on this really tired boring like aren't we so quaint sort of sound one thing I've always loved in Dan's music especially the best Black Keys albums that there's always kind of been a note of fire and passion and urgency to what the band is done but that is just completely just melted or just vaporized on these new singles I'm hearing out of that is his music so I don't know what to say it's just kind of kind of lackluster dj khaled I'm the one with with a million goddamn features on the thing there's a little lane on this thing chance the rapper Justin Bieber quavo is on this thing um look to be honest this is not as terrible as I thought it was going to be I thought it was going to be like another hold you down if I'm even saying the name of that track correctly I want to erase that song from our memory which is why I may have said that title wrong but you know what song I'm talking about the one with the future and it was a really crappy track I'm trying to wipe that many other songs in DJ Khaled's Skog Rafi from my memory though major key was definitely one of his best records this one though it was not it was not the worst in the world you know I like the feel-good anthem that that's kind of going on with the hook I love how sunny and upbeat the beat is it's not just like trying to go hard and make you think it's too sexy or make you think it's too tough or anything like that it's just a smile inducing nice very sunny track yeah sure it's pretty vapid there's not much substance to it and I do think it is kind of cluttered with every single goddamn feature on the track but I do like at the core what dj khaled was trying to do on this song I understand saying dj khaled is doing something with a song is is weird but you know you know what I'm trying to say here but I'm not going to go too much into it I don't think it's that terrible I don't think it's the worst thing in the world I wasn't expecting much and it was like whoa the very low bar that was down here they just barely surpasses like wow that's that's late that's always a nice thing it's always a nice thing to be surprised moving on from there Jeff Rosenstock has a new track out a post worry track titled Dramamine which I don't know I kind of like his singing on the hook of this track but there's kind of like a weird vocal passage in the song that I didn't really quite get into I like the sound of the track but it's I don't know it just seems like a really weird one off that doesn't say much for me you know maybe I maybe I need to read more into the into this vocal passage that takes up so much of the song but you know it's it it wasn't really it wasn't really Wow an you're getting me or anything like that I just just based off of the vibe just based off of the sound of the track you know hopefully though maybe this is a part of another record I really don't know much about the song honestly all I know is that I didn't really love what I heard it was just okay but for the hardcore fans out there just wanted to shout it out just say that you're aware there's a new Jeff Rosenstock out there I got to give a shout out to the new PJ Harvey single a dog called money which is pretty underwhelming it's very low-key but the PJ Harvey fans you probably want to check it out it's a new you know post post [Music] sorry I'm a little sleepy another post album single or the first post album single she's dropped not sure if an you know another project is on the way anytime soon but it seems like some some Africa thought material just had that seep out there that she had to get out Christian Scott a ton de água has a new track out also featuring Elena Pender Pender Hughes which if you remember her from one of his recent albums you know some great flute solos all over that this new track over here it's very Airy it's very smooth as far as contemporary jazz music goes didn't really strike me as all that urgent or really all that adventurous in terms of like fusions of different genres coming together like a non-stretch which i liked so much this to me just felt like they were playing a little too straight that you know there was like some decent solos and decent performances on this track it just didn't really strike me as all that fiery or exciting you know that's all I'm saying but for the Jazz heads out there people who haven't been enjoying Christian Scott's output do check this song out don't miss it and he has a new record coming out this year as well so that's good news jouji aka George aka pink guy aka filthy Frank has a new solo track out a new solo single everybody's been dogging this dude like hey when you're going to come out with more serious music more real music well here you have it ladies and gentlemen a real song a real serious song from Joe G and um you know it's okay it's like kind of a cloudy sad piece of homespun hip-hop with a song hook it's very moody it's very good moo moo and you know I think fans really seem to be getting down with that you know fans love here in the Moody sad raps right now it's not really kind of coming from where I'm coming from you know uh I'm not feeling that excited about the track personally I do think you know I think George pulls together some pretty solid stuff considering that it all seems to be kind of like on the fly sort of DIY you know sort of endeavor and considering you know just how silly and crappy people think some of his pink guy music is when he cleans up and tries to put out something you know like something serious as it were you know it's actually kind of surprising it's like well this is the same guy so effectively again you know I think he succeeded kind of creating that different artistic vibe when he sort of creates music under this name you know uh and and clearly uh clearly he's going through a little bit of something because this is not a track that you come out with when you're feeling when you're feeling like you're in a great mood what I do think is is it is a decent track it you see the hype behind the track and I don't know maybe uh maybe we're going to see more music under this name or music of this style in the future I don't know or maybe this is just kind of one off one off thing but considering this is coming out on the YouTube channel that it is when are we going to see that rich chigga collaboration that's what I want to know when are we going to see some like a rich chigga full collab mixtape or some  that's what I want to know moving on from there couple more tracks blondie has a new song out titled fragments now nearly every blondie song so far from this forthcoming record I felt was badly performed sounded awkward but this track was really kind of a change of pace I thought this song was epic I thought it was emotionally potent I loved Debbie Harry's performance on this track I feel like she really kind of gives it her all I like the chord progression of the track you know there are a lot of things I love about this on lyrically and musically but what's funny is Adam of your movie sucks actually wrote this song and I knew this because weeks and weeks weeks ago Adam had hit me up on Twitter and said hey man like have you been following this blondie record like what do you think of this track this new track I was like go ahead and like it and he was you know kind of asking me questions about it and more and more questions and I was just like why is he so curious about my thoughts on this album and he says hey man if I tell you something kid can you keep a secret and I said yeah sure and he's like I wrote one of the songs on this record and I was like what how does that even happen like what what is the story behind that and I guess a member of the band is a really big fan of the YouTube channel and he promotes his artistic stuff his music stuff on his YouTube channel and through that of the song got back to him and the rest of the band and they were like wow I really like this track and we want to cover it and so they approached him and they got permission and now the song is on the freaking record and it's kind of shaping up to be one of the best songs on the album and it's interesting going back and listening to the original they really reinvented it and I don't know Adam Adam should be really happy Adam should be really proud honestly because I think you know not only is it a great song for for blondie but I think it's a you know really cool to kind of hear his vision sort of fed through kind of the the studio animal you know like because the original is very demo quality you know and Adams vocals were like really kind of rough around the edges and now it's sort of like been turned to this entirely different animal and I feel like the full potential of the song has almost been like reached through this this blondie cover so give a listen to the track it is a great song I do kind of like the rawness and the bluntness of the lyrics a lot and you know I mean hopefully I end up liking more tracks from this Montee album I'm not anticipating it but I had to highlight this not only because of that you know sort of your movie sucks connection shout out to Adam love you dude you're the best but uh you know I had to shout it out just because of how good I thought the track was moving on from there of force words has a new track out titled panic that I like a lot really primal cerebral rhythms on this track something almost like almost like I'm listening to this be coming out of the jungle or some it's a very moody very strange tune give it a listen music video is weird and avant-garde as as well so you know go into this expecting to be weirded out got to give a shout-out to algiers the underside of power this new track is powerful is soulful it's hard-hitting it's got that rock kind of somewhat post-punk II edge to it just like so many of the great tracks from the band's last album really anticipating this new song and I feel like those elements of kind of rock music and you know politically motivated black soul music are coming together in a way that's more seamless on this song than before on the previous record not that they felt sort of tacked on or sort of cobbled together but the elements of the music that were coming from one place and the elements of the music that were coming from another place we're very clear but now it sort of seems like they're blending together a little bit more smoothly a little better and I think it's you know it's making for a really great tune in this instance moving on from their scissor has a new track out with Travis Scott titled love galore if you remember of scissors last album super unimpressed with it did not like it at all even scissor herself was pretty pissed off at me and hit me up on Twitter in the DM z-- and was like either telling me how raw I was or telling you like you know how ridiculous I was for like not liking the album it was definitely one of the most negative reactions I've seen an artist have to to one of my reviews but what I think she's doing here and I hope she realizes this is miles ahead of what she was doing on that on that z album on that debut album this over here is so much more sleek and sexy sounds more professional it's more hard-hitting I feel like her delivery has so much more sass to it it's so much more sensual it's so much more exciting again I hope she realizes that she's like beyond what she was doing before like she's miles ahead right I'm not going to say it's some kind of deep experimental crazy alternative R&B or anything like that you know for a piece of music that sounds like a contemporary piece of R&B I think it is very emotional I think it is very powerful I do think it does have you know very strong like mmm there's kind of like that strong like strong physical sexual kind of quality to it that uh that I love you know it's like it's just dripping in like sex sweat I guess this or you know sort of this is probably the best way that I could put it you know and it's also like a little dark - and this is like all without me trying to analyze the music video or anything like that you know I'm just talking about the song I'm just talking about the music itself I think what she's doing is really interesting on this track and I'm hoping for more you know more of like stuff of this quality going forward but moving on from there Mac DeMarco one more love song it's a decent sleepy little ballad probably one of the better sleepy little ballads that I've heard from this album so far but again I feel like the full impact of all these very kind of low-key songs will be felt once I feel once I feel once I hear the entire album so I like that new script and the excuse me new Chris Stapleton song second one - no thought that was a great country tune that was a tub thumper I don't know I don't know what else to say other than that I just thought it was a quality tune like the lyrics like Chris's vocal delivery on this track and I just want to support and want to shout out any country that sort of is like this has that roots eNOS has that rawness to it you know isn't like gussied up you know if I'm listening to something it's coming from that back country place that backwater place that redneck place I want to hear something that feels like it you know I want to hear something that feels like that I want to hear something that sounds like some kind of crazy expensive glitzy studio or some BS like that I want to hear some raw ass country music and while you know Chris Stapleton isn't like hitting in the same way that a a David Allan Coe might you know it's definitely a raw country then I think a lot of us are used to listening to and you know I like hearing a artists do that especially in the contemporary sphere because you know a lot of the country that I like is older I love hearing artists that are that are newer kind of bringing newer contemporary sounds to that kind of authentic kind of country you know down south kind of vibe so I'm liking this track quite a bit want to give a shout out to the new Higham song right now the girls in Haim are back with a new track that is doesn't sound like a studio track I don't think this is the studio track sounds like they're doing some kind of like session thing on this song as a recording to not only the sound of the track with the music video too and this is not kind of one of those hard straightforward rockers that the band has come out with in the past this is more of like a very drawn-out very dramatic ballad type situation and you know we haven't heard too many songs like this from the band at least not this dramatic at least not this strung out and actually those over pretty well I think it's pretty powerful you know maybe the studio version will be so significant so significantly different that I don't like it you know unfortunately that that could end up being the case but hopefully you know whenever we hear the studio version of this track they stay true to i guess just how intimate the performance was of this studio version of the track you know obviously they're probably a million different ways you could record and rerecord this song but I love the into me of the intimacy of this track I loved the emotion of this track again I love the drama of the track and hopefully that's maintained on whatever version we end up hearing of this song from their forthcoming record moving on from there I want to give a shout out to Daniel Harlow of the PC music camp new single out titled me for you featuring Maury which I thought was a good quirky piece of electronically tinged local pop you know exactly the kind of you know hitting that good balance between hey it's weird hey it's left-field hey it's kind of strange but whoa it's super sweet it's candy on my ears sort of vibe that I get a lot of PC musics tracks liking that direction on the song - I want to give a shout-out to the mountain goats new song titled rain in Soho the mountain goats are coming out with an album very soon that apparently is guitar free and this song is of course you know kind of staying true to that promise and it's a really dramatic track a sort of big like choral vocals coming in the background like doe doe doe doe it's it's like our some really weird arrangements that are very strange and kind of unexpected on the song but honestly vocally as far as like emotional performance and lyrics to John Darnielle killing it on this song I feel like the fact that you know he's kind of freed up on this track and these tracks a little bit you know with there being no guitar ins on the record he's kind of free to just kind of like play that character play whatever role he's putting himself into on a song and just kind of give it that full sort of theatrical performance on a track and you know as far as the theatrics as far as like the acting that I feel like goes into a lot of his songs it's just turned up to 11 on this track it's just turned up the 11 and that's all I got to say about that Shabazz Palaces new track shine a light featuring saddle AK liking this track a lot in my opinion much better than almost anything I heard off of the band's last record which to me went a little too far in the direction of like let's get more obscure let's get more disjointed let's make things a little bit more obtuse this track to me felt a little more accessible especially with the instrumental which had like a really strongly kind of soulful vibe coming off of it it was very sweet was very easy on the years wasn't like really alternative wasn't really synthetic you know which is of course a quality I love about their debut record black up but you know I feel like the elements of the Bands music that did really kind of stick out as being vibrant and really catchy we're kind of lost on the sophomore record feels like they're coming back a little bit on this new record and hopefully you know they kind of strike that same balance again that they did on their debut but sort of find new ways to kind of embody that on this upcoming album but what I'm liking so far what I'm hearing so far rather I'm liking a lot and last track I want to give a shout out to is from this up-and-coming rapper who a friend of mine recommended to me has this new YouTube videos your single out titled a brink and the dude's name is Lou the human this guy's delivery his style reads to me a lot like Tyler the Creator early and an EM there are a few other names that I can mention as well I know there are a lot of people out there who don't really care for Tyler Eminem but there's something about his delivery to me that reads almost like sure it's eccentric it's kind of tongue-in-cheek it's a little cartoony especially when you read in his lyrics I do think he has like a lot of funny dirty weird lyrics that a you know an Eminem or a Tyler fan would appreciate but I think there's kind of like a bit of a scumbag quality to to other things that he's saying in his delivery as well that I don't normally get off of Tyler I don't get off of Eminem and I'm going to leave you guys with that hopefully you got some good recommendations off of this video hopefully you got some you know some good some good leads on some of these artists over here and and hopefully you check out the songs that you liked and blah blah blah blah and blah blah blah blah okay hit up that amazon associates link as it is linked down there in the description hit at that turntable lab link and hit up the people over feed bands comm support them because they're continuing to support this segment as well and that is going to be it for this weekly track roundup thanks for watching guys my voice is a little tired now so I'm going to go arrest that and I will catch you in the next video forever 
a1PdNaCJ_M8,whoo hi everyone burns at any Hall to hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Smith Street Band album you a Melbourne band the Smith Street Band this is their fourth full-length album their second four side one dummy records and their second produced by the wonderful multi-instrumentalist multi-talented multi personality Jeff Rosenstock I'm kidding I don't think the guy has multiple personalities but he was frontman and bomb the music industry but this is my first time covering the band's music and this is actually my first time hearing a band that plays this kind of music from Australia the band basically plays this sort of anthemic angle on emo tinge pop punk which I guess to people over here in the States that doesn't seem like you know anything too novel but I'd been down in Australia a few times and I've seen loads of bands I've gotten tons of suggestions on other bands and it's rare that I catch a group or hear somebody talking up a group that has kind of a bit of an emo pop punk slant to their sound which in the case of the Smith Street Band is enhanced by Jeff Rossen stocks production because not only is the instrumentation here throttling it's also very layered and very epic truth be told it kind of sounds like the production on Jeff Rossen stocks past couple of Records maybe a maybe a tad cleaner than worried but you know still it could be a good thing could be a bad thing depending on who you are but you know it's not just that these guys are not sharing musically a whole lot in common with a lot of the garage rockers and Psyche rockers and pub rockers that usually catch down in Oz it's also specifically what I think this band is bringing to this sound and that is frontman will Wagner's semi thick accent which I think sort of takes the edge off very sad and somewhat you know whiny lyrics somewhat melodramatic lyrics - and not to say that the band never crosses that line occasionally they do like on the song death to the lads which to me kind of felt like an eye-roll worthy ode to growing up or getting more mature making better decisions I'm not against that theme I'm not against that idea but there were some moments in the verses where I kind of hit some lyrics that felt to me very judgmental and snooty which confuses me because sometimes on this album will barely seems to have control of his own hopeless romanticism to the point where his romantic and sexual desires come off a little pushy and weird like on the song birthdays which looking at the lyrics here yeah you could easily interpret these as being really endearing or like ah you know he's easy so deeply in love you know but to the point of view of another person that this could warrant a restraining order also in the song was this overly epic image of these two lovers jaywalking he says over a petrified earth some of the lyrics on this thing read like I'm watching a corny life-affirming scene out of a Garden State ripoff the song that kills me to have to be alive lyrically reads like firstworldproblems the soundtrack and I just cannot help but wince at the line that is sung early in the song that I spill my guts for money but you don't find my jokes that funny and for whatever reason on this track this song stands out amongst all the other ones because typically will and the rest of the band go into a track with a pretty good sense of melody like a good sense of what makes for a great hook but this track most of it just felt like tuneless anguish moaning another moment that felt kind of hand up was the song young once where despite the fact that will is yet to hit 30 he's seriously singing about having been young once and kind of mulling over these relationships and kisses he's had with women in the past wondering if these people are thinking about him the lovesick character flaws that will displays on this album make him kind of an oddball but they simultaneously make him a compelling character and make him kind of interesting because time and time and time again this album he becomes the victim of his own desires as he cries out against these blaring guitars on the song song for you where he says one of my favorite lyrics on the entire album about the realization shattering through him that he's the villain in this movie it's one of the few moments on the album where I can't help but get caught up in the emotion of wills performance especially as he's building up to the final refrain of the track one day there'll be a song for you one day there'll be a song about you it's a tearful triumphant moment that's enhanced by the huge grand punk rock guitars gest production does a lot for this album I think a lot to make this album listenable make it entertaining he strikes a great balance between letting the band sound raw and energetic and like they're performing right there in the moment but also there's some there's some grandiosity to it too that I think adds a lot of emotional weight to what will is singing wait that wouldn't have been there otherwise especially considering how dynamic these tracks are because there are loads of moments on this thing where there are touches of reverb guitar leads layered background vocals horns one other major problem I kind of have with the record though structural issues especially song structure there are numerous tracks on here that just lack any semblance of an intro the song starts on a very hard in to a blaring aggressive verse where you might have guitars drums and wills vocals all starting at once on the one and it's just so much so fast like a few bars of a drumbeat or a melody or something just to kind of set the tone especially with the first track of the album would have been greatly appreciated the general lack of intros and sometimes outros on these tracks also contributes to the feeling that there's not much of a flow to this album as a whole you could assemble these tracks in a variety of ways and pretty much get the same outcome except for maybe if you grabbed one of the tracks with a proper introduction and put that at the very start of the album that might do a better job of you know setting the tone of a record you know all masks and furs little intro foreplay you know can I just get a bit of foreplay here before we just go all-in might explain some of the some of the romance problems but to kind of bring it back to wills emotional hurdles on this record there are more highlights on here like pash pash chiona the track this album pulls its title from on this song will kind of breaks the fourth wall a little bit and he exercises these feelings about his craft as a songwriter and he almost exposes himself here as using this tool using this talent as a way to get attention from this person he has feelings for it kind of makes him as a character as a person on this record sort of interesting because it's almost like his love his feelings of love his obsession with love and what he's doing this band here what he's doing musically is almost like a self-destructive thing we get another very meta moment on the song suffer where will is singing about suffering for your art in the lyrics of the verses it seems like he's almost intentionally putting himself in these positions where he's in terrible situations and hanging around with people who he doesn't even really like just so he'll have something to sing about some kind of tragedy to pull from but honestly in my opinion that only keeps the album entertaining for so long because when it comes to lyrical topics and tragedies for will to pull from I don't think the emotional well runs that deep it doesn't really seem to inspire anything revolutionary in a musical sense either as I said earlier in the review musically this just kind of sounds like a Jeff Rosenstock record the album was an all right listen I can't say I'm not intrigued I certainly am because I do think there are some real moments of emotional darkness and some interesting and very personal and very introspective lyrics on this record but for every unique characteristic that the Smith Street band have and bring to this album I feel like there is a con or at least a couple of negatives working against it whether it be the all-too-familiar sound of the production the moments where it seems like we'll lets his emotions take him so far that lyrically I think he's kind of writing and singing these moments that maybe don't read is awkward to him but maybe would to the listener if they just kind of read into what he's singing the lack of flow is an album the lack of structure to some of these songs though I do like the blend of emo and pop punk and alternative rock that the band brings to the table and the band certainly knows their way around a hook - I mean I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this one transition have you shaved your face yet Anthony no I look disgusting ah the Smith Street band more afraid of you than you are me check out the album for yourself see what's up links next to my head of reviews I think you should check out you'd be interested in official website shred a bit

gRsUzx4N8VI,ah hi everyone here we can hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new gas album narco pop German ambient music and minimalist techno producer mr. Wolfgang Voigt coming through the new album under his gas pseudonym his first record in 15 years under this name and from what I've read in various comments about this record and the giveaway of a title that we have here this is basically the dark eerie and and very long delayed sequel album two gases year 2000 record pop and here that we're finally getting a follow-up to that album is kind of exciting for a few reasons one that is gases most widely celebrated album and it's not often that you get a sister record coming out this many years later I imagine that Wolfgang would have only dropped such an album if the the statement that he was trying to make here was really significant needed to be said and I have to say it does feel like a conscious attempt at creating the opposite album the opposite experience to pop Wolfgang purposefully plays off of that albums crystal-clear alluring and hypnotic loops of synths and strings and horns it's gentle but it has a very blissful vibe to it there are all sorts of bright and vivid sonic colors on this record too and for an album that pulls mostly from ambient music it's pretty accessible it doesn't take an experimental music masterclass to understand the appeal of a track like pop four by comparison narco pop is way less colorful at times bordering on colorless and texturally deficient to the point where some tracks for me just seemed way too bare-bones on some tracks we're getting these lazily looped or extended string samples of very faintly enhanced with some droney cents or some quarter note kick drums which get mind-numbing especially on tracks like narco pop seven and narco pop to a song where the kicks do virtually nothing to punctuate the giant blob size Springs actions that float above them device workarounds really the only track in this vein that kind of gets a pass from me the rhythms on this though are very bassy they're very heavy not quite so much techno inspired kind of feels like I'm listening to a monster stomp on the ground and the distance or something the rhythms are really cerebral but they have the weight to them to kind of compete with the massive and very dense wall of strings and sense that they play against they're not just smothered they're not just overtaken they don't feel like the rest of the beats on the album like they're just being tacked on or maybe it's more like I feel like I'm sitting down in an auditorium and I'm listening to a classical orchestra perform but next door there is some laptop DJ and I'm listening to the kick drums of his EDM anthems thump away through the wall as all of these very syrupy string sections are kind of wailing away down in the pit orchestra in front of me and generally the string passages on this record go so long and they feel so undoctored that I might as well be listening to some kind of contemporary new-age classical music or something because again what what Wolfgang is adding on this record to these strings in terms of rhythms and synth accompaniment just feel so insignificant there's something about it too that kind of reminds me of the caretakers music who is kind of well known for at least some of his songs merely being these texturally warped pieces of old ballroom music smothered and reverb the process of creating some of the caretakers music in my opinion is a little uninspired but at least when I'm not consciously thinking of that when I listen to the caretakers music I do get some auditory pleasure out of it narcho pop on the other hand feels equally basic but with no gratification factor and I think it might have something to do with Wolfgang consciously trying to create the opposite the polar opposite musical experience to pop on this record because I think there's so many fundamentally good things about pop that to work against these ideas would be to work against the potential to come out with a good record a simply darker approach to sound and texture and melody while still employing a lot of the same techniques on top of pacing editing and sampling would have sufficed but Wolfgang was obviously looking for a much deeper change of pace to the point where the sister album here lacks variety lacks engaging ideas lacks compelling musical passages and those are just a few of many many things that this album has that are essentially just a negative opposite to the ideas and sounds on pop there are a few bright spots on this album so to speak I like the dreamy bright walls of strings on the song narco pop 3 the plucky disjointed melodies on narco pop 6 I thought were pretty interesting the the moments I liked on an album most were the ones that really weren't rhythmic at all and I just kind of got these really weird washes and walls of tone that were you know sometimes dark sometimes beautiful maybe since there wasn't really a strong rhythmic component Wolfgang was focusing more I'm just trying to make sure that the tones and the chords and you know whatever kind of compositional elements were going into these tracks or a bit more engaging the beats and string passages on narco popped NSYNC up pretty tightly to the point where the songs almost like you know a little visceral but um do they justify the tracks 17 minute runtime not really because if I haven't said yet this album is 70 minutes long or so call me an uncultured pled with no taste whatsoever but I'm feeling a light too on this record it's easily one of the most drab and tepid records I've listened to all year transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best one should I are you next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just be angry at me in the comments if you're

uX0iSgy4qKM,[Music] hi everyone yep any Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and you are listening to another episode of the needle drop podcast in this episode it's I say every episodes a special episode but this one's special to me because it deals directly with what I do it's a very meta episode how to review an album what is my process what is the process generally when going about reviewing a musician's new record and I would like to try to address this but I felt like doing it simply by myself wouldn't quite make sense because I feel like there are so many different approaches and viewpoints on this issue and not to assume that I'm going to get through all of them today in this one episode this could in fact be a part of an ongoing series but I hope in this new podcast to kind of scratch the surface of that with the first of what is going to be my two guests in this episode Zoe camp is an up-and-coming music writer who has written for a myriad of different publications including the fader and pitchfork and god I'm forgetting all of them I think yes then tiny mixtapes whomever will have me oh that so and I've caught a lot of his always writing and I enjoy what she writes I enjoy her perspectives on things and I figured not only would she be able to give a good perspective on the process of how to go about creating an album review but being a younger reviewer I feel like you would probably be able to give some more relatable perspectives to my relatively young audience who kind of have questions about how exactly to you you know kind of start out with doing what you do so you know having said all that thanks for coming on and talking with me about all this stuff hey thanks for having me I mean I was watching your show back in 2010 so I was one of the people who are probably listening to this right now so it's really cool to come full circle and I'm uh I'm just really humbled to be here no problem um and and that humbles me as well to sort of think that people have been watching me and listening to you for that long but it next this I think at the end of this year will be ten years of the needle drop in some way shape or form because it started out as a podcast so it's kind of ten years old at this point which is kind of weird to think because I'm yet to really kind of get myself a moment to breathe and think about how all of it happened but to just kind of get right into the conversation let's say you are at the the the the top of your very ritzy Brooklyn high-rise apartment you're sipping a you know you're sipping a merlot you're eating a panini you know maybe you're you're reading you know something really deep something really profound and then on the ledge comes down a carrier pigeon with a message and you you take that message off the carrier pigeon it's a note it's it's a it's a hand scrawled note from Ryan Schreiber it is a it's an assignment you have to cover the the brand-new Flaming Lips album that just dropped out of the blue the deadline is what at the end of the week or something so you've got to get to work on you've got to get started right away and also attach the carrier pigeon is a USB of the album so you've got it all right there so you've got to get to work what is step one of the process how exactly do you begin you know is it just plain listening to the record do you do some research are you lighting some candles like what is the start what is step one of your process what I usually do first whenever I get an album if it's by an artist that I'm not familiar with I definitely you want to do a deep dig and find out as much as you can about them and look over their discography that's why discogs is like a music writers best friend come helps you get a better idea of like their entire discography as a whole and if I even if I have heard them I'm usually going to take another listen to like my favorite records there's just to kind of get an idea of their career as a whole and track them trying to kind of situated because one of the first things that your job is as a critic is to be able to write about the these albums and you can be familiar with all the stuff an artist has done but the reader might not so you're kind of trying to kind of give exposition in a way kind of like that dude always in all those anime fights and any like any anime there's all some guy with exposition about like um this is their superpower do tada so yeah got it yeah it's explaining what's going on before it's about to happen or something yeah pretty much so I do a lot to might have to kind of figure that out myself before I get started but then so that's even before you start listening to it yeah just trying to kind of get yourself grounded in it before you start listening okay so you're kind of doing some research on you know their past records trying to potentially you know prepare yourself for any kind of connections to stuff they've put out in the past as far as like their previous material and what is going to be kind of their ongoing artistic evolution what's going through your mind and you know just before I asked this question that that's very similar for me as well I will say though I do kind of do a lot of things on top of each other you know I may be listening to the new record while simultaneously doing that sort of research and looking back into their older stuff and you know going on websites like discogs I go on rate your music or Wikipedia or something like that you know those are sort of my resources as well but once you actually put the record on sort of what's your mindset you know do you try to get all that stuff done that you were just talking about beforehand so that when you put the record on it's only the record and nothing else is happening oh I mean I wish I had the time to do that but a lot of times I like you I'm multitasking so I'm looking at a discogs page or the rate your music page while I'm listening to something but I think the best way is in terms of like listening to an album is to do in a bunch of different contexts so you don't want to sit down and listen to the album without any distractions but you're probably also going to want to listen to it if you have a car while you're driving listen to it while you're walking play it when you have people over kind of just see how they react it's your opinion but everybody experiences music in different ways everybody has a different listening process and a lot of people I think view music is a social kind of activity - absolutely experience it in different settings to kind of see it holds up as a whole you know I mean yeah I mean that's that's kind of similar for me as well I mean I will admit I'm not quite having as many listening parties of albums these days a lot of what I do is sort of more focused where I'm living and just kind of my family life and everything but um you know it's very true I'm listening to this kind of either on headphones you know I give it a shot on the stereo so I can hear sort of in a louder sort of more panoramic kind of sense listening to it in the car listening to it just kind of on my small headphones on a run listening to it on bigger headphones in the gym or something like that you know hitting up other people who I may not have listened to the record with personally but I know have heard the record or I know are into the record and I'm just like you know what did you think about this you know did you give a listen to this you know and that's especially the case it's kind of like a high profile album you know if it's sort of something that is a little bit more of a personal favorite of mine you know I feel a little bit more comfortable kind of taking just sort of a bit of a solo venture on as far as like what my personal experiences but you know you do kind of want to check in with other people especially if it's like a record a lot of people are listening to there's going to be like what did you think of this track or am I like sort of off base when I say that like god the song is awful you know it just like hit me really bad it just like hit me in this really raw ugly way but then you know maybe once you get an opinion from another person who who I guess whose perspective you trust you know could kind of change the way that you feel about it which you know I'd like to say isn't necessarily a bad thing as a critic I guess it's just important that you be conscious of when that happens and be conscious of you know who who you're letting in I mean before I put out a review and I'm sure you are as well I'm careful not to read any reviews you know but there are certainly people who I trust personally who I will ask for what their thoughts on a particular record are before I say what I think about it just kind of make sure that what I'm saying is making sense or definitely to be clear here when I'm also talking about like having listening parties I don't mean if a now if you are lucky enough to get like you know an album promo that's really for your ears only but you know sometimes like if an album just comes out like you said a big one I'll like listen to it like if I happen to be visiting home for the weekend but for my parents because my dad he was a music critic in his college days at Ohio State and he's one of the people I respect the most when it comes to music so sometimes they do that but at the same time you really you're right when you say don't read other reviews you kind of need to do it on your own because otherwise if we're all like writing criticism relative to what other people are generally thinking then it kind of just becomes an echo chamber and it's pointless yeah to sort of ask a slightly personal question off of what you just said does your father keep up with a lot of contemporary stuff as well you know are you able to kind of bounce ideas off of him and he's like oh I think a B or C oh 100% he he collects all the 33 in a third book so I remember oh cool I would go home and just like read over because he's he's always ordering albums off Amazon in terms of modern stuff I mean trying to think the most recent modern band that he has he bought got the Kurt Vile record I know and I think he's into mad at everything on Matador I think labels for a lot of people labels are I think also a considerable sign of whether or not something's like worth your attention or not but yeah yeah labels are definitely kind of playing a bit of a boutique kind of curation sort of role these days I think more than ever you know it's almost like a with everybody being able to put their music out on the internet it's kind of like a seal of approval in a sense yeah it sets certain levels of expectations to you it's all you know it can all be connected to hype and whatnot I mean let's not forget that car seat headrests before he got to Matador that was all because people were talking him up online oh yeah absolutely you know and that's a that's another thing sort of the the the grassroots I guess a kind of hype that artists can now build up through platforms like sound counts and cloud and Bandcamp and sort of a how interested record labels are and kind of capitalizing on that because to sort of sign on an artist who basically has no name brand and whatsoever before you've kind of brought them on can be a really tough sell even if you are a label that does have some credibility you know if you can grab on to an artist like car seat headrest they've already done so much of the legwork for you in terms of being able to spread the word about those about that particular artist yeah definitely you know to go off of another thing you were saying and kind of get back onto the review track you know you made a quick mention of promos which i think is worth mentioning that especially for big big albums like as reviewers we are seeing less and less and less of them like a lot of us are hearing the album when in fact you guys hear the album and it drops either on iTunes that drops on Spotify or drops on Apple music or whatever for you personally as a reviewer has that sort of made your job a little bit more difficult that you got to kind of come out with this review in a very timely fashion you know how many days do you feel like you actually have because I mean once an album comes out that's pretty much the end of the hype cycle you know for the most part like you if that album has come out and there's there's been no promo for it and your review is not out the day that the album comes out like you have to have that review out you have to have that take out in the next several days or else nobody's even going to be looking for a review anyway so you know how exactly is that kind of affected your process the lack of promos especially for big albums these days out of fear of albums leaking it definitely puts you on the spot because a lot of albums obviously you know take a lot of time to really appreciate them for what they are I know I was definitely that way with to pimp a butterfly at the first time I heard it it didn't really you know it didn't and not you know was really you know that was a surprise release wasn't it did not just like come up out of nowhere yeah that just kind of dropped out of the blue you know and the thing is with a lot of these records too and you kind of mentioned it to pimp a butterfly there another thing with some of these albums and it could be to pimp a butterfly could be Beyonce's lemonade could be you know like whatever the latest Swans record is going to be not only are these albums dropped out of the blue they're often conceptual in some kind of way but a lot of them are very very long you know it's not like it's not like an album has dropped out of the blue and you have to digest some 45 or 35 minute record you have to digest a 60 minute record a 90 minute record in a matter of a few days yeah you know I mean I guess you're going to be if you really love me who's like I guess you got to be down and you really want to do good job you got to be down to like listen to one album all night which I mean that's one way to do it but yeah it's tricky I think it's also made trickier because the economy music journalism is we expect a verdict on the spot and you know it's definitely enforcing it really comes all back to like going with your gut you know and I really do think that a lot of times your base instincts involving a record are the ones you want to trust not because people are saying that it's good not because people say that it's important go with because you know when you listen to it art does it make you feel happy do you enjoy listening to do you want to listen to it again you know it's kind of stuff like that too so I definitely go with that but first stuff you know with that like to put the butterfly that might not be as instantly accessible yeah it definitely is challenging because I think I'm just one of those people that I like music to being very kind of immediately gratifying in that sense so having a closer period of time to so-called to basically study yeah that's hard and to kind of go off of that question you know in your experience how and so many people ask me this question in your experience how many times do you feel on average you have listened to an album and then you know sort of you're adequately satisfied with your opinion in your take on the album you know just just the the baseline how many times do you listen to an album before you review it I know for me it's anywhere from four to seven times on average you know totally I think four to seven is a really good ballpark I mean I often times are more like you know sometimes three to six I definitely think at three times and you shouldn't do it shouldn't be free back-to-back-to-back you should ideally be spacing it out so you can you know because you're going to have different jet like your experience might vary slightly depending on that and you want to kind of yeah do that but I also will basically you know I'll listen to it so many times they'll sit down to write the review and if I want to articulate something or double-check a lyric or something yeah I'll definitely replay songs um as far as whether or not my opinion has changed like after publication there's definitely been records that have kind of I've grown to like more than I think I might have uh it might have come across like you know I reviewed the master on once more around the Sun and I didn't really at the time I really didn't like it and listening to it now I think I think I would I like it more than I thought I did you know like I find myself coming back to it because it's pretty catchy but at the same time I also then I listen to you know remission or something I'm like oh yeah so I mean sometimes it fluctuates I mean I'm really glad you brought that up because that was that was definitely gonna be one of my questions because people ask me that all the time as well like has my opinion ever changed after publication and it has but I never had an experience and you know you tell me if this is you know for you as well you know I've never had an experience where I did a complete and total 180 on an album it's usually by very slight degrees of positivity or negativity either in the case of the last Beastie Boys album or the pop groups citizen zombie you know which I was super excited about when they came out I loved the first week that I heard it and now I still think they're good but I don't you know think they're quite as amazing when they were you know when they hit me on first impact I think as an example of a record that and people probably not be happy to hear this but I think I think I didn't give quite enough credit to 2 Chainz based on a true story when it came out and it's because when I asked would I listen to it now I just think it's so funny I just find him so hilarious and I think he's such a a witty and an entertainer oh my gosh I refuse that I do and I gave it 1 point 5 stars out of 5 over time yeah like I I did not give it a positive review either I really think that 2 Chainz at the end of the day you're not supposed to take him seriously and I was looking at like men his rut he's not really he's not telling any stories he's not like doing anything really special I mean you these are repetitive and I had put in gems like she got a big booty so a collar big booty and now like looking back that's funny I mean it's almost just like I mean you said meta earlier that's kind of a meta like rapping about rapping exactly and and the thing is a again you know they're probably some people are mad to hear that that is the album that I kind of feel like well out of all my kind of out of all my reviews definite like fondue yes dick I just think it's so funny and I find him more entertaining on that record than I have on any of his latest records because you know the reason I sort of went back to that album is I was listening to some of his latest mixtapes because I was like oh I might review this I may cover this or whatever and you know in that process like you were saying earlier I went back and heard based on a true story just kind of recontextualize it and I was like wait I I dislike this and you know and not to say that I think it's amazing now it's not you know fucking illmatic or anything but um you know it is a very funny entertaining album which like you were saying I think a lot of people going into that record because maybe he was a new artist because he sort of had that that Kanye endorsement maybe went into the album expecting something a little bit more serious than they than they actually got which which maybe leads us to another good question about this uh this podcast topic and that is a you know where do expectations live for you in terms of importance when you're going into an album can expectations ruin an album for you do you do your best to try to get rid of any and all expectations when you go into a record or expectations perfectly okay expectations are perfectly okay I think insofar as if you know that an artist is capable of reaching a nine or a ten I think that you can kind of hold them to that standard but also I do believe that you know as a band gets on an age like I'm trying to think like I feel like judging a who album that came out this year by the standards of you know an album like Tommy or who's next would be completely unfair I mean for one because it has completely different members and competi Storen jizz in terms of personnel that's just not fair but two I think that you know sometimes some artists peak super early and sometimes you know ever it's a matter of fact that everything they put out after a certain point isn't that good and maybe one of the reasons that you come to that opinion is because everything before it was so great and you know we tend to do that a lot I think with also bands like Weezer and stuff or you know fans that went that have like so many works of genius and then also they put out so many bad albums that you start to think that an album that is slightly less bad is somehow deemed awesome um so I think by those standards too you have to kind of I mean also for comparison I think I'm you know just the record that Kendrick just dropped because to have to follow up to Pippa butterfly would be a difficult task even for the artists who made that record you know now sort of in his you know weird left foot Kendra's kind of way if he did follow it up by doing something completely different just in the same way that he followed up good kid maad city by doing something completely different you know he seems like the kind of artist to rather than trying to build on top of what he does and you know sort of grow and grandiosity of statement and in artistic scope each time he just sort of revolves and revolves and revolves you know and still I think at least for me I kind of anticipated that that was going to happen so I mean at least for me it was kind of like hitting a reset button but still I didn't come away from the record feeling like it was as great as anything he had done in the past but the mere fact that I felt that way to a lot of people who watch me read as oh he hates the album I expected this to be in eight nine or ten you know so it's not even just the expectations of the the writer but also the expectations of the reader too because you know when people follow music reviews on a regular basis it's almost like you know the they know where they feel that they know what artists are going to get eighths what artists are going to get nines what are still going to get ten artists are going to get like a two or a zero or B minus or C+ or whatever I mean and also just think of it this way into like is dam going to be an album that ten years down the line when somebody says hey you want to listen to country for months which what's going to be the album you reach for yes that's that that is a question that's always in my head I don't feel like it's in the head of other people and I feel like that's you know I don't think it's a generational thing I think it's a personal thing you know there are some people who don't really seem to care about whether or not what you're listening to is going to have any lasting power but to me personally that's that's kind of significant especially when you're talking in terms of like what records are classic and what records aren't you know while I feel the application of that term is you know can be sort of warranted when you're talking about a modern record that a lot of people are behind and seems to be getting a lot of critical acclaim it's it's okay it's cute but you know for me like the truest application of that word is that you know this album you know long after the generation that grew up with to pimp a butterfly are fat and old and having kids and are probably not listening to much new music anymore you know do their kids hear that record for the first time and think wow this is amazing you know because to me that's the mark of a real classic record that a generation of people who didn't grow up in that culture didn't grow up that time period didn't grow up in that era in which that album makes pure and total sense here that album and they're like wow this is great you know because I feel like concept context of culture means so much when it comes to the enjoyment of an album and you know especially for popular music it's almost purely that in a lot of ways because you know you don't have a lot of kids these days listening to the Four Seasons you know or listening to fucking any number of completely dated and you know completely irrelevant a synth pop or like new romantic groups that came out during the 80s you know that we're very kind of like trendy and and of the time and I feel like you know while we may try to do our best to make sense of what music out there is great today you know we don't completely know what is and what isn't going to go out of style you know there are tons of artists from the 90s now that you wouldn't think would be translating to this younger generation in the way that they are but you know lo and behold there are tons of Millennials that are listening to Tribe Called Quest's there are tons of Millennials that are listening to Lauryn Hill you know and there's just no way to predict this stuff I think you touched upon a really good point that I about you know a sign of a good album being something that a generation later it still feels fresh and relevant relatable and I think it's also true for example a lot of people ask me you know why do some metal albums get Best new musics why do other albums metal albums not even if they're not as good stay like the vector record sure no obviously I can't speak on behalf of pitchfork but in my own experiences of somebody that writes a lot about metal I think what pushes a metal album from something that every metalhead loves to something that's an instant classic is if people who are not metalheads are can listen to it and enjoy it an example this way I think would be like electric wizards dope throne or most recent the most recent power trip album I feel like you can have fun with that record and really get a kick out of it even if you aren't somebody that listens to that type of music all the time and I think that's also true for jazz and experimental and I think that's you know that kind of crossover and wider wider potential and what it means within this broader landscape of music as a whole popular music is important I think and really think about that you know obviously people are going to hear that and say oh well that means if something is more you know crossover and accessible that must mean that you know like doesn't that kind of make it reductive and I don't think that's true I think it's more about impact and force you know like I think that only at Rick's point never all of his stuff he's like consistently great because you can listen to that and have not heard a single like IDM record in your life and you can still it's something you'll think about later you know it sticks with you it's unique yeah you don't necessarily need to take a master class and IDM or experimental electronic music to sort of appreciate what's going on on replica for example yeah yeah and a lot of I think other stuff although um you know a lot of records sometimes I think like if it's too esoteric and then you know it can be great for you for your by your own standards and that's as a music critic you know one of the great things about criticism these days is that thanks to YouTube and thanks to like you know the faculty can just kind of run their own blogs and do their own shit is that you can kind of suit your stuff to your own audience a lot of one of the greatest burdens I think of being a critic for you know mainstream sites is that your audience includes people some people listen to metal some people listen to no metal but lots of jazz some people listen to Billboard Hot 100 and nothing else and you have to make sure that everybody regardless of where they're coming from can understand what you're talking about and kind of get an impression of what the album sounds like and if it's good or not and I feel like as a critic there's more pressure to have heard more as far as different genres and styles these days because the listener is hearing more too because the Internet just gives you so much easy access to so many different sounds because over the past 10 years or so we've seen so many cultural barriers breakdown and thanks to the Internet and now it's easier for people who didn't grow up listening to hip-hop get into hip-hop it's easier for people who can grow up listening to black metal get into black metal you know previously these very insular musical cultures have just been totally ripped wide open for everybody to observe and critique and comment on and listen to and learn about with the same kind of depth and breadth that somebody who sort of grew up with that sound or grew up with that culture did and you know I not that I expect you to have a comment on this but this is just kind of a thought at the top of my head but I do think that has caused sort of a weird bit of tension or bitterness between I guess you could say you know old school people and new school people and I feel like that also kind of contributes to a in a way that that sort of niche entertainment sphere that you're talking about in terms of you know specifically the metal community and it happens everywhere you know where you have these publications and reviewers who only review one style and then you kind of as an outsider who is more concerned with like how does this fit into the grander scheme of music you sort of see some releases being congratulated or celebrated when like in the grander scheme of things does this really matter I think it's that tension also can you know that tension can be frustrating because I think that niche sites so to speak are just played just as important a role because if you're really hardcore into music like when I'm reading when I want to know about you know some I don't know some like black core amor grind forum I you know rate your music I think is an is a actually a really good source for finding out general opinions and like getting it it could be heavy on the jargon but if you know the jargon for like any different honor if you want to get technical that's a great place and those places definitely really have an important role in the overall landscape of music writing and I think that there's nothing really wrong with that I think that there's different lanes and it's important that I think each Lane be able to come still maintain its own identity and I definitely think that while it's great that critics are you know a lot of websites are covering a more wide variety music that still that doesn't mean that having conversations within restricting it to one genre or style are somehow obsolete or less important because they're not looking at the big picture it's just different it's an issue of optics really and like what prism you decide to view the album in are you viewing it within the prism of its genre of the artist or do you really want to think about it in terms of the grand scheme and I think your mileage may vary according to that and a review can be all of the above as long as it I as long as at the end of the day tackles one of them that's important no I absolutely agree you know and the thing is um there are loads of artists who I enjoy that you know I've given very positive reviews to who you know really kind of only appeal to a niche at the end of the day the niche is not necessarily a bad thing because that can sort of be a bit of a petri dish for interesting ideas to sort of blossom out of that wouldn't have blossomed to any other place moving on from there of going into a record do you feel like you have any kind of general criteria that you look for listened to in an album or are you really kind of resetting every time you hear a new album or resetting every time you hear a different artist you know is that are there pieces of criteria that apply to every record you hear or you know is it really on an artist by artist basis or is it more on an album by album basis now there's general I mean regards or even a genre but yeah scarred list of genre you there are certain characteristics I always whenever I'm taking notes on something as I'm listening to it which I don't always do sometimes that kind of all comes together as I am writing it after listening to it but notes are oftentimes useful for organizational purposes but you know categories like how are the songs arranged how are the musicians regardless of what they're playing can they play competently do the beat sound good there's a regardless of the drums or synthetic or if the drums are live do the songs as a whole on the album flow together is their beginning middle and end to it or does every single song sound the same how how do they approach different are the types of you know lyrical if there are lyrics are the lyrics good are they me you know and also getting back to the general questions that we mentioned before like what is this album add to the conversation that we're having the regardless of how big that conversation is how does it compare to the artists previous work how does it compare to what you can listen to now and just those general questions but I would say the big categories are you know the arrangements that the technical performances on it and I think framing and pacing is super important and doesn't get discussed enough enough by a lot of critics because I'll tell you if there's one thing that can make an app can really make or break an album for me it's the pacing because there's nothing like are you trying like the way that I'll moves from trash trash or exactly so many albums start off really strong like the first four tracks they just go right one after the other they blend into each other seamlessly and a lot of times albums just kind of plateau or worse off they're the worst or when it's really good to start and then it's boring and then it's really good at the end or you yeah or you like it like you were just saying you know or a record that feels like it doesn't truly get exciting until you're four tracks in or something I definitely think that obviously every everybody listen there's a reason that people like different types of music you know there's what makes a rock album good or a pop album good isn't going to be the same as you know what makes an ambient album good because it's all about different moods and but I think that the common language so to speak is you know I don't have things like arrangement delivery techniques stuff like that I I agree with everything you're saying here you know but I think what's important to kind of stress to the listener to kind of categorize these these details is when we're talking like super general things that apply to every album it sounds as if and again I agree with what you're saying but it seems like everything you're saying could almost be categorized into almost technical things you know like like you were saying the the ability for the musician to perform what's the recording quality like you know these are sort of almost the the objective truths of modern music whether or not something sounds distorted or something sounds smooth or something is loud or something is soft yes and then beyond that you know there are sort of miniscule bits of criteria that you can apply to whatever genre the record is whoever the artist is based on what they've released before what you know about the artist and that specific record itself depending on what that album's mission is genuine I think a real an important thing does it really does it sound like they're putting on a show or an affectation or does it sound like something that's like really like in the moment you know what I mean and I think you can tell that I mean and I think that applies to any genre and I think that you got to know when you hear it these sort of these criteria no matter whether or not they're fitting into this grander category whether we're talking about you know authenticity or you know the that sort of performance quality that you were talking about that genuineness they were talking about you know or sort of maybe what you could apply to a record more specifically if it's a rock album for example definitely any of these categories rank higher or lower in terms of importance to you or is it really just kind of a case-by-case basis can you have a completely technically sound album but it's the worst thing you've ever heard because it fails by every metric that you can apply to it as a rock album or you know can you have a great rock album that completely lacks any and all sort of technical ability or coherence so you know can I guess yeah do these different sort of types of criteria you know they do they rank in different ways of importance to you I guess well for me personally I put a real big emphasis as I said before on the pacing and the basic structure of it just like watching a movie on it so personally that's one of the most important things yeah definitely if the album has like an arc and build to it and if because I think that has a real bearing on the experience honestly I think it's really I put a big emphasis on also if it just feels like a cohesive experience or if it just sounds like a bunch of songs thrown together yeah could be lopsided toward the beginning of the end or just like a compilation of sorts but I mean I will say this like for an album for me I'm much more likely to give it I also look at it by a track-by-track basis and look at the songs it of themselves so for me like structure is important not just for nom as a whole but in within the specific songs themselves so yeah I just want to put it in just plain speak it's like it just I just think it's important that it has a point it makes the point and it doesn't overdo it and it doesn't understand it but the out that though that the music has something to say and it says it well alright I mean I think that's I think that's a good way to put it and you know I feel like we can go on forever on this topic there's so much to say about it and I have other things that I would like to ask you but you know just for the sake of keeping this podcast a somewhat you know moderate length but for you personally when you're done with writing the review or in the middle of writing the review whenever you think of this generally what are you trying to tell the reader when you're writing review what are you trying to communicate to the reader what do you want them to know by the the time they've read the last paragraph of whatever review you've written it all basically comes down to one question is and that is why should you care like what are you going to get out of listening to this album is it worth taking any 30 to 90 minutes of your time listening to it and what can you expect out of it nothing more nothing less I mean if we wanted to be more like really honest to be should you buy the CD or not but we're living in the year 2017 and that question I think in the age of soul seek and mediafire and everything you know good luck the consumer guide aspect of it I think is quickly growing obsolete so I mean but yeah on a basic level it's just like why should I care those very same questions sort of run through my as well I guess I guess for me personally what I'm most sort of interested in telling the viewer you know a lot of the time I think the viewer has almost made a decision as to whether or not the album is worth their time because they're already clicking on a review of it yeah um you know so I mean I feel like they've already kind of made that decision for themselves what I'm trying to tell them assuming that they can listen to it already because there are some people who you know and I'm sure you know watch my reviews as well as read your reviews after they've already listened to something and you know maybe they're kind of sitting there and thinking you know hmm was like I'm still trying to figure this out maybe I'll get another opinion or something so I mean at least for me personally what I'm trying to do by the end of a review is kind of give the listener a heads up as to what is on the album what's the album trying to do and whether or not I think it kind of succeeds at it and I feel like they're kind of varying degrees as to how you accomplish going about doing that whether you're talking about an album that seemingly just seems like a smattering of tracks is it a top 40 record is that you know the new Carly Rae Jepsen album or is it the new Kendrick Lamar album which you know going into each artists record you know you're going to expect you know a different kind of tone a different kind of style a different kind of level of conceptual 'ti going into the album I guess it's just me trying to explain the mission statement of the artists because no artist comes right out and says what their mission statement is because you know for the most part that that may just in fact kind of ruin what they're trying to do but obviously listeners are still curious to understand it and want to know about it and I guess I'm doing my best to kind of give that perspective on it while also kind of coming in afterwards to kind of say okay so now that I've explained what exactly goes on here's how I actually feel about it you know like I didn't like it or I did like it and then after I've kind of explained that I kind of try to get to the heart of as to why you know I ended up sort of with that feeling because while I I do agree with what you're what you were saying earlier about like trying to compare you know a new who record to a record that they came out with during their heyday you know sure it's unfair doesn't make sense but I mean at least for me personally I feel like I'm kind of doing that maybe not in a conscious way like oh it's just not as good as their old stuff but I feel like in a sort of way I am kind of doing that in a roundabout sense because I don't so much feel like I'm coming out with a different criteria or feeling on each individual album I mean I can't help but think about what we's are used to do in the past when I listen to a new Weezer album but I am trying to base each score in each reaction that I come together with on just kind of general sense of enjoyment you know and to me that's that's sort of what ends up making an album great you know to kind of reach that threshold of like peak enjoyment for me does it kind of like scratch all of those entertainment itches that I feel like I have when I went into the album you know did I get everything that I wanted and more I guess you know sort of what makes a record and a listen sort of significant to me and and that's sort of what I want to communicate to the viewer you know did that happen for me and if and if not why not and if so you know what what exactly made the album so great that it kind of reached that level for me it really is about expectations versus reality and you're kind of laying out both of them you're kind of trying to say what the expectations were you know what you think the artists expectations were with this project what they're trying to put out what the ideal is what our expectations are based on what they've done so far and you know what the reality is does it live up to what the artist intended does it live up to your expectations and yeah is it enjoyable because an album can you know can seem like super important but it's not fun to listen to I mean and it's interesting you know talking about looking back at reviews and how like your opinion changed because you know when albums like when Lou Reed's Metal Machine music came out everybody absolutely hated it and called it a crock of shit and now people think of it as like one of the most important albums and noise sure so ever it's fluid and criticism doesn't exist in a vacuum and it's it's malleable and I'm perfect but I think you people like you and me we do our best all right I want to thank you for coming on and talking with me about all this stuff I mean you've been fantastic giving your opinion and hopefully we've kind of given people a better ideas too I don't know how to go into the idea of music criticism again I feel like we've barely scratched the surface but I feel like we talked about some pretty big topics here yeah I mean thanks for having me on I wish I was a little bit more coherent but it's a it's the end of the week I will leave a link to Zoe's a Twitter page down there which I mean you can catch her posting a lot of her reviews over there but also you know some of her hilarious tweets which I'm a really huge fan of which she posts all the time definitely I post most of my stuff on Twitter most of it is just about bad news who are terrible oh uh but I also am helping to run up this new site called clairvoyant and that c l RV ynt calm and we focus more on punk and hardcore metal and I'm sure you probably heard I talk a lot about metals so we're trying to kind of focus and double down on that so if you're into that kind of stuff or if you just want to like your new music check it out let's say we run back that scenario that I said at the at the beginning of the the very episode but instead you're passed to us B of the brand-new Muse album do you do you go into the into the review do you reset and be like okay I'm going to try to objectively review this record I mean I'm going to honestly give a give a real take on this album and give it a shot or do you just hand in your resignation right there you know what at the end of the day I do it for the kids so I really have to I'll lay it down because and I have to and I guess you know you made an on-air admission so I'll make an audio admission that God's solution sing for absolution was one of the first CDs I got in middle school you know so there's a bit of a personal history there I got it you got to do what you got to do yeah even Radiohead read it but yeah there I said it I bought a new album once okay all right well thank thank you for thank you for coming out and ruining your career on this podcast I mean you will be you'll be greatly missed I'm going to miss your writing I'm going to miss you know your online antics but uh I'm glad you decided to sort of sort of put it put it to bed here for the record I I did torch the CD uh subsequent fit of rage so alright thanks so much for coming on and talking about alright and now in the second segment of this how to do a review how to do an album review podcast my guest is Brandon aka BZ for thirty of dead and hip hop hey how you doing dude what's going on neo drug what up though what up know everybody appreciate y'all listen you know we bout to get into this have some fun you know alright so in the first half of the segment I talked a lot about how to do a review I was asking Zoe camp how to write a review how to create a review what her thoughts were going into review but a lot of her experiences is mostly text-based when it comes to reviews you're obviously you know where I am sort of on the YouTube platform but even what you guys are doing is is vastly different from what I'm doing because you know even though I may be on camera I'm still kind of formally writing a review and then delivering it on camera after its 100% written I mean what you guys are doing a lot of the magic I imagine just sort of happens on camera at that very moment right there sort of live with the fact that you guys kind of approach reviews with multiple personalities in a bit of a round table format yes that is true because it's funny you say that because as as much as when we listen if we know where we're going to review like as a crew as much as I want to like talk to Mike or like tuck the can or like talk to people about it's like let me just hold off let me hold my emotions until we're all together because that may at the end of the day where it's more like a just you know even with friends even for me growing up with friends you know we always talk about our together and it was that organic natural reaction where the hug you thought what like you're tripping so you know going in with the fellas I have that same mentality because now I've known them for a long time now so it's like I can't wait to say what I want to say and I can't wait to hear what you know people think is he going to say anything that's gonna trigger me or is Mike gonna say something that's gonna trigger me yeah it's just when just us is just pure raw emotion when you watch our videos because that's what you're going to get nothing like written down or nothing pre premeditated thought about anything is all like raw emotion so you may have you know had these conversations in any room when you were younger with friends about music but did you follow reviews at all when you were younger like if something were to get a double XL or you know four or five mics is that something that would would grab your attention and sort of make you listen to a record or make you listen to a record twice if you would already decide he didn't like it or something yes one particular pretty much the only one for me back from the late 80s could about 96 97 was the source source magazine uh value mics a lot from them like it like the back then the source was almost almost not like 100% but it was a good I say 67% of reasons why I will buy an album based off their rating because I know that they were very tough in their rating you know because there's been plenty Islands that I love that only got three and a half mics but if I see someone if I see artists get four or four and a half I'm buying it instantly without even hearing a single or anything in a good nine percent chance I'm going to like I'm enjoy the album so the source was the only one where it was kind of like my Bible back then where I was like if I'm not sure well if my friend says he likes this but I you know I can't really go by his opinion Emmas because we're so different but if the source gives it a rating that I think that's respectable I'm gonna go to the story I'm going to buy it just off him so yeah the source was definitely my kind of go to full reviews written review know that that brings up really interesting question you know do you do you see yourself as a tough critic or if not who in debt and hip-hop do you see is the toughest critic and is being a tough critic important we add answer the second question first yes I think being a tough critic is important because you know sometimes you have to humble these artists or just humble and I hate to say this but Humble the fanbase sometimes like if stuff is wack or you know is it not good you're going to cut to call it out you're going to say say what it and then pluses are opinion be sure you get the same black as well but it's like if you call them something that's wagging that's you calling it Wang regardless if I disagree with you or not but i'ma still respect your pen but you know you it's okay to say that stuff is garbage or wack or as what you would say on the big shine no no no no no no no no like you have to you have to cost of out for what it is you know I don't have no issue with that um now the first question do I consider myself a tough critic at first I didn't I think when we first started doing getting hit by when we first started really getting into reviewing albums and stuff and mixtapes I didn't see myself as tough but I guess the word the more we started doing this I was looking like damn I am tough but if I if I don't consider myself I definitely considered Mike c-town the toughest critic out of out of all of us easily and my hands down but a lot of our fans and even the crew is saying that I'm becoming the toughest guy so I you know I guess it's like a tie between me and Mike but you know you have to just call it call it is what it is if you if you think it's wack it is not worth the for you to purchase it or beyond so like it's put together well calling up what it is I don't have an issue with them people laugh at me when I do when I dog a record on I'm like why are you laughing at me I'll just give you out a straight out this is great opinion you know what I'm saying I guess it's just kind of it's it's it's a different kind of it's it's just funny in a different way because when you're in you don't like a record you just look like you're done yes you have you're done that's it prime example is that riff raff I'm pretty sure you probably remember yeah I remember you looking pretty uh pretty done with that because you know what it was with that with that album I cannot believe like Mike can and people was really given that a pass and they're like do rehearse and write projects and y'all dog the heck out of them and they didn't sound nowhere near as bad as this and they was given that a fast so I was like son I couldn't believe what I was hearing me being the only person that just did not find that album amusing at all but you know that's that emotion is the raw emotion that's coming out I think that brings up another interesting point you know there are moments where you're sort of diametrically opposed you're on the complete the other side of the spectrum from the rest of the crew in a formats or in a YouTube channel in a discussion panel where you're finding that you have to have your opinion basically compete with a you know three four sometimes five differing opinions you know three or four differing opinions in a review you know how important is you is it to you to sort of maintain your own stance and maintain your own ideas you know because I know that you obviously in the rest of the guys put an effort to not talk about a record before you talk about it on cameras to not to kind of influence each other and kind of muddy those waters or anything like that but sort of in the middle of that conversation how do you kind of keep yourself grounded in your own opinion while all these other ideas and points of view are kind of flying in every other direction that's a good question because it's been it's been moments where can or hit all of them at some point will probably say something that I was either getting wanted to say about a record or you know it's planning on sand and then they say it and I'm just like oh my god they didn't took my whole damn a thought process or whatever especially Mike sometimes like Mike don't go laughs please just because if you go before me you're going to say something that I normally like yep yep yep yep yep Bharani if usually in that case I just try to it's really off the emotion because if someone say something that's gonna trigger me then I'm going to I'm going to kind of expand on my reasoning or or peek I like to call it piggybacking like if I say is can't say something exactly I said I like to piggyback and just kind of like come up with my own I guess quote-unquote bz4 30 thoughts about it without trying to take Ken's word forward so much because yeah you right by being four of us is it's been times where a lot of us have said you know the same thing about a project rather we hated or didn't like it or social about it so yeah sometimes that's the tough part about revealing sometimes up like people you got the upper hand because we always let people go first I don't know why we came up with that system but I look at people sometimes as he started talking I'm like you motherfucker you been I say something that I was gonna say but you know once he don't and you know can't go or if I go second on my cool let me get my all right now and then y'all gonna piggyback off of me you know what I'm saying like you know that does that's that's how I look at it but yeah you're that's a good question I mean all I can do is just kind of like when as is happening my brain just started rolling like I'm okay well he said this so now what I'm gonna come with now bah bah bah bah you know is this is really like on a fly like all the stuff that you really that people see everything is clearly on the fly like I'm really just like winging it we all like winging it pretty much yeah no I mean because I mean while I'm not doing what I do in kind of an in a panel format you know though I occasionally do do the the review discussion here and there I try to do my best to avoid any and all opinions before I you know end up doing a review at least a lengthy opinion you can't avoid the opinions of the fags you know they'll be hitting you before the reviews even out saying it's the best thing you've ever heard you better give it a ten you better give it a nine you better give it an eight it's the worst album I've ever heard in my life you're going to hate it um you know you've already you're already going to hear that whole spectrum of the pickups before you come out with the review but I'll try to avoid the opinions of people who sort of I respect before going to review because that might sort of influence me but you know speaking of the audience in your experience as a reviewer because I feel like if there's one thing that's vastly different from the reviews of today whether you're doing them in texts whether you're doing them in video you know whether they're formal or their reactions or you know roundtables like what you guys are doing the audience plays a role in in the whole thing that they never have before you know it's not just PR people and record labels and you know radio stations and airwaves telling you something's good something's popular something's hot this needs to be reviewed right now um now the audience is playing that role sort of a like I'm sure you experienced and the run-up to the Kendrick Lamar review that you guys have just dropped yeah I'm sure you were getting all kinds of social media messages and emails and death threats to see you know people post people send you pictures of your house and everything you ready this now right your view this right now right um you know the audience is playing a role that they never have before because the Internet is sort of making things a two Street you know you may have kind of found a way to stay solid in your opinion amongst the rest of the crew but you know it is is it ever sort of a struggle to sort of stand your ground when hundreds or maybe even thousands collectively of people are kind of coming at you guys saying you're wrong about this one your opinions wrong I hate you guys I'm unsubscribing oh I love it I mean I love when when when people especially if it's the album that I like dogged out like you know for example like a big shine album or whatever I love when people like come at me you know trying to like you know force change my brain and have me thinkin differently or telling me hey go on they go hey go on when they tell you how to listen to an album I'm pretty sure you've got that million times yeah they tell me that I'm not listening to an album correctly how you're going to tell me how I'm going to consume music that I've been listening to practically my whole life so I mean yeah stuff like that it I'm still going to be strong my opinions regardless of how I feel if I love the album and the fans tell me that they hate it and they say aw man this is born BZ this sucks or whatever obviously sometimes you got to watch when they trolling there's some people that actually have a that at least in the comments sections I'm really good at replying in comment sections you can see what I had that better give me some good stands on why they hate or love the album and then I'm gonna guess what I'm gonna reply right back in that comment section and tell them why this album is great why I think it's great how I think it's wack why I think it's so so and so on and so forth so I like it I mean longer is not on a troller level I love when I'm challenged online or on Twitter or whatever because you know well basically on the intercom because I can type a little more 140 characters on Twitter seems to be a little bit too limited for me to be arguing back and forth for folks but um I catch you in the in the Facebook or YouTube coming I love it I take it on I love early on you know and you tell me if you've had experience with this I mean really early on when my audience started to grow there were moments where you know sort of the the backlash of negativity would really shake me I mean at the point where you know I love it now the drama is amazing you know but yeah sure I mean there were points and you know I was in my early to mid 20s at the time probably not as solid in my opinions and might be we'll experience as you guys probably were when you started the channel because you know you guys were like lifelong hip-hop fans you know whereas I was trying to review so many genres at the time when I was starting the channel some of which I wasn't nearly as experienced with as others and you know there were people and sometimes you know I would have to kind of like rethink my thoughts on the way that I would talk about records in certain genres because I needed to pick up on certain terminology or there were certain things I should have been bringing up that I wasn't that you know maybe I liked or disliked but didn't think to say anything about it because that just didn't kind of strike me as something to bring up but you know that's something that you know an electronic music fan might pick up or want to point out or a metal fan might want to pick up and point out where a hip-hop fan might want to pick up and point out you know but but sort of the the crowd does kind of add that extra layer of difficulty in a sense you know with how kind of hard they can push back but ultimately I think it's I think it's a good thing because I think if you kind of wall yourself up yeah away from them you know I think it can prevent you from being honest because you know you kind of feel separated from the whole thing and you feel like you can just kind of say whatever bullshit that you want to say right you know even if it's completely unjustified but it makes you actually kind of think twice about what you're going to say and putting it the right way because if you you know sure if you're doing a negative review you may want to say something harsh you may want to say something that pisses people off you know yeah so like communicate effectively like this sucks yeah but you know if you're trying to daintily you know dance around an album to say hey like I don't think it's great but it's it's a it's not terrible or you know even to say an album is great you know you may miss speaker may you know uh say something off-base or whatever you know I think having an audience or reacting to what you're doing in real time is sort of leaving you feedback whether it's you know crazy troll comments or you know long-winded well thought out and well written comments you know I think it's helpful and ultimately sort of a healthy thing for you know not only what I'm doing but kind of the music community at large because think you know well you guys are doing what you're doing I'm doing what I'm doing I think we're all kind of a part of the larger sort of communal discussion part of music culture that's going on right now where you do have kind of opinions flying in every direction about every new album right and it's like you say it - uh like I said I like it because it brings on a great healthy debate if you - the trollin the trollers but like people who really you know dispute your your opinion I think it's great but I think it is great for healthy conversation - healthy debate because I mean I'm the same way when I watch sports shows it's like it's certain people I watch that I know that's gonna round me up you know they're gonna say some rumble' you out of your mind so I'm glad that you know people like you people like me and then if I we kind of we bring that same emotion and bring that out in our fans you know what I'm saying that people that watches our show on a regular basis they're gonna they're going to still love what you have to say regardless if they disagree with you or agree with you you know I love that when you can still respect it but you still want to dispute like hey I don't I think you're wrong because you know like I think that's good I think that's great this recent kendrick lamar review has me thinking of sort of another question something that I probably wouldn't have thought to ask before this review even came out but I feel like this album brought a particularly interesting set of opinions because the album is not so clear cut like Kendricks previous couple of records mm-hmm and because of that I think that that has led to this really wide array of different interpretations of the album and what's funny is I've had so many comments and so many really angry passionate emails and you know various correspondence sent to me about this album and each of them are sort of like dead set and one percent convinced that their interpretation is 100 percent right and I'm wrong and they have the point of view of the record but what's funny is like every single time somebody puts that amount of effort into trying to quote-unquote understand the album like all of their interpretations are different you know they each come at me with like a different kind of point of view or a different take on different things in the album yes but there and it's almost like it's gotten to the point especially with kind of the rumors that were surrounding the release of this supposed second album right it's it's like things have almost gotten like conspiratorial yeah you know what I mean like people are starting to like put together the you know the Illuminati clues and shit like that and it feels like it's just kind of gone overboard to the point where it's not even really an opinion anymore and just kind of a conspiracy theory one thing I would say about about Kendrick Lamar albums I think he's with fans I think they put them in this box that where they're so used to him having these conceptual well-thought-out projects you know a good kid maad city to Pember to fly you know even section.80 to a certain point was with a will theme some type of a theme right there going on with the album with the exception of untitled unmastered so I think with this album you know especially other people listen to it and then you know of course you know what happening with him and the song does work at the end and everything people lost their mind in Venice our time in with oh he made this album cover because this was green and he made this and I don't know if you saw this bit to where in the video of a DNA how they like oh look Kendrick got a red head a red wristband on one wrist and then a green wristband on the other oh he he's about to come up with another album on Sunday like I was like what is wrong with y'all like y'all really thinking too deep on this on this album II I think y'all really puttin Kendrick in his box and I think it's kind of unfair I mean it's great that he's put on this such high level and to put out quality conceptual album but you know what if the guys just want to release album just let's enjoy you know just for us to listen to without all the deep meaning of course he's gonna have different emotions going on through it out like you said it's all over the place ivory with your net but you know what's wrong with just having something you just want to pop in and decision to and enjoy people are thinking too deep with all these theories in the second albums and audit of the crap is ridiculous at least for me it's kind of the duty of the reviewer to demystify that a little bit and I personally would have probably done that a little bit more in my review had I maybe done it a little bit later because so many of these theories have kind of proliferated and you know while music is definitely subjective I feel like there are some objective truths to it that you can definitely set the record straight on right you know and at least in the case of this I mean just to you know I know damn is a different project from anything Kendrick has done before but I feel like it's very much the same than everything he's been doing up until this point in that he's still a very emotional raw and honest and down to earth and straightforward guy you know he is telling you what he's going through he's telling you his perspective on things why can we not just accept this album for face value right you know like why does it need to mean something that it's not why can't it just be a really talented artist kind of stating his perception on things you know which is which is what I feel like Dan is and in a lot of respect we were telling people stop it with you they on conspiracy theories just enjoy the album voice like enjoy it like I mean that's what we've always done before is like we've enjoyed albums I make sure it's gonna be me it might be a tie-in here and there with you know his previous albums or it might be something like you say it might be some deeper meaning or something just take the album what it is and enjoy it it's been plenty of artists a lot of artists that may work on our projects MF doing that maybe some will conceptional thought our project but he also made some projects that you just wanted to pop on and just enjoy it's nothing wrong with that just take it for what it is don't be like oh it's a doom album what is he trying to decipher this time or like how I'm going to Cypress rhyme scheme on his album like just accept it for what it is and enjoy the freaking out yeah I guess I guess some people go into some people go do an album like it's a science project yeah and there's exactly exactly you know what's funny is it's that we're both reviewers and it's funny because we're going into this conversation saying hey you know what don't treat an album like that because I feel like too often reviewers are kind of stereotyped as being that kind of person you know the person who thinks too much about the album and they take it too seriously and they can't just sit down and enjoy a record meanwhile we're not sitting here talking about the conspiracy theories around damn we're not talking about what can you see theory you know like if you listen to this fucking track when the moon is in this phase and you know the constellations are in are in such an arrangement then you know all of a sudden you're going to look in your email inbox and the second album is good to be here are there ways that you try to stay grounded when doing a review so that you come through in a way that's I guess kind of relatable and you know really personable because if if there's one thing that you guys are great at it's just kind of coming across as just average honest just fans of the music and nothing more nothing lastly that's the purpose right there that's that that was our sole purpose when we started doing dating hip hop because it was like look dead in hip hop generally has been going on since we were kids since before was born people been talking about music human sent around time on music together for decades so it was like you know reason why we just want to stay grounded main thing is like still be yourself still be yourself go into it still I'm going to still give stuff reaction the same way I would give reaction if I was with if I was off-camera you notice a we wasn't recording if me and you and Mike was talking about some music I'm going to still be the same guy if we was recording on a camera is like the mini collabs we've done before yeah I mean we done plenty class before so yeah you get it so yeah it's like you have to still just think about just like I said the natural rawness of it is this I guess for me it just comes natural because I don't think about how I'm going to react it just happens when it happens I guess you know the way you were kind of saying what you were saying about you know just staying raw and personal and honest I feel like that's a quality that is so important so integral to a lot of these video reviews that you see right now but is that to kind of imply that the era of text reviews that kind of preceded all of this that that was dishonest that that was not honest not only that question but have you ever read a review that like maybe pops up in your head that you felt like wasn't an honest review you know what I was that's a good question because yeah I've been reviews this was like kind of doing it down the decline of the stores like when I was just kind of like okay I'm done with them and you know you read certain reviews and of course this is one the time when labels really started getting putting their you know hands in with these magazines with the double XL thesaurus it was another one I'm forgetting to but um yeah like so when I when I start find out that these labels is really kind of putting their fingers in the hands and knowing some of these writers and everything and when I'm like as I'm list to the albumen like minute Salamis trash why is the source rating is four and four mics four and a half and it's like I'm reading it and just something about it just doesn't seem genuine but like it just things like I don't know if they're being paid off by someone or if someone throws some some nice little extra caster a you know talk about go tomorrow talk about good on this particular albums that come out for this particular label then you get this certain amount of money so yeah wreath like in that late 90s it was a lot of reviews I used to read nice like this is not saying genuine and on like who I need someone to talk to me about this and like give me a face-to-face genuine feeling of why they think this album is this good or why they think is this van so you write you know you absolutely right that's a that's a good question because it was reviews where I was like yeah that don't seem genuine like who's paying you buddy like real yeah I mean I definitely feel like when when I was checking out some reviews and spinning and like when I was in high school and later on in college when I would see some music review websites like bitch work for example I mean I'm not talking about these publications across the board as institutions but every once in a while I would see a review that I don't know while I didn't have any proof in my pocket that you know that was like oh this is totally you know this person's been paid or this is a lie or that it uh you know it did kind of feel like there was a bit of an agenda going on or like some kind of bias yet while I have my biases and I'm sure you have your biases you know we kind of come out and admit them you know what I mean like it's been well-documented that sites like edge fork or at least for a long span of time had a Brooklyn bias you know it was like it seemed like almost any and every popular little upstart 15 minutes of fame buzz indie band that would come out of the woodwork from Brooklyn was like oh this is great it's an 8-point whatever it's music it's the best new music no matter what you know meanwhile there are other reviews that and it's easy it's even easier today than it is than it was back then thanks to social media you could see what writers are talking to one martes and flirting with you and popping up at what parties and edited it out yeah it's like oh you yes so even though the internet does allow things to be more personal the dishonesty is still there and it's kind of easier to pick it out and highlight it out because you could see who's friends with who we're talking shit about who about where and you know who's had a bad experience with this other person and it's all documented all died so then so then later down the road when the bad review or the super positive review pops up it's like okay X makes sense makes sense now and also to would you say it was plenty unlike how we all we all they may our biases but at the same time if that art is that we're you know you were super huge fans of if they released some you know average to below average stuff we're going to call them out I mean you know it's not like it's not like we might have our bias but it you know if you coming out with a wack project or project ourselves that's more not up to your standards I'm gonna call you out I'm gonna say look this is but this is beneath you prime example that's always that's always hard though though like and I'm gonna give you a prime example of that too um recently last year when your view Tribe Called Quest we got it from here okay and everyone like people fans everybody the crew they know I'm a huge quest fan granted though I did I still like the album I enjoyed it but I didn't know where near loved it as much as can a mic and um we had a guest on there Kyle who's who's who's actually like older than all of us and he's been like an addict I have a hip hop listener for year for decade but um he loved it Mike loved it and ken loved it I was like yeah I liked it but I mean it was for me being a die-hard question I just feel like this this album wasn't he like it wasn't the it factor for me didn't it didn't pull me like the rest of the track called quest m and I'm a huge quest fan so of course Mike and it was losing they freaking mind I'm like look and a good album but you know I didn't love it you know like you guys they thought it was just like excellent from beginning to end I'm like not it had definitely some slip-ups on this album like for sure but yeah like it's hard it was tough and like what you said it was tough for me like it was really tough for me to be so critical same way with a lie so like I didn't even like de la soul's album they last out they got off a Kickstarter that they raised are a lot of money off of I didn't even love that out and I freaking loved De La Soul and you and if you watch that review again you can tell how sad I was like I look like a sad puppy because I had his like give a negative review on about I had to give a negative review for one of my favorite like hip hop groups you know what I'm saying so I was like yeah I mean let's let's demystify that that that sort of assumption that a lot of people make because thing is I feel like a lot of people may see you do a negative review or see me do a negative review and assume that we're doing that because we want to be mean or we're doing that because we're having fun doing that and it's it's never easy especially when that artist has come out with three four five projects that you're super impressed with yeah and you know you don't want anything else but for the next project to be good you know that's all you want they said that the other thing is embarrassing but you've heard so many that you know you know when you're excited and when you're not you know when you're liking something when you're not and you know if you're not excited you can't come on camera and pretend pretend the pretend to be when you're not you know which which I think of you know as part of the way that the camera kind of keeps people honest it can be like you say if five good projects and it can be one dough but I would be so sad that that's a bad project that it just would be I can't be excited people who know me know that I'm not that I won't be excited about it but yeah my Canon was of course they were surprised because it was like I told them how I was feeling before we reviewed it so yeah one day when they came up they was like what but you let him be but I'm like yeah but this was just bad you know is this it hurt if like I said it hurts when it wouldn't happen moving on from you know what I sort of see is like the next stage of kind of what we're doing right now I mean since my channel came up and your channel came up there's been this huge kind of growth in within the sector of YouTube reviews in this whole reaction genre yeah you know what's your take on a lot of these reaction videos generally you know do you feel like they're effective at what they're doing I mean it's it's sort of twofold you know for me it's like yeah you do kind of get those raw emotional reactions you know in an almost stronger way than you would in just kind of the formal review format mm-hmm but then there's you know there's really nothing like in terms of anything kind of I guess conversationally gained from from what's going on because you're kind of reacting to it right there you haven't had time to think about it you know I mean I think case in point is that some of these reaction reviewers they had the Kendrick Lamar reaction that they came out with and then maybe a week or so later it was like okay here's here's my Kendrick Lamar final verdict now when it's like I don't know for me I would much rather just gather all my thoughts together before I've even said anything and then just kind of tell you what I finally think after you know I've kind of really had my full experience with the album after multiple isms I think we're just in that time now where people like seeing that raw what is your what are your first impressions when you're listening to this song or this um I think that I think people don't mind it you know I think people like people just want what they want fast yeah yeah that was and that format is the fastest way to do it that's the way to do it is easier to do it you know the people who are recording it who was providing that that content is easier and I'd like you said I think people just like that click that could read Quick Reaction they like to feed it and I think that sort of adds to the fact that you know in the Internet age opinions have really been democratized you know people really want to know what everybody's thinking you know like they want to see opinions about some new album that they've heard on Twitter and they want to see a bunch of people reacting to it in real time on YouTube and you know they just want to be hit with so many different thoughts and ideas about this thing that they're listening to you know do you see I mean obviously it's not all of that thing because we sort of benefit off of that right you know right but I mean are there sort of negative other sort of negatives are there downsides to that because you know I think it does kind of create a situation where you're not really enjoying the album and all you're doing is just consuming all these opinions of the album or you know further down that road it could create a situation like what we saw with the Kendrick album where everybody's not enjoying the album there's creating conspiracy theories around the album right on using with that situation I just I try to ignore as much as that as possible because it's like one of those things where I'm like okay let me listen to the album let me enjoy it let me try to or as would you say you know dissect the album on my own because yes some of that stuff can cloud it like which you know for you example I could you reviewing an album before us and it's a Bono we're going to review I'll wait to afternoon review it did not probably okay let me check on see what happens you know Fantana saying about you know woody woody felt about this album not not after we got done shooting it so it's like I try to keep away from all that negative stuff you know that negative business all that buggy buggy buggy but like you said we benefit from because people people will watch us but I mean we they can't wait to see it which i think is good i think that's cool for them to be eager to hear our opinions you know cuz i was i was that same eager kids six seven years old seeing what the store is gonna say about how many mics they're gonna give this album so i mean i think it's it's good but were you throwing a social media in there it can get a little nerve-wracking it is like because every time so i just woke up understanding off social media i don't need to see nothing i don't need to hear anything me and you we both got it with the Kendrick of Kendrick Lamar review I mean any TDE review Kanye West stuff I mean we list can go on as far as artists that's like when people release stuff they just don't lose a mind and hit us within two minutes after the album drop you know so I just try to stay away from stuff like that you know and I just still be thankful that they still want to watch our videos well you know thinking about those kinds of technicalities and the thing that you're specifically focused on and if I could just kind of ask you a hip-hop hip-hop question or two since you guys are really just kind of geared and centered on on that genre in your series you know are there certain criteria or sort of things you go into an album looking for or listening for specific to the hip-hop genre because you know that's that's just kind of the genre you guys are centered around uh yeah definitely Center of course production because there by always like oh yeah we know you're going you go and be precipitous if ik about the production so that MC the voice sometimes you know voice does make a difference um you know we're going to say rather me like an MC or not cuz I mean we all know Danny Brown has a a voice test that's the acquired taste so you have voice I think of course lyrics kind of like I guess this is like weird for me it did I always do I've always kind of relative put the album cover into like what the artist is trying to say or talk about and I think I've said that on some of the day to hit my videos before where I'm like I look at the album cover and be like okay so maybe this person is probably going to do this so as I'm listening to the album I'm kind of like trying to picture what there was trying to bibley do with the album cover sometimes it works for me like it really works I'm like with them the album cover well that makes sense like that uh so that I know it's weird but that's just like my little only thing I always been doing since I was young and uh well I guess in like the mixes of the of the beat in of the album stuff like there's a sound Cleary's and mixes sound muddy is it meant to sound a certain way so something like that is well I pretty much what I get into but you know I guess like the basics button is it hard to kind of hold true to these criteria or at least kind of hold the same standards for them that maybe you used to when you would listen to music when you're younger with artists out there like Danny Brown and tire the creator or Death Grips or young thug artists who are really unorthodox and their approach to all these things who I mean you know they're making either I guess you could say good music or music that at least appeases their fans but the way that they approach things like production or you know the vocal approach you know it isn't why you couldn't call it good by traditional standards I guess right right yeah that's kind of true because I think I was going just for example to you example like when we reviewed me goes out like I was I wasn't going into that review the same way I was going into like let's say a rocky marciano or a cow review sure know what I'm saying cuz i know the host guys are completely different you know migos is completely different from a kind as far as sound the way a wrap everything so you know yeah certain artists you kind of I kind of go into it differently I'm not going to go into meat you know amigos a Gucci Mane album like I am a Skyzoo you know someone has really thought out thought-out type of artist you know killer Mike you know LP like I'm going to it differently so I'm going to as with like someone like me goes I have I've heard or future I'm going into a lot okay if I'm in a strip club well I enjoy listen to this music on the street club probably so like you know so I guess the math standpoint from that scale then I'm going to say yeah I you know me goes okay with me I fire my night listen to that on a regular basis will probably ever again until I go into a strip club or something like that then yeah the same way I would do MF DOOM out I'm not going to judge it that same way so in a way everything kind of has its time its place its squeeze extra whatever you know it's its moment that it fits in yeah even even if it does fit even I can probably like it we're still dog it out but I must still understand like okay I know what this music is for this is for that type of scene it's not for headphone music where I'm gonna sit down or I want to listen to something you know just chilling and relaxing you know what I'm saying so is this type of music you have when you just got people over you having a barbeque or just having to get together something like that I mean you know it's certainly still certain music is good for certain moves I might not want to fit that particular mood all the time so I might you know dog it out but I'm I still understand it for what it is um given that you guys focus pretty much just on hip-hop in in the reviews that you do on the channel what do you think feel like excuse me what do you feel like makes the genre so unique to review you know what what do you feel like makes the genre different from other genres when it comes to either the musical experience or just kind of the the challenge of kind of talking about it and reviewing it for an audience um I guess the fact that at least I feel hip-hop is been such it's been such a um a young man's game is like every time we were viewing something you know at our age of course it being older it's like people look at us like well you can't talk about this particular artist because you're not at a certain age like if you're a certain age the music has to be good or bad you know if you a certain age like if we like for example the future if we if what three out of four of us in like future are they gonna say it oh you have to be young to like it or you have to be all too old to understand it which is not the case because I've known and seen older dudes or dudes my age that enjoy future just as much as a 19 year old so I'm asking well what's funny his future is not even that young al exactly why I think you just pry ordered me you know and this is like and and you know you have all these kids who are listening to 2 Chainz and easiness 40s exactly it's like I mean y'all talking about us being old but y'all know like 2 Chainz is like owning us like so this is crazy yeah look that's one thing I don't I don't like about the genre because it's like to me it's the only jogger that don't respect as legends so like if you bring up a coochie rap to someone you know a king on black who but if you an R&B and if you young singer if you bring up Marvin Gaye of Stevie Wonder they gonna be like oh my god that's like Jesus or whatever but if you do the same way or if you say something bad about Mars right you right everybody's going to look at you right what's wrong with him a date but but that young R&B artists not going to say nothing bad about him whereas a young hip hop artist you see someone like you too little yachty a young thug and be like you know who is Rakim like forget Rakim like you know man I do oh it's like do that do like it's like want to do they lay down the foundation know who's DJ Kue hurt like they not gonna care about that they don't care about the legends that's the only genre that does not care about the legend do you feel like that that point of view though kind of comes with the the the competition and the attitude of rap music yeah it does I mean because you know you all guys are always trying to one of my best friend said uh like the rap game is like a hotel like so you check out if somebody that's gonna be hot that's gonna check in like just gonna check in the hotel and why that other hot person is checking out so and I think and like and it goes back to another point where I think it's just such a young man's game like people always want to kind of stay hip on to something fresh and new once you get a certain age or a certain you know type of demographic it's like we're gonna push you out so that's why it's a competition I think that's why that competition stays fresh because a lot of some of these guys have been making music for a long time they still like look I can do this just as well as that that new hot dude that's making music right now so it can be good it's healthy you know if the music is good but you know if you're just trying to blend in I've seen a lot where a lot of these older you know veteran MCS try to hop on or something like new and trendy and it's like dude that's not you what are you doing like stop so sure that's me and I'm pretty sure you seen that before too with some hip eyes I got why are you hopping on that wave you know you say it's a young man's game but do you feel like that's changing though you know with with guys like you and the rest of Gen and hip-hop who you know yeah you may be older but you know you're still very much one of the more consistent and notable outlets out there when it comes to hip hop reviews and you guys aren't you know back and down or fading away or anything like that you're keeping your opinions there in the circle just like with a lot of these young kids opinions and not only that but you know you have artists like 2 Chainz and future who do appeal to younger audience but they are older you have artists like Danny Brown who you know part of his whole backstory part of his whole shtick is that you know he sees himself as old at this point or you know at least at that the release of old and the release of 30 you know age has always kind of been an important thing for him you know Kanye West who is you know starting to push well yeah it seems like it's it's not as much a young man's game as it used to be no it's not it's not because but you know what it I think it is too sometimes I think and I tease younger younger my younger fanbase you know about this all the time like they always get on me you can to Mike for like trying to quote-unquote hang on to some of the legends like you know hang on to the Coogee reps y'all still hanging on to you know the weight red man's y'all still hanging on the Raekwon it's like some of these younger cats are starting to do that with little wayne cuz like as they see little wayne getting older like you said little wayne Kanye West these guys get older they may not be as or putting out as massive masterpieces of albums that they did in the earlier career but the younger generation is still hanging on to these little Wayne's and the kanye west's and not them and there's like it's like a full circle for me I look at it like it's like full circle but yet to answer a question I do think is it's kind of getting out of that because you look at Kendrick Lamar he's 30 nylon Drake I think Drake is 30 or 31 and I think long as that core fan base is still with you regardless your age I think I think we're seeing I think we're kind of seeing I think we're kind of still seeing like kind of a little bit because you still got a lot of young dudes are still and get like little yachty he's like clearly like what 20 19 20 years old you know who's you so you got a few but I still think I don't think it's shifting I don't think it's gonna be like oh yeah 35 40 is cool but I do think that you know you still got that dota group of guys that still kind of got the clear fan because I can see Kendricks still doing this 2:35 you know 35 almost 40 and if he's still putting on Kali albums we're still going to eat up regardless of his age I think the young people will too not as if it's a new way that's coming up final question before I close things up how important is sort of the history of the genre that you're talking about when going into a review you know do you feel like you know you guys kind of have that on lock do you feel like that's something that is lacking in other reviews or with other reviewers you know let me know what you think yeah I think history is definitely important because sometimes history can give a new fan some sort of like a I guess background like if you they want to do a I call this the background check of hip-hop if you want to come and do a background check I think when we're reviewing especially like older artists that's been in the game for 20-some plus years you know we always like to talk about hey look this person did this he worked with this you know if you thought this artist was if you thought the artists that you like today she go back and listen to where he got this you know or create this down or got inspired by this particular sound or this particular you know style of rap or a style of trapper you know trap rap or southern rap or whatever you know I think history is definitely important especially dealing with the genre of hip-hop because like I said before I think is the only genre where they don't respect the lessons or give notice to the legends you know what I'm saying like any other genre does so I think history is definitely important man when you especially just give the background of that artist because for people like me and you when we're talking about these artists I think it's great that we give them a background of so some sort of a small history of what when this artist got started where can you check out their stuff at how they establish their style and where they probably got inspired by or influenced by style so history is very important man in my painting especially when it comes to hip-hop culture and important to bring up in a review games yeah and it's important to bring up interview clear like I said we we talked about Kuji rap we talked about Scarface and we went through the history on them you know it's like you have to know why we why we're reviewing his artists and while we put him on such a high standard in the first place you know it's like this guy laid down a certain foundation for you know whatever coast west coast East Coast up know down south you know we're going to talk about that we got to bring that up you know it is important we feel like it's definitely important because a lot of people are not bringing that up right I want to thank BZ 4:30 for being on the episode of the podcast and sort of having a discussion with me about how to review an album sort of what goes through his mind when reviewing an album and sort of peeling back the curtain a little bit with the the process of sort of doing an album review with Devin hip hop and drop his YouTube channel is personal Twitter account of course the the Denton hip hop a YouTube account down in the description thanks for being on thank you man thanks Avni this is this is fun this is awesome [Music] [Music] 
OnVcHeX-mww,here we go hey everyone it's your friendly neighborhood Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd here in desperate need of a shave and haircut and I'm going to get that before I uh before I do my next review but I'm gonna do this quick raw track review over here of the brand-new Frank Ocean track lens Frank Ocean pop and R&B singer who just a couple years ago it was like the guy didn't even exist it's like he completely dropped off the map everybody was like but boys don't cry where is my boys don't cry and now that he's finally dropped his follow-up record to channel Lauren just like we can't get enough of them we can't hear enough from him between the endless record the endless project he dropped before blonde his amazing second great record moving on from there he had that biking track with Tyler the Creator and jay-z that slide on the version track with young thug that came out this new lens track and I'm sure there's other stuff that's been going on to kind of raise his visibility that is slipping my mind at the moment you know that segment he has on Apple music right now that the blonde did radio whatever it is which some of this new music has been coming from now this new song over here lens there is a version of it where it's just Frank and there's a version of it where we have a bit of an interlude on the tail end and then it goes into a passage where Travis Scott performs which kind of excites me because thinking of Frank style and thinking of Travis's style I feel like there's a lot of common ground there I feel like there are a lot of amazing ways that they could work together to make a great track however you know both of these versions kind of have their issues the the version with just Frank it does kind of fade out in the midst of that interlude which it feels like it's going somewhere it feels like it's progressing something I don't want it to cut off I don't want it to go away because it feels like there's some kind of Direction popping up here out of nowhere that I want to see where it goes and then the version with Travis we kind of get that satisfaction of that of that latter moment of the Ballad but then Travis's vocals just seem really off I don't know if he recorded them on a bad microphone or if they weren't mixed all that well or if there's just like some bad reverb on it I'm just really not sure his voice sounds tacked on and weirdly laced into the sound of the track which is unfortunate because again these are two people who I would love to hear collaborating on more tracks because I think there's so much common ground here between the influence from hip hop and both their music the influence from pop and both of their music the influence from R&B music in in their music em and you know modern trap as well I would say to degree but it just didn't go over that well I mean so I guess in the end I do kind of favor the solo Frank track because it doesn't have that ending that I think just falls flat on its face now as far as the core song of this track is a pretty stunning an emotional ballad from Frank it does have a heavy heavy presence of auto-tune toward the beginning but it really kind of seems like Frank is on his 808s and heartbreak for a good portion of this song you know he's kind of giving a passionate vocal performance that auto-tune is super super heavy to the point where he just almost sounds robotic the keys that he's playing over are very somber they're very sad kind of soulful too and as the song progresses it kind of melts away that auto-tune melts away and it kind of reveals Frank's raw very human very organic voice and then it sounds like yet another quality ballad off of blond and as far as the lyrics go and you know that that's that's pretty much it for the music for me I mean not the music's bad I enjoy the fact that it takes kind of that simple approach that a lot of the music off of blond did for me that record Frank found great power and sort of very straightforward very bare and raw intimate instrumentation and he did kind of find a way to make that auto-tune sound come off somewhat intimate now as far as the lyrics it's interesting because Frank seemed at one point like somebody who was trying to avoid his fame at all costs and not come out with that follow-up record and not give his audience what they wanted and now he's coming through the track that almost seems like a meditation on Fame it almost seems like religious in a sense as well I'm not exactly sure where sort of the the elements of popularity and where the elements of spirituality kind of end and start maybe they're bleeding together there are multiple moments on the track where Frank where Frank makes references to spirits looking at him and smiling and you almost kind of seem that you see this lack of shame in him in the lyrics as a result of well I don't know if there's really anything for me to worry about they've already seen everything they've seen me at my worst they've seen me doing things that I should be embarrassed about so what do I have to be embarrassed about anymore and I kind of feel like in the same way he's kind of taking that same attitude when it comes to his his popularity his life in the limelight as well because sort of the way the spirits are kind of looking at him at least the way that I took it on the track sort of seemed to be the same way the lens was looking at him that he was referencing on the track so you know don't go into this just thinking it's just a simple kind of ballad that you don't need to read into debt that deeply he's really trying to make a personal comment on on his popularity right now which should be pretty interesting for fans because while he does talk a lot of personal stuff in his music he hasn't quite you know mulled over his own popularity in his music all that much and I would say this is a pretty interesting moment for that I do like the track quite a bit given that it was released after blonde and you know it was kind of a one-off thing and I don't think a new Frank Ocean album was around the corner I'm not really sure if there's any thing else I can say about it other than what I'm saying right here you know I don't really kind of feel like it's indicative of a new direction for Frank or anything like that it really just kind of seems like an extension of what he did on his last record all I do is is I kind of sit here in hope that he doesn't you know blow a bunch of potentially great ideas by you know rushing out a bunch of tracks again and again and again you know I'd much rather maybe kind of lurk back into the shadows maybe not for as long as he did after channel orange but again lurk back into the shadows and kind of hide away a little bit simmer on some ideas and come through with another boom like great fantastic reinvention creative colorful amazing and emotional album you know don't don't spoil too much for us you know because Frank Ocean I think is one of those artists who will probably do better if he doesn't give too much away to everybody I feel like the mystique and the mystery of Frank Ocean is part of what makes his music so interesting and so entertaining him and he does kind of give you one of those revealing moments in his music it feels so significant because he doesn't reveal a whole lot so uh you know I guess those are my thoughts again I'm not sure if I'm to think anything of this track beyond that if this song is going anywhere pointing any direction because it seems like it's too early to tell or predict or even expect you know a new record from Frank Ocean but I do like this track and you know hopefully uh he comes out with another record that is just as refreshing as blonde and sort of everything he's really kind of presented us with in this time span what did you think of this track if you gave it a listen did you love it did you hated why what do you think I should review next and I will catch you guys in the next video forever 
WnrrJjtraas,hi everyone king for the ban tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and right here I'm trying to make a video about a phenomenon that I've noticed in emails people send me in conversations I've had with people who watch the show and messages people send me over social media about the show as well but I haven't addressed it until now because a youtuber fellow youtuber made a pretty interesting and I would say very accurate video about about it here's a clip the other day it hit me because Drake's album came out but I don't know if I liked it or I didn't like it but I was leaning more towards the liking it Avenue but as always YouTube's algorithm showed me that Anthony Fantana didn't waste any time and quickly made a review about Drake's new album and his review kind of made me feel not so good in my stomach because now I lean more towards the middle of I'm not sure again whether I like this album or not it said some things that I didn't think about listening to the album but now that I'm aware of them I don't know if I should keep liking the album because I always liked it or if he is right control you bitch your favorite rapper sucks your favorite rapper sucks and you don't like him anymore and you know why cuz I said so I said well you don't like and that's why you don't like it your favorite band sucks - oh your favorite band their shit they're a shitty band and you don't like him either because I told you not to like him you got poopy doodoo caca taste poopy doodoo and your favorite singer sucks - sorry your favorite singer your favorite ukulele player garbage your favorite electro ambient producer garbage your favorite new disco quinta carbage I decide what you like bitch honestly this is one of the few things I will never get and I will never understand about my reviews I get people hating my opinions I get them disagreeing with my opinions I get understanding and respecting my opinion but one thing I do not get is that you cannot enjoy an album because I put out a negative review of that album turning people off of things that they like is probably one of the least favorite things about the influence that I have with the videos that I make I would much rather influence people to like things not to dislike things but I mean honestly I I give as much passion I give 100% whether I'm doing a positive review or a negative review it's just kind of the audience's choice that they would much rather watch the negative review a lot of the time huh and while yeah you know I'm not a big post Malone fan and the guy who made this video he brings up post Malone my negative post Malone review and yeah the things I said in that review I honestly feel those things but I would much rather you spend time digging through my loved list and finding some recommendations there rather than worrying about whether or not it's okay to listen to baloney Maloney because I don't really like the guys music this just confuses me so much because it's I tell you guys all the time that these videos my reviews are just my opinion and I don't say that so that you can't get mad at me people are gonna get mad at me either way I say that because I'm saying hey take my lead here form your own opinion have your own point of view if I want to influence you to do anything it's to bring the music you're listening to the forefront a little bit put it in the forefront of your mind think about what you're listening to and think about why you like it here's another point that this guy made in his video that I that I liked and he released an album self-titled it calling it future and goddamn that album is my fucking shit I give that album a 10 out of 10 it makes me feel like I am the one selling drugs I am the one that's getting all these hoes I am the kingpin it makes me go into a fantasy world that I don't live in at the moment that makes me fuck I am up fucking with the wall let me give myself a bit of hypothetical credit here and say that man maybe I'm influencing you guys to dislike records that you previously liked because I just really thought about it and I made a good point and I just I just said some good ass shit maybe just notice some stuff I didn't or he put in a way that I couldn't even if that's true I don't think that means I'm 100% right or you're one is percent wrong or that I'm even 80% right and you're twenty percent wrong the math the math on that is dodgy but you know what I'm saying I get the idea of listening to an album and feeling like hyper-charged off of it you feel like you're that dude just me personally I'm not trying to be that guy with with all the hoes you know I want to love myself I want to steal all the oxygen I want to be the darkness creeping through your system you know the the whip cracking every bitch into position that's more my vibe I love being empowered by music just future he doesn't really empower me there's nothing about his sound honestly that feels all that powerful or cool to me we're tough or gritty or whatever to me it just kind of sounds like a fish singing over a trap beat let's go let's go that's just what it sounds like to me if you liked it if you want to keep on liking it then just keep on liking it try to understand where I'm coming from and just reframe what you're listening to from where you are coming from and just understand why you like it or why it appeals to you Drake's more life for example my biggest critique of this record is that so much of it sounded really unfinished kind of unpolished very background and that's not necessarily a terrible thing as I said in my more life review I think it's a reflection of how a lot of Drake's audience and just the mainstream audience in general for music listens to music consumes music these days I think Drake has successfully sort of catered to that the sales of this project reflect that I don't care for it but that's mostly because it's not really what I'm looking for in my music I think you could watch my review of this record and come away from it understanding what I'm saying but simultaneously listen to more life but still enjoy it for the fact that it's just a little bit of vibe music it's some background music it's you know nice and pleasant its atmospheric it sets a nice mood you know when I actually think about all these bland whitewashed dancehall songs I do groan but when it's just kind of playing in the background and it's just sort of you know not the forefront of my mind it's it's nice and honestly I don't really think Drake meant for more life to be anything more than that so you could make the argument that this album succeeds at what it's trying to do still though I don't think it's good and I'm gonna tell you that because I feel like that's my job telling you guys my honest and straightforward opinion about new music and I feel very much the same way about futures music - you know stuff that I dislike a lot of it is very popular and you know even the stuff that I don't care for I think has a time has a place has an audience and if you just happen to be in that audience then I mean fuck it the the albums for you it's meant to appeal to you it's doing what it's supposed to do I'm obviously not the person future has in mind when he makes his music nor do I think I should be I digress though my point is I don't want to tell you what to dislike you know if if you want to come into some negative review that I've shot and get a laugh out of me tear on-the-record apart that's totally understandable that's fine I get watching my reviews for that purpose a lot of people do find my negative reviews to be kind of comedic I get that but don't come away from the review feeling like you got to feel the way that I feel if I ask you to do anything other than watch my reviews it's just try to check out the artists that I review that you're not so familiar with especially the artists who I do try to give a very positive review - you know music that does seem sort of a special at least to my point of view you know go out there and check out the the onda trope because and the shoe shoes and the the swans and the idols and the Neal Caesar Regas of the world Clarence Claire out but ultimately I'd rather influence the way you listen to music rather than what music you listen to because simply buying every album that I buy and trashing every album that I trash I don't think that's the most mindful way of getting value out of what I'm trying to do here maybe I made a good point about an album you really like her you really love but don't just come away from his shrugging your shoulders like oh well you know I guess he's just right no don't do that like stand there really think about why it is you like this thing in the first place to defend your shit and you know what if it comes down to well you know I just like listening to it because of some feel-good background music that I like to put on while I'm jerking off to some porn then you know there's there's nothing wrong with that it's totally fine so it's totally cool not every record needs to be super deep or super lyrical or some super mega edgy conceptual to pimp a butterfly death-grip shit some music can just be some passive fun some music can be you know just wildly experimental more experimental than I even like listening to some music can have some kind of deeper hidden emotional meaning for you that it doesn't really have for me and please go into my reviews understanding that there's most likely a difference between how I'm listening to a record and you're listening to a record because it's my job to listen to the album I have to be analytical and focused and add attention and engage with everything that's going on in the song or in the album sure I may overlook things I may misinterpret things but I'm not just taking this casual approach to my listen of the album and that's going to inform my enjoyment in very different ways then you know your enjoyment might be informed by just kind of listening to an album it the same way that you would any album just simply for for pleasure so while there may be certain things about an album that really really really matter to me because I'm just like maybe they don't rank as high for you in terms of importance so in in final I will say my opinion matters my opinion controls you my opinion influences everything you're doing only as much as you allow it to believe me if I had control of what people were thinking I would have I would have so much more interesting ideas than you know getting you guys to like some fucking albums all that being said though thank you for watching this video I hope this has caused you to reflect a little bit on the the videos I make how you watch the videos that I make I know this isn't going to stop people from sort of consuming my videos in the ways that they do that's totally understandable you know if this is entertaining for you guys you pick your level of enjoyment you pick the kind of enjoyment you get out of these videos I just personally don't want to be causing anybody any sort of like I really like this album and Vanda no ruin you or me like that's that's really not the kind of you know emotional stress I want to be putting on people especially over something is as simple as music I mean obviously I love music I take it really seriously I have made music the the fucking center of my life which I orbit around but you know it's it's nothing to sort of you know sort of uh get all stressed over like this you guys are the best I will catch you in the next video love you love you muah muah muah transition what do you think about this topic influence opinions changing

m2XV3sj_iqY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go into what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week it's a

have to offer because I will say again out of all these vinyl the month clubs that I've worked with and I've worked with quite a few you know I've done sponsorships with quite a few of them and you know I've seen many others this is one of the more unique ones these guys are truly doing something really interesting sting sting sting all right as I was saying this is kind of a special week it's kind of a unique week there there wasn't a whole lot in terms of tracks that I really truly loved and was excited about yeah you know we might do best tracks first just to get it out of the way because there are just a couple of tracks that I was kind of surprised by did enjoy and you know it's its tracks some of them that I didn't even anticipate that I would enjoy first I want to give a shout out to the new bones mixtape which is titled unrendered I believe which is that on soundcloud right now give that a shot just kind of shout that out and moving on from there one of my favorite tracks that I hear this week is from the tunnel visions the track Ted Nami hope I'm pronouncing that correctly and it's a really cool creative piece of tech house it's kind of experimental very groovy and some very creative and strange vocal samples throughout this this track that I thought were pretty beautiful too it's a it's sort of a hit this really interesting balance between being cold and sort of calculated and very repetitive and methodical but also soulful and colorful and bright so I like that track quite a bit next moving on from there the new white Suns tracks psychic drift white Suns who I have reviewed on multiple occasions so far these guys are an interesting noise and experimental music outfit that have a new record coming out via the flexor and I believe this is their second album for the label and I think I love their last one I love their previous record before that but there's no one over here this track that they've come out with it does take a while to get going it is a slow burner it is a very heavy and ominous drone but once the track really starts revving up and getting really noisy and intense and you get those kind of screamed shouted vocal passages it does get insane and off the wall so I'm really digging that track moving on from there big boy with kill Jill featuring killer Mike banger of a track awesome awesome performances on this track big boy he always comes out with a great track he always comes out with a great couple of singles this one with the killer Mike is truly gritty and hard-hitting and badass but the track that he came out with featuring Adam Levine uh God what was it Mike Mike oh I don't want to only want to think of it right now honestly this track would with a mic Jack God this track Mike Jack that that was like an awful piece of dance pop rap so big boy he can never really settle on a single sound you know he does have the ability to kind of pull off those hard-hitting tracks but in his heart he is very much a pop rapper to it to a big degree so I mean I always sort of go into a big boy project expecting that sort of variety and inconsistency in a way you know there are just some directions and then that he goes in some sounds he pursues that I do not like it all and these two tracks exemplify that perfectly this is like wow this is here's the big boy I love and here's the big boy I don't like all together on two simultaneously released tracks so it just letting you guys know if I end up feeling that way about his forthcoming record that's that's perfect that's probably that's probably why but I did love that killer Mike track that killer Mike track was great and that's pretty much it for tracks that I was was truly truly loving this week there were a lot of tracks that was sort of on the fence with the new rich chick a song back at it definitely one of his more introspective and personal tracks from a lyrical standpoint but not really all that as far as like a chorus the beat wasn't banging all that hard it was really that it wasn't a song I really got whipped up in you know though if you're if you're kind of looking for a more introspective angle from rich chigga because he hasn't really kind of given that on too many tracks thus far this could be a pretty interesting listen for the hardcore fans who kind of want to get a little bit deeper into what he's about and what he's trying to do with his music so that track is decent the new xxx temptation tracks that popped up on WorldStarHipHop this this week there were a couple of them were all kind of okay there was one track where he's rapping over like a boom bap beat and he was really trying to put together some bars and it was like you know that's that's alright you know it's not amazing the track that really sort of stuck out to me as my favorite I guess was the track he put out with ski masks the slumped god what in tar what an xxx tarnation which is just kind of another heavy distorted aggressive track in his usual style though the really me me title so you know I don't really know if there's anything else to say about it beyond that it was it was listenable it was decent you know it was fun moving on from there the new father John misty cover of who loves the Sun zealot underground cover a track that is in a new soundtrack that you need to go to I think 259 in the link down there in the description box to start hearing that it's a decent cover its a sweet cover you know certainly plays into the the emotional mood of a lot of the songs that he put out lately off of his latest record pure comedy and also Paramore hard times like this is part of the week that this week was that this is part of the reason this week was crazy like everything's been flipped on its fucking head Hopson came out with a new track called bust that which is like a weird kind of little tour song which is actually pretty listenable and Paramore came out with the track that was like surprisingly listenable this track hard times is not the usual pop punk PAP that the band comes through with it may seem a little dated in that it sounds and the music video even looks like it could be a for some kind of disco tinged indie pop from the 2000s or something but I do think this is one of their better songs like it certainly sounds better than their pop punk stuff so I'm all for this direction personally I find it kind of refreshing so moving on from there I have so many other tracks that it was a you know thought was thought were worth shouting out but I but I still looked really crazy about you know the new idols track that Australian band idols which are typically really brutal really noisy they've come through with this new track titled the Maslow dogs I believe that's how you pronounce that it's not quite as heavy or as monstrous as as is a lot of what I've heard so far this Maslow's dog's track but it is certainly jammy and does have I think a greater post-hardcore influence to it the issue with the track though is that I think at one point the Jam kind of loses a little bit of steam and stops being all that exciting like the intensity of the playing sort of falls off sort of trails off and the track gets a little um moving on from there youth code lost at sea Chelsea Wolfe does a remix of this song which is actually like pretty raw and awesome DRAM has a new track featuring ASAP Rocky and Juicy J titled Gilligan which is pretty low key track you know not really as colorful or as eccentric or as fun as some of my favorite tracks that dream has put out and not that he can't put out a nasty gritty trap sort of a very nocturnal very murky sort of song but it's not really like anything all that exciting to me outside of the guests features on this song you know the hook is kind of a dud in my opinion and the beat is just kind of like a bit of a generic trap thing there's not really anything all that is sort of a special about the instrumental and DRAM isn't really sort of letting loose on his bright sort of crazy vocal harmonies or anything like that he's trying to do sort of a more straightforward rap performance on this track it's it's okay it's okay I'm not crazy about it it's decent moving on from there perfume genius had a track out called go ahead this week that is definitely the oddest and most difficult to digest track that I've heard Mike come out with in a long time like the beats are so sporadic and the track is so I don't know tangled in these odd rhythms and just like a really weird groove or just the way the song is paced is just so strange I don't really know if I could say much more about it than that it's just really really obtuse and it has me not worried but sort of a little on the fence but intrigued as to like wow like what what does this potentially mean for the rest of the record like can the rest of the record be this sort of experimental and if it is will it all just kind of like make a bit more sense and will everything kind of fall into place once I hear the entire album so you know while it's not like what this instant hit to me it does kind of have me you know sort of a little puzzled and interested to see where things are going the new bleachers track I hate that you know me it was okay xate oven he said lana day featuring gucci mane and 21 savage it was alright and you know that was it for the tracks that was kind of a thought were decent thought were worth mentioning but you know I wasn't crazy about now the worst tracks of the week God there are so many the big boy track that I just mentioned with Adam Levine God is that track sickeningly sweet and I just don't want to have anything to do with it ever again I'm not looking forward to whatever album that's going to land on and I got to listen to it more moving on from there Lana Del Ray has a new song out titled lust for life with the weekend and a lot like the last track she just came out with the production is absolutely disappointing on this track it's almost like she's completely abandoned the sort of vintage vocal pop aesthetic that her music usually puts forward which I felt like she embraced that in a bigger way than ever that she ever has before on her last record and I was kind of excited to see if she would continue to push that forward but now with the glitzy sort of flat mostly synthetic instrumentals that she's working with really on this song I don't know it's it's kind of like I'm listening to some adult contemporary pop or something you know it doesn't sound young it doesn't sound youthful it doesn't sound fun does it sound colorful it doesn't sound vibrant it's just very sanitary it's just very static it's just very flaccid it's very flat and I mean I know I've said before that even before this was publicly acknowledged by either of them that Lana Del Rey is the girl that weekend is singing about in his songs and weekand is the guy that Lana Del Rey is singing about in her songs and they need to work together more because the few occasions that I've had that I have heard them work together it always sounds good on this track not so much chemin not not not so much chemistry on this song in my opinion it's kind of a drab mess I mean as they're kind of trading lines on this track it just sounds so boring and maybe it could have a lot to do with the instrumental it just doesn't seem that there's much fire or urgency to this track both of them are kind of fun ended in both of them are just kind of painting by numbers on this song in my opinion moving on from there we have surgical methane I'm invisible the ministry side project and that this apparently is the DJ swamp remix and this was a nice little track that came out for a 4/20 so if you're looking to I don't know give yourself a little bit of a you know 4/20 regret I guess listen to this track is god it is bad this next track is hard woods have a new song out titled hit that drum and woods are a band that I've covered numerous numerous numerous times on this channel and there have been a couple attractions forthcoming album love his love that I really liked a couple of tracks that it was really or at least one track that it was majorly disappointed by this track is another one of those the track is unlike any other song I've heard the band put together it's mostly based on this sort of tense fluttering drone like this constant shuffling of instrumentation to sort of build this wall of sound and odd is it awkward and the sound that it creates is is neither exciting nor is it relaxing or pleasurable it's just so sour and ugly and horrid that I just don't know what else to I feel like even though the words that I've said they're very negative I feel like I failed to adequately describe what makes this song fall so flat on its face in my opinion I'm very worried about this forthcoming woods album I'm afraid that there's going to be just very little consistency to it because that's sort of what the singles so far have been kind of you know communicating to me and this track is man I'm not looking forward to having listened to this track a bunch more times when their next director comes out because this was like an instrumental mess and just didn't really make much sense to me from an instrumental standpoint from a performance standpoint from a production standpoint from a songwriting standpoint it was just one of the weirdest and most unpleasurable experiences I've had listening to a wood song but even more unpleasurable I would say is the new Lady Gaga track the cure God is this a generic piece of pop trash you know which is really unfortunate because everything from her last record even the worst tracks like had I would say more personality to them more rawness to them you know definitely more of a singer/songwriter aesthetic to them than anything she's ever put out before you know definitely not as glitzy or over-the-top and I wouldn't even call to cure that you know it just kind of seems like a really generic dime-a-dozen sort of pop beat Lady Gaga's vocal performance didn't really seem to dig in that much emotionally for me either it just seemed like Lady Gaga kind of reminding people a little bit like hey you know I still make you know plain old popping music you know it's not all about this whole rock country funky soul music thing that I just did on my last record which unfortunately like you know from what I've seen is not sold as well as some of her previous records maybe she's kind of feeling the pinch there a little bit in this thinking hey maybe I should go back into a direction that my fans sort of expect from me or something you know which you know again is unfortunate I liked her last record I like that she sort of took a risk there and tried something different for the most part I think it did pan out but um you know I guess she's she's clearly feeling the need to go back into you know her typical sort of dance pop of direction and you know and if she's going to do that you know certainly I welcome that but it's it's going to be it's going to need to be something a little bit more unique and memorable than what she's presented here on the Cure because this seems like a track that pokerface Aragog could have written with two hands behind her back because this is just you know not really anything special in terms of the song the sound the lyrics it was just so so so run-of-the-mill for her so another huge disappointment and another amazing couple of disappointments the new young thug saw all the time God the the can I get the lyrics for the hook on this track up the the guy is literally rapping about tampons he's literally rapping about tampons the hook makes no fucking sense it's such a bad track not only that but vocally this is one of the worst songs the thugger has ever put together like he sounds like a bad pop can he sounds like he's trying to do a little bit of a dancehall thing but he doesn't have the ability to fully commit to that sound or vocal style so sometimes he's dipping into it sometimes he's dipping out of it and then you know again you get this god-awful hook where he's just rapping or singing or whatever about fucking tampons and bleeding on you girl which is actually kind of disgusting like kind of kind of reaches a level of disgust that I that hit me when I heard that line off of Rick Ross's last record where he was rapping about like that girl eating his ass out or whatever that's disgusting this is also discussing thinking of some kind of young thug tampon with menstrual blood bleeding on people that's like really weird and gross to me and not even because I think a menstrual blood is inherently gross or anything like that it's it's the fact that young thug has been melded with with tampons so he's a man pon you know he's half human half tampon and there's blood all in him and he's bleeding on people that's fucking gross but moving on from there the last track I want to mention in God the soul this'll end the segment thankfully is the new Danzig track devil on highway 9 Danzig I'm not saying it's time for Danzig to stop making music I think it's time for Danzig to start making different music you know because the thing is what he's trying to do on this track what he's been trying to do for his past couple of records it's just not working out anymore not only do the instrumentals not sound that great but I don't think Danzig really has the vocal presence to kind of deliver over this kind of music anymore because on this track he sounds Haggard I don't know if he could have done another take and gotten a better vocal performance or you know sipped a little tea gotten a better night's sleep I don't know what the solution is all I know is that he sounds awful on this track like this is nothing like debut album Danzig this is nothing like you know second or even third album Danzig this is just a mess and I don't know what else to say about other than that and those are the worst tracks of the week God there were so many of them and hopefully next week is not nearly as emotionally trying because I honestly I caught up on a lot of these songs recently because I was kind of you know in the midst of all the damn drama from the damn review that just came out and you know I was kind of locked into that and sort of looking at my other reviews and everything like that and it wasn't until like a day or so a day or two ago that I was like okay wait actually like let's try to see what all the songs were that came out over the week and I was like man so many terrible songs God so you know thankfully exercise that demon it's out of the way and now that's sort of through let me say again Amazon

Sb2jdXBAWw4,"what am i doing what am I doing with my life [Music] hi everyone life in the new life can hear the internet check the microphone music nerd and make sure it's on it's time for a day where I go over the records that have made it recently semi recently in my collection over here I have so many records that I'm sitting on right now that I have not had a chance to get on the turntable and give a full listen to because I just have so much going on with the channel with my personal life with a ton of different  so you know my time with my turntable has been limited as of late however you know Record Store Day did just happen I got a couple of pickups over here and I did actually get a chance to give a listen to a handful of records that I have gives pretty positive reviews too that I've been pretty excited to give a listen to that I'm going to talk about here and yeah that's going to be it for this video and remember down there in the description is a link to all of my other vinyl collection videos let's just get straight into it no more but damn gory sorry I love you guys sorry why did you ban me from your live events like our UI my god I wish I could see Corey Feldman live but I can't I'm not allowed this is the honest-to-god 7-inch of go for it featuring Snoop Dogg and every day with doc ice yes yes yes and yeah man it's it's it's really it's it's some it's some Corey Feldman and his angels up here they are okay let's let's get let's getting close over here okay let's just get in a little close so Corey Feldman and his annuals over here they are up front they are flying Corey up to heaven his guitar is clear and he's smiling he's looking very happy it's very innocent they're going up to heaven but then and I didn't know at the bottom of the picture over here the entire world is burning to hell like everybody is burning to death down there and Corey Feldman is angel they're smiling they're like haha we're so happy we're so glad but I mean you know after how they were treated after that you know Today Show performance I can understand how they would want the whole world to burn as they ascend up to heaven playing they're playing their music for the rest of their lives but um I think that I think the cover of this 7-inch actually says quite a bit about a Corey Feldman and his angels as a musical project now there isn't too much to the back over here other than some liner notes some credits the inside of the gatefold over here is just white quite naked but the the 7-inch I mean the 7-inch itself it has kind of this old-school sort of like very cloudy heavenly print on the inner sleeve over here and you see it right here you see this you see this right this thing is blue it is a beautiful very saturated blue and I don't know if there's really anything else I could say about it other than please do not be jealous of me having this and because honestly the only reason to own this is really for the mean and I'm not even totally sure if it's if it's worth that because I threw this thing on a turntable and listened I put a lot of effort into making sure my table sounds good my cartridge sounds good my amp sounds good I got good speakers this 7-inch sounds like I do not know who did the mastering for the vinyl or if there even was any mastering for the vinyl then this is just like some kind of you know just like recording just thrown onto the record or something like that maybe it says over here if I read into it enough but no it just kind of looks like performance credits but um mixed by Mike as engineer here I don't see anything saying that there was any kind of vinyl mastering here but the record sounds terrible like Snoop Dogg is even harder to make out on go for it than he is on the digital version that you can catch online there on iTunes or Apple music or Spotify or whatever so you know don't necessarily be jealous that that you don't have this because it don't sound good the only context I see myself playing the 7-inches if I have someone over I want to torture with it or if you know somebody who I know is just really morbidly curious and then I'll just have to have to you know bend to their whims and play them the 7-inch but you know outside of that it don't sound good it's not a fun listen I did not put it on and smile I smile more just looking at it than I do actually listening to it so you know that's it is what it is but still though I am NOT happy with corey feldman I would like to see Corey Feldman live but I'm not allowed at the show and you know hopefully hopefully Corey hits me up on Twitter he changes his mind and he comes around you know maybe you guys can reach out to him don't be mean to Corey don't harass Corey you know just say Anthony Fantino doesn't really dislike you and and he has a fun time listening to your music and you know he's not he doesn't he doesn't hate you like you know you think he may hate you like he's not a big fan of your your record but like you know he's a fan of you as a person and you know he wants to support you you know it's I know it's really weird to be obsessed with something that I really don't like all that much but you know I will say that in a weird ironic way I am a Corey Feldman fan so you know we'll just leave it there this next release is another thing that I was looking out for this records today I didn't get too much Record Store Day stuff because I wasn't really like truly excited for that much stuff but I did get this 10,000 kids with guitars a little kind of reissue thing over here compilation released I don't know what you call it from the band noise attic now this trio I found out about doing my research for Record Store Day and this is like some Australian band from like the 90s or so who you know we're we're making a recording music that had some grunge influence and Punk influence like there was some gang no Johnson influence going on there some of their stuff is pretty low Phi and I like what I heard and I was looking forward to picking this record up to kind of getting to using that as an opportunity to kind of get to know the band's music better now it is like a double LP you know ABCD sides and there's a cool little like little booklet over here this is a pretty involved with that what they have going on over here it seems like the whole story of the band with like loads of neat little pictures that just look like Ross as good for them you know I mean this this is back in the day I'm sure I'm sure they're all full grown adults now you know get not they're just not kids anymore but you know this what they were doing what they were recording seems like pretty cool in Australia you know you could spend months and months and months sort of getting to know the the the important and the significant artists in the Australian music scene because there are just so many cool artists over there and interesting musical anomalies that just don't make it over here they just have a scene over there it's kind of all its own and you know it's it's an interesting petri dish for some artistic ideas and sounds that you know don't always carry over to the US and I guess another kind of cool thing about the cover over here is it's kind of a like a pop up sort of thing but what I mean I don't it doesn't necessarily reveal anything since the cover itself is black kind of a weird choice there but like you know I guess it is kind of a cool I don't I don't own or another record that does this so I guess that is kind of a neat thing though we did not come with a plastic sleeve so I got to throw it in some plastic sleeve because I do not want that to get damaged that would not be nice obviously I just got this record so I haven't played the vinyl yet but I'm assuming it sounds just as good as the digital recordings that I heard online and this next one is not a new record store day release but it is a record store day redemption because I think this came out last year I saw an older copy of it today and I was like man I was looking for that last year now it's here I'm going to get it and it is a repressing of wu-tang's debut single protecting that with Method Man on the b-side ah and it is of course a nice half black half orange 12-inch not complaining about that or like orange a yellowy orange a yellowy just like the blue tank front cover 36 chambers you know sort of the culprit color of the logo that they're using over there and yeah I just really kind of like the flat sort of cardboard very raw nasty kind of finish of the of a cover are over here it's plain you know nice double color vinyl record sounds good too really happy to have that on on vinyl and you know again Record Store Day Redemption I was looking for this last year and it's and it made its way into my possession because somebody gave it up somebody apparently did not protect their neck and and they had to give up this vinyl because your family was like well we're not we're not Lu tank fans and so-and-so over here they didn't really protect their neck or anything so what are we going to do it other than sell it get you know just pawning so moving on from there got to give a shout out to a couple of people who send me some records I've got to give a shout out to the one and only nard waar and you send me a copy of the new evaporators album Ogopogo punk and nard waar you guys may know him for his journalistic endeavors his interviews and you know there are certainly great interviews but you know you got to get into the guys music too because because he had some really cool fun happy-go-lucky enjoyable music you know people tell me that I don't listen do enough happy music and you know if there's a happy music I do like quite a bit it's the evaporators now to me this is not one of their more significant releases because it is kind of short it's kind of like a bit of a glorified mini album in a way it's just nine tracks a lot of the songs are very short and a couple of tracks on the back end don't you know they don't sound like evaporators tracks because they have different singers megan barnes on the track candy is actually a very kind of fun almost like post-punk II almost disco II poppy sort of rock track reminded me of blondie a little bit in a way like that track quite a bit and the final track on here is actually a rap song featuring brother Olly where brother Olly is rapping about guard wire himself which is actually pretty endearing and flattering track I imagine us for Naru R to kind of hear that song even for me it was like wow it's like a really kind of cool fun track about the man the the legend himself gnar one of the human serviette is a you know some cool fun cover art over here and you know tracks like Ogopogo Punk and Mohawks and dreadlocks tortora Mohawks and dreadlocks you know the typical kind of silly poppy punky very very tongue-in-cheek very playful evaporators musical style they've come through with the you know some good tracks and I believe the it's it's kind of like this yellowy orange color yeah it's nice yellowy orange II vinyl nice 12-inch over here played at 45 rpm of course because again it is kind of a short little record but yeah shoutouts and hardware for sending me that it is a very fun record and nard we're all is a class act always a classy guy to that guy how can you look at that this picture seems like fidgeting is like there's like a little bit of soft focus on the band to make them look like so sweet or you know they just really naturally look that smooth they look very smooth they're all very smooth guys are very smooth very smooth pillowy features like very cuddle smooth men it looks like a man in that photo sorry guys I was just I was uh indulging a little bit of dry sexual innuendo there for for my own personal humor and I got to give a shout out to the good people over are earache records because they sent me this badass vinyl copy of foot of sleeps holy mountain I've had a digital copy of this record for a while never owned a vinyl copy of it they said they'd be sending one my way I guess this is kind of a special repressing of the record over here I don't know if this is the case for previous pressings they've done on this record or other pressings of this record but apparently this is like some full dynamic range album and the thing is this sleep album it's not it's not famous for its recording quality it is a little rough around the edges a little raw but I think whatever they did with this record it sounds very good at least it kind of has a very clear punchiness to it you know this album is definitely not as heavy or as thick or as dense that you would probably want an album in this doom metal stoner metal genre to be but this album does sound very raw does have very nasty this I'm very animalistic and the vinyl itself is a nice kind of heavy ish pressing and the color is this kind of deep --is-- purplish kind of a dark magenta sort of shade it's very opaque as well it's like it's not quite you know it's not quite a it's sort of see-through but not quite see-through and it's just really nice pressing it sounds good this is certainly a better listen than the digit of the digital copy of the album that I've had so I'm like you know really happy to sort of have have this and you know again I appreciate Eric for sending this my way not getting it earache listening to this haha that's a bit of a musical auditory humor I guess but the record itself sounds good again if you're into stoner metal you're into doom metal if you're kind of curious about that stuff you know if you like Sabbath if you want to hear something that pulls from blues rock sort of slows it down makes it sound really heavy give this thing a shot good this thing to listen and you can't go wrong with I think this is pressing it does sound really good and the price that I've seen before online is not really that bad either moving on from there I want to give a shout out to oh I don't really have to shout out anybody since all this oh no I did not buy this myself I want to give a shout out to the record label OSR for this Hartley C white album that they sent me over here which recorded us our studio OSR look them up on Bandcamp because they're now-defunct and they were having a sale and the guy who or at least the person who I was in contact worked over there I know watches my stuff and you know was like hey we're doing a sale and you know we're giving away some stuff like would you want us to send you anything and I said send me send me a Hartley see white record because he's always been one of the more eccentric and interesting artists on the label in my opinion Hartley is this really odd kind of very outsider music type guy's sort of spoken-word almost very poetic music like I love the words that go into his music quite a bit and a lot of his songs are these really odd syncopated lyrical musical pieces where you kind of have the bass and the drums or guitar and keyboards or whatever kind of following rhythmically in step with every single word he says he may be talking like this did it did it did it did it did do and with each you know sort of vocal note that he'll put down you know you'll get a drum or you know a bass or whatever hitting that note as well on top of so it becomes this really odd tense very strange musical experience and I'm really happy to sort of have a copy of it now because it is a really odd listen and there is kind of a very vintage rough dirtiness to the recording that sounds like you know if you weren't told that this was new you would assume that this was recorded during the time of a Captain Beefheart or Frank Zappa or something like that because this is not you know necessarily sound like something brand brand-new it does sort of have an old-school very you know very art rock a very experimental rock kind of charm to it that's almost like that almost predates punk music like obviously it physically does not but it almost seems like the sound and the ideas themselves kind of like you know are coming from a time where punk music hadn't happened yet or something like that but maybe you know that there are probably people would listen to this and disagree with that heavily but yeah you know it's a very interesting record Hartley's Hartley give him all the credit in the world for being as unique an artist as he is and go on Bandcamp look up that OS our record label look at that OS our record label Bandcamp page they a lot they have a lot of interesting stuff over there all right these records over here I purchased a while ago and I finally got a chance to get him on the table or at least talked talked about him first off shout out to my boy Jeff Rosenstock for one of my favorite punk albums of last year worry this is a really kind of raw interesting album for Jeff you know his little rough around the edges in comparison with we cool but way more conceptual and seamless of an album but sort of how the tracks all flowed together lyric sheet lyric sheet lyric sheet and vinyl over here is really nice it is sort of the same kind of color scheme as the cover over here with the pink and blueish lettering and you kind of have a Slattery pinkish blueish kind of record over here and it's a blue and pink on one side it's kind of pink and blue on the other side I think that is really cool now one thing that I think is even cooler about this record not just that it sound good you know but also comes in the download card now Anthony all records these days come with download cards what's the big deal huh well this is a pretty interesting download card to me let's uh let's show you this download card kind of there you go all right well let's let's uh put this down quick download card Anthony just says worry it looks kind of nutty well on the back side over here it says this card is embedded with wildflower seeds plant under a thin layer of soil water regularly and watch it grow so I'm gonna take this card and I'm gonna play on this and I'm gonna put it in the dirt and I'm going to water it and we're going to see what grows out of it I'm going to put it up on Instagram to follow me over on Instagram a fan tan we're going to do some updates of my wildflowers over here okay and shout out to Jeff Rosenstock for hooking me up with these wild flowers with this little download card over there you know again I'm going to update over on Instagram shout out to Jeff Rosenstock so uh so yeah that's it moving on to the next record got to give a shout-out to my boys in Swain the long dark blue love this record when I figure records of last year nice sort of pinkish Castelli sort of aesthetic to the album art over here nice picture of the band on the back with the track listing and a cool little pencil drawing in the double LP gatefold not double LP this is a gatefold single LP gatefold all the band's looking so cute and sad over here Kay nice picture tube and lyrics behind my head and the vinyl itself is a nice kind of dickish pressing and it's kind of like a it's a little hard to describe it's kind of like a bluish greenish it's a dark 4c kind of green color on camera it does seem like it has like some blue tones to it but to me here it's very very green it's very green so maybe a you know I'll just go by my eye right here and say it green but uh given the title of the record I expected blue but I think I think I think the last record yeah the other record I have from these guys under the name this routine is hell that is blue so that sort of makes sense that's blue and this is different color alright I think I have one more record last record last piece of vinyl over here that I want to give a shout out to that I bought and really happy I have a copy of because it's been a while since I've been able to give this album a full listen again and goddamn does it sound fun it sounds amazing really energetic really blood pumping with like the adrenaline everything that I've said in my review I'm probably repeating here but tink is our than the lizard wizard but no no God and nice little sort of a cult imagery with the lyrics on the back there nice gatefold where the band is looking this mysterious and mystical as  crazy looking band right there yeah just looking really odd and mystical I guess with uh oh that's a nice dog that is a nice dog oh that's a cute dog but um the vinyl over here is actually pretty intriguing not just because you sort of have what is that Oh on one side of the sleeve over here the rest of the band members over here but but the the record itself is this really weird red black blob pressing which I don't have any record but looks like this I mean maybe some of you are looking at this and saying Anthony that looks like shed and I don't agree I think it's actually a pretty unique idea it actually looks like a crazy masked head of some sort of weird black figure that's going to haunt me in my dreams from now on but uh but yes a really weird black blob pressing the record itself sound monstrous just as awesome as I expected or hoped it would be and just the sweaty amazing energy I'm getting off this record so happy and so hype about it and yeah that's going to be it for this vinyl into the update except one thing except for one thing guys except for one thing exam we have a couple tapes and these tapes are basically a good chunk of my adolescence over here we have weird owls bad hair day we have a low Palooza and we have in 3d these tapes I used to play to death and I got them like for a dollar each and once I get these in the tape deck my youtube channel is dunzo because I'm just gonna want to listen to these tapes all day listen on my bad weird al' pet parody songs of you know eat it and the nice Santa went crazy and Amish Amish paradise and the the Jeopardy song is on here too and I'm just I'm just going to be done I'm just going to be done so and I'll leave it at that that was the vinyl update I hope everybody is uh you know hope everybody is doing well I hope everybody's uh treating themselves with good making sure you're hydrated eating your fruits and veggies and I will catch you in the next video true Tran [Music] "
et2s-u3KFbc,hi everyone they Anthony bandana here the Internet's busiest music nerd check on that mic it's it's gone it's gone I hope everybody is doing well it's time for a review of the new timbre tambour album sincerely future pollution timber timber is a Canadian musical project fronted by singer-songwriter mr. Taylor Kirk and so far they've released a handful of albums which I have loved all of them to some degree even though they're not one of the most popular bands around right now I think timber timber has a pretty unique sound style approach to music I and many other people have likened it to the music and the films of David Lynch in its eeriness in its kind of fetishization of vocal pop and rock music from the 50s there's something very vintage and very scary and very unsettling about the music that these guys make and I love it if you ever get the opportunity to to listen to their previous their previous project hot dreams over here mirror effect please do do yourself that big favor there's just something about the atmosphere of timber timber that's so amazing to my ears not only that but Taylor Kirk's voice it's so forlorn and kind of sowards very weird pairs very well with the incredibly creepy and dark and sometimes threatening lyrics that Kirk sings in his songs and while I wasn't anticipating they release a new album this year I'm always excited when a new timber Tambor album is announced and man my excitement for this record was stopped right into the dirt right away once I started hearing the teaser tracks to this album because it just seemed like such a 180 such a sonic such an instrumental change of pace and not that bands can't evolve or take risks or you know switch things up timber timber has a handful of records under their belt right now it only makes sense that at this point in their career they would try something at least a little different but I was not anticipating that the band would try to make such a synth heavy album like almost abandoned the lead role that the springy echoey very sad guitars typically take on a timber timber album as well as though the folk influence that usually permeates their records too this is a more electronic record not that the drums and the guitars have completely disappeared they haven't but there are way more walls of since on this thing throbbing electronics and honestly thinking about timber timber making a more electronic record in my head it doesn't inherently seem like it would be a bad thing I can already conceive of at least a dozen ways they would be able to apply their eerie creepy frightening sound to a more electronic pallet but that does not happen effectively on this record when it comes to actually doing the sounds of synthesizer music and electronic music any justice I think this record really falls flat on its face nor do I think timber tambour effectively translates their sound to what they're trying to do here all that well there are tracks on this record like velvet gloves and spit or moment songs that at their core seem a lot like other timber timber tracks seem like a formulaic timber timber track not necessarily terrible but there are some vocal melodies and chord shapes here that do feel very familiar almost giving me a bit of musical deja vu and then on top of it you know with the emphasis on synthesizers and I guess a less guitar driven sound you know the the usual aura the usual mystique the the whimsy the ambiance it's the romance it's just not here it just feels very flat and lifeless the kind of sour negative fear inducing emotions but also you know very lovely and alluring emotions - that would go into a great timber tambour song they have just evaporated completely and they're not replaced with anything it's just a very flat neutral sound to me so some of the songs here just kind of feel like rehashes repeats and the instrumental change the band is bringing to the table is just a bit of window dressing then you have cuts on album like grifting which is a total top-to-bottom change in timbre Tambor sound and their songwriting style this track is kind of like a funky piece of southern rock ZZ Top style but the synths play a larger role than the guitars so it does have you know those prominent dirk.burger I'm just not sure what Kirk was trying to do on this track I mean all the credit in the world to him as an artist I loved a lot of the music he's come out with up until this point but his singing on the song just struck me as out of place as awkward as I don't know just um it's really just like trying to jam a square peg into a round hole he just never quite finds his footing on this beat and his attempt at I don't know trying to take a more sexy or swagger influenced tone on this track is just so it's hard to listen to I did however warm up to the song sewer blues a little bit I do like the song at the core of this track quite a bit but still the throbbing electronics that surround this tune I'm not really all that into them and the more that I listen to the track what's so glaring about it in comparison with previous timber tambour songs which typically have very good endings is at the end of this track just kind of fizzles out the way the song is braided together is is fine the way it's laced together but they just don't tie the knot then on this album like previous timber chamber albums there are at least a couple of tracks that are just sort of instrumental interlude which you know typically on previous albums they're fine they're good listens they're decent listens but on this album over here where I am just not enjoying the core tracks of this album at all or I'm just kind of coming out of the neutral these interlude moments feel even more unnecessary there were really only two tracks on this album that I felt I truly enjoyed from beginning to end Western questions which was a track that not only struck me as as great in terms of sort of a different songwriting style different musical approach for timbre tambour felt like a track that was true to their original sound the incorporation of electronics was creative and effective not only in a musical sense but also a narrative sense too because the song is essentially kind of this dystopian set of musings on modern technology the modern age which if this entire album sort of felt like that or at least kind of brought that same strong tone I think it would have made a little bit more sense as a record at least this this move anyway and the only other song I was equally into was the following track the title track sincerely future pollution a song that at first I thought it was just going to be another instrumental except this would have been one of the best instrumentals on the album as the climax of the track is really huge it's really an epic instrumental II in comparison with the other intra mood tracks which are you know kind of low-key for the most part but the ending actually does feature some vocals it's just that the song is like 3/4 an instrumental and it's really just again how huge immense climactic and epic the track is instrumentally that really kind of wins me over and then we have floating cathedral as the closer to me just kind of feels like a track that's soaked in a sort of love lust obsession a romantic obsession at least that's how it read to me and in a lot of ways especially with the springy very lovingly stroked tars all over this track it kind of strikes me as you know another timber chamber song that's pulling from some vintage or vocal pop again not necessarily a bad thing nothing altogether new for them with the exception of the droning Warped kind of electronics moaning away through the majority of the track which the more that I listen to it the less I think they actually add to the song itself it just kind of feels like this tacked on lazy instrumental idea sort of introduced into the track just kind of make it fit with the aesthetic of the rest of the album while sure maybe to a degree I would have and could have lamented timber timber album that sounds like and every other album the band has come out with thus far I would have preferred that to some kind of half-hearted change of pace which I I don't think the band completely conceived exactly how they would go about pulling it off before they just kind of laid it on the record because the sounds that they conjure going into this new direction they're just nowhere near as interesting they do very little to stir up the usual mood usual emotion that I love hearing out of a timber timber track and they also do very little to stir up some kind of comparable replacement mood or anything if the band is to continue working with this sonic palette I don't know for me personally I think they're just going to need to kind of go back to the drawing board because this was just I was just at a loss with this one honestly I'm feeling a strong four to like five on this record transition have you given this album a lesson did you love it did you hate it what would you rate

KFGo3SWOlKo,hi Yaya Yaya hi everyone Yatta Yatta no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new magnetic fields album 50 song memoir singer-songwriter Stephen Merritt and company are back with the latest magnetic fields album is a huge ambitious musical undertaking it's 50 songs and a lot of the tracks on this record take an autobiographical tone and with each track on this record being attributed to a year in Stephen Merritt's life it's kind of like you're being run through his entire lifespan thus far in these five discs these 30-minute blocks now I was kind of hesitant to go into this record because it is a long album it's two and a half hours long and this decade has not been the best for the magnetic fields in terms of output with realism and love at the bottom of the sea being two of the Bands weakest releases thus far but to my ears fifty song memoir seems to have lit a fire in merit songwriting again the dry quirky hilarious charm of the band's music is back in full force on this thing which actually makes the entire listen of this record pretty easy the album doesn't feel like it's two and a half hours long at least to me and there's really no reason to sit down and listen to this entire record in one or even two sittings you can pretty much take the album disk by disc by disc just kind of listen to your favorite discs of the album over and over and over so listening to this album and the way you would traditionally listen to any other album probably not the best way to go about it you're most likely guaranteeing that you're going to have a bad experience with this thing best to kind of just take this record at your own pace and get to know each disc before you move on to the next one now I could get completely bogged down in this review and make it way longer than it needs to be by individually describing each track on the record what goes on lyrically what goes on musically but I think that would kind of be a waste of your in my time what I will try to do is I'll say that there are several different kinds of tracks on this record tracks where Merritt is bringing a strong first person narrative he's grabbing that autobiographical tone by the horns be instrumental or relatively straightforward so it's easy to take in the story and it's really Stevens sense of humor and his wit and his attention to detail that makes these tracks so awesome whether it be weird diseases where he's talking about a couple different health issues that he suffered over the years like epileptic fits I guess when he was younger I believe there's another point on the album where he references his hearing disability to one of my favorite tracks on here is how I failed ethics which pops up on the 20th the year of the album it's literally about merit failing a college course because it doesn't sound like he took the the philosophy of ethics all that seriously as he says he writes it off as an offshoot of aesthetics and then he has to come back retake the class and he sort of devises his own made-up ethical system that's not based in history or in religion either and even though his professor doesn't really you know like what he's come up with he gives him a passing grade because he's done the coursework seems like a weird thing to write a song about but that's kind of the magnetic field that's exactly what they do and it's Steven Merritt's again his sense of humor the details in the story that he delivers that just makes the track work the song life ain't all bad seems to be about a person who very early in Stevens life made his life a living hell he describes this person as killing his dog killing his mice he used to work on this person's ice cream truck and I guess they would just kind of use the bye scream truck as a means just kind of drink beer all day and just hang around I don't know who this guy is I mean I know that there are multiple spots on the record where Merritt makes reference to not having a dad that makes him very upset also other references to various boyfriends and suitors that his mother has known over the years that Steven has a different experiences with mostly negative and funny at least in retrospect the song blizzard of 78 is about Steven's first forays into music around 12 and 13 starting bands with other kids that he knew and this instrumental is purposefully ugly and distorted and really dissonant and just not very pleasant on the ears as to kind of make fun of just how rudimentary and bad some of the music was that he was writing and I guess trying to orchestrate when he was a kid he makes reference in the lyrics of these bands this particular band that he was in making The Cramps sound orchestral and making the Shaggs sound like the band yes and there are other tracks on here where it's about Stephen Merritt being a twenty-something free spirit musician who's broke as now that's kind of one set of tracks on this album there are others that aren't so much about Stephen but sort of infatuations or life and historical events that happened during that year that I guess struck him as significant enough to reference them in an entire song on this record whether it be the death of Judy Garland in 1969 on the song hustle 76 we had a 10 year old Stephen Merritt who is just an avid disco fan and he just kind of just pours over how much he enjoyed his disco music here on the track that represents 1980 he kind of waxes poetic a little bit about his infatuation with the New Romantics movement the song rock and roll will ruin your life is not only a comment on rock and roll itself and the culture the lifestyle but also kind of a comment on his no-goodnik dad on this same disc we also have the song how to play the synthesizer it makes sense that a lot of the tracks on the second disc of this album are directly music related and are about Stephens musical experiences because these are sort of his formative years that put him on the path to become a professional musician and writer in the first place earlier and later on the album we had Stephen tributing a cat named Dionysus who I guess he had great affection for when he was very young but the cat apparently hated him there are a couple other tracks that if you just listen to them on face value they don't really seem like they make sense in this memoir album but when you actually look at the year that they came out you can kind of put two and two together me like okay that's like he would be singing about that at this age like the track why I'm not a teenager or on the song that came out of for the year 1990 on this album where merit is essentially singing about kind of this prolific and constant songwriting process he was going through during the early years of his musical career which strangely enough is one of the few moments where it seems like Merritt is referencing you know the act of songwriting act of being a musician during a time when he was sort of on really on the way to becoming a notable musician you know there aren't too many tracks on here that are all that meta where Steven is kind of referencing being in the magnetic fields being in the music industry really nothing like that honestly still though for the first half of this record it does feel like I'm kind of traveling through Steven Merritt's life at the speed of song but the thing is this record doesn't really feel all that devoted to the memoir concept I mean even though I do love the first half of this record even there it is a little spotty and then once we get to disks four and five it's like I'm just hearing a bunch of tracks that could have been on any number of magnetic fields like past three records songs like cold blooded man and lovers lies and the ex and I I like these tracks but what makes them significant to this record even on a track where merit seems to be tributing a city that he was living in at the time have you seen it in the snow um romance and relationships and places have long been an inspiration for merits music why are they here on this album that's supposed to be about him because going into this record I assumed that I would hear an album that was a little bit more story like a little bit more revealing and personal and we do get a lot of tracks like that on this very long record but at one point the the will to kind of keep that up just kind of melts away and he just sort of seems to be writing about everything but himself to the point where I think the album loses its sense of time as well I mean the fifth disc of this record you could probably assemble the tracks on this in any number of ways and it wouldn't really matter like what song is 2012 what song is 2007 what song is 2015 it really makes no difference and the song somebody's fetish while I do think it's funny I think it's an entertaining track the idea that everybody is somebody else's sexual fetish what significance does this track have is a closer and I guess one more gripe I have about the album is that you do have a lot of tracks on here to go down these weird musical detours into disco or lopsided circus music or sitar psyche desert rock pop which isn't anything entirely new for the magnetic fields I mean stylistically and musically they've always been a pretty diverse band usually for the purpose of highlighting the story or the tone or the emotion of a track but as they embark on different musical adventures they kind of keep the instrumentation sort of rudimentary and very primitive and messy to kind of keep that amateurish charm that's made the band's music so great over the years but with 50 slots to fill on this record there are so many songs like this that just feel like it's just so many left hooks all at once it just kind of creates this uneasiness about the record this constant inconsistency and some of the ideas the instrumental concepts on these songs do come off really gimmicky a little obnoxious like on the track the day I finally where merit essentially is kind of singing a few feet away from a microphone and what sounds like a nearly empty room as he's banging on some random metallic percussion diddling on a little keyboard it's like he's kind of just taking breaks in between lines to hit some stuff around him just basically improvised still though I do love merits Basie very kind of clumsy voice it's still very forlorn it's still very passionate still a major highlight of the magnetic field sound the band is still showing a lot of personalities still showing a lot of talent still showing a lot of creativity on this record in a lot of ways I think this album is a return to form but there are definitely some lackluster tracks on this thing especially on the fifth disc which is easily the most drab of all the discs on the album unfortunately while I think the first half the album is great and there are a lot of great tracks on this record overall magnetic fields at this point in their career just did not have the fortitude or the attention span whatever to just fully and completely execute this concept and just make sure that it stayed entertaining throughout if it was just a bit more focus and commitment on what is supposed to be the central idea of this album I think could have been so much greater but as is though the album is still very entertaining I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing transition so after I finished my review of this record I got my eyes on something kind of interesting in relation to this album so I guess on my iTunes on one computer the digital booklet for the record had showed up but on the other computer it didn't and I didn't even notice it so I've been kind of listening to this on my stereo on my iPhone and then when I finally was kind of listening to it a little bit finally I said that word twice great I'm on my laptop I saw there's digital book I was like okay let's check that out let's just kind of get my eyes on that and just kind of see if what the lyrics are and some of the tracks that have been some of my favorites on the record and then I noticed there's this picture in the booklet and it's this photo it's this photo of a napkin that Stephen Merritt has a kind of scribbled a little message on to here's a picture of the of the napkin over here and it says I'm Stephen Merritt this is my autobiography and 50 songs one for each year of my life it's mostly love and music don't dig for much of a storyline and if things get mellower as 50 wounds that's life that's that's so Stephen Merritt he pretty much reviewed the album for me and acknowledges the fact that the album is not really what it says it is you know it's not a fifty song memoir you know which you know is still even though there is kind of that that that little warning there it's still kind of disappointing you know because 69 love songs is in fact 69 songs about love I mean for the most part you know it it meets its quota it reaches the the mission that the title sets the album on this however is not not so much the case um you know mellower toward the end totally understandable I get it you're moving through different passages through your life different passages sound different on an album of this magnitude of this concept but for you to kind of completely give up on the autobiographical tone of the album almost completely at one point on the album just kind of seems like I don't know like you're just not fulfilling what you set out to do and I guess you know even kind of admitting it here but uh whatever whatever it's still pretty good LP and that's it and if you've given this album a listen what you think of it Gillette I hate it why what do you think I should review next then I will catch you the next video other videos next to my head I think you should check out subscribe to the channel official website to forever 
FAYdije-kSw,hey everyone its Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and I'm going to give some quick thoughts here on the new pile album and a hairshirt of purpose these guys are a Boston band I've covered their albums their past two albums on the channel before their record dripping highly recommend that definitely check it out if you haven't heard of the band already it's new and over here though could also be a great listen for newcomers it's easily their most dynamic album the aggressive spots on this record whether it be hair shirt or Texas or ropes length these tracks are so intense so heavy the band is firing on all cylinders with an amazing mix of indie rock and post hardcore I would say maybe a little bit of noise rock in here too because God are some of the heaviest and loudest moments on this album abrasive maybe not all that experimental is certainly abrasive then on the flip side this record is just really bipolar in a sense because you know these intense moments these aggressive moments they were certainly toned down a little bit when I've heard the band's music in the past as were the more depressing and somber moments on their earlier works on this album they feel far separating from the aggressive tracks on this record God are the dreary passages of this album dreary and long-winded the damn really takes their time playing these just kind of very depressed guitar passages that are very slow very patient the vocals are performing in these really like long gated shouts and moans that personally I mean it does sound special it does sound different it's I don't hear a lot of bands sort of delivering these kinds of vocals on a record I do think pile really kind of brings the sound of their own on this album but these vocals particularly having a really hard time kind of connecting with the malaise of the album but still you know I will say it is kind of a unique and a special characteristic of this album these elongated sad pained vocals and and man when the band busts into an angry track or an aggressive passage it really feels like they just kick into high gear because it's such a significant change such a stark contrast I I'm not sure you know there's so many things I'm not sure about with this record I've heard it again and again and again and it's either I'm having a hard time connecting with the sadder more dismal moments on the record or I'm just not seeing a whole lot of significant flow from track to track to track because these long and very sad songs and there are a lot of them on this record they really kind of slow down the pace and the momentum and the flow of the album and there's a lot of them they really kind of our patience testing in a way I feel like the album is just a tad bit bloated in a sense like if they had cut them down to these most essential moments and brought some better balance with the more upbeat or I guess more physical tracks in the track listing here it would have been a better more solid listen but it said it does kind of drag on a little bit in my opinion so again I'm either having an issue with kind of connecting or things kind of feel like they're dragging on a little bit or just the sequencing the flow the tracklist feels a little off a little lopsided it's kind of difficult to explain because from a technical standpoint from an artistic standpoint it seems like pyle are doing a lot of great and creative things taking risks trying new things definitely pushing themselves harder than they were on their last record this to me feels like a more logical sequel to what the band was doing on on dripping because it feels like the two aspects of that record the two sort of Sighs of the emotional spectrum of that album intensified and separated even further I don't know if that's necessarily a good or a bad thing but it's certainly a thing and it's certainly how this album sort of reads and feels to me maybe the tracklist would have made a bit more sense that there were more tracks here that sort of felt like they bridge that gap a bit you know what I mean but it said it's like you're either being hit with these incredibly intense moments or these tracks that are just like really trying to I guess I would say troll the darkest depths of of the human psyche of human emotions and and beyond that it just doesn't seem like these feelings ever really kind of come together you know in a cohesive way yeah it's uh I'll say it's an interesting album you know it's interesting to hear an album that feels this separated from itself in a way and I'll say bipolar again but III wouldn't say it it's helped it out as a listening experience all that much you know it's interesting but it's not necessarily all that pleasurable or I guess satisfying as a listening experience it does become kind of I guess I would say tiring and draining and maybe that was part of the Bands intention because it is it is kind of an intense listen to not only hear tracks that are this aggressive and tracks later this depressing but also be switching back and forth between these emotions in such a kind of breakneck way I don't know I'll recommend that people try this out if you are an underground rock fan and even if I can't sell you on this album certainly check out the band's earlier stuff again especially dripping and I don't know I think I'm going to leave it there you know I'm left with more questions and answers with this record but I do think this album brought up some interesting things I think pilots are some cool risks on this album it was certainly worth talking about and I'm interested to hear in the comments and on social media what other people's reactions to this album were you know did you feel much the same way I did about this record or did this album speak to you you know let me know and I will catch you guys in the next video thank you for watching and obviously there's a link down there you can hear this record too for yourself and that's it I am a hairshirt of purpose forever 
YfdBfEFfg3M,hey everyone its Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd doing a raw quick iPhone ravit here now that I have a couple of really big videos out of the way this week the Kendrick review the the Radiohead worse the best check those out if you haven't but now I'm going to be talking about a project that I've been getting a lot of requests on this week people are saying hey you got to talk about that new playboy cardi playboy cardi's he's the best he's the newest disease the next he's next man he's next you know I've heard a couple of his viral internet singles before this came out and I don't really have an opinion on him honestly but now that I can hit this full project and sort of get a fuller scope of what playboy kardi is all about his sound his style everything I'm not really impressed to be completely honest this thing was so painfully mindless I just felt like I was just hitting my head with a hammer as I was listening to this thing I felt like every song that I listened to on here I was killing brain cells because my brain was just in so much pain thinking please please give me something just something other than I don't know these redundant lyrics and this overemphasis on ad libs from what I can hear playboy cardi very much inhabits that whole little boozy vert wing of this whole mumble rap trend right now and not to say mumble rap in a negative sense because there are some artists who kind of dabble in that or could be labeled as that that I like and there are others such as future that while I'm not a fan he does have his own sound e Azam's Isle I respect that again not a fan but you know I respect that he has a sound into style playboy party though reminds me of too many artists to really kind of feel like he's all that distinct or all that memorable all that original he just kind of feels very generic very dime-a-dozen to me and I mean I'm struggling to hear something that's special about his music because it's not his lyrics because there's nothing lyrical about this at all you know sometimes he has you know a really kind of funny silly ridiculous thing to say about money or sex or drugs or whatever you know it's believe me it's it's kind of the generic trap topics here you know we don't have much to work with but but the only thing that makes it funny is that it's so preposterous that his music lyrically is so under written so it's not lyrics that make him special like little Uzi vert he very much overemphasizes ad-libs some of them are fun some of them are kind of entertaining but I don't see his adlets as all that memorable or energizing or exciting either he kind of has that same mid-range and nasal tone that little Uzi vert and everybody who's been copying him lately has as well occasionally kind of busts into a bit of a melodic flow but not so melodic that you know he's actually like singing a memorable tune or anything like that it's just kind of like little hints of you know melody here and there in his flow like little newsy vert he likes to grab all of these really atmospheric and kind of quirky very light-hearted instrumentals that have a very playful keyboard leads in them that I like quite a bit I love the production on this thing for the most part it's actually really the selling point of the project in my opinion very little of what I liked about this thing had much to do with playboy Carty himself I was way more into like ASAP Rocky's feature on this thing way more into a lot of the beats on here I give playboy cardies producers all the credit in the world they make him sound much more listenable than he would be in any other context so you know again all the credit to those guys but playboy kardi himself there's virtually nothing special or interesting about him or what he's doing on this tape again it's not the lyrics it can't be the lyrics it's not his flow it's not the fact that he's singing a little bit here and there his ad-libs are kind of run-of-the-mill his voice isn't really anything special either I'm just kind of struggling to hear what is so great about playboy cardi what makes playboy kardi significant it's not the hooks either because the hooks are pretty redundant and pretty basic and what is and what isn't a hook is sometimes hard to tell on this tape because even playboy car use versus and his ad-libs are so redundant and repeated again and again and again and again throughout numerous tracks on here that when he busts into a hook the hook doesn't really feel any more special than anything else I just kind of feels like another repetition of another thing so I don't know again really struggling to hear anything special about what this guy has to offer and it's just so purely mindless that it's mind-numbing just to listen to it and I don't know I don't think I'm ever really gonna try to make the effort to listen to this guy's music again you know not unless I hear a spare track or feature or something that somehow Wow's me and gives me curious again but I think this is where my curiosity is is going to end right here on this on the self-titled project and that's that's all I have to say I'll catch you guys in the next video what did you think of this thing if you've heard it gelada a 2y and yeah forever 
RIGINiBYxis,hi everyone finally here Tanner here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new Kendrick Lamar album damn Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar's back with his fourth studio full-length album I guess that is if you don't count his a b-sides record that dropped last year untitled unmastered essentially a set of raw b-sides and afterthoughts following his incomparable 2015 album to pimp a butterfly an album that was so great even the leftovers from this album sounded amazing lately Kendrick has been on fire everybody knows it he is just on a level that none of his contemporaries are on right now in terms of achieving both incredible commercial success and artistic success his albums do numbers but he still manages to be lyrical conceptual and on the cutting edge of modern music and just like he said on that teaser freestyle the heart part 4 he came through the classic he dropped that and he came right back with another one so his consistency is impeccable and on that very same line Kendrick gives us the Kendrick Lamar guarantee that the next album is going to be great it's going to have the whole industry on an icepack it's a bold claim but Kendrick has given us no reason thus far to doubt him so damn is here and Kendrick once again has hit us with an artistic left hook because this record is far from being the grand jazz-influenced meditation on self-worth that to pimp a butterfly was this album brings an entirely different sound and on top of that while it is conceptual I think Kendrick approaches concept in a really fractured way totally unlike what anybody has heard on good kid maad city or to come a butterfly where you might have multiple ideas but they all kind of coalesce to one point before I get too deep into Dan let me just say I'm pretty floored by the fact that Kendrick with each project has reinvented himself almost entirely from top to bottom and in this case in a really short amount of time now in comparison with everything Kendrick has released thus far damn is his most scattered album even though it may not be as dense or as somatic as good kid maad city or to pimp a butterfly it's harder to compartmentalize because there's so much going on this is Kendricks most raw and intense album emotionally whether that be tracks that have an incredible amount of aggression and grit or just really pain sorrow and depression now what is guiding this change of pace it may have a lot to do with the Fox News clip that he plays toward the beginning of the album where his art his B et performance specifically I believe was misconstrued as being bad for black culture bad for black people bad for race relations in America and this clip that he plays is not the only time in the mainstream media that Kendricks art has been interpreted in this way now Kendrick has taken this slander against his art personally obviously but I think he's also taken it as a challenge on this album to basically say hey you know you you want the angry hedonistic violent rap guy I'll give them to you I'll be that guy I'll hop on a track banger I'll get in other rappers faces I'll play that role I'll get nasty like that all play dirty and the way he goes about embodying this on this record I think is really creative not just with the heightened aggression of this album not just with his interesting approaches between him and his producers to contemporary flows and production styles but they're actually quite a few moments on this record where you get like these reverb DJ drops on the record that's just like a new kungfu cutting hmm like I'm listening to some mixtape that I downloaded off adapt it but the decision to go into this direction runs even deeper than this as Kendrick uses this as an opportunity to comment on hip-hop culture at large and race relations in a post Obama America and I would say there's one more major layer to this album which is addressed on a couple of tracks here but it's not something that is spoken about throughout the entire record and that's that I genuinely think Kendrick is depressed on this album seriously I don't think we've ever heard Kendrick on a record consistently sounding so unhappy so unsure themself sounding this vulnerable I mean even on the darkest moments of good kid maad city and on to pimp a butterfly it still felt like we were listening to an artist who knew where he was going that everything he was doing was being orchestrated as some part of grand plan a lot like the God he's been so sure is looking out for him on his previous project but I'm damn Kendrick is shaken not just in regards to his faith but I think his moral compass as well and those two things are really important pivotal things to a Kendrick Lamar project those things usually play pretty central roles when it comes to keeping his mind right and with those two things deteriorating on this record Kendricks message sounds way more unresolved and conflicted than I thought it would be going into this record it may also have to do with the fact that he's taking on such huge concepts stated in bold capitalized lettering in the titles of these tracks pride lust fear God etc these are things that philosophers have been mulling over for thousands and thousands of years I don't expect all of their intricacies to be explained in a 55-minute rap album but damn isn't so much about the answer to anything as much as it is about the struggle to understand something that's especially intense and difficult for Kendrick because his savior complex drives him to have that answer it drives him to have that solution it also feeds a loneliness in him on the song feel where he sort of portrays himself as the savior as the hero as the provider but nobody is saving or providing for him nobody's praying for him and even though he may have legions of fans who are certainly concerned with his well-being and his mental state when you put yourself in that position you still can't help but feel that way occasionally and again faith also drives the struggle of this album because on numerous occasions Kendrick has said that he does what he does with his music as some kind of service to God but then he's left with no solid conclusions or answers when he feels like he's been left behind by this God to suffer and to struggle which he takes us some kind of sign from God comparing himself to Jobe which happens on the song fear which if you're unfamiliar with it it's basically a biblical story about a man Jobe who essentially tears his life apart as a test of his faith in his love it's on the same track where I think Kendricks faith his belief in God takes the ugliest turn that it has on any project that he's released so far right at the very end of the song fear where we hear a voicemail from his cousin Carl which he alludes to on the song yah and if you look at this voicemail it's pretty interesting referencing Deuteronomy Carl makes the case that Kendrick is unhappy he's struggling he's unsure of things because he's kind of drifted away from God's light he's not living up to the commandments the statutes the laws set by God pretty much the the Christian God he then makes the case that black people Hispanic people and Native American people are the true children of Israel which seems harmless on its face that's fine but then that is channeled into every injustice over the course of history being interpreted as a punishment by God because these groups of people have drifted away from the Word of God and this is pretty much presented without comment I don't see Kendrick criticizing this idea it's just kind of thrown out there again on the song yeah where Kendrick references this call references this voicemail I've been from a few things he says about it I'm led to believe that he thinks that there's at least some truth to it now let me just say before I go much further i all right disagree with this on every level I personally feel it's bullshit and stupid to chalk up mass genocide slavery Jim Crow the mexican-american war and countless other things to some kind of divine punishment the roots of these and justices are political their social their economic to blame it all on God's will just kind of seems disgusting to me bordering on self-hatred and most definitely self flagellation and in my opinion the exact opposite of being conscious now my ideological disagreement he didn't really factor into my overall feelings with the album especially since this voicemail does happen to land on what I felt was one of the better tracks on the record but I do think moments like this should not be overlooked by the listener in fact they should be at the forefront of the listeners mind while they listen to this album because this idea of God punishing Kendrick for not living up to the moral code that he should is part of the reason he's suffering on this record this is the mentality that he's beating himself up with on this record when you see him going into those dark places he's rationalizing his own pain and suffering as being the decision of some Supreme Being that he's never seen and all he can do is just throw himself at God's mercy and say please don't do this please don't take all my success and everything away for me personally walking around with that mentality that view of the world I would go crazy it would be like walking on hot coals for the rest of my life or going into a fucking wood chipper feet first now I would say those are the major themes of the album there other abstract sort of ideas that are placed throughout the record - most notably the symbolism of the blind woman in Kendricks death at the very start of the album also the serendipitous series of events that could have led to Kendrick not even being born on the closing track Duckworth obviously there were intentions to placing these things in the album like the vocal passages that are reversed at a few points in the album which you could put in an audio editor place in the right way see what Kendrick is saying there and get a deeper meaning out of the track potentially but I took a lot of these moments as just being kind of open to interpretation for the listener and maybe you could even take this album on the hole as that because it seems like Kendrick is intentionally trying not to do what he's done in the past and that is beat the listener over the head with some kind of central theme concept or idea now that's me trying to wrap up the general idea of an almost bipolar album things get even more interesting on this record when you dive into each track individually on the song DNA while this is a very aggressive banger and is a track that is solely exciting just on its sound in Kendricks awesome vocal performance here it's also a track where we seek hendrik struggling to kind of make sense of all these things that he sees as pretty much being a part of his genetic code that could be anything good positive or amazing like being royalty to something really negative and dark and awful to like being poison on the song element Kendrick celebrates his unapologetic dominance of the rap game also his connections to criminals on a bar or to this is a side of Kendrick we don't often see usually he's trying his best to be on the straight and narrow follow the good path but he's definitely getting angrier more aggressive more violent on cuts like this this is an emotional and a moral inconsistency that I think even acknowledges on the song xxx which has an awesome instrumental moment on it where you kind of have these police sirens this revving bass a hard-hitting rhythm Kendrick is coming through with some of the meanest and most aggressive bars I've heard him put on any project it sounds like something off of good kid maad city on steroids but then immediately after that we had this beat break away and then Kendrick finds himself speaking to a bunch of kids about like gun control or something so right there we kind of see Kendrick acknowledging this inconsistency this contradiction this hypocrisy in his own self also I do want to mention that Bono's appearance u2's appearance on this track went over way better than expected on the song humble the trick is pretty much not to be humble at all feels like Kendrick is is more focusing on telling other rappers to be humble it is a decent banger I guess my one disappointment with this track is that there's not really anything to hearing it in the greater context of the album that I don't feel like I already got out of just listening to the track by itself and the song fear is easily in my opinion one of the most incredible moments on the album from a lyrical standpoint the track is a conceptual deep dive into the idea of fear and that's fear of everything from being disciplined by your parents to a fear of God a fear of death in the second verse here Kendrick lifts off multiple scenarios in which he could see himself dying on this track Kendrick also flushes out the idea that whether or not his shortcomings and the shortcomings of other people too are due to some kind of wicked or weakness and he mentioned the idea of DNA again as being something that is preventing him because they're all these things are in his DNA positive and negative that are keeping them from evolving fully into God's light not every tracks message is as concentrated or as obvious though song pride for example with the exception of a few lines in the track that the song doesn't really seem to be that strong of a statement on the idea of pride however the track title here does seem to be a part of an ongoing thing in the tracklist where you kind of have ideas that complement one another or mirror each other or the opposite of one another shoulder to shoulder blood and DNA pride and humble lust love and xxx fear God and duckworth which makes sense because I think Kendrick sees the fact that his father lived at the end of that track as almost like an act of God of course there are numerous lyrical highlights on this album but the greatness of Kendricks bars really comes to fruition when you observe what he's trying to say in the grander scheme of things in a single song because in general on this record Kendrick is not being quite as poetic not quite as flowery especially on tracks like DNA and Humble songs where I think he is making his lyrics a little more blunt because he wants to go more aggressive he wants to go angrier I think he also simplifies his lyrical approach a bit as a means to come through with some of the Papias tracks he's ever recorded too which brings me to the sound and the production and the musical style of this album which in my opinion is most likely the Achilles heel of this record because the sound of this record is really all over the place it's sort of spotty and I feel like in this attempt to shoo for a more contemporary sound Kendrick is not really playing to his strengths the song yah for example while I do like what lyrically this song does for the narrative of the record I find Kendricks performance and the beat here to be really bland and sluggish and forgettable I kind of feel the same way about the song loyalty I actually do like the kind of smooth dreamy melodic instrumental here Andrey contributions to the track aren't that bad either but as far as Kendricks vocal performance here it's not really a fiery entertaining moment for me nor do I think Kendrick makes a statement in his lyrics on loyalty that's all that profound but really these moments in my opinion are just okay it's two other songs on the record that I think make for two of the worst that Kendrick has ever put onto a project for one the song love which not only features akari's choirboy vocals on the hook but also Kendrick and I want to be a lady and what made him or anybody think that that was a good sounding refrain the I don't know because this track just delivers one coronally song bar after another and again I mean I don't know why Kendrick would compromise his sound this much for a song about love when lyrically he's not really making that profound of a statement on the topic and while I like the song God a little bit more as a concept as a lyrical moment on the album this song also features the worst singing on the entire record for Kendrick not only are we hit again and again and again with the silly cries of don't judge me Kendrick sounds like the frontman of some awful Orange County emo band but I'm also kind of confused about the logic of this track the idea that God should not be judging the questionable things that Kendrick has gotten himself into on this track or that the material things the material desires that Kendrick is rapping about having them is almost like being God it seems just kind of counter to things that he said in the past and I get the contradiction and hypocrisy and inconsistency of faith of self of morality is kind of a a theme a major theme of this album but to me this this just did not say anything it didn't go anywhere it just seemed like a failed attempt to trying to make a poignant statement that being said the rest of the album as far as the production the sound the music is actually incredible I love the hard-hitting trap rhythms of DNA they kick off the album really well on that and that beat change up in the second half oh my god that bass the base is earth shattering the instrumental on the song element reminds me of something that that Kanye would ride with much pride the kick snare pattern on this track is great the echoed vocal sample the pretty piano is highlighting the chorus to Kendrick singing on the hook isn't bad either a Meagan looks sexy the very smooth and Spacey feel is way too straight back and minimal to be one of my favorite instrumentals here but the track does a great job of sort of playing a foundational role for Kendra's lyrics you know some instrumentals here steal the show some are really stark they're really skeletal they're really just like only the essential things sort of like the song fear - which is not really one of the most vibrant instrumentals on the track until actually you kind of hit the second half where some really nice faint string sections do a lot to elevate the song the song pride I kind of love the slow sad beats on this track and watery guitars it may not seem like much but the sound of this song is one of my favorites on the entire record I love how kind of woozy and drunk and intoxicated and warped the song feels not only from the instrumentation do I get that vibe but also some of the weird effects and pitches on Kendricks voice throughout the song - the pace of the song also makes it really easy to kind of eat up each profound line that Kendrick is stating on the track the song lust which I would anticipate given its title to be fiery is actually chilling features along the most eerie hooks that Kendrick has ever laid on a track and the song xxx I love because it kind of has this three phase progression to it the intro the banger middle point the slow jazzy Spacey sort of dystopian vocals from a Bono I'll say it twice it went over way better than expected and then after that there are a lot of various sound effects and weird sonic passages at the end of tracks and beginning of tracks to kind of highlight the meaning of the song that just played to the song that's about to play even when playing it relatively straightforward Kendrick has to add in all these little extra details to get you thinking a little bit more deeply about what you're hearing god damn I saw and again I'll say I love generally the sound of this album it's vivid it's stark it's sharp its stripped-down its raw its rugged its tattered its dirty there are a lot of things to like about this album but I will say that it does read to me is kind of inconsistent Kendricks most inconsistent album yet actually not just with the handful of tracks on this thing that I thought were pretty lackluster but also with the themes of this record being kind of spotty and again unresolved some tracks aren't so much a statement but try to embody what the title is representing others just seem like mere references to the topic at hand or really just kind of fail to say anything of significance about it and while yes inconsistency and conflict is certainly a theme of this album it was intentional going into this record I don't think it's always to this album's benefit I do see the value in releasing an album where you essentially kind of document the war that goes on in one's mind when you're tackling issues like love and lust and fear and God and what role these things play in the world we're living in today but I think Kendrick could have done a better job of just sitting on these ideas mulling them over more and possibly string together a more central idea to tie it all together just to give this album more impact as opposed to kind of rushing it out so that his statements on Fox News and the recent election of Donald Trump would still be relevant I don't think this album is a total mess and I think it's far from being worthless and I wouldn't say the album has no meaning either I think what the album means is very much up to the listener I'll say again and I don't think we've ever heard Kendricks dark side like we have on this album right here before but I have heard Kendrick release better projects better projects than this at least three of them I would say and that's pretty much what leads me to say that I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this record Tran you're giving this chasm a seven oh no you know it's not a ten it's not a ten for me then why are you wearing a yellow whale it's just it's just symbolic you know I figured it's a Kendrick review it's exciting you know where the flannel no no no you can't use that way you can't wear the yellow flannel like that yes I am how'd you do that the yellow flames going to say right here till you learn how to use it the right way make it yellow flannels not to some mean is that just I mean that you do it's a special thing for a special occasion you don't just wear it all willy-nilly at all being [Music] you [Music] 
uu8sC7YDOZg,are you having a hard time breathing I'm having a hard time breathing it's here it's real hi everyone it's tom finney your tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another installment of our worst - best series Radiohead worse - best in this video I'm gonna be going through Radiohead's discography their album studio album discography just the studio albums and ranking them from what I feel is the worst to the best without further ado let's go yes for me the King of Limbs is Radiohead's worst album and sure while it may not be as dated or as corny as some of their debuts worst moments it lands at this spot for a few reasons one the band's attempt at doing a full record where they try to blatantly fuse experimental rock and electronic music just fell flat on its face the result was a bunch of unexcited passionless performances that sound like they really should have been left to be forgotten on some Thom Yorke solo effort and - in the grander scheme of Radiohead's discography this album just seems so insignificant and so surprisingly short the musical risk the band took on this record didn't really pan out it's not a sound they ended up perfecting down the road I mean the closest they came to perfecting what they were doing on the King of Limbs was actually the live version of this album which is infinitely superior to the studio album itself in the end the King of Limbs to me just kind of seems like a weird detour they embarked on that they didn't really end up committing fully - at least not enough to put out a complete satisfying album and considering what they were doing on their next record it just doesn't seem like an essential part of the Bands evolution at least not as essential to their evolution as their debut their starting point Pablo honey it's consistently ranked as Radiohead's worst record among fans and it's not hard to see why it may have been a perfectly acceptable alternative rock album in the 90s when it was released but it has not aged all that well over over the years even the album's biggest track creep has become a joke among Radiohead fans among the hardcore fans as being the entry level Radiohead that's the Radiohead song everyone knows that anyone can enjoy yes only Radiohead fans would create a massive running joke about the band's music being too accessible and that's a lot of the reason why I think Pablo honey gets so much unjust hate because Radiohead fans are too busy glorifying kitteh and okay computer some kind of like gold standard of music like they're the most experimental groundbreaking albums of all time and something like Pablo honey oh that's just pedestrian when in reality the biggest sin that Pablo Honey commits is that it just had a lot in common with its contemporaries sure the album is a little generic but ripcord and how do you do and anyone can play the guitar are perfectly fine alternative rock songs in my opinion it's not their worst record it's perfectly respectable as a 90's rock album and as a formative moment in the band's career such an overrated album don't get me wrong there are some perfectly fine songs and some amazing ideas on amnesiac but this album is essentially a glorified set of kid a-after births and while it's well known that the material here was recorded in the same session as the material on kid a don't let that trick you into thinking it's just as good especially when you have blatantly unfinished and repetitive tracks all over the tracklisting here the song hunting bears is just a guitar detour the song Punk pull revolving doors is just like a mind-numbing electronic interlude that doesn't reinforce much of anything the album has before or after it you and whose army sounds like some kind of demo ballad that Tom's strung together that just had like a big climactic string section tacked onto the end of it to make it sound finish and even one of my favorite tracks on here morning Bell starts like I've been teleported into a track that has already been playing for two minutes this album constantly gets built up for being more abstract than kid a but only in the sense that the songs are dodgy er and more obscure in my opinion if we're to go on the sound and the music of this album in comparison with kid a what happens on amnesiac is way less adventurous with the exception of the kind of jazzy finish the band tries to pull off at the end I do like life in a glass house though and some of the Bands best material is on this thing knives out is chillingly beautiful the groovy desert rock on I might be wrong is actually pretty fantastic and Pyramid song while that track is pretty redundant and does feel like an extended motif like many other tracks on here the track is just too emotionally potent and it has too great a chord progression to just deny it I'm not denying that there are beautiful and haunting moments on this record I'm not it's just that despite the fact that it runs at about the same length many other Radiohead albums do it's one of the Bands most rickety releases and it's clear that the band did their best to hide that and I think it mostly worked but it still just kind of feels like a b-sides collection to me [Music] the bends I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with this album I appreciate it and respect it as a significant moment of progression and evolution in the Radiohead discography it's certainly a more unique listen than Pablo Honey it is one of Radiohead's most consistent and solid well-built records I think the band successfully blends alternative rock with art rock on this album also in comparison with Pablo honey Tom York is a much more captivating frontman the mix is fuller the mix is richer the band just sounds heavier and more powerful but I just don't see the bends as interesting as what the band would be doing down the road a lot like Pablo honey the more years that go by the less significant the album seems to my ears because this album even though it is more cutting-edge than Radiohead's debut it's still packed with so many alt rock isms that are growing staler and staler and staler case in point the title track and they're at least a handful of songs out here where it just sounds like Radiohead is coming through with like this real sense of swagger like what they're doing on this album is just so ahead of the curve and so deep and I just don't feel like that's the case in a way I do prefer in easy acts haunting ambience I do prefer Pablo honey's rawness how unassuming that album is in comparison with the bends but I do think the bends is a more significant point in the Bands career more important to their artistic growth because it did bring them to okay computer a lot of fans and music writers label Radiohead is the band that defined the 2000s and if that is the case a hail to the thief was probably their least definitive moment of that decade and not that I think it's a terrible album some of my favorite Radiohead songs are on this album two plus two equals five is one of the best introductions to any Radiohead album period the explosive second half of this track is amazing and it's just interesting to see the band kind of evolve past the eeriness and just the the the abstraction of kid a and amnesiac and head in a direction that's more aggressive and groovier more physical and the ballad on the song a wolf at the door is probably one of the most heart-wrenching moments in the band's entire career the issue with this album is as many people in the past have stated is that it's just kind of inconsistent and a little bloated while the very cold and calculated back drifts is a better attempt at just trying to make electronic music than many moments on the King of Limbs the the track doesn't really do anything to support or reinforce the songs that surround it and the weird densely packed rhythms and vocals and synths on the back end of sit down stand up stanzas one of the most questionable production choices of any song in the Bands career or most genius depends on how I'm feeling that day I think there are a lot of great sounds and ideas on hail to the thief it's just that the band doesn't really perfect them or refine them here they just kind of end up doing that later in their discography on records like a moon shaped pool and in rainbows I could pull a lot of tracks out of this album individually and say great track amazing track fantastic track but there's just very little rhyme or reason to it as an album and Radiohead's usually pretty good at coming through with a well groomed well conceived well flowing album while it is a more cutting edge than a lot of what the band had released early early on it's just not that well groomed and I think it suffers for it a lot now we're in the top half of the list and to kick us off there it's [Music] yeah a moon shaped pool it's it's super-new it's super-new but the more I listen to this thing the more it feels like a really significant part in Radiohead's discography the more it feels like one of the band's most cohesive and conceptual albums and while sure it's their most low-key record it's their most subtle record don't let that distract you from the fact that it is one of their most beautiful albums - one of their most fully realized albums one of their most elegant albums I think Radiohead stir some great emotional power on this album it's just that that power is just so quietly displayed it's not painfully obvious but I love the way that this album just serves up all of these sad spacey transcendent Tunes I think also on this album Tom flexes his muscles as a more lyrically direct songwriter whether it be on the closing track where he's kind of lamenting the the loss of a really important romantic relationship or on the song burn the witch where the band is really kind of taking a direct shot at the modern state of socio-political discourse just you know just kind of fallen into the trash also I just cannot get over the the creepy alien the story going on on the track decks dark sure you know there's kind of a uniform eeriness and again in a kind of a very vast atmosphere to this entire album but there's actually a lot of musical variety to this record there are moments that take on more of a folk rock flavor the track . when my favorite Radiohead songs period has a bit of a kraut rock vibe to it the tension they build on this track is amazing singing not only is this album a great listen throughout but also a fantastic return to form considering the record that preceded it this album is a masterclass on how to write a slow burner and I think four years is going to continue to be one of my favorite records in their discography kid a the legendary kid a Radiohead's official bold line in the sand transition from making some alt rock and some art rock to just go in experimental rock working in some crazy electronics to basing their songs on more abstract structures and beginning to incorporate in their music a chilling ambience that would remain with them for pretty much their entire career afterwards few bands undergo such an overhaul in their sound and come out on the other end this successful and even though I have long said that Radiohead is not one of the most experimental adventurous bands on the planet the the the very obtuse songs that they present here on kid a they're not for the impatient because this thing is dystopian it's dark it's the song national anthem is probably the easiest on the ears Radiohead gets on this record but even that track is loaded with tinny strange vocal effects and a horn freakout at the end the song optimistic probably contains one of my favorite vocal performances from Tom I also love the very surreal and kind of psychedelic in limbo the IDM influence on the track idiot Tech is awesome and so incredibly icy and the song motion picture soundtrack is very lullaby esque and with it's kind of a very relaxing pump organ chords and harp runs it's easily one of my favorite finishes of any Radiohead album if anything holds the album back and the grander scheme of Radiohead's discography I don't think it has the best flow from track to track of any Radiohead album the ambient interlude tree finger still kind of stands out to me as you know just a really odd detour on the record that doesn't necessarily logically flow from the preceding track and even the songs on here that do complement each other just seem kind of isolated and compartmentalized maybe in a way that's kind of an artistic comment on how in a vacuum the album itself feels but regardless I do think it does harm the album even if just a little bit for sure I could see why this album would be the favorite among many Radiohead fans it's just not the case for me though [Music] mm-hmm we're here in rainbows this album is probably not landing this high on most lists of this kind but honestly truly this album is and continues to be a personal favorite of mine in Radiohead's discography in rainbows is a lot of things for me it's Radiohead's most visceral exciting consistently explosive album it's an album where Radiohead ten years after releasing easily their biggest record are proving that they still very much got it a lot of the ideas on this album might sound pretty similar to some of the tracks on hail to the thief but it's my opinion that Radiohead went on to perfect those sounds on this record because there are tons of moments on this record where the band is using these grooves using this energy to reach these just bubbling points these boiling points that these these orgasmic peaks of sonic bliss jigsaw falling into place for example and also this record has an amazing flow from the kind of scattered and punchy beats at the very start of the song 15 step to the dreary pianos on videotape this is a watertight ten tracks without a single lull there's so many exciting highs and deep passionate emotional lows on this album of the track body-snatchers Radiohead has not sounded this raw since Pablo honey and the song nude is probably in my top 5 of Radiohead songs ever like this track to me is just just gorgeous beautiful tiered you know inducing alien soul Thom Yorke's vocal performance here is one of his oddest but also one of his most beautiful what's even more amazing is that the band had been sitting on this song for such a long time it only took this album for them to end up recording and releasing it the song reckoner sounds like the band trying to write a trip-hop ballad from the ground up Tom's nasal kroons are heart-wrenching ly sad and even one of the tiniest moments on this record Faust ARP seems to just have an incredible amount of significance to me I love the fingerpick guitars on this track the hushed vocals with these two things Radiohead manages to strike a great balance between being kind of funky intimate beautiful and creepy and for me it's still so hard to listen to this record and think about it being ten years old at this point because it still sounds to me so crisp and exotic and colorful and exciting and that's why it's it's landing so high on this list here we are here we are here we are here we are the top of the list the top of the list yeah sure this might be a popular number one pick for a lot of other lists but I do truly feel that speaking purely from the experience of an album an album experience okay computer is the closest Radiohead has come to perfection I do think the album is a little overhyped in the grander scheme of things I don't think it's one of the greatest pieces of music ever conceived by man but I do think it's the greatest album in the band's discography and certainly a crowning achievement for rock music in the 90s because this album is such an interesting sound for rock music at this time it's not super raw or funky or grungy like a lot of the albums were being released in this decade instead it's really pristine it's clean it's vivid it's almost a futuristic take on rock music and in a way it actually was I think to a degree this album was the most predictive album in Radiohead's discography as it would go on to influence the muses and the Coldplay's and the killers of the world which you know maybe not everybody's happy about but I think that's a small price to pay for such a fantastic record but you know it's kind of that pristine immaculate almost spotless sound of this album that I think is part of what makes it sound so timeless because there's not really anything about it that kind of hooks it into hey here's this weird dumb gimmicky trend that everybody was doing at this time in that sense it kind of reminds me of an album like Pink Floyd's the wall it's just so fundamentals fundamentals fundamentals that what this album is doing is most likely never going to go out of style the production on this thing it's so great it's so rich it's so detailed there's such good instrumental balance on these songs the the groovy riffs on paranoid android sound fantastic the distortion is so burning it's so fiery and the blissful jangle II let down sounds like the band it advertently wrote the instrumental blueprint for almost half of the post-rock songs to be released in the 2000s the rest of the record brings an amazing range of interesting emotions and sounds and lyrical concepts there are tracks on here where Thom Yorke is exploring what seems to be this the strong sense of loneliness and isolation these feelings of being alien karma police remains to be one of Radiohead's most catchy tracks but also hilariously sinister tracks to when you read into the lyrics and while this record is not as consistently visceral or as explosive as some other tracks in the band's discography you know they definitely build tension they definitely take their time there are a lot of subtle sad dreary moments on this record but when the band finally hits you with a payoff it fuckin pays off albums like this are the reason that people describe music as having an orgasm like quality to it like at the very end of the song exit music and no surprises still stands in my opinion as one of the most fantastically beautiful songs in Radiohead's entire discography I love the lullaby quality guitar lead and the pretty little glockenspiel I mean the track is really a combination of what sounds like someone kind of gently trying to put you to sleep but also a little bit of Velvet Underground and maybe a touch of musical theatre too and going off from the musical theater point there this album is really dramatic it's very grand it's really trying to do its best to reach beyond what seems like the limitations of music itself even the most blunt straightforward simple track of this entire album electioneering sounds like it's trying to make enough noise to shake the earth down to its core it's like listening to the band try their hardest to transcend just being a group of guys making music and maybe this album is the closest Radiohead has has ever come to doing so and that's why it is in my opinion Radiohead's best record and that is going to do it for this Radiohead worst - best list everybody I hope that you dug on this list and hopefully my thoughts and ideas here made sense and maybe I influenced you to check out some Radiohead records that you haven't thought of checking out before you haven't checked out before or maybe you're just typing in the comments right now about how much you hate me although this video is pretty long if you were going to do that you you probably did that in the first few minutes of the video and then and then dipped out so anyway transition and there you go that was the Radiohead worse - best other videos next to my head I think you should check out and also down in the comments taking suggestions on what artists to cover next in this series let me know let me know what you think seriously taking suggestions seriously let me know and I'll catch you guys in the next video forever 
ud3WySlz6ZI,uh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week BAM it's a special late night after our swanky dankey edition of this series oh and and this is going up Sunday it's it's baby Jesuses coming back day although he was not a baby at that point hem ahem he was zombie Jesus at that point but anyway let's before we get down to business of course I have to mention our Amazon Associates link down there in the description if you hit that link and you live in the US anything you buy we get kickback from it use it to buy some shit we're gonna buy anyway you're using it we appreciate it we see that you're using it helps out the show helps out this segment if you use that shit pat yourself on the back and also we have a similar thing going on with the good people over at turntable lab there is a page linked in the description where you can pick up some vinyl some cool exclusive very nifty pressings at least they look exclusive some of them look like really high-end color vinyl shit over on this page of stuff I reviewed stuff I've recommended also audio equipment as well for people looking to get into the wild world of record collecting and turntables they also have great information on their site for people who are starting out and don't know too much about any of this stuff and yeah so hit up that turntable lab link as well again anything you purchase off of that link we get kickback from it and finally I have to mention our fantastic our fantastic sponsor for this video I'm not just saying that the good people over at feed bands calm the reason I say it's fantastic is because this is a music subscription service of vinyl subscription service that is unlike any other I've ever seen before they're using the power of crowdsourcing the excuse me of crowdsourcing to create this completely unique experience where you have paid users taking music that has been uploaded to the site by artists who you know happen to be on the site happen across the site get involved with the site and they're commenting on it they're listening to it they're voting it up and the stuff that ends up being the most popular the stuff that the fans that the user on the site are saying hey this is good this is great stuff that's stuff that shit gets printed to vinyl that's crazy no one else is doing that of course you can opt out of records opt out of pressings if you're not into the music and sort of get something else swap it out like a lot of these subscription services allow you to do that's cool that's amazing but they really have a unique approach to this that again I have not seen anybody else do and again if you're an artist you're trying to get your music out there you can put your album up on this site you can have it commented on voted on sort of seen on this site by people who may stumble across it but uh you know once once you're kind of in the pool of artists who are kind of getting talked about and voted on like there is a real possibility that your shit could get printed to vinyl and unlike other subscription services these guys aren't sort of just sending you records and kind of disincentivizing you from going to your local record store they're actually doing a bit of a debut on this coming Record Store Day because some of the records that they're printing the vinyl they're kind of playing the role of a record label too because they're printing these records and they're sending them out to independent record stores so a lot of the records that these guys are printing you're gonna see him at Record Store Day this coming Record Store Day so if you go on the site and you look through the music that's really popular on there or look at the stuff that they're gonna be printing you may end up seeing that stuff in the store when you hit up Record Store Day this this this coming week so I don't know I mean they're doing something really unique and and something to do with a freaking golden ticket it Willy Wonka style golden ticket type shit going on that I'm not even going to get into now because I've said so much about them already and you know I'll leave it to you to sort of look into that a little bit deeper I think I've said what I needed to say at this point because again they are doing something truly unique with the site so check it out listen to some of the music on the site if you're an artist maybe put your music on the site sort of see what they have going on because again I've seen and have advertised with a handful of these different vinyl subscription music subscription websites and what these guys are doing it's definitely different alright let's get into the best and worst tracks starting off the worst tracks as usual our good friends over in Lincoln Park kemo track this week titled good goodbye featuring storm Z and push a tee goddamn two artists who I would never think I would ever hear a Linkin Park song but but here they are but here they are and you know honestly the the the the song is not lacking for anything that Pusha T or storms he brought to the table but like what we've been hearing from this forthcoming Linkin Park album so far it does not sound like a rock song it just sounds like a garbage EDM anthem and they're just going completely electronic like you know anything about the band that was rock or metal previously has just totally sold up the river and now we're just kind of you know hearing some bad EDM anthems with rappers on them honestly Pusha T and storms are the best things about the track because the the verse before Pusha T's is absolutely cringe word the excuse me cringe-worthy I can't even talk it's it's making me cringe so much thinking about I can't get the words out because I'm like there's so much corny inspiration all over the all over this track it's making me want to throw up a little bit but that's really kind of the extent of it for the worst tracks this week not that there weren't other horrible tracks there were but I kind of wanted to clear this whole segment out clear the whole worst track segment out that Lincoln Park track was too terrible not to mention and but I kind of wanted to clear this whole section out just to say the new Fast and the Furious soundtrack is one of the worst things I've heard this year there almost is not a single track on this whole soundtrack that is not an over produced piece of garbage like I've never heard so much crappy trap in my whole life like goddamn where were the artists and some of these artists on this record I like them I enjoy their music I mean even the migos tracks even the little yachty track on this thing is hot garbage and I know you may hate little yachty already a lot of my fans don't like little yadi a lot of my viewers don't like little yachty but even if you listen to the yachty track on this thing it's it's easily one of his worst tracks if not his worst track like it's another level of bad I don't know what to tell you man just like every track like all the worst tracks of the week every track on this thing worse track of the week so that's why I needed to clear the section out because it's just it's just shit stacked on top of shit and I don't know what I'll say about it other than that because I'm not reviewing this goddamn thing all I want to do is have this be the last thing I say anything on this God for you know having to do with this godforsaken soundtrack because it really is auditory piss and I just don't know what else to say about it man it sucks it really sucks you know maybe toward the end of the year like I may mention it one more time if somehow I even think to remember when I'm making my worst albums of the year list though again it's not an album but like almost all the material on this thing I believe is original if not all the materials so you know and and I believe like a lot of these tracks are sort of inspired by the film you can really tell because the it's like it's like McKay's if the music on this thing is inspired by the film it's like it's like basically like two segments of a human centipede you have someone's ass sewn to someone's mouth and then that person's ass is sewn to that person's mouth and then and then you just have two people continually shitting and eating each other's shit and that's essentially what we have here if we're talking about a situation where the music truly is spots it truly is inspired by the film just eating each other's shit in an in an endless cycle and that's that's uh that's all I have to say about that okay that's all I have to say about that so they're those those are your worst tracks of the week moving on to the songs I was kind of mentored kind of indifferent toward but definitely felt were worth mentioning okay worth mentioning this new excuse me I need to calm down I really need to calm down because that was that was a that reaction there that was a very passionate very hot mess whoo all right new Mack DeMarco track over here that I got to mention this song over here on level definitely kind of going forward with the trend of what we've heard so far with these Mac DeMarco tracks a little more synthetic a little more Spacey and dreamy and lyrically definitely more depressing and personal and intimate too while I'm not as in love with the the very ambient synth sorrowful synth sound that this track is going for like I'm not enamored with the sound of it I do think it could be the type of track that hits me way harder when I hear it in context with the entire record because if we're hearing this sound kind of reinforced with a bunch of other tracks that sort of have a similar mood a similar vibe to them then it really could you know click with me hard but as a single like this is not anything that will most likely jump out at you you know unless you really kind of dive into the lyrics because they are kind of you know dark I would say you know they are kind of sad and I have to say this is probably the most intrigued I'd been to hear a Mac DeMarco project in a while because it seems like you know definitely it could be a big sea change for him you know what I mean I'm definitely curious as to what he's gonna deliver here more than I was like before salad days came out you know which ultimately I was disappointed by but this really could be like a defining moment for Mac because it seems like he's writing from a more personal point of view than he ever has before so it'll be interesting to sort of see what he delivers on this record especially based on the lyrics of this track which again I thought I thought it was decent not one of my favorites of the week but certainly worth mentioning moving on from there the new black lips track squatting in heaven which unfortunately I thought was kind of weak you know definitely not as exciting as the previous single I heard from the record you know while I do appreciate that it seems like they are going back to their rougher more lo-fi more wild sound this is one of those instances where they get kind of muffled in their own mayhem you know unfortunately definitely that's the case here hopefully that doesn't end up being so for a bulk of the album they're about to come out with but definitely the case on this track you know give it a listen I love the album title and I love the album cover this forthcoming record you know this track really could have used a little bit of work and some clarity I think shout out to woods for the track bleeding blue which felt like a very eerie beautiful ballad I'm just gonna leave it there just gonna leave it there I do think this is a good ballad I am still kind of weary about whether or not I'm gonna dig this new woods record though because some of what I've heard so far just sounds like I'm listening to a bad funky jam band but this song really kind of felt like they were playing to their strengths again you know I sort of felt that that sorrowful mood that I loved hearing out of a woods track you know they definitely channel that better than I think a lot of bands do and you know I'm just kind of hearing it manifests itself in another track that has just some good songwriting some good backing instrumentation behind it definitely enjoying it moving on from there the band horror with the song city rejects of sonically to me this just kind of felt like a standard Punk tune though I do think these guys have a ton of attitude and you know some of the lyrics on the track we're kind of interesting but if I if I am kind of throwing this track in here it's to definitely recommend the music video which i think is really creative not only does it bring kind of a strong message but also just the aesthetics of the video just the way it was kind of recorded and edited and everything is kind of really insane and off-the-wall really loved what the band did with the video and again I do think it is a one of the more creative videos I've seen you know in at least a year it is a pretty off-the-wall creative and very rough wild video with some very quirky editing and in effects that I thought were pretty cool power bottom I want to give a shout out to this track lol that they just dropped not a track that jumped out to me as much as what I've heard so far from their forthcoming record kind of a more easygoing ballad type song to me not really a teaser track you know although I guess the album it's it's not around the corner so I guess they wanted to kind of showcase that hey you know we're not just writing silly you know kind of garage poppy tunes over here we can sort of you know do a ballad too and it doesn't sound bad I'm just kind of you know anticipating that maybe this will work a little bit more be a little more exciting in the context of the record Kumasi Washington with the song truth Kumasi Washington and company have a new EP coming out via Young Turks this summer that I am very excited to hear tract I was kind of on the fence about it I do think it's kind of a mild song the chord progression didn't really stick out to me as anything special the solos were decent and the song really kind of works in three phases the second of which to me almost felt kind of unnecessary in the grander scheme of the track because there wasn't anything in the second phase of the track that was ultimately that exciting or added that much to the song in my opinion I thought the music video was really well shot and really thoughtful and really meaningful beautiful music video actually if there's anything again kind of a I feel like I'm sort of in the same position with horror over here you know if there is something definitely recommending we're worth recommending about this track the music video is amazing however the third phase of the track really kind of is the major payoff of the song I mean the drums are going insane those chorus vocals that you heard on the epic those you know those grand choral vocals that are so amazing just reaching orgasm Heights are certainly here it does not sound like as vivid and as pristine or recording as what you may remember from the epic but the performance is there the instrumentation is there the layers the density is there just sort of hoping that the EP has more to offer than what this track did because it definitely doesn't sound as risky or as or as adventurous as much of the material on the epic but you know I'm open to sort of having my mind changed on this track once I hear the whole project but let's move on from there I want to mention no worries you know Anderson pack and knowledge just came out with a music video for the track sacred money which is not new but on the back end of that track there is a remix of a song from their latest record that you should check out because they're about to come out with a remix album of tracks from their latest record and I know a lot of people were sort of crazy about that album I thought it was good you know crazier about that record than me and it could be interesting to sort of hear like a lot of those tracks remixed especially since the remix on this video didn't sound too bad and those were the tracks that I'm just kind of mentioning over here the songs that I was head over heels for got to give a shout-out to homeboy Sandman with Ben this is the most animated quirky lyrical fun and fucking quotable I have ever heard homeboy Sandman this guy always wants me to this guy always puts me to sleep I always want to go to bed when I listen to a homeboy say I'm in track this this dude on the mic I mean not that I'm saying he's gonna crazy here he's totally off-the-wall but he's so entertaining and witty on this particular track and I'm hoping that he can just kind of keep this slightly more animated delivery up on his forthcoming record not that every song needs to be really happy but you know he just felt like there was more to connect with emotional you know there was more personality there there was more vibrance there and when it came to the tone in his voice when it came to his lyrics not that the guy hasn't been lyrical in the past it's just kind of been delivered in this really flat flat tone that has been a real turnoff for me and hopefully um you know the things just worked for me a little bit better on this forthcoming record but this song so far bamboo really liking it moving on from there Clarence clarity has a new track out titled fold 'm featuring a rapper named shaadi or shady it's probably not Shady I'll say shoddy although I apologize from the up I apologize if I'm not saying that correctly clearance clarity changing direction on this track quite a bit I mean excuse me oh my god we do these raw and that's what happens home clearance clarity made one of my favorite albums of a few years ago it's titled know now one of the craziest most dense most experimental and insane pop records you will ever lay your ears on period like if you're a music producer if you produce music at home this record will make you shit your pants you'll be like man I don't know anything about anything because it's so dense it's so amazingly arranged it's so crazily orchestrated this dude is insane but now it seems like with this new track over here you're starting to strip things back a little bit peel back some of those layers do something a little poppy or a little bit more accessible and obviously he even leaves room for a rap verse on this track I mean the rapper is wild on the song I mean I can't really say that it's a conventional verse or a conventional delivery or anything like I can't even say there's much conventional about this song you know it is still very wild it is still very out there maybe not as strange as I expect Clarence to be because you know I do love know now I do love sort of his early EP stuff now that I've sort of had a chance to hear it but you know I could I could see this direction kind of benefiting his music because you know I do think he is he is too out there for the average listener you know and for him to do something a little bit easier on the ears could be good and the song does sound decent to me I like the song maybe it's not as you know densely produced and sort of overwhelming which I do like but I do think it's a fun tune moving on from there waves with million enemies yes I'm loving this song waves I'm liking the boom I'm loving the Bhumi bombastic crazy off-the-wall production that this track brings I'm loving how you know it sort of seems like it the the sound is so modern but it sort of still has the spirit of a rock song and I like that you know and and that's what I've been liking from all the tracks I've heard so far on this record so to hear that sort of manifesting itself more and more and more with every track that comes out has me excited you know obviously the Nathans kind of vocals were still there you know that kind of snotty nasally punky sort of attitude he has is there you know but it's it's kind of a thing it's this trademark and you know the sound is huge on this track and I'm loving that it's a real ballsy heavy in-your-face kind of track but with you know kind of a silly tongue-in-cheek kind of playful sort of attitude about it moving on from there Farra the only ones this is kind of a this is this is a bit of an odd tune over here not gonna say it's a great song you know fair is this really odd project on the Italians do a better label that came out with one of my favorite singles of all time called gay boy and if you look that song up yeah you will cringe I'm not gonna say you're not gonna cringe but the fact that song is so cringy that's what makes me love it I love how cringy that song is it's such a it's such a terrible but lovable track and now Ferrer has some new music coming out on the Italians do a better label this one titled the only ones this this part of the single that's being released and you know I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna say check it out I think it's fun I'm having fun listening to it it my enjoyment may be the slightest bit ironic but hey you know I don't think Farah would have it any other way moving on from their king gizzard with the song digital black king gizzard is coming out with their next record of this year in June because the band I guess again they've promised to come out with like four five 100 albums this year and this track is one of the tracks that has been released from this forthcoming record because apparently it's like a bit of a three chapter kind of thing and the band has released the entire third chapter on YouTube and on Facebook and you know you can hear each song in this chapter and all the songs are available on Apple music now and probably other streaming services as well and the song digital black the heavy Rivage the the song is almost progressive and theatrical too like I really love that it sounds like they're going in a totally different direction with this forthcoming record then they did their last album and man the fact that the creativity this band is bringing to the table is so dense it's so amazing it's so it's so endless that they can come out with this sound that is just so diametrically different then everything that they were doing on their last record like it's so heavy and doomy and it's again I will say theatrical yeah it's it oh like it's it's crazy I'm floored I'm fucking Florida and my mouth is watering I'm excited for this forthcoming record and I'm just gonna say digital black check this song out if you check out any song that are recommended in this video this week check out this fucking song and I want a shout out danger doom the song madness featuring Black Thought and Vinny Price danger doom the infamous not infamous but more legendary project featuring Danger Mouse and MF doom came together and they're coming together with a bit of a reissue of the album and they're gonna be a couple tracks that were not released with the initial album and the song is one of them and it's it's a good track so if you're a danger doom fan if you're an MF doom fan please do make sure you give the song listen don't let it slip through the cracks for you and that's gonna be it so that's that's the video thank you for watching again I want to mention Amazon Associates link down there turntable lab link down there we get kickback from that and our sponsor feed bands dot-com that's feed bands comm check them out very unique service that they have going on over there and that's gonna be it for this video everybody thank you for watching hope you got some good recommendations out of this thing hope you were entertained by my disappointment or my disgust rather with the fasten the the new Fast and the Furious soundtrack and we are gonna we are gonna leave it there okay I will catch you guys in the next video forever
