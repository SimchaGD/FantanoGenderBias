50xPMH0UMs0,new decks hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and going to do a quick track video here talking about a few songs that I would love for you to check out especially the new single came out a few days ago blogged about it on the website and it has been growing on me ever since if you don't know MGMT they're in new york-based psychedelic pop and rock outfits some electronic and indie tronic and very catchy poppy singles in their early discography but it seems as they have released more material they've been getting stranger and stranger but I like seeing the duo go into more adventurous territory and that seems to be the case with the few songs that have dropped from this new falling fell pew so far we have the song alien days very textured but not a ton of replay value for me however with this new track even though it is kind of repetitive the title being your life is a lie with kind of a broken record guitar riff some very repetitive vocal phrasing but it's a very kind of silly playful absurd short and earworm kind of track not only do the lyrics have this kind of tongue-in-cheek existentialism to them that I like a lot but the music video is awesome and features Henry Winkler for a few seconds also while we're here experimental electronic music producer food-man has a new album out a new collection of tracks that I would love for you to check out this and more link down in the description box as well as a really fantastically long vivid and heavy piece of drone metal from Northumbria young father's experimental Scottish hip hop trio has a new track out that is being featured on my friends of friends compilation the song effigy and also an album down there from Jung booth they have put out an LP a new full-length LP that features some really fast heavy aggressive and melodic post-hardcore and scream oh okay cool Anthony Fantana tracks new MGMT you 
YUJdtb1j1jM,tec-9 something else hi everyone MP Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tech 9 album something else tech 9 Kansas City rapper been at rap music for a few decades now and if you're the kind of person that analyzes rap music as a game as an industry and I know there are a lot of people who do tech 9 is a pretty interesting figure since the late 90s and early 2000s he's been making hardcore hip-hop with a slight slight horrorcore edge and his alternative lyrical topics and his alternative style and get up when he would do live shows or take promo pictures sort of set him in this outcast light and a lot of this guy's old outfits and get ups when he would perform live actually had him looking a lot like hip hop's answer to nu metal which is not that far of a comparison when you consider the fact that System of a Down Serj Tankian is actually one of the vocal guests on this album so there are some new metal and some rat metal vibes too coming through on tech nines music in general and this album too but the fact that he's dabbling in this genre that a lot of people consider to be kind of on the downturn hasn't really affected his popularity and the fact that he is an older rapper who has been in the underground for a long time hasn't really affected his popularity either because let's face it a lot of these older underground rappers didn't really transition over when the underground kind of exploded in the last handful years however it seems that tech 9 has really thrived in this brand-new Internet age for rap music and that's something that is wrapped about a handful of times here on this album and yes tec-9 is really eccentric style and image helps but I feel like the fact that he is a very technical and proficient and fast rapper is maybe his biggest selling point I love hearing this guy spit in a cypher doing a freestyle doing something acapella he's just a mind-blowing spitter has a really great flow and the thing is he enunciates really well and comes through with some really blunt lyrics that you get the first time or second time around definitely a guy who kind of straddles that line between being accessible and clever clever it's this sort of balancing act that has made tec-9 a popular rapper has brought him success and and as success has come things with him have changed especially his feature lists as of late with his recent albums tec-9 has featured artists that you would expect a guy like tec-9 to work with guys like three 6 mafia or local boys like Chris calico or big Scoob and also young up and comers who have a similarly dark edge to them like Hopson but then there are some sort of artists that are either really popular much more popular than tech 9 in the mainstream or ones that that sort of feel like are outside of his dark realms as well people like Kendrick Lamar Danny Brown who appears on this album little Lane yellow wolf t-pain the game and Wiz Khalifa are on this album too even Big KRIT who tec-9 did a pretty awesome BET's cypher with a few years ago there's even a legal and clear doors sample of Jim Morrison singing all over one of the tracks on this LP and even though things have been changing for tec-9 stylistically he stuck to his guns pretty much even though he is a different artist than he used to be in the early 2000s he's still pretty recognizable as the same guy I think the biggest surprise is on this LP are maybe the club ear tracks especially fizzles which has Danny Brown on here one of the bonus tracks from this LP where of course it's a banger beat really noisy and Tek is rapping about Mali which I guess is just something you have to do and in rap these days especially if you're rapping with Danny Brown so even though in a slightly objective way I can acknowledge that this album has versatility it has style tec-9 has technical ability with rapping quite a bit of it I don't like it I don't like this LP not even a little bit you know I I just don't get the sentiment of this album on a lot of tracks especially right from the start of this LP where you have these monotone girl voices talking about force trying to reduce us I guess us being tec-9 listeners or those who listen to tec-9 and think alternatively but what the alternative is is never really explicitly said I just feel like there are all these vague feelings of isolation thrown all over this album why it's almost like the music on this LP is trying to feed like an emotional vulture on anybody who's ever felt like they were unaccepted at any point in their lives and of course around every corner on this LP were reminded of how nobody accepts tec-9 and he's an outsider and he's different there are moments like on the song bitch breaking into colored houses where tec-9 comes off really funny clever and self-aware talking about how for a majority of his career his audience has been predominantly white however as he's been getting more popular and accepted into a rap community that is increasingly growing more open-minded toward things like gay rights as well as darker expressions and hip-hop music but then there are spots on this LP where I feel like texts personal observations aren't that fantastic or just his personal experiences which I'm not sure he's putting on display if he's not going to at least twist them in a way that has interesting word play or subtlety like on the song with the BS which has a pretty great bang or beat and some solid guest verses I love big scoob's contribution to this track the dude raps fast he's got a phat smooth husky voice but tec-9 he's just completely over-the-top about his financial troubles and getting his kids through college he puts it on display in the most obvious way possible where I don't really feel like anything for the situation really like okay you have to put your kids through college that's okay it's great that you have kids going to college which he cleverly rhymes with knowledge but still even though there are moments of this track that I do enjoy the instrumental kind of keeps me back from from full enjoyment I think because of just the the kind of weird Halloween style synthesizers playing in the background not everything needs to sound subtly creepy in a cartoony way especially college enrollment I mean one of my issues instrumentally with tec-9 kind of goes back to the song bitch where he mentions that he was one of the first rappers to try to make putting classical and opera music sampled into hip-hop big to me this trend has consistently been very corny gaudy and just in bad taste which are adjectives I would use to describe other tracks on this LP like the song love to dislike me which sounds like this rat metal Evanescence collaboration hybrid with this corn s guitar wails screaming in the background again I feel like these feelings if I don't belong are put on in the most vague way possible where just about anybody listening can hear this and be like I identify it just feels so manipulative to me it feels so shady and then there are moments where tec-9 doesn't really feel that relatable at all like on the track fortune force field which essentially is texts personal lyrical diary about the trials and tribulations of attempting to trademark a mixed drink that he wrapped about in a previous song as soon as the first verse was over I was just thinking what am I even listening to will tec-9 be rapping about his stock options later in the tracklist I realized that trademarking your own thing and trying to start your own business is is a very personal thing it could lead to a lot of money it may be really important to tec-9 however it does not make for a very passionate and harrowing and meaningful song topic to be completely honest maybe this is the kind of thing that jay-z could write like a really cocky clever lying about with a double entendre and then it would sort of fit into his song and get annotated on rap genius but it is just beating a dead horse when you've worked it out into song form if there's one single thing I can give him props on at least some regards to this track and others on here he's topical he takes a concept and he runs with it even if it's a concept that is is really stretched too far thin by the time he's run out to the length of a full song I do have to give him props on the song fragile though one of the few tracks on here I really dug a song where he felt real if like he was passion evil heart fell on this track really a song where lyrically he was responding directly to critics of his music I guess it's kind of ironic that the critic would love the song that kind of is a shot at critics but hey it was one of the more captivating tracks on this LP am I offended by some of what tec-9 said on this song not really I do understand kind of where he's coming from being a guy who is an alternative face in hip-hop he's had a lot of people who don't really understand him or his music listening to it over the years essentially labeling him as a joke as a character as a gimmick essentially for doing things that had been carried out in rock music for years like you would never write an article about kiss calling them a gimmick rock band because they wear suits and have face paint and I feel like he answers these criticisms well in this verse he ends off the verse by saying yeah you know what I am sensitive about my stuff he sort of answers the hate and I like how on the flip side Kendrick Lamar's on this track also rapping about critics rapping about the intense love in some of the hate that he has gotten over the past few years and how that can kind of drive one crazy as well tec-9 seems like a cool down-to-earth dude who is self-aware enough to the point where he shouldn't need to respond to people who are going to just sort of tag him with such a shallow criticism and not really dive deeply into the things that he's saying however as far as more serious critics of tec-9s music go I don't feel like you can be this guy who gets angry and gets upset saying that you put all this effort into your lines and you're mad that people are criticizing your music when you come out with songs like Wham you like Bailey's I like ladies I'm quite crazy there are people who are listening closely to lines like this in our life this line is like not good it gets a little one-dimensional after a while especially when I'm here in lines like I'm the biggest and baddest um matter than maddest I got this I had this it's a good rip homie Thanks and it just feels like so huge it feels like this big put-on to me but maybe what's even more disturbing when tec-9 comes through with a song that feels really personal like a track that's my kid where where he comes off like a proud father and if he has two kids like he says that are stable contributing members of society that's great but in this tracks lines he's rapping about using physical discipline clocking with the right hand so you have a kid who doesn't end up like Adam Lanza didn't he have a mental problem and as far as one of the final tracks on this LP Strange Days which features Jim Morrison's sampled vocals on the track well the song isn't terrible I feel like the sample Jim Morrison vocals are you so uncreated Lee really just singing entire lines of lyrics in between tech nines lines and it just does nothing for me really as a matter of fact most of this album really did nothing for me while again I I realized and I respect the fact that tec-9 has technical ability he has kind of a persona and a style of his own for me the choruses almost zero appeal on this LP especially that CeeLo hook on that's my kid where he sounds half asleep or like in the middle of eating a sandwich or something and as far as the instrumentals ago very few of them actually appeal to me many of them are just far too synthetic flat and when they're not just really club' they're just gaudy again with some of these Halloween style sounds or musical phrases or these more classical or operatic musical sounds phrases an instrumentation I'm feeling a strong three to a life four on this thing if you've given this up he'll listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it I'm sorry but here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Billy woods who does not get in props all mistakes were intentional only the strong subscribe so do it Anthony Fantana tec-9 something else different forever [Music] 
drEvNUbqbPs,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new dead in the dirt album the blind hole after just a few IPS this Atlanta Georgia band is now dropping its full-length debut album on the infamous southern Lorde records a label that as you may know lately has been kind of dabbling in the sludgy er side of extreme music and this new record that they are presenting with dead in the dirt is a 22 track of fair and time-wise lands out around 24 minutes averaging just over a minute per track I decided to give this thing a listen give it a review even though I feel like labels like Southern Lord and maybe to an extent Deathwish records have been kind of saturating the loud rock scene with heavy sludgy hardcore punk records or grindcore records power violence records kind of like this but I feel like at least this album was interesting enough to catch my ear for the short amount of time that it did we've got mosh friendly friendly riffs all over this LP and D beat drums as well these groovier points on the album which are backed up with these drums are occasionally interrupted by syncopated blast beat drums and guitars so and of course feedback plays a pretty gigantic role on this album as well and of course we cannot forget the vocals which are a range of different extreme music styles we have death metal s growls on this LP some just straight-up hardcore punk screams maybe a few moments that these shrieks on this LP feel a little scream O influenced the recording and the mix the heavy bass on this thing and just the overwhelming compression not too overwhelming though but the compression on this LP just makes this album sound so massive and yet it's really clear too even though the guitars are so just and the drums are just so pummeling but very resonant to every single crushing bass drum kick and bloody crusty sledgehammer guitar riff come through as clear as a bell a lot like a wrecking ball just kind of careening through your bedroom wall not only do these faster spots feel clear not too blurry even though that does sort of happen to an extent because of how fast the band is playing but there are slower moments on this LP that feel nice as well like the 11th track or the closing track here - which have some simple but effectively dreary guitar parts as well as some very slow slow riffs on the closer here the low-end on these riffs gets so heavy that there's this tangible Rumble to the bass it's moments like this that actually kind of lead me to believe that the band does have some kind of idea of what subtlety in music is however it's not really often on display with this LP and that could be a good or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for if you didn't already know power violence and grindcore bands can kind of be a dime a dozen if you're looking for nothing more than kind of a completely unmemorable slugfest where over the course of a stereotypically short album you are beaten almost within an inch of your life but you don't really remember much of any of it sure there are bands like nails that are really catchy really groove heavy and just have an insane sound that is just more powerful than most in this genre and there are others like worm rot who I continue to sing the praises of who are a grindcore act but come through with some real absurdities and eccentricities to the music they're creating for sure dead and the dirt has come through on this record where they fantastic recording immense recording for this kind of music but sometimes I can't help but feel like a lot of what is presented here songwriting wise and and vocally - is just kind of very standard I don't really feel like the vocals are legitimately wild or furious sometimes just really kind of following in the footsteps of a lot of expectations coming from death and hardcore punk I definitely don't feel like the vocals here are as infuriated as what I've heard from either in fest or Charles Bronson and on the shorter tracks I do tend to feel like the bands writing especially on the riffs can be sort of unmemorable it's really the longer and Meteor tracks and then sometimes even the slower and sluttier tracks where I feel like dead and the dirts potential kind of comes through while they do have that physical intensity that you would want from some of the shorter tracks on here there's not much to them that I gravitate toward and while I wouldn't say that this record was boring to me I'm actually surprised that I stuck with it and wanted to listen to it again and again there's definitely something to be said for that but as I listen to this record more and more and totally enjoyed the recording enjoyed the ferocity enjoyed the intensity and I was looking for a little bit more in other places but I just wasn't finding that stuff meaning more creativity from the noisy sounds or the riffs or the vocals or just the song structures though this record is fast and enraging I just wish it pulled some more punches offered more surprises had a little bit more personality it's not a record that I see sticking with me for the long run but if you're into something extreme straight up and no BS then I would definitely give this thing a listen regardless of whether or not you agree with me on this review I'm feeling a decent strong 6 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it I want to give a shout out to Paul tec-9 fans I hear you Sammy Jerusha over at the rocket out blog I just did a video with him you can find a link down below in the description box and moms who buy their children tonight on vinyl only the stronger subscribe all mistakes were intentional straw anthony Fantana dead in the dirt forever you 
sJbkuz8zMyo,Kandee claws snap snap okay okay okay I have heard you I have listened to you and I understand y'all don't want no scrubs so I'm going to cut my hair you should just get that hair cut on your head you hippie man you just you can't argue with that hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music art and it's time for a review of the new kandi clause album series and calypso in the deep time kandi clause is a pop outfit been following them on and off since 2009 when i heard their debut full-length in the dream of the sea life a very low phi and psychedelic album otherwise known as NZ dream ozc life this is the second full-length album now that they have dropped since the release of that debut and it is really catching my ear a lot more than the last full length they put out in 2010 hidden lands an album where essentially the the group cleaned up their sound quite a bit really made the production a lot more spic and span than their low fights and worked out a lot more precise melodies this LP was a lot more engaging musically but sort of threw away all of these surreal fuzziness and it is now on this new full-length album where I really feel like kandi clauses kind of reconciled the two sides of their musical persona here and have created an LP that is instrumentally and melodically dense with all of these sweet candied melodies that feel compressed and layered one on top of another in this Phil Spector esque wall of sound style there are moments production and arrangement wise where it feels like kandi Claus is pulling from the Beach Boys and the Beatles as well so there is sort of a vintage retro throwback element to some of the songwriting album however there is a very strong dream pop element as well on this LP which genre wise is nothing new dream pop has been around a while but with these genres resurgence as of late it does keep this album feeling kind of modern especially with how dense this album is with sound instrumentally this LP is as thick as a triple decker club at a truck stop diner with really distorted rough bass guitars over modulated guitar chords some really shimmering leads and keyboards and some pretty whispery sedate boy/girl vocals as well and while all of these pieces of instrumentation all of these sounds don't seem incredibly impressive on paper it's really how candy cos arranges all this stuff that kind of Wow's me because even though the the slow pace and the very breezy vocals on their tracks give a very dreamy sleep-like feel to this album it's the melodies and the arrangements that feel very awake alert nimble agile at some points it's almost as if candy Claus is sort of like a mini psych pop pit orchestra on some of these tracks especially on the track transitional girl which actually has all these beautiful Beatles esque vocal harmonies soaring after the choruses there are also some other spots on this LP where they're really heavy guitars and bass sort of buzz and drone and pound along with the drums and this sort of My Bloody Valentine like fashion the sound is really heavy and it's warped however don't expect candy Claus to take a similar songwriting fashion on this LP a lot of the band's melodic influences come far from outside of shoegaze whether it's the song charade which is a very moody waltz or the song fallen tree bridge which has all these sassy Latin guitar leads playing over the intro or even the track birth of the flower which is so tropical in its melodies and its instrumentation that it feels like it would go over pretty well at a luau even though aesthetically Candi Claus does stay in roughly the same dream pop psych state throughout this entire LP when it comes to the kind of music that influences them melodically their ears really to the wind and this breeze sort of takes them in a lot of different directions while I think that there is a lot of instrumental talent on this record it almost seems like to me that candy Klaus is a little too reliant on this whispery vocal dream pop aesthetic to sort of make this record work occasionally candy Claus can feel kind of OneNote in the same way that black moth super rainbow can which is especially the case if I don't end up liking the song or the melody that the band has worked out for a particular track like on the song illusion which has all these downs stroked very moody dark guitar chords all over the song that actually feel like they could have worked against the melody from the opening theme to Tales from the Crypt I do appreciate the band's ambition to try out different musical styles throughout this album but as I listen to especially in the second half with all the instrumentation in the vocals feeling uniformly packed together in this vacuum-sealed psychedelic sausage-making all of the instrumental elements feel really mushy it gets a little stale honestly most of the time I do dig this album a lot candy Claus instrumental backdrop is so impressive at points on this LP it's like being dropped right into the middle of a hallucination inspired fairy tale if only the the sort of ambitious concept and narrative that I know the band's strung together for this album came through in a very sharp way through this dream pop aesthetic it's a bit of a double-edged sword that I feel like candy Claus is yet to wield in a really impressive way on this album still with the amount of production and instrumental talent that I'm hearing on this LP I feel like candy Claus but this album is one step closer to coming out with a project that is conceptually impressive intelligible but still for the time being this album is very blissful melodic fun and enjoyable I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout-out to dead end hip hop who did a great video talking about sort of hip hop's response or involvement or effect on the whole Trayvon Martin case also Zack D honky Fan Tan chip and happy birthday Eric only

Jl9trkoRjMM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new EP from Sam this guy is a singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist hailing from the UK if you paid close attention to what was going on in electronic music in 2011 you may already be familiar with him due to his many appearances on the debut self-titled subtract album and the most utilized singer and easily them the most standout singer out of the entire Bunch Sam feh and I say standout because of his incredibly soul full voice which is executed with this very tight nimble vibrato uh he's got a wonderful range to his voice as well this very youthful tone to it that runs a little nasally I think it's all of these qualities that come together and make people instantaneously compare this guy to a singer like James Blake I think once you get deeper into each artist stylistically listening to their music more and more and more where they're heading sort of seems to make it apparent that the comparison is is only legitimate on a vocal level now with this solo effort that Santa has just put out dual this neo-soul EP of his which is six tracks long two interludes on it for meteor tracks all kind of adding up together to about 18 minutes some tracks seem to head in a slightly more electronic direction others more natural with piano kind of leading the way but either/or it's really the vocals that kind of take the spotlight his vocals are especially impressive on the closing track here can't get close which sort of sees santhu vocalizing over this one musical refrain over and over and over for about three minutes and then the song kind of ends not really a fully formed song but Sam does singing on this track has range from his very sad emotive low-end to his very painful Seto's our beautiful I just wished the songwriting and the instrumentation were a little bit more hammered out or a little bit more substantive on this track and honestly even though it's not as bad on other songs here for me that sort of seems to be the recurring theme on this short collection of tracks even on the most fully realized track on this EP indecision which is a song where Sampha delivers that's really passionate fiery piano ballad the instrumentation backing up Santa's piano playing and singing feels so faint so weak that I just wish it was him singing and playing piano and that's it it's like there's no confidence in some of the backup instrumentation on this EP now tracks like without and beneath the tree songs that take a slightly more electronic approach I wish they were a little more vivid and and lush instrumentally - but maybe I find a bit more appeal in songs like this because of their electro acoustic blend of instrumentation I'm loving just how serene and seductive and calming and smooth all the sounds are added up together especially on the song without which has these layers upon layers of rhythms that progress pretty nicely as the song moves forward and I'm loving the addition of guitar on this track - it sparkles and it shimmers in the same way that the sense do they just melt together in this really nice way and just sound very one overall it's it's not a bad ap I did enjoy it however I wouldn't say that it stopped me in my tracks or anything like that if there's anything that I came away from this EP with it was you know a few catchy refrains like the one on indecision but mostly I'm just kind of feeling yeah sanfur could come out with something a lot more interesting in the future I mean that that ultimately was my reaction to this thing when it concluded it's just a matter of either him getting a little bit more ambitious with his instrumentation or hooking up with another great producer like subtract to come out with another series of songs and that's it if you've given the sepia listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it thank you for watching you're the best Sampha dual ep you 
SG2kU6-Nt-E,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and going to do a little question comment thing about a question that people throw my way quite a bit where i dosed out scores scores reviews numbers etc putting scores at the end of my reviews via a zero to ten number scale is something that many people have asked me about since I started the needle drop it's something that I've reflected on quite a bit since starting the needle drop and I know the reasons why people don't like it or sort of the negative aspects of it which I guess I can't present because the world of art is so subjective how could you put something as concrete as a number or a grade on it I know from the outside looking in it may seem like a very cold and callous practice and part of the reason that is because I don't really explain it in every single video and God why should it be but for me personally the the numbers that I put at the end of my reviews and I assume that's the case for most reviewers even though they don't really discuss it a great length either is just a reflection of my personal opinion or preference there is some kind of magical criteria checklist that I'm sort of oh this is worth this many points and this is worth that many points really all that's going on is from zero to four we're talking about an album that I dislike whether it be a four which I dislike a little or it's a zero which is like an atom bomb of sadness going on in my brain then we have a five which is pretty much me on the fence and then from six to ten that's stuff I like whether I like a little bit as a six or a ten which is an atom bomb of happiness going off in my head I know there are people out there that tend to react strongly to these numbers whether it be with love or extreme hate but to me those people are individuals that give in to the idea of getting hung up on such a thing if those people were not getting hung up on numbers then they would get hung up on me simply saying you know what I hate this or I love this I guess at the end of the day all I really want is for you to be able to comprehend what I'm saying understand the opinion that I'm trying to give my like or dislike of the album and I guess sort of just throwing a number on the end of it helps in the understanding of that and I think at this point you could definitely say I don't rely on that too much especially since I sort of don't score and my quicker reviews and in my more long-form reviews you definitely get a ton of opinion and context before that score is really delivered but still they're going to be people that just think about the number and and you know what that's their thing that's their loss there going to be people who lose respect for me over a score there going to be people who compare the score of one album to another album and are like oh my god how could they do that people are going to enjoy people are going to watch people are going to listen to what they want to enjoy watch and listen to for the reasons that they feel like I can't make you watch or understand or enjoy my videos the way I want you to understand watch or enjoy them especially as the viewer base of the YouTube channel grows the more it grows the less control over that I have people could be watching my reviews because they think Cal is really funny five-stage which by the way he's not he's never actually been funny but some people seem to like him more than me for whatever reason what shapes so for whatever reason you watch I have decided that it's probably the smartest thing to let you watch the way you want to watch and let you enjoy the way you want to enjoy and understand the way you feel like understanding sure if you ask me a question in a comment and I don't miss it or if it's on Twitter or something like that or in an email I'm happy to answer but I mean you're gonna think what you think and I'm not gonna try to correct every single person who I may disagree with just because that seems like a futile pursuit and that's it so in nutshell I guess that's kind of why I put numbers at the end of my videos what do you guys think what do you think of scores at the end of reviews of anything really I mean does it make things convenient does it make things easier or is it the greatest artistic travesty to ever happen in modern times that we are giving one stars to restaurants or d-minuses to movies or 4.32 new albums let me know Anthony Fantana scores forever

VBtBgCyA8BE,hi how you doing Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and gonna do a review right now the new alunageorge album body music these guys are London pop duo who had been dropping some pretty hot singles for the past few years in 2011 it was the song you know you like it and in 2012 your drums your love and this year earlier this year my personal favorite so far in the line of singles they've been dropping track attracting flies and all these tracks were a pretty nice fusion of contemporary R&B dance pop electro pop some of the hotter electronic music styles to come out of the UK right now like future garage as well as UK bass and even though these songs they were great however not really the most inventive pop songs on the planet there was still reason to believe that this album would be solid for one George Reed is a pretty talented and versatile producer plus you've got this guy making the beats the instrumentals for the album track for track for track so there is going to be some kind of quality control and consistency across the instrumentals and as far as Aluna Francis goes she's an incredibly capable singer with a distinctly high-pitched voice which is very tiny but subtly rough like it's it's got a little bit of sandpapery quality to it it's like I'm listening to her whisper but even when she's singing loudly and the songs on this album have a sense of structure they have melody they have explosive memorable choruses however I would stop short of saying that it's really a a ambitious album really to me this album is just kind of a mixed bag of contemporary pop tracks even if a lot of them are well written a lot of the same love and relationship tropes that you've heard in pop music a million times before are sung here again but alunageorge can come off pretty clever about it sometimes like on the track attracting flies where you have this emotional argument going on with a lot of Lies being thrown around and what is being sung is that this person everything the exhale is attracting flies kind of polite way of saying that it's and I really like the hook lyrics on the track lost-and-found - if you wanted a lost-and-found you should have caught me on the rebound there are moments like this where alunageorge can present a pretty interesting turn of phrase and that it really seems like they're putting effort into the lyrics but then again there are spots that come off a little obvious with the rhyme scheme like on the opener which which tosses together the rhyme sad glad bad the times we had okay so the cat had a bat and it was fat on a mat even though I wish there was a little more effort put into the rhyming here and there overall I wouldn't really say the lyrics are an issue for me even though many of the tracks here focus on this very young love or heartbreak it feels like it's being executed with a pretty mature focus because at the end of the day it's the it's the genuinely catchy melodies and courses that make these song so good now the previously released singles which are all great are dumped pretty early on in the tracklist on this LP although I will say that I have to mention the track your drums your love I love the melody on this track especially right before the chorus pops in and you get these jazzy or piano chords playing into the song it's musical flourishes like this that gives some of these songs character and make them feel a little bit more layered than your average pop tune and alunageorge outside of these singles which they've been riding for years they do manage to bring some at least some other highlights like the track kaleidoscope love I love the vocal melodies on the verses on this track has a really old school 90s R&B flavor but the beat and and this happens on track after track after track that brings this more 90s R&B vibe the beat feels very new feels very current especially with the weirdly manipulated bass on this track I would say the same thing goes for the track best be believen again we're getting kind of an R&B flavor but the vocal samples which are pitch shifted and played throughout the song like an instrument I mean that just feels so new and really catchy I like that Aluna Francis is bringing tons of things with her vocals whether it be a vocal melody or whether it be her lyrics that makes these songs memorable but George read as well some of the tight little flashy additional melodies that he'll throw into tracks make the songs memorable as well now like I mentioned earlier other genres do come through on this LP like the electro pop and the dance pop and the UK bass especially on a song like Lost and Found I do like the variety but part of me ends up favoring tracks like the title track on here which are slower a little more sensual over songs like super star which I just see his kind of being very blandish pop they're actually a handful of songs toward the second half of this album that don't really add much to the LP for me that includes super star as well as Lost and Found just to touch as well part of that has to do with I don't really feel like George Reed is bringing an incredibly new idea or concept to these tracks that he didn't bring on previous tracks in my opinion but these songs are also kind of running to an issue for me that I think is the biggest consistent issue on this album and that's really Luna Francis and and again I said earlier she's a capable singer I still believe that and I think she has a lot of pitch I think she has more range than a lot of girls that are trying to sing this kind of music she definitely has an ear catching voice as well which makes the singles off of the cell P so great but I feel like she's a little limited in the style that she sings with George Reed is much more of a versatile producer than Aluna is a singer a lot of the tracks on this LP have the same vocal phrasing and if it's not that it's it's pretty much every song here singing with that same kind of cute sexy dynamic even on the slower and more sensual songs where I actually would like to hear something a bit more soulful or toned down I actually think the title track is one of the few moments here where Aluna felt legitimately vulnerable or kind of lovely even though I did like this album it does feel a little limited on the diversity side they do kind of tend to run a little one-dimensional on this album but the songs that are good on this here are great if only they could kind of veer out of their comfort zone and write some other songs feel just as good as some of the singles and other highlights on this album alunageorge is next LP will be fantastic and at this point I don't really have any huge doubts as to whether or not that could happen given the singing and producing abilities that have been presented so far I'm feeling a strong six to a life seven on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and that's it this review has been my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to a video that I made for the maker studios channel where I talk about three new music videos from earl janelle monae as well as climate control find a link to that here or down there only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional anthony Fantana alunageorge forever you 
Rm2A0VHzeXM,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd yep that's me you know that already and it's time for a quick review of the new all pigs must die album nothing violates this nature these guys are a massachusetts band this is their second full-length LP and it's been a handful of years now since I first heard of them and they initially impressed me with their Curt blue of converge produced debut self-titled EP their sound and their style tends to run on the hardcore punk side of things with a kind of sludgy loud heavy aesthetic and since they put out this EP and even before they put out this EP and I'm sure long after I make this video this is not really the only release out there right now kind of dabbling in this fusion of metal and hardcore stylings you know just taking a more metallic approach to playing just fast aggressive Punk style music and this EP that I'm talking about and the debut album they dropped shortly after showcased power energy speed ferocity but when it came to writing and just kind of having a distinct sound or style all pigs must die I was really kind of coming up short however I do like this new album of there's a little bit more even though it's in roughly the same style I'm finding that the riffs and the chord progressions do have a bit more personality to them some of the melodic guitar leads or harmonious chords laid into tracks on this album like of suffering and bloodlines and the really slow sludgy closer do hint to all pigs must die showcasing a little bit more finesse but I think another change all pigs must die has made to this album is that it's a little more ferocious than their last two and maybe a little less kind of generic hardcore sounding some of their fastest and most aggressive songs yet have made it onto this LP songs like Hakeem siege and and sacred noting the speed and the power of these songs is just to me completely undeniable and I would say in terms of sound and production this record is definitely heavier and all pigs must dies laughs tell Pete to however even though I do like the force and I like the power of this album those things are nothing if not memorable for me because while all pigs must die is heavier and louder on this album it's not like they're as aggressive as other groups that are fusing some of these same styles together and are on the same label all pigs must die is on to southern lord groups like the secret and nails too are just much more but still sometimes actually to a fault because I'm not really a huge fan of the secrets last LP even though that is is unquestionably aggressive but the thing is it's so fierce non-stop that nothing much on the LP sticks out and I kind of feel like this all pigs must die album isn't like that throughout but there are quite a few songs on here that sort of breeze by me because of the sort of generic hardcore vocal stylings that that do run through some of these songs and the kind of unambitious guitar work again while it's fast and it's loud the fact that melodies that are interesting don't really stick out where chord progressions or grooves that are unique or creative don't stick out this to me sort of feels like hardcore wallpaper sometimes I would say with this new album of there's all pigs must die is not as one-dimensional as they sort of came off on their last full-length LP but I still can't say that I'm any more than lukewarm toward their latest material even if this album is really infectious sometimes with with how aggressive it is if you've given this all pigs must die album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why did you not really care about the writing or the guitar work or anything like that and it's just really kind of the energy that's sucking you in and made you enjoy it or were you looking for a little bit more from this album and in the same way that I was anthony Fantana all pigs must die you 
IHXn82SEoLY,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here inter Nets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ha album the Knights gambit this guy's in New York rapper from the Brownsville area who's been flying underneath the radar for a little while now the guy's had his past successes and efforts with natural elements as well as the GZA whose album ProTools he appeared on but he has amassed more buzz than he ever has through his solo stuff especially the album grief pedigree that he dropped last year which had a handful of pretty notable singles on it which had YouTube videos that had tens of thousands of views on them songs like chamber cold facts summer and it songs like this that that sort of paint cod as a very subtle rapper and when I say subtle I mean he really embodies that word in just about every sense then artist possibly can the dude has a really quiet low-key smoky vocal delivery and his flows on his tracks are very slow they're spacious they're hypnotic it's kind of like listening to a sedate MF DOOM and as far as lyrical content cop pretty much delivers a series of stories and bars based around drugs violence the concrete jungle he lives in and other personal experiences and thoughts and last year when I first heard of this guy through singles off of grief pedigree I think I dug his stuff but sort of cast him off as being kind of this quiet rock marciano type another New York MC hookah has collaborated with on a few tracks Rock actually appears on this album and you know part of what sort of had me cold with that comparison is that I didn't really enjoy Rock's latest full-length LP reloaded while I did appreciate the very sort of quiet minimalism that rock went into making that album with it at the end of the day kind of underwhelmed me a little bit and I kind of feel like this album and grief pedigree too to an extent can be a little one-dimensional and thuggish at times but I I seriously think that with the Knights gambit kosm usek has grown past that limitation in a really big way he's making hip-hop music on this album that really breaches into territory that is dark eerie pained tortured song for song for song cause bars on on this LP soundly quietly admitted crimes recorded in a wiretapped sound booth and it's in these lines that he kind of is reflecting upon his past or at least what he projects to be his past and while it doesn't strike me as being regretful in any sense of the word cod does kind of feel like a dude who is very jaded worn and kind of weathered by the very intense experiences he's had across his lifetime he kind of seems like a guy who for a long time has always had to be on guard and has also had to navigate through some really tough situations which is an issue on this LP that is reflected with all the wordplay and symbolism having to do with chess on this album also the album cover the album title and there are numerous vocal edits and snippets played throughout this album that referenced the game of chess as well a play chess but my past is checkered a lot of what cast says on this album to tell you the truth is is very thoughtful and thought-provoking he's not really a guy despite the fact that there are elements of violence there are elements of of many other things that are mentioned in hip-hop music in his music he's not a guy for empty boasts or or shallow material pursuits now as far as the instrumentals on this LP something that that also kind of hooked me in on this album and made me really interested in where Kyle was going with his music the beats on this thing are not hooky they're not loud just like Cobb but still to me they registers being very creative refreshing and kind of bold for hip-hop music just because of this kind of quiet and creepy aesthetic that they go for like the opening track on this LP which has all these primal tom drums playing throughout and a guitar riff that I actually think comes from Black Sabbath's self-titled track Black Sabbath if it wasn't ripped from that song it's a guitar riff that sounds exactly like that song and like Black Sabbath's Black Sabbath this track is is similarly dark the song our Father has this really tense chord progression to it and I just love the pacing of the drums and the keys on this track did it and then you get this wide gap of space and then they just like kind of come in and interject quickly and then again you get this wide gap of space it's a really interesting thing about this LP that there are very few hip-hop albums that that like this one I think use space as creatively to create tension to create unease and this track is rife with that sentiment with the sort of hollow wood percussion kind of clicking away in the background and the lyrical topic on this track where essentially Ty's talking about trying to live righteously or just want to be on the side of the good but because of his sort of lifestyle he has to be doing these bad things and he is praying to God asking God to sort of look away as he is going to be doing these dirty deeds in this dichotomy of being kind of caught between the good and the bad side of things is also expressed on other tracks here like bard and likeness but to go on with the instrumentals I love the track jungle with Trillian thei reeling over and over and over against these very softly played lead guitars it's a track whose instrumental is really ethereal it's really cloudy it's like I'm listening back to a hip-hop memory like some kind of flashback and the heavy bass and the hand percussion and the crushing bass II piano notes on the track P sake is fantastic as well and I love the turn of phrase on the hook on this track as well with a pistol being the only piece that coughs ease peace being you know his sort of Avenue toward creating peace or the only kind of solace or safety that he gets but peace also being kind of like a peace I really dig the song knighthood off of this LP with the kind of soulful humming voice that is sampled and looped through the track and even the closing song which has these kind of fuzzy distorted lead guitars it is a track that feels like it could potentially have been a really loud piece of boom bat but instead it goes these sort of soft and subtle route even though Cod does take a lot away from 90s hip-hop his approach feels so new and it's so funny to think of sort of somebody reinventing it in a way that feels this refreshing when you have people out there like Pro era for example who are doing kind of like this 280 re-creation of this older style and and it is enjoyable but to really hear somebody kind of reinvent this style of hip-hop incorporate the personal storytelling it incorporate the gritty kind of Illmatic esque dangerous urban backdrop and to have a rapper who is not really indulging in all of it necessarily not because he wants it to be flash you are impressive or anything like that sort of as a necessity to kind of live when that actually is the case but when that's not the case it really is kind of caught coming off like a reporter but in addition to how awesome the instrumental is on the last track from the cell P off the record the song topic is really awesome too because the track is loaded with bars and in wordplay that are all in reference to classic hip-hop albums from the 80s and 90s if you ever wanted to kind of get like a hip-hop album starter kit or anything like that just watch the music video for this song any group of albums you've managed to pick out of that music video I wholeheartedly endorse now other tracks on here like 30 pieces of silver also a topical track a song that is about betrayal and sort of the the lifestyle that Cobb maybe had been leading at the point where a lot of his songs reflect to earlier in his life and just sort of the dangers of living that lifestyle in respect to not being able to trust others and it's his really quiet stone-faced delivery that that makes this sort of fear feel very real at least for me as I'm listening to this song I honestly think this is one of the most chilling hip-hop songs have heard this year and fantastic topical track on this thing nothing is essentially a song work odd dives into his hip-hop journey a little bit and kind of concludes that if this hip-hop thing is going to work out if this isn't for him then nothing is you know if I have any issues with this album overall I do wish it was a little more diverse and and I would maybe here and there love to hear cos sound a little bit more animated there's always part of me that's going to want a little more diversity but I feel like at least the instrumentals delivered that and even though Cop pretty much does stay at the same sort of quiet semi monotone flow he does bring a diverse array of topics or just really good stories that keep me kind of in the loop and listening very closely as I trip through this album but even though khat is really understated in his flow in his delivery it just cannot be denied that he is a creative and thoughtful emcee and that his delivery style works very well with the amount of wordplay and his effort he puts into every single word that he writes out every single bar that he measures this is just kind of his style it's not going to be for everybody and you know dive in deep into bars and sort of thinking about lyrics and being moved by lyricism in general isn't really for everybody but still that doesn't make khat any less good at doing that and that doesn't make this album any less fantastic either I'm actually feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to people who say that I don't review enough hip-hop but the only reason they think that is because they completely overlooked underground MCS like kha and they're not even really on their radar are only the song subscribe and all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana kha forever 
nTimdBZM30E,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music chia-pet nerd and it's time for a final update haven't done one in a while in the row let's let's just get straight into it our first vinyl you know recent additions to my collection is essentially the theme of these videos if you didn't already know there's also a series of other videos that are vinyl videos that I've done going throughout my entire collection but these videos just you know kind of talk about recent additions and these are some of them now this first one comes from the sponsor of this video eclectic the official art and record store of the eclectic society movement of a past me this freaking discovery vinyl whoa and it's a nice gatefold if you guys have watched my vinyl videos you know I love a good gatefold it's really kind of glossy on the inside and then I mean on the outside and then on the inside it's sort of a less glossy finish which I I like I like the varying textures and the other jackets are in really nice condition and it's a really thick pressing of the record too which I love and Dan does the vinyl sound clean it sounds pristine clean I mean you know some pressings of vinyl are good some are bad and mediocre and not all the sounds really translate because the pressing is crappy it's of bad quality but this is a clean clean like glass pressing I mean every sound is just so resonant and it was just again it was just beautiful you know listening to some of the songs off at this LP I haven't had a copy of this I mean in high school I had a friend of mine who I borrowed a CD copy of his and you know ever since then whenever I've wanted to listen to this album it's been either through that or it's been on the internet whether it be on Spotify or YouTube and it was beautiful listening to this LP on vinyl just how crisp it sounds on the LP I love it next one you guys may remember this LP recently reviewed this and bought a copy of it for myself because I do enjoy it stone tightens scratch-and-sniff now this this is an example of you know vinyl sounding a little bit different than when you listen to it on mp3 if you guys remember my review you got a little insert there with the song titles because they are not pressed on the label we have kind of like a the butt or the a hole of some kind of beast there and that is the scratch side and this is the sniff side but anyway you know we have an insert there nothing on the other side but you know the colorful artwork over here with the all sorts of weird things coming out of this guy's rainbows sliced wrists but to go on this is a very noisy sludge metal record I would go as far as to just call it straight and noise metal and when I listen to it digitally before I reviewed it it was chaotic and I feel like it feels even more chaotic on the record just because of when you're listening to vinyl the bass gets emphasized and the drums especially sounded incredibly boo me as I was listening to the album I needed to you know sort of adjust the bass a little bit to get it sounded real good but it is a heavy freaking vinyl again if you somehow missed that review I'll put it down there in the description box if you're into sludge metal if you're in a noisy Rock these guys definitely you know bring those together and in a way that's really energetic and angry this next one is a the this this is probably my favorite recent find right now these guys are MX 80 sound they're an Indiana post-punk outfit rock outfit experimental rock outfit only had a handful of records including albums and EPS I think they had one EP the count before this if I if I remember what I read in sort of the background correctly because there is sort of like a little story kind of detailing the album because this is not the most popular or plentiful of records this is actually a recent reissue of this album and I heard this album when I was in a record store in Massachusetts over in Northampton and I also bought some other stuff from them but this record I heard them playing on the stereo and I was like what the hell is this this sounds like some weird experimental spoken word rock that came out in the late 80s that would have been like a huge influence on LCD Soundsystem or something like that sounded like they listened to a lot of Velvet Underground and other noise rock outfits that that I think that I thought at the time actually came before them but no this actually came out in 1970 freaking seven and I mean the the significance of that if you're familiar with punk music and post-punk music will be surprising to you if you give this a listen and it really does not sound like at least some of the songs anyway do not sound like something that would come out of 1977 there are some tracks that really do breathe some of the sounds and the musical rock phrasing of that time but the tracks on here like man on the move or facts facts are songs that are incredibly refreshing and forward-thinking for that time and to think that a band like this came out of Indiana of all places is absolutely insane but yeah like really art experimental noisy post-punk with some really weird eccentric vocals that just border between singing and spoken word again kind of remind me of The Velvet Underground at points but much more you know 1977 I guess I guess you could say some really great songs on this LP and I keep going back to it because yet not only is it sort of forward-thinking for it's time to me but it's just a really creative album if there's one thing I I'm not crazy about with it I think and the the guy who ran the record store was telling me about the mix of the record kind of being changed for this new reissue the vocals are kind of loud which if the mix has been changed for the better with this new LP I would imagine that maybe they were even louder with previous pressings but yeah the vocals are kind of up you know very high in comparison to everything else but still a I don't mind it really good tracks on that LTM xat sound heart attack alright next one of my favorite jazz lp's ran across it for like 12 bucks new pressing it's a nice pressing on Atlantic rolling Kirk the inflated tear even though this is not one of his more avant-garde albums or anything like that this is really kind of a middle-of-the-road go to classic and 4/4 Bop post bop hard bop because of just how strong his playing is and just how great is his sense of melody is from the first track to you know weirder songs on here like mini you know just uh it's it's really the melodies that he plays the sort of stick out in my head as I listen to this album again and again and again and I got the nice old classy old-school label on there and I like that and again it's it's a nice thick pressing it's nice I was listening to it it sounds as pristine as the Daft Punk record really beautiful really clear really lush loving it all right this is another record that I grabbed from that record store that I mentioned in Massachusetts I guess I should name if I didn't name them already feeding tube records this record is actually on their label and they had a ton of records that they had released and I was just sort of perusing through them not really knowing what was what and who was who a lot of the artists local a lot more of them not local but incredibly underground and this is not really a band it's actually a collection of four different musicians and I guess the song titles on this album are cold and burn and I knew just from this album title from the four musicians listed and the fact that there are only two tracks on this full-length LP that I was in for some kind of adventure either I was going to be hearing some kind of intense avant-garde noise piece or it was gonna be drone and lo and behold it was drone and not bad drone or anything like that not overtly electronic it's it's mostly cello violin guitar I believe there's actually some harmonium so it says on here on the back and voice although I guess I need to listen to it a little bit harder I didn't pick up as I was sort of perusing through the two sides any voice right away but the the thickness of the drones seemed mostly to be performed by those string instruments and maybe some light electronics and they are sort of dark they are kind of intense not the best drone I've ever heard of my entire life but but definitely a colorful record and you know I just do enjoy listening to drone albums on vinyl you know really gives you the opportunity to kind of you know really sort of take them in you get that lush sound you get that heaviness from the bass and because it's on vinyl you know you're kind of committing your time to kind of hang it out and listening to the whole thing alright next LP that I bought an EP actually liturgies immortal life this is the EP that they drop before a lot of their full-length albums created by Hunter hunt Hendrix so it says on the front pure transcendental black metal I remember I first heard of this group on the blog gave me tinnitus I think I think they blogged some tracks from this EP nice clear vinyl pressing and while oppressing is in good condition I I like the cover art and you know I like that you know I'm getting a chance to kind of hear the earliest work from what I favorite experimental metal bands right now Oh we're just uh we're gonna continue on this from one of my favorite experimental metal bands out there right now the sound quality of this recording it's not really the pressing it's really the sound quality of the recording it's okay the guitars are mixed together and recorded in just a really sloppy way where they are just laying on top of the drums which are electronic and in a somewhat awkward way the guitars do lack a certain finesse that they have on liturgies later records and the fact that you're hearing electronic drums on here versus the live drums it does kill the vibe just a little bit I think that would have been a lot more intensive the drums had been live like they were on renal ation and their latest record which I do love the hell out of I'm sort of debating on whether or not I'm going to keep this vinyl I'm going to give it a few more lessons really kind of see if if I enjoy it a little bit more or if there's really something that kind of as a fan of liturgy I can get out of it but as of right now I wouldn't really recommend this for anybody who wasn't just sort of hardcore into liturgy while I do realize that maybe you don't really kind of come across this vinyl every day I'm not really crazy about the sound quality of the other recording but still admittedly it's kind of interesting to to sort of see the early stages of what I think are one of the more interesting names in in metal right now and those are some of my favorite recent additions to the record collection at the moment I have more but we'll talk about those in a future vinyl video cool cool thanks for being awesome Anthony Fantana vinyl forever 
jaBYEPoTh8A,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd with my Chia head here to tell you tell you tell you that I am totally endorsing and one two percent for if you get the chance try to see the Swedish metal band ghost or ghost BC they recently came out with a new full-length LP many of you may have caught my review for I will put my review for that album and their first full-length album down here in the description box they played an East Coast date over in Hartford Connecticut at the Webster theater I went over there I saw it and it was great they played fantastically energy was there just the stage performance the drama the theatrical kind of element to ghost was was there in full effect they played after skeleton which they were opening for them skeleton which actually has a new album on the way in October so they said and yeah I just want to come on here make a quick video and just let you guys know that if you want to see a solid metal performance go see ghosts no question if you go check them out definitely they are not really a band that is going to totally just rock out totally get crazy insane on stage or anything like that ghost is a very reserved band they're kind of a quirky creepy band they're really more about the whole theatrical thing coming out in full costume being kind of tongue-in-cheek with their whole Dark Side thing really it's it's about the catchy songs just sounding really great good solid performance they're not exactly a band that is going to totally reinvent their songs live either they played nearly every song and it was a nice mix of songs from their debut and Sonics by their new album they played nearly every song pretty straightforward there were some moments like they played some of the instrumental bits from their new LP songs like Genesis from their first album which is an instrumental piece or even the song death knell where they were taking these instrumental parts and elongating them they could have passed worked out a lot of these parts before the live performances and and that's possible considering just how tight they were throughout the night and and that's really one word that I would use to kind of I guess encapsulate the whole performance it's just tight they were just flawless straight just mmm every single T was crossed every single eye was dotted and even though you know that they're there takes on a lot of these songs was not entirely different from what you're hearing on the record it was still a really enjoyable show because they do sort of add a lot of visual elements to their music with sort of their gestures and their costumes and the interesting backdrop they had which was cloth from what I understand but it looked like you know stained glass and they had lights on behind it and everything like that and as far as songs from the new record if you guys saw my review for ghosts latest album yeah I wasn't crazy about it I prefer their first album hands down across the board I really admired ghosts ambition on their new LP trying to incorporate new musical elements trying to be a little bit longer trying to write these multifaceted songs and to tell you the truth the song sound a lot better live and to kind of hear these songs beefed up a little bit with these latter guitars in person really sort of made them enjoyable for me still if I go back and I listen to the record I'm gonna wish that the guitars were louder you know I'm still going to miss that element but at least it was good in person you know at least I could say they pulled together really solid live performance so again if ghost is playing in your area and like I said earlier understand they're not really a band that's really gonna just light you on fire or anything like that with just going nuts on stage it's it's sort of interesting to see what makes ghosts differ from other metal bands when you have a band like skeleton witch on the stage you know a band that doesn't seem to obsess over every single melodic or chord progression detail on the same way that ghost does but they're a group that nonetheless gets everybody pumped when they hit the stage because they are just oh energy ah-ah-ah if you've caught ghosts live what did you think of him did you love it did you hate it why do you wish that they were a little more animated on stage or is just sort of delivering some slight variations of some really great songs of theirs enough to sort of seal the deal and again if they're playing in your area do check them out Anthony Fantana ghost live forever [Music] you 
YHg5pYYEjRs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new self-titled record from Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros these guys were a California indie rock and indie folk band who in my opinion have had one of the more shocking falls from grace since their debut full-length album release in 2009 and and when I say shocking I mean sort of more in in recent memory back in 2009 when they put out their first full-length up from below it was an album that did not necessarily turn a ton of heads upon its initial release but it had a few nice sleeper hits on it that got people into the band sort of after the fact songs like home really fantastic hit off of this LP a song that is catchy very joyful just jubilant instrumentation that is a mix of folk and rock sounds and the band's really huge instrumental lineup showed with just how gargantuan monstrous their sound was it was like listening to some kind of giant folky Arcade Fire and when I think about that theory or the idea of that in my head I I'm into that but I don't think Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros really carried forward into their later releases to to really kind of capitalize on that potential really reach their full potential actually up from below was far from a perfect album but listening to the band's next full-length here was like watching a director try to put out the sequel to what essentially was a cult film with no budget and half of the original cast everything sounded really rickety on this album from the instrumentation to the performances there just were not a lot of good takes on this LP and I would say the songwriting was just not as concise or succinct or just really straightforward and memorable I just think it's odd that Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros would give up their pop appeal so easily especially considering that their pop appeal was the best thing they had going for them on up from below because when it came to the worlds of indie and indie pop they certainly weren't trailblazing or creating any new sounds or anything like that now with this new self-titled full-length of theirs Edward sharps pop appeal is still out to lunch except this time I feel like the band is is emphasizing that indie folk vibe a little bit less and instead they're they're going for something that feels way more vintage with some extremely tacked on soul and previously Edward sharps music has tipped its hat to the psychedelic 60s but this time around on this LP we're getting acid so guitar solos really thumpy Paul McCartney s bass lines and drums that have a really kind of hollow atmospheric thud to them as if they were being recorded decades upon decades ago instead of sounding authentically vintage I think this self-titled LP sounds more messy and thrown together than here case in point the song in the lion quite possibly the worst mix song you'll hear this year the horns the lead vocals the horribly performed falsetto background vocals and the drums all just completely out of whack and some of these problems aren't even specific to this track consistently I would say the worst thing about this album is Ed sharps voice while his sing was good and and pretty tolerable on previous LPS I would say much of the time on this album when Ed sharp isn't really screaming to reach notes that he doesn't really have he's using this really forced vibrato that gets annoying after a while as I'm listening to this album even though Ed Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros may have some real passion for the folk rock and the pop and the rock of the 60s on this album I feel like them trying to recreate it here is is the equivalent to just watching a Broadway rendition of the 60s the musical 60s versus some bad street performance of it I would say this record is essentially in default answer to a Prairie Home Companion which is incredibly dorky and incredibly hokey show on NPR that dabbles in country folk music a little bit of bluegrass as well but the thing with a home companion is that it's kind of self-aware tongue-in-cheek a lot of the time and I don't really feel that vibe from Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros even though ed sharp can get silly at times on this album like on the song let's get high when he's singing ain't we all just Japanese when we're high I still can't help but feel like this album is is a little serious at points like this I mean if this song was put out in 1963 at best today would be like a novelty song but now it just sounds ridiculous then there's all these references to love needing someone's love giving your love we all have love for one another again trying to recapture this emotional philosophical sort of social sentiment of young people from this era of music that Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros are trying to recreate on this record and this is just one more thing on this album that falls horribly short of sounding like something I can take seriously or really kind of believe in I have to be completely honest and say that this album there isn't much about it I can say that I liked I mean the production was really bad and you know just technically weak the instrumentation again sounded really flat and just bodyless a lot of the time just for some kind of cheap attempt to recreate some dead sonic palette really there were only flashes on this album that that appealed to me like oh this melody here sounds pretty good or this vocal take sounds okay or I like this guitar part here the only emotion that this album really stirred up in me is that it made me want to go listen to Frank Zappa and the mothers were only in it for the money I think after listening to this album maybe I came at least a little close to gaining a quarter of the anger or annoyance that Frank Zappa had for hippies and their social circle when he wrote this LP I'm essentially feeling the light too decent three on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to you you're the best only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantino ed sharp forever you 
RmsKkUKturk,whoo hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a little quick review of the new arca mixtape and-and-and-and this guy has been producing under another name previously but still overall when you count the production he created under that name as well as this name arca he has a pretty short discography however I guess his talent his connections his really forward-thinking production style landed him on the short list of co-producers on the new Kanye West album yeezus now I first heard this guy last year when he prolifically released stretch 1 and stretched - and even though hip hop and wonky and beat music were clearly staple influences for arca it doesn't really seem like on stretch 1 and stretch 2 he enjoys playing by the established rules of the beat production of that genre or really anybody's established rules because a lot of the beats a lot of the rhythms that back up his productions are kind of disjointed they're sputtering their grooves tend to be very angular and kind of all over the place and as far as some of the more melodic samples and the synthesizers on his tracks they come together in a way that that does not really feel harmonious either much of the time his his since and his samples can come off as being more like a jumbled glitchy sound collage and as far as vocals go which which do occasionally appear on his albums it feels like they're thrown into the mix more for a druggie trippy effect than any kind of coherence or meaning or understanding now this new collection of tracks from ARCA has essentially been assembled into this non-stop 25-minute mix it's really hard to explain it's like I'm listening to someone smash an abstract sculpture with a blindfold on and then you're taking the blindfold off of them and you're forcing them to reassemble the structure as like the intro track on this mix not which has these swirling quickly ascending high-pitched lead melodies that are sort of dizzying I love the odd vocal samples that that are cycling over and over and over on the track harness ARCA does really love to take just little vocal snippets and kind of pitch shift them layer them out repeat them over and over step them up and step them down and there are moments on this mix where ARCA comes through with some beets that have a bit of a trap flavor to them with the groove of the bass drum and the twittering high hats though even when he goes for a trap banger style track or a little snippet because these songs do run a little short he still does not play it straightforward he's still really just sort of really messes things up just twists things turns things and make sure that a lot of the high is the samples and the melodies just stay whacked out as hell outside of these trap moments there's spots where it feels like ARCA is observing some cloud wrap aesthetics too there are some electronic sounds that hit me on the 8 minute mark of this mix that feel as if I'm listening to something Autechre had produced even though there is a huge hip-hop influence in Arcas music just like there is a nought ecers music at times he can get really experimental and really cold there's even a moment with some of the weird vocal layering and chorus effects around the 20 minute mark of this mix that hit me as being kind of Shabazz Palaces influenced even though ARCA is clearly influenced by a lot of the more alternative sounds in hip-hop and electronic music today he drives his creative process out into this weird lone desert to the point where it feels like he's not really connected to much of any of it but as I guess sort of one long holistic piece I do think it's really great it's fun it's creative it's challenging and and it's really thought-provoking too as well as just being kind of visceral when it does come through with with with a moment that does feel like it's a banger if you've given this listen and there's a link down there in the description box there's no reason not to listen to it give me a love give me a hate why you know just let me know what you're thinking and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh ARCA [Music] you 
EC9-QwUEaoc,hi everyone Anthony Han Tan oh here the Internet's busy busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new fuck buttons album focus these guys are an experimental music duo whose aesthetic is really really electronic synthetic but their earlier stuff dealt much more and just the noisier more abrasive kind of droney side of things but on their 2009 album tarot sport an album that a lot of people consider to be their breakout LP the duo was bringing in all of these techno influences with these straightforward driving kind of repetitive beats and on top of that the slow-moving chords the slow building nature of all the instrumentation that they were using led to some really epic vibes as well and even though I appreciate this side of fuck buttons music I appreciate that they try to create that sensation with their music ultimately it's their writing and it's sort of the the pace or rather the stillness of their music that kind of kills me melodically just compositionally I find a lot of the tracks to be really dull just cycling through the same chords and and melodic phrases again and again and again really with with not enough variation to make the songs interesting from front to back because for sure the songs that they write do catch my ear at the start of the track for me most of the time it seems like the only changes that they're interested in are making things louder making things softer or just adding more melodic elements to this sonic pig pile and it's it's just confusing to me that fuck buttons would take this structural and melodic approach with their songs time and time and time again because they're so great and meticulous when it comes to finding sounds and just finding interesting textures if you would work this hard to grab the most interesting sounds that you could find sounds that a lot of people are not toying with why would your music writing approach be so obvious really is obvious as a bad post rock song I will say the slow focus does bring a little more are detailed to the table though than Tarot sport did fuck buttons does layer their tracks a little bit more the drones feel a bit more massive there are a few shorter tracks on here that I like quite a bit that feature these really fast arpeggios they feel like they could have been in some kind of 80s sci-fi progressive synth soundtrack even though there are elements of this album that add more character to fuck button style I still can't help but feel like progression of their songs is is still not a strong point and slow focus does try to imply this progression by just piling one looping snippet of sound on top of another looping snippet of sound to a higher degree than they did on their last album but I feel like all this has done is just dull the pain of the monotony that typically comes through on their tracks I would say the worst offender in this sense is the last track on the album hidden excess the longest song on slow focus opts for what are probably the blandest chords on the entire LP and this set of chords which which aren't even interesting at the start of the song just continue again and again and again and again from beginning to end on this track getting louder and louder and louder in this sort of boring melodic lead that's that's descending again I just feel like there's very little personality to the melodies and the chords that fuck buttons writes into their songs and and when I listen to a song like this I feel like no wonder there's not that much significant change to the music over the course of a 10 minute song when this is your main theme for sure on this track and others energy is their sound is their groove is their but the melody just seems like this incredibly neglected afterthought and I know that melody isn't really a strong point on on numerous albums that I may enjoy or in different styles of music but it seems like the melody is something that is being showcased on these tracks or is at least trying to play a pivotal role in what makes these songs what they are while fuck buttons does deal in a lot of noise and a lot of drones they do take the time to write chord progressions and the chord Russians they do use are really clear and in your face and very audible the court progression on the opening track your brain freeze feels just as uninspired in a lot of ways but fuck buttons does manage to work in some kind of bee and melodic change up on the second half of the song which which does keep it kind of interesting maybe the tracks the Red Wing and sentient SAR my favorites on this LP though they do tend to be as repetitive as some of the other tracks on this album they do work with some really out there sounds Red Wing has some really interview I just love the character of some of the synth sounds and just the the groove on this track and and sentient has a bit of an industrial vibe to it I would say really metallic really sort of nocturnal dark there's something about these tracks that kind of makes me feel like I'm listening to a coherent Black Dice song but in the case of the Red Wing you have all these high-pitched ethereal just ringing droning out synthesizer notes that that have a bit of a thinness to them that makes me feel like I'm listening to some just tremolo picked post-rock guitars I wish it changed up more but it still does have a bit of an epic feel to it and beyond that there's not much more I can say about this LP the things that are really likable about this album are blatantly obvious I mean you've got the great grooves you've got the interesting drum sounds and synthesizer sounds odd noisy distorted electronics again there's a lot of personality there's a lot of character to the sounds the fuck buttons works into their tracks but consistently I'm just really unimpressed with the way that they progress their sounds I'm feeling a decent too strong sex on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what should I review next and that's it I want to give a shout out to Alexander 180k thank you Rick Moranis good luck on your new album and this dude here's a straw only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan oh fuck buttons [Music] 
Pkat6FdK-oU,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest the zik nerd and it's time for a review of the new stone Titan album scratch-and-sniff this is the debut full-length LP of the Connecticut rock trio stone Titan who after a handful of years of DIY touring doing some splits 7-inch single putting out some self-produced eps and demos they have stepped up to the plate with what I guess is an album it's just about 28 minutes maybe a little bit less if you cut out the string of time before the end of the last track and the secret track I wouldn't quite call it an EP but I guess it's a mini album either way we have eight tracks here which are of a serious sonic extreme to the point where the band can be a little just heavy-handed one-dimensional but they feel completely aware of this and don't overdo it which is sort of a breath of fresh air considering that a lot of bands that tend to go very slow and heavy also go pretty long and get a little indulgence and stone Titan this heavy and they are loud but rarely are they brooding and looming and just really really the bands approach to sludge metal is actually really noisy and chaotic and has sort of a punk ferocity to it it's absolutely filthy as well it's about as gutter as a rat carcass floating in a puddle of piss with some pretty clear influences coming from bands like buzz of and I hate God some of the earlier and and more noisy sounds to come from The Melvins maybe a little bit of torches hanging in there as well but without the pop sensibility Oh God with none of the pop sensibility and I say no pop sensibility because I think there is very little about stone Titans delivery and performance on this record that feels and and I'm completely fine with that I like it it's not like the playing on this album is loose though the guitar or the bass guitar and the drums are all very tight but man is the energy on this album wild and worthless so much energy is expelled into creating this just heavy disgusting display of sludge metal that I'm surprised any of it is coherent it's like stone Titan is just going sludge metal Super Saiyan on numerous tracks here with if if it's risks that are just so distorted they feel burnt to a crisp blackened by the Sun laying on asphalt waiting to just be picked up by whoever picks up roadkill that's exactly the vibe I get on the opening track here I wish I was dead where the vocals in addition to the guitars are very loud and harsh in sound and sentiment that's even more so the case over the track groovy warhead commander where the band is layered one vocal on top of another vocal on top of another vocal a technique that the band also kind of does over the track miles away from sober I mean it's it's really a lot of voices going even though there is plenty of hate out there in the world I like that there's a metal band that is leaving room for statements that are incredibly spiteful and borderline absurd with their over-the-top aggression and gross Ness I mean look at the freaking cover it's a guy cutting his wrists and rainbows are coming out and all sorts of weird disgusting figures hanging inside of the rainbows it's not exactly like you could say the band takes itself too seriously when one of its song titles is Alaskan Thunder  this absurd side of their character is is something I would love to see emphasized in the future now not only are the tracks on this LP fast and tense and heavy but they have a tendency to run kind of psychedelic to just shoving some really weird and abrasive details into the bassy muck that is displayed on a majority of the songs here and some of these details can come through the way of de tar embellishments or drum fills some feedback weird vocalizations and these can be expressed in in a kind pretty and melodic and blissful way like on the song Alaskan Thunder or in an incredibly harsh and aggressive way like the track can of worms and even though the structure does help the songs along and makes them interesting to listen to I would say that stone Titan is miles away from not only being sober but creating some traditional kind of songwriting which is fine the trio really sort of concentrates a lot more on just pure nasarah which they do really well and and again I commend the band for making an album that doesn't go too long considering how hard and fast that they go for much of this thing but I still wish it was longer but with a little more variety again if a band was only going to be this direct 25 or 28 minutes is a decent time length and there is at least some semblance of variety in this very short display of extremes on scratch-and-sniff I just think if they're gonna come out with more records and if they're gonna put out longer records into the future they should find at least some kind of alternative to their high volume mayhem or at least find some other higher volume of mayhem that would make them even more fun to listen to I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing if you've given to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to oh f talk and live Chris ah and Josh from red scroll only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana stone Titan forever 
3YCde5yysF8,[Music] it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about music and in this track review we're talking about a brand new track from california rapper Hobson the dude is a double XL freshman who's amassed some huge hype over a very short period of time with some multitrack projects yes but mostly his ill mind of Hopsin song series and as he's been releasing more singles under this ill mind of Hopsin title he's been trending more and more and more toward this social conscious deep lyrical theme with ill mind of Hopsin for he was throwing up disses to tyler the creator fake rappers out there why he is an alternative and sort of a savior to hip-hop right now throwing out lots of funny punchlines while making fun of his fans a little bit and casting himself as a social outcast and then there is ill mind of Hopsin v which was kind of a trio of critiques one verse making fun of dudes that are essentially partying pot smoking motivation list losers with the following verses making fun of girls who want that perfect guy that Romeo but they can't seem to find him because of their own bad decisions and black people who sort of seem to take to that thug in lifestyle now I like the song and some of the advice or morals that Hopsin portrays in this track feels sensible but a lot of what he says in my opinion feels fueled more by just some kind of personal bitterness as opposed to some kind of wish to enlighten people or help people out especially on the last two verses it's like he's had a lot of run-ins with guys who have turned to that thug lifestyle and makes his third verse a little bit more about race than it is these social pressures that make somebody into that kind of person addressing those kinds of pressures is what makes an album like good kid maad city so fantastic and Hobson's failure to understand or at least display some kind of understanding of the way all of these cogs work together makes him an emcee I can only take so seriously take a listen to the rebuttal that New York emcee my son did to that Hopson track addressing the third verse specifically and going into all the details that make somebody that kind of person and again with this new track of Hobson's I don't really feel like he's addressing larger issues again we're given the situation where Hopson is an emotional pain he's upset a friend of his is essentially losing his life to a drug addiction he does meth it destroys his life his friend's lives his family's lives and Hopson has all of these memories of the past that him and his friend have together too and this song despite the fact that a drug addiction is is really a life changing thing doesn't go much deeper than this really honestly it needs to if the kind of cursory storytelling that Hopson displays in this track worked nobody would do drugs the thing is tons of people do drugs every day and lots of people put their lives at risk every day all because there are pressures at work here outside of wanting to be cool or doing a hip drug even with all the attention around crystal meth right now with fantastic TV shows like breaking bad I'm yet to run into anyone that thinks that doing crystal meth is cool or hip nobody is doing meth to get into the meth social circle I think the best things about this tracker not only hopson's flow which is always solid but some of the details here and there that he delivers having to do with his relationship with his friend and kind of having those self doubts where he's thinking himself could I have stopped him could I have prevented this what could I have done instead of going deeper into this Hobson essentially lays all the blame on his friend and is really angry and bitter about it again that bitterness kind of preventing him from asking those bigger questions instead he gets nostalgic about rapping with him playing Nintendo 64 with him and while that does make it emotionally engaging in a sense it also sort of makes it feel like a PSA which has just a hint of fakeness to it but I don't suspect that the song is fake considering that this isn't the first time hops has tried to address this subject matter in a track he had a previous song crystal-meth but maybe the thing is Hopson kind of backs off on some of these details and doesn't really go crazy about the storytelling because he knows that the music video is going to be paired with the song and that will certainly help along with making what is going on with this track kind of connect with people which is fine and I guess as a total package deal song and music video together ill mind of Hopsin six isn't really bad but it's not a song that I would just listen to or be moved by just on its own especially considering how kind of flat and generic and synthesized an old-school Eminem esque the instrumental is and the hook get me back my home app I gotta say I'm just really kind of left out in the cold on sex while I see that this track is the most personal he's delivered so far in this ill mind of Hopsin series if it feels like a lot of the bitterness that hops and harbours in his tracks gets in the way of making some lyrics that are actually interesting and get people thinking if you've given this track a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana ill mind of Hopsin forever [Music] [Music] 
_MGNJbLc1wI,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new let live album the blackest beautiful let live California rock band who for a few albums now have been bringing together elements of punk music metal music post hardcore on top of that maybe some modern pop punk flavors as well which did play a pretty notable role on their previous LP through some of the vocal harmonies the really hooky choruses but still with a lot of very just uh aggressive riff äj-- just shut the up kind of riffs there was an undeniable ferocity to this LP let live is a really energetic band that I think asks a lot of energy from its listeners and and there are a few things in their sound that display that more than the vocals which for the most part are screamed and are really high volume relentless impassioned put those together with really fast and tight playing with the guitars and the drums and somebody listening to this is bound to get hyped up now personally I do find let lives sound in just the way that they deliver their songs to be a little too clean for me a little too clean in comparison with some of my favorite post hardcore records out there however I wouldn't really say that they're up there with some of the more melodramatic poppy and kind of spic and span bands in the genre I don't know asking alexandria and even though that's not the case I got to say I feel like let live is moving a little bit further in that direction with the black is beautiful oddly enough though I don't really feel like the band has gotten any less aggressive on this LP their frontman Jason Butler feels just as intense as he did on the band's last full-length he's spazzing out on nearly every track here his shouts and his screams feel really throaty and when he goes for more of a tone down spoken word kind of vibe he feels really emotive kind of eccentric over-the-top I think he has a ton of personality as a frontman even if sometimes lyrics don't really move me or anything like that even if I may agree with them to a slight degree the American got him in his second de Dix of cooperations despite statements like that I can't help but feel like the sound that let live presents at times feels a tad bit corporate for one the really clean and robotic and pristine vocal harmonies that are used on almost every track on this LP feel more than ever as if they're being used just for accessibility purposes because they certainly don't sound that great for anybody that wants to just hear a raw natural real human voice it feels really fake and obnoxious it's like the kind of studio trickery that a really bad glam metal band would use or even a new metal band their spots were butler's vocalizations make me imagine him as like a tiny David Draiman I'm just torn on his performances because for the most part I feel like he is the most interesting thing this album has to offer because of his energy and because of his passion aside from Anthony Rivera on drums who actually has a fantastic drum break on the track the fear fever but consistently throughout the album his grooves his his tightness his speed and his detail are all really impressive even though Butler seems like an incredibly capable singer obviously that's the case from let Liv's previous LP every time he tries to do something that seems to stick out on here it just makes me cringe a little bit like the start of the track white America soda Mack Vince or the the really sort of overacted and whimpering vocals on the closer especially as he's kind of talking about taking his own life and kind of laughing to himself for the very back end of the track as if this is like some kind of display of psychosis or maybe he's being maniacal I'm I'm not sure I just feel ambivalent toward most of the emotions that let live just throws up in the lyrics to be completely honest and and I don't think the band is necessarily over emotive I get that post-hardcore is music that has a lot of links to emo music and other very expressive forms of punk my issue is that I just really can't say there's much of anything about let lives approach that feels fresh for sure their intensity makes it adequate the performances on this record are really tight the production of post-production I feel I've essentially given us a record that is really heavy and technically flawless the band plays well and in some of their more sporadic moments they remind me of groups like blood brothers or the refused and as much as I like the spots on this album that remind me of those groups the more that I think about it and the more that I listen to this the more this album feels like just an unapologetically poppy bastardization of the sounds the influences and I don't really have anything against perfection or accessibility for sure everything on the new Queens of the Stone Age record shows up on time so to speak but that album even though it's catchy it's it's somewhat subversive in its in its really moody emotions on the blackest beautiful let live definitely comes off as fast and abrasive but it's almost kind of misleading because once you dig past that I feel like I'm listening to these kind of basic but sped up rock ballads which lyrically a lot of the time I feel like are just trying to plug into these really vague appeals to emotional emptiness or some kind of discontent with the world at large truth be told even though there wasn't much on this record that offended me or that I really disliked aside from just the really cold sounding background vocals a lot of it was just kind of dull for me again I like the sound I think the production is is top-notch but the songwriting just really didn't do much of anything for me I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to my dog nori get better you're literally my dog only the strongest subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana let live forever [Music] [Music] 
VZ2VfOOAyow,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a chilled-out review of the new Lycus album tempest these guys were metal outfit from the west coast they've been around for several years but this is their first big studio recorded commercial full-length release the band actually features an ex member of the group death heaven for those of you who are huge into the records sunbather you might want to check this album out as well but it's not as if Lycus or tempest have that much bearing in the experimental black metal or progressive black metal black gaze world still I would say this record is a a forward-thinking and very melodic and engaging approach to the style of metal that this band does play very slow dirge like funeral doom metal metal songs in this style feature tempos that that move like the seasons monolithic riffs that have an epic sound and melodies that are incredibly mournful and just have the strong sense of sadness pretty much the styles defining characteristics since the 90s when it was molded by bands like thier gathon and funeral as well as esoteric a recent ban to catch a lot of attention playing in this style has been a hab if you count about 6 years ago as being recent like it seems really conscious of this genres past but they want to keep things interesting and modern as well as slow as this band songs are they add a lot of detail and progressions into the mix really justifying the long lengths of the three tracks here that are 9 11 and 20 minutes there's endlessly flowing melodies throughout this LP a lot of them executed by guitar leads sometimes they're layered and harmonized in a beautiful way tons of dramatic drum fills and expressive guitar chords that remind me of chord progressions that I've heard on records like wolves and the throne rooms to hunters or even that new pallbearer record plus there are plenty of peaks and valleys as these songs go from beginning to end I take the vocals on the selfie too I wish it was more variety to them but just these monstrous growls front pretty much every track here that combined together with the melody and just the sloth-like pace of these songs I feel like I'm listening to slowed down death metal power ballads it's skulls and rock horns and corpses and lighters in a way the music on this LP is is just reflective of the Paulo Girardi oil painting that is slapped on the cover it's just a really gruesome display but it's the very melodic coloring that gives these grim edges flavor and depth and emotion there isn't much on tempest that I would say is catchy you're not really gonna commit much of this album to memory if you're just giving it a cursory listen I would say that's because this is more of an album to just get lost in and that's easy to do with just how huge this sound Lycus presents is on top of the fact that the melodies on this LP on these songs are constantly shifting but they occur and just sort of blossom at this very slow pace that keeps them engaging but also makes them sort of easy to take in even though these songs are just constantly winding there's details and and I guess variety on these tracks but but not so much it's dizzying even as the band layers on more guitars throws in more background vocals or even put strings which they do at several phases in these songs the opening track on this LP coma Byrne opens up with these minor toned harmonious chords that are just loud distorted blaring they just have this massive sound there's a ton of bass in this mix and then even though it's incredibly heavy it's not like this pummeling or overwhelming heaviness really it's more of an enveloping heaviness it's just vast it's open the more I listen to this record the more it feels like I'm sinking down into a swamp and the deeper down I go the more layers sort of pile on top of me one guitar on top of another guitar more vocals more bass the strings and what's so awesome is that this record is so freaking loud and yet all of these things are balanced really nicely in the mix later into the song coma burn you get these double bass drums and these harsher vocals it's really a visceral point on this track a blood pumping point especially with the tremolo pick Qatar's on this spot in the song thunderous riffs come later after this and the way that some of the chords resolved that the band is playing here at the end of the track it almost feels kind of uplifting or even positive as varied as some of these songs are when you listen to them closely that's one thing that I wish these tracks have a little bit more of not only that just positive beauty but those more just adrenaline fed moments most of this record shoots for an epically dreary vibe and that's fine because the band does incredibly well I just wish there were more visceral spots because it definitely would have given this LP a bit more of a flow because while I do enjoy the three tracks here a lot I don't really feel like I'm on a journey from beginning to end with the album but for sure each track in itself feels like a trip even the slower and more melodically layered track engravings the second song here even though it is a bit shorter than the opener and and it doesn't really have a hard hitting spot and it's nine minute runtime I think it may be my favourite track here just because of how beautiful some of the guitar phrasing is and the clothes are on here while it does end with with a seven minute drone which which I guess in a sense is giving this album some kind of closure it is really hypnotic spot on the LP and it does kind of provide some cool down time to make me feel like okay this is done but I I wouldn't necessarily say that the song is is any more epic or climactic than the two previous tracks I still think the heavy riffs and a lot of the guitar phrasing in the middle of the track are great and I do love the intro which feels very Grails like with its echo drenched guitars which are just shimmering and have a bit of a desert vibe to them I just wish the band did something a little bit more radical to it I do think in a sense they were conscious of the the either the limitations are just the very few elements that they were working with on these songs and they didn't want to overdo it or anything like that and only offered really just 40 minutes of music which if you're talking about metal of the style it's not really like Lycus is asking that much from the listener I guess aside from the playing and the melody writing the thing that can commend this album foremost is taking these ideas that that would normally require a listener to be really really patient and in a way sort of condense them down into a very succinct funeral doom metal record I'm feeling ad sense of strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Austin young lean and Milady's bread only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana tempest Lycus forever 
xNS2lFLHedE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new yung lean mixtape album unknown death mm - you got prey my hand is bread my hand is bread my hands are bread there's bread my hands are bread there's bread my hands are bread bread my hands are bread bread my hands are Brad my hands are [Music] [Music] 
bRJAsAzwuJE,new ducks hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here just want to make a really quick video letting you know that there are a few tracks out right now that I'm really enjoying I have linked a lot of them down there in the description box but maybe the one they're really the one that is the most recent that I've been digging on a lot is the new friggin Earl Sweatshirt track the dude Odd Future member West Coast rapper has a new full-length LP titled Doris coming out on Columbia Records this is the latest song and music video to drop from this new collection of tracks and even though I've liked every single song up until this point I actually think this one is maybe the best that he's dropped so far actually reminds me a lot of not only his older stuff on his original Earl mixtape but also maybe some early title the Creator stuff too I mean what I liked so much about Yonkers even though I didn't love the single when it initially came out but what I loved especially even more about bastard is that it's a record that feels very young its record that feels very dark and introspective I feel that that's something Tyler has drifted away from a little bit ever since he put out bastard I think he's returned to it in a sense on his latest record but man is this new track of Earl's just rife with this feeling again I have liked every song girls put out from this record up until this point with this song maybe being the best so far and actually some really great contributions from vince staples as well as Casey Veggies on here two features that I think are two of the best features I've ever heard them do on an odd future related track I'm especially loving Earl's word play on his bars the Jekyll and Hyde line caught me you might need to think about it twice to get it fully really maybe the weakest thing about this track is the instrumental and that isn't even that bad it's very basic but it does set a dark tone if you've given this track a listen what did you think of it loved it hated why and let me know if you're looking forward to Doris Anthony Fantana Earl forever [Music] [Music] 
JbNpHx9cX3I,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd doing a quick review of the new Milo EP mixtape project cavalcade if you've been a longtime viewer of this channel I don't think I need to catch you up on exactly who milo is he is a Wisconsin rapper he's dropped some projects that I have enjoyed over the past few years like I wish my brother Rob was here or the two EPs that he dropped far far earlier this year things that happen today things that happen at night I told you guys in an earlier favorite releases of 2013 so far video that things that happen today may potentially be my favorite hip hop EP of this year if not just my favorite EP period he has moved quickly on to his next project it's it's called cavalcade he's working again with things that happen a day producer Riley Lake Riley's production in in my opinion comes off as being really layered thematic kind of conceptual and I think that Milo's lyrics show off those tendencies even more when he's on Riley's production now from what I understand a lot of the songs on this record are inspired by some personal tragedy for Milo as well as his grandfather and from what I read are one of his grandfather's favorite musical acts the band America whose music is sampled constantly throughout this project now the production on things that happen today was was really colorful and and modern and forward-thinking but I think that the beats on cavalcade take in almost trippy psychedelic turn like the opener on this LP geometry and theology it kicks off with this America sample the song a horse with no name actually it has the the very kind of somber vocal kicking the track off and eventually the fiddles the winding fiddle playing gets manipulated not only is it playing against these guitars but later it's kind of throbbing and pulsating and waving wildly and Milo's rapping over the track pretty passionately and he's got this chipmunk version of his voice playing against his voice on top of it with this on top of the samples and the kind of subtle percussion it's really dense track I would say almost cluttered in a way of course Milo's lyrics what I was hearing of them are very philosophically loaded he's dealing with issues on this track like ego as well as purpose language and what it all kind of boils down to is that Milo is using a lot of these references and a lot of these philosophical ideas to just convey some really basic human emotions there are points on this track and others to where Milo comes off as being very insecure very kind of confused about his present his future one moment on cavalcade he's talking about creating this weird art piece made of papsmear yeast and bloggers called it his masterpiece he compares his rap notebook to flowers at Algernon which I guess if you're familiar with the book you can kind of liken that to sort of a progression since Milo sees himself as as getting better writing rap songs but a very rough start I guesses is is what he's trying to say came from this notebook again look up the book flowers for Algernon there's also another line where Milo is saying that he dedicated his life to mining pyrite basically you know writing fake gold or at least that's what it felt like to me and there are moments where where in his own sort of dorky weird funny way he's bragging about what he's doing and how he's making it doing what he's doing in a sense where he's talking about how he's running this art rap game right now but it's a boondoggle there's one moment where he's talking about buying audiobooks with rap money's drowning out poopie rap songs with them this is the second track on the album which actually fades pretty seamlessly into the third song on this LP which I do like a lot of this tape does feel incredibly cohesive even the songs that I don't really care for feel linked in and just inseparable from from the songs that I do like this next track though red oleanders maybe is is easily my least favorite on this tape and it really has nothing to do with Milo or Riley Milo's versus to me are fine I don't really have an issue with anything he says and then something that's really interesting toward the end of this track is that there's a beat change up and Milo is sort of legit flowing on on this song a lot of people sort of criticize him for his weird chopped up Spacey semi spoken word rap style which I do like a lot he was rapping a little bit more straightforward like on his my brother rob was here mixtape and now he's kind of getting back to that a little bit more here at a few moments and actually doing it better but III digress to get back to read oleanders really for me it's it's bus driver that just ruins the chorus of this track and really just the song in general his singing to me is like supreme shower singing just like not really a stronghold of pitch just the way he sings hurts my ears and and it's it's all in the throat up here in the closing track on here not one of my lows best courses as well but still I I do appreciate the adventure that he tries to deliver on this track not only are his verses still very heady and very odd but his flow on the song seemed so comfortable and he's able to kind of maintain the same delivery that he does on a lot of tracks that it's almost not obvious that the song is in three four riley lakes sampling very nimble sampling of acoustic guitars on the song too is very nice also on the track I am I am Riley really shows off his production prowess Milo does have a verse on this track although it's a short one the song is mostly an instrumental a really interesting and twisted hip-hop take bringing the trademark Suzanne Vega do-do-do-do dude together with more America samples then toward the back end it just makes this sudden change into more of a future garage thing it really shows off how much James Blake really kind of influences what Riley Lake does how well he pulls together the James Blake sample from the song retrograde is just another breadcrumb in in that trail of influence in that trail of admiration the the lion does feel a little padded out at times with all of these people talking here people talking there this snippet from here this snippet from there it's not necessarily a bad thing because I do like a lot of the quotes that are played and I feel like it does kind of give context to the kind of things that Milo will be attacking in his verses even though they are really abstract really Reilly Lake to me sticks out more as as being the person on this mixtape who is like ah surprise I'm doing this now can you believe it which is fine because it's led to some great beats on this thing but I have to say there are moments where I feel like Milo is a little overshadowed not only by how fantastic some of the instrumentals are but almost by the overwhelming amount of effects that are used on some of these tracks especially the first two I ended up liking this tape quite a bit not quite as much as things that happen a day are things that happen at night but I wouldn't say it was quite in the disappointment that I felt Milo takes baths was when I first originally listened to that if you've given cavalcade to listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Milo Reilly Lake cavalcade forever 
G_sH1C5MjzQ,Miriam the believer hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new LP blood donation for miriam the believer you and me both Mary I wish you would bleed to death Miriam the believer or Miriam well Anton is a singer-songwriter guitarist star vocalist and one half of the eccentric Swedish musical duo wild birds and peace drums a project that she's been in for quite a while now with her husband Andrea swirl in wild birds and peace drums have put out handful of LPS and EPS since they started putting out studio material in 2007 a lot of the track songs and releases being sort of stripped back instrumentally featuring for the most part and Riis's drums as well as Merriam's vocals which I understand sort of sounds boring on paper but the thing is these two are actually really really skilled musicians with enough chops to keep these instrumentally stripped-back songs really interesting Miriam and her husband play with with quite a bit of intensity on some of these wild birds and peace drums songs and even though that is sort of a thrill to hear a thrill to experience it doesn't really add up much into sort of traditional coherent songwriting mostly because that's not what they're going for a lot of the time even as they work to incorporate more musical instrumentation and layers into their subsequent albums this new record of Merriam's though is a move toward the accessible maybe not a pop album sometimes an art pop album but overall just much smoother in terms of delivering accessible melodies and and just straightforward chord progressions Merriam's vocals are still rife with with personality and some really bold vocalizations and her husband's drumming is on this album as well but both of them feel relatively reserved in comparison to the wild birds and piece drums material probably in an effort to deliver some songs that are easier on the ears and allow the other instrumentation the guitar the synthesizers the bass to make it into the mix and sort of effectively play the roles that they have to play yes Miriam and her husband are sounding less bombastic but I'm still catching a lot of the stylistic influences that that you would catch on a wild birds project the soul music is here the jazz the rock but it's all sort of delivered with this more easygoing slightly eerie and in dark tinge rather than wild and free Miriam comes off feeling very alluring and moody on these tracks Merriam's vocals and the rest of the instrumentation are recorded and and produced to sound a little cavernous reverb II kind of distant but still there's an intimacy there on these tracks and everything comes in really clear especially Merriam's vocals and there are moments where Marian's voice sort of reminds me of the vocals of other artists maybe Victoria LeGrande from beach house on the track the string of everything one of the slower more dream pop influenced tracks on this album really jangly shimmering guitars on this song and Miriam seems to be reaching into these just low bellowing notes that remind me of Victoria's singing but of course throughout this track and many others Miriam proves herself to be much more of a nimble vocalist when she reaches into her upper register I hear slight flashes of Kate Bush there are moments where the the very mysterious vibe of this album remind me of Chelsea Wolf's last full-length LP but Merriam's volume her very commanding cadence and her jazzy phrasing with her vocals really sort of put her on a pedestal of her own now as far as the songwriting goes on this LP it is varied it's memorable and it's emotionally moving in about every direction Miriam tries to go in the opening track on your blood donation shimmering guitars marching drums and an anon chorus serve as a really theatrical backdrop for Merriam's fantastic vocal improv that track and others on here have some really smooth easy transitions between the verses and the choruses like the song the string of everything or the track first haiku one of the longer songs on here in Dubuque moving ballad really sweet slow pace and melody on this track and a wonderfully gorgeous sack solo to finish it all off there are several interlude tracks on the selfie as well and on the flip side of these more easygoing songs there are tracks that are still accessible but seem to work more in phases songs like dead meat which slows down speeds up changes groove over the course of shifting from a verse to a chorus and what also feels like a second chorus we have one course where Miriam is just reaching at the top of her vocal range and and shouting dead the other phases is more toned down but just as moving where Miriam is singing that everything she knows and feels is stuck and spiderweb I love the chord progression on this track - and the song invisible giving the longest track on this LP is maybe the most multi-phased on the entire LP it is a dark epic which kicks off with this incredibly fast and rhythmic drumming and guitar strumming the beginning also starts off with this murky bass line and with all this sort of subtle instrumentation Merriam's voices like this huge lightning bolt crashing down and the middle smack dab in the middle of the black black skyline and it's this boldness and it's this contrast that makes the song so engaging from beginning to end as it's changing from one idea to the next now for the wild birds and peace drums fan there are a few tracks on here that do sort of harken back to that stuff but do also blend into the tracklist of this album pretty nicely songs like somewhere else where Miriam is singing leave but also during her background vocals if you can call them that it's like she's recorded her lead vocals then recorded these just high-pitched howls and shouts with this sort of low five fuzzy clipping recording and it's like these vocals are placed or even sampled and just sort of played throughout the track as she's singing against them I'm loving the hard fast flamenco style groove on this track - as well as the swirling synth arpeggios and the song above the world has one of the kookiest sort of percussion sections on this entire album something I could totally see in the background of a birdsong now there are a few downsides on this I mean for one the interlude songs don't exactly wow me but they don't exactly tease me either making me feel like oh this needed to be longer and there are a few songs that I wish were a little more eventful like the track to belong or to let go one of the jazzier songs on the album with its groove and it's bass line which are very slow very smoky Merriam's vocalizations over the track are pretty the song does meet an abrupt end but still it's it's not like it really reaches a climax over the course of the song and the closure is somewhat anticlimactic as well even though miriam does do well on some of these more linear flowing songs these just for me are not two of the best still on this record I got to say overall Miriam has essentially proven herself to be a really captivating worthwhile and incapable songwriter and on top of that what what has already been known about her from previous musical efforts is that she's a fantastic singer with a voice that is a ton of personality as well as melodic sensibility and emotion considering how exuberant wild birds and piece drums records are it's not surprising that blood donation is exuberant as well just in a slightly darker way I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review has been my opinion if you don't like it here is a straw I want to give a shout out to man man good luck with your new single in your new album grand theft auto 5 I love that gameplay trailer Jeremy he's awesome and the Connecticut state judicial system please allow me to shift my jury duty dates far into the future so that it does not interrupt a few things that I've got going on right now please only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana marrying the believer forever you 
Nqel2VI24cI,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd eating some candy wondering a question in my brain sort of curious about what you guys think about the phrase bad taste in the music world we hear this phrase thrown around quite a bit when people who are huge into music are sort of talking shooting the discussing music someone doesn't like a band that somebody else likes or somebody likes a band somebody else hates and all of a sudden this person gets categorized as having bad taste now I personally find the idea or the concept of there being such a thing as a musical tastes to be very interesting for me taste with music or tasting music should be a lot like tasting food you should be able to distinctive fie different musical characteristics using your ears using your auditory taste you should be able to tell if something is loud or distorted or subtle you should be able to tell the difference between the Tambor's and the characteristics of different musical instruments you should be able to tell the difference between a kick drum and a bongo you should be able to tell the difference between a piano or a glockenspiel or a guitar and a lute why not use the word taste as a swap out for identify listening to a piece of music you can tell me what genre it is you can talk to me about the quality of the vocals you can tell whether or not the chords or the melodies are ascending or descending what the instruments are that have been recorded those kinds of things to me would be a reflection of good and accurate taste this other tastes that people typically use is just another way for people to give other people a hard time for not liking the same music that they like and I don't necessarily think that listening to popular music or what some snobbish people perceive to be bad music is a definer of bad taste you can listen to nothing but top 40 radio as well as maybe top 40 country music and I don't know what else you want to make fun of or slag and whatnot you can listen to all of those things but if you're listening closely enough and you can distinct if I the bass from the drums and the vocals and the sense pull all these things together analyze each of them in your head and you can actually tell the difference between different songs that you're listening to then maybe you have good taste I actually associate taste with with maybe the depth that you're listening to something versus what you're actually listening to some people when they are tasting with their mouths and eating they just whoop down the food that they're eating they don't even chew it they don't even remember what it tasted like and is just digesting in their stomach almost completely whole because they never really took the time to enjoy using this magical taste receptor that we have in our mouths called the tongue if you're putting on music and you're just listening to it in the background or all you like is the melody or all you like is the lyrics and that's all you're really paying attention to then you're not really listening that deeply into the song or the piece of music that you have on and if you're not trying to listen in and get those deeper flavors and deeper meanings and understandings from the music that you're listening to then maybe I would say that that your taste is bad or your taste is just cursory but that's what I think about taste and what musical taste is and maybe what musical taste should be and yeah what do you think let me know tell me please Anthony Fantana bad taste good taste forever [Music] you you 
dx0GKBjt8io,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hairs growing in and it's time for a review of the new ghost poet album Samus o so as some say I so I say light this is the sophomore full-length LP from this uk-based rapper I first heard of him back in 2011 through the album peanut butter blues and melancholy Jam I wasn't huge on the LP but nonetheless I did kind of see it as this recent rise where I saw it as a part of this recent rise in alternative forms of hip hop artist alternative flavors and new faces in hip hop people like Danny Brown Shabazz Palaces Kendrick Lamar Milo Death Grips ASAP Rocky in Action Bronson 2 Action Bronson didn't start that you're a lot of the people who I just listed didn't start that year but they did come out with notable records that year that did manage to catch a lot of attention and for sure ghost poet had his own sort of approach that made him worth noting he had a lot of atmospheric beats on this LP a really sort of slow understated somewhat whispered flow vocal delivery to be honest ghost poet felt a lot more like a ghost than he did a poet considering just how obscured he was and and how hard it was to make out some of what he was saying in these tracks his really understated flow and his voice which was kind of smudged by effects and then some really low mixing for me personally made him come off much less than gripping I still admired his will to experiment though I was hoping that his next album would catch my ears a little bit more and I I guess I could say in a way that this sophomore album has though I'm not really in love with it for one ghost poet does diversify his sound his his vocal style his instrumentals with some beats on here that do feel hip-hop influenced but are much more electronic tracks on here have a pretty huge future Garage influences well with the instrumental a few moments here I would actually say our reminiscent of and furthermore some tracks like plastic bag brain the instrumental there it's it's essentially just a rock song instrumental a subtle Rock instrumental but still a rock instrumental now as far as ghost poets voice he's much more front-and-center much more audible his lyrics intelligible his emotions sort of tangible however after giving this LP a listen I can't really say maybe better production and just clearer vocals were what ghost poet needed if anything this album is is lacking a captivating vocal performance and and lyrics to back that up one track after another ghost poet delivers these haphazard sort of boring vocalizations he they just sound sort of silly at times and and for many tracks here as well he seems to be singing with this forcefully lethargic attitude it's like he's really too tired to put the emotion necessary to captivate an audience into his singing and it's not like he tries to hide his listless attitude for sure it's it's decidedly this way with some track titles on here like sloth trot or comatose however there's nothing on this LP musically lyrically or emotionally that makes me feel some kind of emotion in reaction to his sluggishness at the end of the day when I give a listen to this LP I just feel like I am a spectator to somebody else's rainy day or spilled milk I feel like a little bit I'm listening to the hip-hop equivalent to the new national record or something the prettiest thing on this record has got to be the instrumentals and there are some good instrumental choices on here these string sections at the end of comatose are great some of the more future garage influenced beats have nice grooves to them especially the opener and the synthesizer melody the very sort of simple synthesizer melody which has a driving groove to it on the song them waters it's it's very moody it's very electrified it's very nocturnal again I I like a lot of the instrumentals here but none of them are so redeeming that I'm really able to get into this new ghost poet and enjoy the songs as they currently are truth be told the this album really truly underwhelmed me and and there's not much more to it than that really if you've given the cell peal listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana ghost poet you 
ScrgMsVv5bI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and gonna do a quick review of the new Jaguar my album howlin these guys are an Australian music duo they have been turning some heads with some hot singles from the new full-length LP over here although personally all it's really doing for me is turning my stomach still even though I'm not really digging this record I could recommend it maybe for you as a summer record it does have quite a summery feel to it with some very bright sunny musical sounds and styles coming together on this thing some very Beach set indie pop and rock on this thing as well as bouncy house beats with some really melodic and and nice and the sizer programming - and and it's very rare that these two worlds actually mix on on a full-length LP and I I can't really say I'm all that impressed with the way that Jaguar MA mixes them I mean the the the the fact of the matter is is that they don't really mix them really it's that they'll pull together a really great house tune I mean with what I'm hearing on this record it sounds like they have a great appreciation for house music like electronic music is is really in this bands wheelhouse it's it's really what they do best in this album's best electronic moments it reminds me of fantastic singles from DFA records or specifically like Hot Chip like the second half of the song the throw the way the beat rides on this song the squelchy bass you've got this hard kick squelchy synthesizers sort of a rise in atmosphere the rhythms disappear and then when the kick drops back in it's really nice the last few moments of the track comes save me are great the synth riffs on the song uncertainty it's it's rare that I hear a band playing very Beach set indie rock and pop who come off so affluent with electronic music there are some moments toward the back end of this LP where some of these indie pop sensibilities mix with some of Jaguar Maz more electronic sensibilities there are tracks on here that are just straight up beach rock and not that I'm against beach rock by design but it feels like all they're doing is copying from some of the most boring contemporary insipid ideas in beach rock that are out there right now I feel like I'm listening to a watered down foster the people to be honest and there are other tracks on here like the throw which I said I love the second half of this song but the vocal melody on the first half with the the really badly executed falsetto it's excruciating just to listen to for me personally I really think Jaguar ma has a lot of talent and for sure they're really great with appreciating some of the beach rock that they're copying because they do emulate it well it's just that the kind of Beach rock that they're trying to emulate isn't particularly good Beach rock and and again to go back to the house music influences they're great a guy I'm just so confused and sort of on the fence with what the band likes and and how they brought it together it feels like this this house music stuff is just so much deeper in inside of them in terms of just being familiar with the ins and outs of it and then they sort of dumb things down with this Beach rock that doesn't have much personality to it at all really again I'm not really down with a lot of the vocals but when these guys just deliver a hard quarter note beat and cover it with some interesting psychedelic synthesizers this album is just bliss if if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Jaguar MA 
U-f5nFg-8Sk,who didn't drink a deer out of fear that he would hear bleep the beetle hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new autopsy album the Headless ritual these guys were a California death metal band who were back with a new album after an almost incredible return just a few years ago with their comeback album McCobb eternal it was the band's first full-length LP since the 90s a lot of people who have been fans of them since then did seem to take to it even though the group did have their low points before they disbanded in the mid 90s they did manage to put out two of Death metals biggest classics albums loaded with memorable heavy and catchy ass riffs riffs that were on the heavier side of the death metal spectrum really bringing more of a doom metal flavor into the picture of course Chris reverts fantastic drumming and lead vocals make these albums death metal classics because the fact that he has one of the gruff estranged future and most unique vocals in death metal period but I think this new LP offers a little bit of a change of pace maybe not so much that people who are unimpressed by eternal would want to gravitate to this album instead the band is still kind of stuck in their old school death metal ways which is completely fine considering how good they are at that but I will say that Chris's vocals seem a little bit more under control or maybe rather in balance with the guitars the bass and the drums behind him I think the drumming actually has a much better recording on it this time around way less ambient noise on the snare the drums feel heavier be seer thicker and really the mix overall feels thicker the guitars on this thing are massive and I think they take advantage of that massiveness by emphasizing the slower side of the Bands style the more doom oriented side of the band style yes there are still faster moments on this LP you or autopsy he gives the listener these spiraling guitar leads and shredding against these really brutal blast beats but there are quite a few moments on this album where autopsy does all of a sudden out of nowhere just slow down bring these really do me do me spaced out riffs that because of this thicker mix are just rumbling they're just like the song slaughter at the beasts house which has a really fast introduction but two minutes in the song goes totally black sabbath totally tony iommi influenced Rivage then the band harmonizes it with some extra guitars then they strip it back to the bass and Chris gives this really chilling chilling vocal performance he's just putting his blood and his guts all over this track while I do like it when autopsy does go fast I love it even more when they contrast these faster moments with some slower more passionate and memorable moments maybe this memorability in this just emotional intensity is at its highest on the song she is a funeral it's the longest song on this LP spanning past seven minutes and Chris legitimately goes nuts on this song I was transfixed and the thing is behind his voice these very slow dreary guitar riffs in the background they bring a legitimately sad and and kind of tortured feeling to the song obviously the the title already makes me think that that it's about some sort of relationship heartbreak and whether it is or it isn't Chris really feels like he's in some kind of emotional pain on this track and it's not really just the the song subject that makes me think this it's also the bridge as well with these mid-paced chords that have these huge deep bellowing background vocals hanging behind it oh there's some harder highlights on this LP like running from the goat head which I think has some of the fastest shredding as' intro riffs on this entire LP and the song when hammer meets bone - as the sort of old-school heavy metal vibe to it but of course Chris with his vocals and the down-tuned guitars bring that death metal vibe even though I could pick out songs that I really really like they're just way too many I guess sort of shortcomings for this LP for me to really love it for one the album is shorter and and that doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing it is longer than some of the Bands classics but I feel almost as if they're kind of cutting and running on some of these songs without completely developing them or fleshing them out especially when you consider some of the longer tracks on this LP are fantastic with their multiple parts and that the band was writing some incredibly long songs on their last full-length LP the song coffin crawlers strangely enough enters with these really neatly medially moodily guitar leads just layered on top of one another and this really awesomely eerie tense way and I do think this is a great way to start the track but when the track finishes they just fade down all the instrumentation and then just mysteriously fade up these guitar leads once again only to fade them down only seconds later it felt like a really lazy way to end the song the song thorns and ashes I'm not really sure what to think of this track it feels like 1 minute and 46 seconds of of what could have been a song but the band just decided not to really make it a song and the closing track on this thing I feel the exact same way even though it does breach over the two-minute mark it is really only two interchanging riffs and and not really much of a song idea a few other tracks on here that I really enjoy fade out around the four three-minute mark which isn't necessarily a bad time to end a song it's just that I don't really feel like the band has developed these tracks in a way where they feel as if they should end and these points I mean for example the song arch cadaver that song just sort of melts away as it feels like it's getting its most psychotic energy together between Chris's vocals and the guitars it feels like there are moments where autopsy still has a few tricks up their sleeves but maybe they didn't want to take it that far on this record with every track and instead just kind of give something that would be easy to digest but unfortunately that's made these songs in my opinion a little less memorable and a lot less striking flawless thrilling really I'm feeling a decent strong six on this LP again if you highlight songs that I really like but other tracks that I wish took it further and really that's it if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I'm gonna give a shout out to people only the strong subscribe all mistakes for intentional Anthony Fanta no autopsy forever you 
YeHgbYZm6H0,Shannon hi everyone Anthony van tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new James Holden album the inheritors James Holden is an electronic music producer and DJ as well as the founder of border community records an electronic and experimental music label that has released dozens of LPS and EPS since it started in 2003 and essentially James is celebrating the 10-year long life of his label as well as his much longer career with a new sophomore album just sophomore album when it comes to material James is really more of a prolific remixer he has quite a few big names under his belt as far as people whose songs he has rearranged people like Madonna Mogwai Four Tet Britney Spears New Order Depeche Mode Radiohead he's obviously more of a quality over quantity kind of guy and if you are a fan who has been waiting for this new full-length LP you can't really say he held back in any way delivering over an hour of music across 15 tracks now like James last full-length LP this album is beautifully textured some really rough percussion pretty somewhat vintage synthesizers although maybe that vintage flavors turned up a little bit to the point where this record reminds me a little bit of another border community Records released Luke Abbott's Holcomb drones on my favorite electronic music LPS of 2010 there's quite a bit of variety on this LP wah-wah some tracks on here do get a little tedious even if they are very colourful songs like the Illuminations with all of these swirling synthesizer arpeggios caught within this very aged recording it feels like a little bit of Boards of Canada worship it's alright that Boards of Canada worship actually continues on other tracks here like summer spite as well as circle of fifths while it is very steeped in this influence what he's doing on these songs it is kind of noisy it is sharp it is sort of shrill and there are other tracks on here that sort of take a more ambient approach that lose me a little bit because of how disconnected they feel from any sort of real tangible feeling still the more that I listen to this album and the more I sort of look at the artwork another thing that I'm not really crazy about on this LP there is sort of a theme a concept that runs throughout most of this album and for me it kind of starts with the album cover where we have a rock carving something that we typically associate with the idea of primitive life something that's a rudimentary but what's actually carved into the rock if you observe it closely is very clean it's straight it's not some kind of crudely drawn Buffalo or anything like that the symbols on this rock seem almost as if they're beyond human comprehension like they're futuristic or maybe even alien and that's sort of the dichotomy that this album explores you have something that feels in a lot of ways technologically advanced but kind of has a very old soul to it you've essentially got a lot of these simple basic visceral primeval musical ideas being executed through electronics through new technology it kind of reminds me of the balance that was struck on that Africa hi-tech album that I enjoyed so much a few years ago except James approaches it with different musical influences and styles on the inheritors James performs a lot of IDM micro house techno a little bit of progressive synthesizer an ambient music and James doesn't really blend all of these ideas together into cohesive tracks really he genre hops from song to song to song like the songs Ranade or the title track from the cell P which are really amazingly produced progressive and riveting techno songs very noisy dirty rough kind of simple and they're very linear grooves and each of these tracks also are colored with really intense and complex synthesizers Ranade has these tremolo very fast waves of sense just pulsating quickly and on the title track the synths are really sharp they're blaring there screeching across the track making it even more hot and heavy than Ranade that ambient route comes up again on songs like self playing schmaltz or sky burial but some of the chords and some of the melodies on these tracks feel really sinister and dark I don't really feel like I'm listening to something that is pre civilization like I think the theme on this album is but rather post civilization the songs feel like the the very desolate aftermath of some kind of great tragedy but maybe the best tracks on this LP in my opinion are the ones where we get those primeval and acoustic instrumentation elements mixed in with the electronics songs like caterpillars intervention where the plucks strings and the blaring saxophones and the really hard constant hypnotic again primal beat makes the song feel like a dance around a campfire with a drum circle other songs on here like circle inside a circle the opener and gone feral as well take these electronic elements and mix them with percussion that feels like it was played with hands or at least just sounds like sampled hand percussion while it is electronic it has a very natural kind of rootsy feel to it in a way and I really like that I think these tracks are some of the most unique moments that this album has to offer if this album was going to try to go forward with this theme I would love to hear more tracks to sort of take it at this angle because these songs to me are among the most memorable on this album but really for me the odd man out on this LP is the song 7 stars which has kind of these gothic piano chords and melodic flourishes throughout the track it's in 3 4 it's very moody waltz and while it is very electronic and it is very noisy and has a nice huge climactic finish I'm not really seeing where this song fits and with the rudimentary vibes that I get from the other melodies and and the other grooves on this LP rather the song feels very civilized very refined overall I did really really enjoy this LP it had a lot of songs that I enjoyed it just came down to being a mixed bag of tracks with a very loose too loose of a concept really a lot of tracks stuck out to me as being great very bold mixtures of old ideas and new sounds some tracks are really unique pieces of techno a few are very underwhelming a few more kind of drown in their influences but if you're into electronic music and you something really textured and you want something that's colorful and and something that is above all things just tense will kind of keep you on the edge of your seat do give the inheritors a listen I'm feeling a light a decent seven on this thing if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Pyrex Agustin CGT Esperanza it's a - Billy woods and Vincent only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana bulette

wBgqAKxujkE,JDC hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new jay-z album Magna Carta Holy Grail jay-z Jigga man Hova is a New York MC business tycoon and now a father oh and also the largest figure in hip hop music in terms of Fame and financial status now despite jay-z's long-running financial success as well as very popular singles recently he had quite a few hits off that new watch the throne collaboration he put out with Kanye critics and hardcore hip-hop fans snobs have pretty much come to the conclusion that jay-z is in the midst of a bit of an artistic decline at the moment it's been a while since he's put out an LP that reached that widespread acclaim of a reasonable doubt or a blueprint or an American gangster or even a black album and honestly I don't really see that happening anytime soon especially considering the marketing campaign behind this new record of his Magna Carta Holy Grail there wasn't really any hot sort of radio single to come out before this album was released to get people kind of hooked in on it and radio singles have pretty much been jay-z's bread and butter for the majority of his career instead jay-z kind of opted to present a bunch of commercials advertisements for this record in tandem with Samsung that were thrown all over television all over YouTube feature jay-z as well as Timbaland Swizz Beatz Pharrell Rick Rubin all kind of biessing in the studio listening to some beats trying out some lyrics talking about the current state of the music industry comparing this internet-based age of the music business to the Wild West I just don't necessarily feel like what he is saying reflects his current situation jay-z just releasing an album isn't the same as just about anybody else releasing an album for one jay-z is the only rapper out there who is actually jay-z not many artists are releasing their albums with Samsung partnerships either much less getting Samsung to buy a million copies of their LP so that it is platinum before it actually is physically released I wish that the commercials went a little bit more into where jay-z was going artistically one of the advertisements I believe actually calls out specifically the song jay-z blue the song that was hyped as a personal piece of reflection on jay-z's recent entry into fatherhood however this song is maybe among some of my least favorite tracks on Magna Carta Holy Grail almost of the point where it's kind of embarrassing with all the Mommy Dearest references and desparate notorious b.i.g samples I don't really care for the instrumental either with the silly acoustic guitar patterns that just feel like they're being thrown in there to make the song feel meaningful and as far as the lyrics go with jay-z saying his baby needs pampers he needs three months in the Hamptons joint custody I need to join the idea starting to with me there's actually a video that the onion put out shortly after jay-z had his new baby talking about that for sure he was going to roll out all these really corny daddy lines making fun of him putting out lyrics that were that were fake saying things like he's trading liquor bottles for baby bottles and even though it was funny at the time I thought the joke was kind of preposterous no way jay-z would go down this road what he actually delivered on this record is not too far from the joke the onion made now I know daddy didn't love him I know this is an attempt at jay-z being kind of vulnerable and the last verse of this track isn't bad lyrically jay-z picks up the flow a little bit and the epic strings in the instrumental or a nice touch too I have a hard time believing that jay-z is kind of on that Joan Crawford level of emotional instability honestly this song just feels a little too fabricated to me story wise and emotionally too because jay-z seems legitimately more emotionally moved by his damaged relationship with his audience than he does the relationship with his baby not to get caught up in one song though because there are tracks on this LP that I like I do dig the opener on this album a lot of you may remember the instrumental from the advertisements that Samsung ran for this thing there's a very passionate vocals from Justin Timberlake very slow dramatic pianos that play up to the point where the beat comes through hits hard with these twittering hi-hats that feel very trap music influenced hard-hitting kicks little baby pianos and lyrically jay-z raps about that tattered relationship he has with Fame such a harsh mistress yes Fame has given jay-z opportunities and money but I suppose it's had its annoyances as well the only downfall this track though is is just the really gaudy Nirvana hook reference on this song as well as ah-ah-ah I also dig the track Picasso baby it's really hard-hitting it's braggadocious it sounds expensive the beat change up toward the back end of this track is fantastic really sounds like something Rick Rubin would have produced for jay-z and Z and Z and Z and lyrically it's cocky it's catchy I know a lot of people may get a little bitter over jay-z on this track because the wealth that he is rapping about is very real it's very actual it is hyper super wealth but the thing is that's what jay-z is so freakin good at I think my only annoyance with this song is that jay-z is rapping throughout the track about owning expensive pieces of art not for the sake of art appreciation but as a sign of status the song up the world feels like classic Jay it's big its ambitious it's riveting as well in the song somewhere in America has all those qualities too and and additionally this piano phrase this piano sample maybe that feels really refined totally reminds me of some of the production from the cruel summer be it as well as watch the throne even though Kanye from what I understand is not credited as a producer on this record there is a huge Kanye influence on some of the instrumentals here especially the ones where Travis Scott is credited with producing on the track now I know why Travis Scott has been signed so that Kanye can kind of be in two places at once now again lyrically even though jay-z on these tracks is rapping about a lot of the stuff that he continues to rap about I think he stays pretty fresh stays clever with references to his basketball prospects his millions there's one line that I love in particular when he's saying when I was talking to Instagram the last thing you was your picture snapped to me that track is clever it's epic it's huge as well as the song crown which another track that has a huge trap music influence not so much an old school or boom-bap flavor that you would typically expect from jay-z this song has a very powerful approach the presentation of all these very current sounds in hip hop instrumentals and jay-z's lyrics reflect that power with references to being mentioned on CNN his past in the drug game I love the Cain and Abel reference and even though again some of what jay-z is saying is not only just sort of run-of-the-mill for him and normal for hip-hop it's hard for me to ignore context when it comes to jay-z and I mean that in a good way I mean they in a complimentary way because even though there are a lot of rappers out there rapping about selling drugs making money selling drugs getting big off of selling drugs jay-z is essentially the number one guy for this he is the poster child for getting your start via drug-dealing nobody has gone quite so far from the beginning was that he raps about in his songs we're talking about one of the most powerful famous men in the world acquaintance to the President and he is completely open and honest about his past selling drugs not that I think that this is a thing that jay-z should be regretful of or throw in the closet I think it's more interesting if you frame it within America's sort of weird love-hate relationship with drugs while there isn't some massive riot or revolution to get the sort of drugs jay-z with selling legalized people are completely fine and okay and even interested in hearing the sort of stories that jay-z has to offer splattered all over the mainstream media now to go on there are some other tracks on this LP that I like like the song heaven a song where jay-z goes through a bunch of religious references self compares to God a little bit again it kind of feels like he's inspired a touch by what Kanye was doing on the song I am a god except jay-z approaches it with a better more sensible instrumental with a great vocal cut my only issue again we have jay-z sort of digging down to that 90s alternative rock been referencing the hook from REM losing my religion and the song part two on the run isn't bad either a track that is in a long string of collaborations with his wife baby mama Beyonce and while the flavor of the song with Beyonce singing as well as the beat and the piano on the track feels a little dated it's a little old-school it really kind of feels like one of those 90s hip-hop R&B fusions it is a great track with jay-z sort of going into the bad boy bad girl intimacy of their relationship and rapping about what they have authentically and and poetically for sure there are a lot of quality tracks on Magna Carta Holy Grail that longtime fans will love to hear jay-z deliver and a lot of these tracks have some really fresh sharp loud forward-thinking production but over these more forward-thinking and newer beats there are moments where jay-z feels like he cheapens his craft a little bit for the sake of just getting on top of a really loud modern banger and of course on beats like this he dumbs down his flow a little bit and it just gets me thinking really like we're doing this songs like Tom Ford as well as BBC on this track has an extended coda from nas the beat itself is is really kooky Swizz Beatz is all over the instrumental too and with only a single verse from jay-z it really kind of feels like I'm listening to another interlude off of this LP there are a few 52nd tracks on this album too in the second half which sort of come out of nowhere actually which the songs verses was a lot longer than it actually is if it was it really could have been one of the better tracks on Magna Carta but the worst has got to be with me you know I got it with Rick Ross where jay-z just really throws his flow in the toilet really into the toilet to the point where I'm not even interested in what he's delivering lyrically and Rick Ross is completely obnoxious on the song not only because his flow is just as bad as jay-z's jay-z is really bringing himself down to that Rick Ross level but there's a silly shot at Reebok and the track having to do with the the molly line that he did have an advertising with him anymore overall I have to say that jay-z into his forties I'm pretty happy to see that he has quite a few tricks up his sleeves on this new rap LP and while there are quite a few enjoyable tracks on this album some passable ones and only a few that I really really disliked I think Magna Carta Holy Grail 's biggest failure is through the fact that with the advertisements and the lyric dropping and all of this pre album release hype which was building up to something big and ambitious jay-z came through with an album that was really sort of just kind of safe for him I'm kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what should i review next and that's it if you don't like this review you know it's my opinion here's a straw I want to give a shout out to jay-z and that's it only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan Oh jay-z Magna Carta Holy Grail forever 
wxH8Q4b-0gg,"Billy woods hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Billy woods album Billy woods is a mysterious DC based rapper who kind of jump-started his long-running solo career with an incredibly dark topical lyrical and moody hip-hop album last year history will absolve me and as far as woods rap style goes he has this flow that sort of blurs lines between rapping and spoken word sort of ranting and the way Billy delivers these lyrics comes off really forceful convincing the meaning of what Billy is saying for the most part hits at least me very instantaneously because he tries his best to be a very vivid storyteller a communicator and emotion conveyor and the guy makes some really great production choices as well which brings me to why door candy is sort of a unique moment for Billy in his career he's got all the production handled by one single person a pretty popular underground hip hop producer blockhead who of course is most famous for his work with Aesop Rock when I first heard of Billy working with a producer for the length of an entire album on this new project I was pretty excited about the concept potential behind door candy and I gotta say after numerous listens to this album there is a significant theme at least if not a story running through this album and it's a theme that really delivers on the title here you have the word door which isn't an often used word but means things like gloomy severe and candy which i think is sort of a piece of symbolism for drugs which are often mentioned throughout this LP and not just really doing them or getting addicted to them having them ruin your life mostly selling them it's really a story of someone who was living really small time while selling drugs and just kind of the life that this person is leading and and this story may be more personal than Billy lets on and on top of this blockhead lends some really good production to this LP not incredibly layered or flashy or anything like that there are a few moments that get really melodic and and sort of progressive like his old Aesop Rock production but for the most part the instrumentals on the cell P feel eerie they feel rough they set the stage for something that feels like some crimes are going to be committed some harsh realities are going to be exposed it's one grimy sample after another in kick drums and snares that don't so much boom or bang but really just sort of thud still the roughness of these beats doesn't stop blockhead from getting really creative with what he samples or the pace of his rhythms or the the detail in his rhythms like the song Manteca which has these really odd old like old man vocals singing against these very weird synthesizer leads or the depressing chords and descending bass guitar on the track Gilgamesh which has these birds sampled throughout the chorus too for a hip-hop beat it really sounds like a funeral march and the track poachers which has a strong desert vibe to it the song tinseltown one of my favorite tracks on here does have more of an old-school blockhead vibe to it and while I love the sad soulful horns on the track 1,001 nights I wish this song got developed a little bit more into something with maybe a little bit more structure because it feels like this same horn sample is just being repeated over and over I don't know they're just some songs where I wish they hit a little harder made a bit more impact like the the potentially great posse track on here fool's gold with open mike eagle mocha only lucid and billy woods on the track to the beat in my opinion really sort of meanders and when it does change the things that adds to the equation are not really that interesting like the very weak synth melodies that that occur under the second and fourth verses on this track as far as Billy's rap style I'm not really seeing a whole lot of change between this LP and history will absolve me he sounds just as passionate and focused as he did last year maybe what he's saying comes off a little more coded but the more I listen to it the more vivid this image becomes and the more I feel like this is what Billy had been doing with his life maybe up until the point when he kind of started his rap career because he does throw in images of cops extortion DA's busting through the wall like the kool-aid guy paranoia dim prospects girlfriends and old flames all while throwing some moral undertones under all of it like forgetting about the golden rule for a few pieces of silver I could be wrong about how non-fictional this story is but Billy doesn't really seem unafraid to toss in a reference here and there to his rapping or his rap career which he does on the song hack he does on the song Central Park where he reminisces a little bit about helping kids out with their fractions in measuring product out but this is one of the few moments where Billy goes into the technical and descriptive side of selling drugs really for the most part he's painting a picture of this person's life while this career move is kind of going on like on the song poachers where he seems to be getting involved with the family of someone that he knows who got arrested and taken away by the police for what I assume is what Billy has been rapping about there are a lot of great spots like this on this LP my issue is that toward the end I really sort of feel like this picture this image this story whatever you want to call it falls apart a little bit and he doesn't consistently deliver more imagery or just develop more curves or more corners in this shape that he's trying to create and I don't necessarily feel like the features on this album either add to the story that door candy tells overall I did enjoy this album a lot but I do feel like Woods's portrait could have come in clear the production could have been a little bit more memorable at some points but still I do feel like in a way door candy is a more ambitious move for Billy woods and if he continues to work with the kind of storytelling that that attempts to reach from the first track of an album to the last track of an album I could see an even greater project coming from him in the future I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Egypt as well as feeding to records all mistakes were intentional only the strong subscribe Billy woods the needle drop blockhead forever "
qvTJQU4nyqU,I'm back for vacation run the tools review dead a blink down there watch it bro [Music] 
TKeH0PM48EI,Joey badass summer nights hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new Joey badass mixtape summer nights yi Kao won hey hey hey hey hey hey oh it seems to be okay now oh okay go ahead yeah you're you're good Joey badasses in New York emcee this is his latest mixtape a follow-up to Joey's breakout 1999 mixtape which dropped last year it's a mixtape that put Joey badass on the map put his pro era click on the map as well as helped usher in this new wave of old-school New York hip hop revivalism that we've been seeing with the beast coast movement and while I thought a lot of tunes on this mixtape were great and solid and I loved the aesthetic that Joey was going for I did have a bit of an issue with him sort of drowning in his influences a little bit too much to make this tape really hit hard and just be memorable even though Joey was mimicking his idols a little bit too much he spit a real nice on the tracks but still I felt like there needed to be a little bit more growth or evolution there and certainly there has been that since the very short amount of time between the 1999 tape and this new tape from Joey quite a bit has happened actually he's been working with different producers he's been touring heavily he appeared on ASAP Rocky's latest album one of his biggest is this healer yet he put out with pro hair that really solid mixtape that I love toward the beginning of this year and there was also the unfortunate passing of Capital steez one of pro eras prime members after all that Joey is coming back with this new group of tracks 19 new cuts from him some of which have been released already and Joey still really is kind of wearing his influences on his sleeves with song titles on the selfie like word is bond or lyrical refrains like deep fried friends even though Joey is still really straightforward with where he comes from stylistically I feel like he has traveled a little bit further down the road on this tape when it comes to I guess coming into his own and sort of defining himself successfully in this vintage hip-hop style that puts a huge emphasis on lyrical ability not necessarily poppy hooks or viral catch phrases and just like 1999 and the Pro era tape once again Joey is spitting his ass off with a whole load of charisma vivid imagery wordplay and on some tracks a higher level of energy like on the song 95 til infinity which has this beat provided by Lee Bannon this is actually one of the more Spacey cloudy smokey and warm beats I've ever heard Joey rap over and even though he is not as lyrically ninja like he comes through with this just over-the-top delivery this just immense level of aggression shouting a lot of his lyrics it's not a bad track and it really sticks out as a change of pace also another change of pace is him landing on a new piece of production from DJ Premier on the bonus track from this thing with some very precision DJ scratching all over the track we get more personal moments from Joey like on the song long live steelo where he essentially gives a really heartfelt eulogy to his past friend wishing that he could sort of get these moments back or just enjoy one more of them just one last time hitting one more line one more vibe the song right on time sees Joey kind of painting this picture of a really vulnerable Joey badass going through this love story with this girl he seems to be infatuated with not only sort of a physical level but an emotional level too and the song rain another emotional track toward the end of this LP kind of puts us in Joey's head when it comes to his current spot in his music career he sees himself reigning as King right out of high school he's eaten now he's feast in now last year he didn't make no paper earned some haters hitting hard to be famous but it's hard to mane and Joey gives us another moody number as well with the song trapdoor although there is nothing on here in terms of just sadder songs in my opinion that are as an emic and really just career-defining as hard knock and I don't really think it has anything to do with a lack of effort or just Joey not really being all that Hungary or anything like that Joey still sounds very hungry on a number of songs here and don't get me wrong I think the features on this thing are pretty solid maybe there are a few that kind of make me Oh Harry Potter references why Nick although I guess Joey did evolve into a Charmeleon whatever Chuck Strangers is sounding pretty good when he pops up on these tracks he sounds gruff he still sounds hungry just like you did on the peep mixtape desi Hines who was one of the more standout emcees I fell on the Peet mixtape is still rapping pretty fast and I think his voice deepened a little bit since peep came out because with his voice lowering a little bit he kind of sounds like jay-z circa 1996 still I I kind of feel like bringing all of this up I am splitting hairs a little bit because I mean this is still a really quality project Joey is spitting really well across these tracks and the songs that do feel more personal and focus are fantastic it's just that again summer nights feels a little bit like a sequel to keep the approps even with a series of beats that feel like instrumentals from that mixtape I mean I guess I can't really be surprised considering how little time has passed between the release of summer nights and peep it's just that that's really sort of keeping me from being incredibly excited over summer nights because a lot of it doesn't feel incredibly new I'm feeling a strong 6 to Alli 7 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I'm gonna give a shout out to Jenn Derrek Lee Bannon and everybody on the planet only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Joey badass forever [Music] 
wM5ShDIxgaQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jarren Benton album my grandmother's basement this guy is Georgia MC this is basically his his first big commercial project it's out now on funk volume which is a label you may already know thanks to artists like dizzy Wright as well as Hopson and with the height building behind him now it looks like Jaron might become one of their next big artists as well because on this new group of tracks he definitely has flow personality and some good instrumental picks as well a lot of the beats actually come from a producer who goes by the name of Cato who brings quite a few impressive and very heavy trap style bangers to these 19 songs there are a few other beats here that go for different styles as well a few boom BAPS some more ethereal tracks that have more melody to them basically kind of setting a foundation for Jaron to say something a little more meaningful the variety across these songs is is okay at best it's not fantastic it doesn't bring a whole lot of versatility to the table if anything the 19 songs here lay a little too heavy on those trap style beats with jarran going absolutely nuts on the mic which is actually pretty fun at first and led to some really great singles on this LP especially the songs on the first half of this album but it does get a little stale by the second half even though Jaron is really great I mean it is one of his strengths to be kind of cartoony and and ridiculous with his punchlines Jaron really is a great a talker he strikes me as a guy who growing up might have had something clever or smart or foul to say to just about anybody who got in his face to kind of give you a picture of the sort of dude Jaron is the guy steps right on the throat of Tyler the Creator comparisons right at the start of one of the tracks on this LP but he does sort of welcome Eminem comparisons and even compares himself a little bit to Andre 3000 down the road I guess in sense due to his very fast flow and southern slant though I do think the mmm comparison is a little more legitimate especially since gerund tends to be very in-your-face sort of violent wild he also has Vinny paths as well as RA the rugged man on this album doing features and it really does sort of take a certain kind of MC to want to invite guys like that onto your tracks plus the flow Jaron works with on the track razor blades and steak knives it sounds like something right from the Slim Shady LP and I would say there are some moments on this album where Jaron is just as creative with some of his weird-ass punchlines like off-the-wall like up drywall he's also rapping quite a bit on this LP about quadriplegics being a male chauvinist who hits his girl with a bowl of grits at times Jaron can be a little much and and some of the things he says it really kind of feels like wow he's really trying to get attention here isn't me there are quite a few tracks on on this LP that fit that bill songs like don't act or Cadillacs and Chevys which is actually one of the catchy er songs on this LP but right at the start of the song he says hey I'm gonna say on the verses and we'll just do a hook whatever I get this sense from Jaron mentioning this on his album and from some of the better tracks on this LP that on my grandmother's basement maybe in a way Jaron isn't really trying as hard as he possibly could because the descriptions of his life growing up and sort of the bad decisions that he's made on the song life in the jungle which has a chorus on it that reminds me a lot of some production from the cruel summer compilation it's actually a fantastic track Jaron actually gets deeper on song dreams as well not only about his personal life but the plight of sort of growing up poor growing up uneducated again he tries to go into a deeper shade of storytelling on the song heart attack something that I think a lot of people will think of Eminem when you listen to this track considering that he's vexed over his girlfriend leaving him he basically goes psychotic over the whole ordeal sadly enough they're they're not enough songs like this on this LP even those songs like smells like and and bully with Vinnie Paz are great cuts toward the back end of this LP I do think the second half of the album does sort of get a little stale because Jaron doesn't continue to deliver this deeper shade of storytelling and introduce some new ideas because there are a lot of hooks on the second half of this LP that remind me of hooks from the first half Jaron does sort of throw a lot of his feature tracks on the latter half of this LP to maybe it was sort of an attempt to kind of keep things fresh and keep things engaging break things up a little bit and not keep the album feeling Sammy Sammy but I mean at least that that didn't happen for me anyway overall I did like this project I thought it was pretty good I think Jaron has a lot of personality and potential as an MC is it fully realized on this album I wouldn't say so I mean if anything this album feels like just a mixed bag of tracks some of which are deeper some of which hardcore fans are really going to like but a lot of songs I think we're put together just for the sake of getting another popular MC on the track getting some kind of cross promotion thing there and just putting together a lot of bangers that have sort of single potential if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Jarren Benton forever 
N1_k2ikvXkc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review of the new Kyary Pamyu Pamyu album nonde collection Kyary Pamyu Pamyu is a japanese blogger singer model pop star one of the biggest pop stars over there right now thanks to her his singles her quirky aesthetic that is so eye and ear catching that she's caught quite a bit of attention over here in the West as well now if you're really going to talk about key Ahri's music seriously you can't really go without mentioning Yasutaka Nakata a multi project songwriter producer and DJ who has been working in the Japanese music industry for years and even though he is well known for working with Kyary this is not the first time he's produced music for a female Japanese pop star it just so happens that Kyary is one of the more bold faces in Japanese pop music that he's worked with so far and I don't just mean in terms of her clothing and the individual aesthetics that come in her music videos I mean that is an entirely different video review in itself thank you I actually think Harry's music by his self qualifies as being pretty eccentric within that Japanese pop music realm now Japanese pop music is is typically characterized as being pretty upbeat bouncy very bright as well these are typically the things that people notice first about aside from the language barrier and the very youthful voices of the singers in this genre and all of those characteristics definitely show up on nonde collection except I would say that Yasutaka and Kyary up the ante with some very creative colorful and and sometimes zany sounds an instrumentation some of the keyboard sounds and since I'm not a collection are so silly that at times it kind of feels like Jay pops answer to pee-wee's Playhouse what I just want to say to you is that when you listen to this LP don't quick to assume that what's going on here is just normal for the genre and that it's just sort of run-of-the-mill that sort of conclusion is easy to jump to when one there is a language barrier and two you're really disconnected from the culture that the music comes from which is so far outside of the context that you're currently living in when you give a listen to this record and you're asking yourself why does it sound so hyper and colourful and fun well I mean it sounds like all those things because it actually is all those things it's not like there's any kind of secret code or anything going on here as far as I can tell another assumption I would be pretty hesitant to make is that Kyary is essentially Japan's answer to Lady gaga for one Kyary is not the first eccentrically dressed person from Japan and even though Lady Gaga has been known to wear some pretty weird outfits I personally though I do enjoy some of her older stuff don't really see a lot of that eccentricity bleed into her music I actually see many of the tracks on nonde collection as being even more experimental than the songs from kyary's previous album which really helped her break into the Japanese musical mainstream the song invader invader one of the bigger singles off of this LP and one of my favorite tracks - feels like a song that was composed by j-pop robots from another planet presenting these really wonky synthesizer melodies this one portion in the song that feels like a dubstep drop it happens for like five seconds although it's not really heavy and abrasive and overwhelming like most dubstep drops it's actually kind of small and cute and tiny and farty I actually see it as more of a self-aware playful reference to dubstep music than it is an attempt to try to cross over to dubstep fans outside of that I'm loving the zany vocal melodies all over this chat and the song me is incredibly fun and playful and just ridiculous with its vocal melody Mee Mee Mee Mee Mee Mee Mee Mee Mee for some reason like when I hear this song I imagine some kind of dance going on that involves this again we've got another melody that feels very oriental feels much older than the record that it's it's being presented on but the sounds the groove and all the instrumentation it feels very modern it feels hyper colorful this song feels like nighttime people out in the streets having a fun time eating laughing talking it's just a party and and that's what I love about a lot of tracks on this LP even as some of the moments on here get even more eccentric with some odd piano melodies and in one track toward the end of this thing that that feels kind of polka inspired my one letdown on this LP is that there are a handful of songs that feel maybe a little too straightforward a little too toeing that Jpop line to feel special or even memorable the beats and the melodies on tracks like saigo no ice cream as well as kamini 100% maybe these songs to me are some of the least distinct on the LP there's actually a capsule cover on here as well capsule being a musical project that Yasutaka was involved with before he was involved with Kyary which is a hell of a tune it's it's really melodic and it's really fun but again not one of the more interesting tracks for me sonically or instrumentally especially with the very cheesy slightly jazzy synth trumpet playing throughout this song to still even though I'm not head over heels for the sounds that these songs are presenting for the most part I still enjoyed them to an extent I'm not really disliking much of anything on this LP to be completely honest track four track four track we're talking about really sharp melody writing that is so sticky is just so infectious that I think it really transcends the the language barrier thing for me at least personally tons of incredibly vibrant sounds and and since fermentation in a variety of tracks that present different modes of playfulness and and and weirdness I would not say it all that this record is for ironic enjoyment or should be enjoyed from the perspective of oh this is just different because it's not from my country and so on and so forth personally I see this record is kind of being like a gigantic layer-cake that is taller than me maybe clearing my head by five feet and I have been given permission to just literally dive in and eat as much of it as I want maybe after eating a few slices conservatively on a plate I would just stick my face in Ingo even if there are a handful of songs on here that I'm just a little on the fence with I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to vic mensa chuck strangers Dave Reynolds Dominique and is Elia banks Azealia you forgot your tweet where did this go where did this go I guess that tweet got deleted I guess that tweet got deleted only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Kyary Pamyu Pamyu forever [Music] 
RwthMKGN99A,hi everyone Anthony fan tano here the Internet's busiest means the data and it's time for a quick review of the new death side album random access memories memories Daft side or dark side is the musical project the musical collaborative project between dave harrington and music producer electronic music producer nicolas jar so oddly enough these guys have gotten together and they have done a song for song remix of the new Daft Punk album random access memories one of this year's most hyped and polarizing music releases for sure the record did get quite a bit of critical acclaim but there were a lot of fans that were really split on this album considering how disjointed it was considering that they didn't really go down their usual house-music route or anything like that and even though Dave and and Nicholas are remix in this new Daft Punk album it's almost as if there is a slight very small noticeable voice of dissent in this remix album they obviously enjoy quite a few cuts from random access memories or they enjoy ideas from it but I don't know if this album feels celebratory or anything like that for one there are some songs on here like game of love and beyond that really do maintain a lot of the musical characteristics of the tracks that are being remixed maybe they adjust the speed of the songs a little bit but the bass lines and the rhythm guitars throughout these tracks are pretty as is in terms of how they feel how they sound the grooves that they're playing not to say that the songs are untouched or anything like that Dave and and Nicholas really transform these songs which were very disco influenced and not overtly electronic at all into tracks that are just skeletal straightforward very effective micro house tunes on the other hand songs like get lucky and give life back to music especially the latter of those to undergo some serious transformations give life back to music has an incredibly noisy rickety drum beat that is sharp with the the equalization of the drum sounds just really there's a lot of treble there's all these metallic clangs and tones inside of the beat as well and the guitars and the vocals are just hanging very murky like behind all of these noisy percussive sounds the song get lucky though is is much darker than its original the pop of this song the pop element of the song is sucked right out of the equation and instead some weirder some weirder just odder guitars are thrown into the mix and when the groove of the song finally reveals itself even then it's still a pretty moody track this song is not up all night to get lucky then there are other tracks like fragments of time and touch tracks that I also enjoy but outside of the the very hefty use of samples of the vocal cuts from those songs the tracks are nearly unrecognizable I enjoy the majority of the songs on this remix album but I can't say I was head-over-heels for the whole thing it does take a little bit to start you know does take its time with beginning songs like contact and within one because they split the song within into two parts throughout the album they start the LP off and they're really more ambient noisy spacious not really bringing a groove or anything like that then once give life back to music kicks in then it really feels like the album starts these song lose yourself to dance while I do think Nick and Dave are making a pretty funny statement by making their remix of this track just two seconds long I do feel like there was a pretty I don't know a missed opportunity on this track because they could have turned it into something fun I think because while that song I think is one of the weaker cuts off of random access memories so is instant crush with Julian Casablanca sand they managed to remix that track really well the song doing it right which is one of my favorites off of random access memories with the way that Nicholas and Dave do the vocal sample on this track the way they manipulate it pitch shift it and then repeat it uh-uh it gets borderline annoying and on the song Giorgio I feel like the string section is that they sample on that don't exactly sync up entirely with the beat that they're putting behind it and and with the way that they equalized and mix the beat in the way that they sort of thinned out the strings maybe to kind of cancel out all the other instrumentation just kind of keep those chords keep those melodies and and musical phrases there's definitely some kind of distance there's a real lack of connection between the strings that they're trying to sample and the beat overall I I thought this was a fun listen it's something that I see myself returning to definitely yeah because I am a Nicholas jar fan I love The Dude's production I love his approach to creating electronic music and and for sure that shows up in a really big way on this album but maybe this LP too even if you're not a Nicholas jar fan might appeal to you a bit more than what Daft Punk actually did considering how split some fans were on on this album even if it is micro house and it's not hard hitting it's not banging it's not really poppy and catchy and just burning it is more house oriented than random access memories is give it a listen let me know what you think do you love this thing hate it why what should i review next and that's it random access memories memories deft side 
ZuSBgDmBKZc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and we're at the halfway point of the year as you may already know from my other video where i talked about some of my favorite records of this year but one thing that sort of comes up a lot in the comments section of my reviews because of course people never forget people never ever ever forget especially when i don't really care for an album people tend to take reviews little personally and and i understand why that is i mean people really take their musical tastes and and their favorite artists and their favorite albums and and they make them a part of their lives i'm not surprised by or disappointed by or even hurt by some of the negative reactions that come in the the comment sections of of my reviews but i think here we can sort of address those in a really healthy way and just kind of give everybody an opportunity to vent for one things that are overrated tell me straight up because i'm honest with you what do you think I have sort of hyped up a little too much this year and that I've made a big deal but you're not really seeing the point you're not really seeing what's so great about it I've definitely gotten a lot of responses in that regard to my Queens of the Stone Age review my Daft Punk review my My Bloody Valentine review not my altar of plagues or my knife review but I have enjoyed those albums quite a bit more than most albums this year and for sure they're going to be some people who sort of react negatively to that in itself because there are certainly a lot of records that came out this year that I'm just not seeing the excitement for even though a lot of people have have loved them like the new national record for example you know I'm not really against the national style in general I mean I do enjoy albums like the boxer but honestly since that record I I don't see what the band is doing that is is that captivating obviously I didn't really care for the new Kanye album that much there were strong reactions to that but I think there may have been even stronger reactions to my feelings on the new Jay Cole LP especially since that was traditionally a lot more agree for sure my ghost album review caught some negative reactions I really think the band missed the mark on that record by bringing in a bigger budget bringing in more bells and whistles and just not keeping the songwriting up to snuff in comparison with their debut LP even though I was excited about it at first I was pretty disappointed by the new Strokes record the new Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds unfortunately did not meld with me at all some people were expecting maybe a slightly more positive reviews for the new local natives the new foals I was really sort of let down by the new Thundercat the new Justin Timberlake album didn't really do anything for me which I did get a lot of negative responses for not enjoying quite so much and even though I didn't really dislike it I think a lot of people were expecting a much more positive review for the new Boards of Canada album these are albums that to me just did not appeal to me that much for one reason or another but you know you're completely free to tell me if you think I've underrated them and also the third part of this that I definitely wanted to talk about our LPS that I didn't necessarily love that I didn't necessarily want to shove down your throats but but I do think deserved a little bit more credit and attention than they actually got when they eventually were released like the new Grave baby's album crusher and odd lo-fi rock release with some gothic tendencies that yeah there are some weird inconsistent qualities to this album but still the band's aesthetic their style and just their sound or fantastic the new Quasimodo is is still an incredibly solid release that I think deserves more attention the new melt yourself down album - it's a little one-dimensional but still some really great danceable Punk Middle Eastern African grooves coming out of this thing the new the world is a beautiful place and I'm no longer afraid to die might be my favorite Connecticut release of this year the new Laura Marling a very great solid front to back singer-songwriter album could be a little bit more eventful or engaging but very beautiful for the most part the new included record a very creative and very colorful and funny clever collaboration between ASAP rock and Kimya Dawson and on likely pairing but it comes out really good and the new Big KRIT mixtape which yeah I didn't love it I thought it was okay but blow-for-blow it's just about as good as nearly every other thing that he's released dope body has a really solid 7-inch out the new nails album is incredibly hard-hitting if you're looking for hardcore punk metal power violence and the new underachievers mixtape indigo ism one of the better hip hop mixtapes you're going to hear this year if you try it out so in your opinion this year 2013 what has been too hyped what hasn't been hyped enough what if I hype too much what are you hoping will grow on me by the end of the year hmm this mmm unfortunately it's it's it's not I still think it's good though I still think it's good what do you think Anthony Fantana 2013 so far forever 
zu735vXnvCE,dear hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and june is almost over worth the halfway point of the year everybody and it's time to discuss the best album releases EP releases all that stuff of the year so far i have reviewed quite a few albums positively very positively this year but i have narrowed down my favourites of 2013 so far 215 major releases and here they are remember these are in no particular order the new Kurt Vile album wakin on a pretty the very first LP I heard from Kurt Vile that I loved pretty much from beginning to end though I wasn't totally crazy about a lot of lyrics on this album Kurt's production Kurt's songwriting his melodies and it's his really relaxed attitude on this album are intoxicating they're infectious they're undeniable I love the folk rock and psychedelic sounds coming together on this album it's a really rich texturally dense album that is just really pleasant to the ear seductive next an album from the Australian band the drones I see seaweed easily one of the most dramatic LPS in this band's catalogue they've really distanced themselves from that punk blues garage rock roots to put out an album that is really instrumentally refined and just really big overreaching very beautiful singer-songwriter type album with some huge instrumentation definitely one of the best hardcore releases that you're gonna run into this year this routine is hell's howl this album has seriously been on repeat for me over and over and over part of that might be because it's so short and it's easy to repeat but man are the vocals fierce on this album the lyrics are top-notch in terms of just bringing that really fed up angry I'm not taking this anymore kind of attitude and just the riffs so badass so mosh friendly loving this album maybe a little more now I did when I originally reviewed it an album that I loved when I heard it took me a little while to get into it but I still love it daft punk's random access memories the band really came together with an interesting smorgasbord of sounds from the 70s from the 80s whether it be soft rock disco what have you they just weaved all these sounds together into what feels like just a tribute to this musical era that the duo must be really really fond of or else they wouldn't go to such great lengths to recreate it so accurately and so passionately there are a lot of revivalist albums out there right now recapturing older sounds and and for sure this is one of the most exciting I've heard ever another pretty big album released the new Queens of the Stone Age album like clockwork an album that I did not anticipate that I would enjoy so freaking much but not only are the guitar tones on this album stellar there's a lot of variety between the tones on this album and the beats the grooves are dark they're moody but Josh hommies songwriting on this record man did he go oh and I mean that in a good way I mean the songwriting on this album is legitimately dark kind of tortured and the melodies I mean they stick out Queens of the Stone Age really put together one of the most dynamic records ever with this thing next the knife shaking the habitual this album brings together African rhythms Middle Eastern rhythms electronic music and some really strange vocals melodies and song ideas and of course it's all strung out across about a hundred minutes of music with a huge ambient interlude in the midst of all these tracks I loved most of the songs on here it's a challenging albums of fun album it's incredibly colorful well put together very dense and intricate and yes so loose and raw and visceral and in the moment I can't stop saying good things about this album the new savages album silence yourself one of the best punk and post-punk records you're going to hear this year these girls really bring together the the darker vibes from this genre taking a lot of influence from Joy Division Bauhaus Siouxsie and the Banshees for example and and really hardening them toughening them up with some badass riffs and some pretty good lyrics clipping mid-city these guys recently got signed to Sub Pop Records and off the back of this album it's no wonder why because man are the beats noisy textured creative and just everything that I'm looking for in an adventurous hip hop beat really though these guys are a little further outside the box and I think some people want to go instrumentally once this album clicked with me I loved it and even though the beats are so out there Davi Diggs the the group's lead emcee actually does quite a good job of keeping these songs rooted in a hip-hop tradition with his storytelling with his flows with his rhymes it is one of the most creative hip-hop albums that I think you'll hear this year if you give it a listen altar of plagues teeth glory and injury one of the most creative black metal albums I think you'll run into this year though these guys do take a strong black metal influence on this record they incorporate some industrial sounds some ambient sounds some very angular riffs and and grooves and of course the vocals are incredibly tortured as well the band has sort of drifted away from there longer more repetitive somewhat post-rock influenced songwriting style and and made an album that i think is way more engaging and and exciting another great black metal influenced release death Heaven's sunbather an album that takes all the harshness and aggression of black metal music and transmits it through some really beautiful and sort of uplifting chord progressions and lead melodies this album is really anthemic it's moving it's beautiful I've never heard something so aggressive just sound so pretty I guess even though this isn't technically an album I do want to give this a shadow because it is one of my favorite releases of this year the two EPS that Milo dropped tour the beginning of 2013 honestly in my opinion things that happen a day the first of the two EPS is is my hip-hop EP of the year though it is still possible that I will like another EP more III doubt that another EP is going to inch this one out of the way with Milo's creative eccentric and very personal Rhymes and the fantastic instrumentals that Riley Lake brought to the table collaborating with Milo on on this project the new Buchan gas album general dome which brings together elements of industrial music noise rock and folk rock and indie rock into this really weird just jagged weird riff homemade instrument mess looking at this album trying to figure it out is a lot like just staring into a plate of spaghetti and trying to follow where a single noodle is going it's impossible that's never gonna happen best bet is just take a fork jam it in there roll it all up eat it and just try to take it all in at once and eventually the excitement kind of wears down but not in a bad way what buchen gates are doing sort of becomes clear the hard punchy rhythms the weird grooves the distorted strange sounds coming out of their instruments it's really colorful noisy and yet captivating record 2 because of the lead vocals from Erin Dyer which which keeps the song sort of pretty and gives them a strong human quality and next a duo that lacks some humanity but in a good way the new Autechre album exei man really interesting to our double album of electronic pieces that are challenging out there difficult and really just continue this duo's tradition of exploring creative refreshing electronic sounds even though this record is in a lot of ways is in the same emotional vein as a lot of their past stuff I do think these guys are getting better and just sharper when it comes to just spelunking these interesting sounds and assembling them into something that feels cohesive and and just engaging the new Ghostface Killah album with Adrian young twelve reasons to die Ghostface Killah emcee from the infamous wu-tang clan this is one of his best records I think period even though I wish it were longer even though I wish some of the features were a little bit more ambitious and that Ghost varied up some of his lyrical subjects on this album I do like the storyline I like the progression I love the instrumentals that Adrian young brought to the table this thing is is really like watching a b-movie revenge action film or like watching a Quinn Tarantino film I had nothing but fun listening to this LP and finally the new Ice Age album you are nothing another kick-ass punk ass but you in the face kind of record not really punch you in the face it is a pretty apathetic depressing and kind of post-punk album and I love the way that Ice Age is able to bring those moments together with some serious noisy instrumentation speed and a visceral mess to make a record that is just as kick-ass as their full-length debut actually like the fact that they vary things up a little bit with some piano a little weird ambient interlude the band is definitely getting more ambitious and I could see them coming out with more records in the future where they sort of stay in the same style but offer up a few changes and different sounds here and there to kind of keep things interesting alright those are essentially my 15 favorite major releases of this year what have your favorites so far this year been let me know just freaking tell me don't hold back just say it just say it don't you worry about what anybody's gonna think who cares don't care about what I'm gonna think about it say Anthony I know you heard all these records but these are my favorite records who can't say breath you 
GINcxJ20efI,Locrian hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's been a bit of a and it's time for a review of the new low korean album return to annihilation these guys were a Chicago band a three-piece and for about ten years now they've been toiling under the radar making all kinds of experimental rock music turning out numerous records sometimes a few within the span of one year and the music on these records is usually a twisted cauldron of black metal post Rock drone noise dark ambient music as well the band really emphasizes texture sound dynamics and intensity to over everything else you know things like a strong melody or accessibility and the band makes this pretty mountainous music on their new album as well on what at times feels like a shoestring budget there is definitely a slightly low fight quality to the music on this album there's a lot of ambient noise room noise surrounding some of the instruments like the drums the recording is a little rickety it's a little loose a little noisy but the sounds are still very heavy rich and vivid it's just a recording that's got a some character to it I would say you know it's got a lot of blemishes on I suppose but the performances are there the sounds are there now similar to artists like Tim Hecker or Boards of Canada for example the music that Locrian makes is incredibly visual its cinematic it's very thematic there are actually some pretty strong themes on this album I would say of Apocalypse vastness desolation and they embrace these feelings with some really raw drums some tattered distorted keyboards some heavy bass and some very bouncy echo drenched guitars even though the elements that look Korean works with on this record are very simple they do create some very strong moods with them using a lot of repetition throughout these tracks to really create a place in in my mind that I can sort of freely wander through as I'm listening to it some of the tracks on this record it's not like the songs really have a a beginning point and an end point per se it's not like they have a strong progression it's like they just are they're static they stay there's a lot of stillness in these tracks like the track exiting the Hall of vapor and light which has these distorted keyboards some wandering guitars in a very patient beat it is a very repetitive song but it feels like the more the band repeats these ideas over and over and over the more real and and the more vivid this soundscape they're creating becomes the more I feel as if I'm in it it's almost as if I kind of want that repetition I'm looking for it because what Locrian is creating in this song it's so evocative however sometimes the repetition sort of works against locrians favor because the sounds that they're working with or the music that they're playing it's it's really not that evocative it's not that moving like these stumbling guitar leads throughout the track to moons which I'm really sort of cold toward or the song of visitation from the wrath of heaven which has this huge monstrous ending which breaks in suddenly reminds me of something Mogwai used to do on their older stuff and I love the finish the instrumentation is really thick it's heavy there's so much texture flying at me at once it's overwhelming but the span of six minutes in between this point and the intro where the band is really repeating on this primal drumbeat these weird reverse melodies that are cycling over and over and over I I guess I'm not then thrall dwith this interlude the end is amazing but the journey on the way there is just not that stellar I just wish it were a little more engaging like the second half of this LP actually like the title track on here which is actually pretty multifaceted it starts off with these just rich twangy guitars that feel like I'm hearing a bit of a desert hymnal or something going on especially with the vocals in the background there's a droney interlude a post-rock like build up and then this hellish black metal inspired downward spiral at the finish it's a pretty intense frigging ride and the 15 minute closer is is actually my favorite moment on here maybe with the acoustic guitar in the heavy bassy piano keys right at the start and the song evolved into moments of noise of drone black metal and I love how the band keeps their sound palette really similar from track to track to track and even from genre shift to genre shift making all of these various influences come together and feel sort of cohesive as if they're meant to be together anyway this closing track as it just trudges on it becomes this deafeningly apocalyptic dirge it is it is the perfect closure for this thing and really encapsulate s' the cover art that we have going on here the lone shopping cart empty parking lot fog the Locrian rights on the South melodically or chord wise is definitely not as interesting as their sound play and it's not as interesting as their very wide mix of influences unfortunately but still it didn't make this album any less enjoyable for me what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it I want to give a shout out to chainsaws which you might hear in the background John Dan Kottke the hip hop heads reddit Jaime's world and Chris H oh and also the straw I forgot that in last video but if you don't understand that this is my review and this is my opinion here is a straw only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Locrian forever 
EWDeqO7tndU,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and we're gonna do a quick review of the new Black Sabbath album thirteen Black Sabbath from the UK Godfather's of doom metal legendary metal band a band that I constantly recommend if if people ever say to me Anthony how do you get into metal listen too early Black Sabbath albums not only can you just not go wrong with any of the band's initial LPS the self-titled paranoid master of reality the hits go on and and what's cool is that great records from this band continued to come out even after they switched lead singers from Ozzy Osbourne to Ronnie James Dio but now with 13 we're dealing with with basically the first Black Sabbath album to have Ozzy on it since like the 70s and we're working with an original lineup on this LP - except for drummer Bill Ward unfortunately actually Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine have replaced him on this LP for all the studio sessions and as much as I love Rage Against the Machine and I know Brad Wilk to be an incredibly capable drummer still just all the changes all the time just all the weak solo projects it all just maybe very skeptical to listen to this album the the the Frank Zappa and the mothers of invention album title were only in it for the money comes to mind when I gave this album a listen I I did get the sense that Ozzy Iommi and geezer are just really not messing around for one osses vocals on the rest of this album outside of the goddess dead track are way more on point and at times sounding pretty sinister even though Ozzy hasn't always been with Sabbath he's never really stopped singing throughout his career so it's not like he needs to kind of get back in gear with that or anything there have been critics of how Ozzy has performed in the live setting as of late but in regards to putting together the performances for this album I mean Ozzy's vocals came out good maybe he's not coming as extreme as he used to but for sure I mean he sounds captivating he sounds like his signature self and not to mention the really awesome harmonica solo on the track damaged soul it really feels like Black Sabbath is taking us back to the old days with Ozzy doing that and Tony Iommi's riffs they're heavy they're slow they're just dark but there is a little bit of a lack of momentum to them a lack of groove to them there isn't this vast chilling creepy openness to them that made a lot of the band's previous work just so eerie and for the most part the reason that is is because of the the very bad production choices that happen on this album there's just way too much volume and compression on this LP I just don't know what was up with Rick Rubin producing this album Black Sabbath they come from a time when there wasn't an extreme amount of compression being laid upon every single track in modern metal music because let's face it metal music more than most genres abuses distortion and compression because everybody's got to be the hardest the heaviest and the loudest and I feel like Black Sabbath felt some kind of pressure to compete in that lane unfortunately instead of just kind of letting the natural and fantastic tones and sounds of the guitars and bass shine through and that's another thing the extreme use of compression on this album really buries geezers bass to the point where you can't even really make out what it's doing half of the time I know that there are modern records that make use of this that do sound good and you know I I'm not taking anything away from them but Black Sabbath they play in a style that sounds better when it's not choked off with compression as good as some of the songwriting is on this album I can't help but feel like the sound could be so much better I actually think even Brad Wilkes drums suffer a little bit at the hands of just Tony Iommi's guitars being fattened and turned up all the way and in terms of just really structuring these songs Ozzy and company are not screwing around either they're not writing really short tracks with cutting out and just and leaving and turning in the other direction I mean they have delivered over ten songs here that a lot of them land in the seven eight-minute mark Black Sabbath is coming off pretty ambitious with their songwriting and their padding these songs out justifying these lengths with multiple parts moments where things speed up really awesome solos to be completely honest the solos are really the most riveting thing on this album aside from some of the vocal performances and the harmonica the solos are really where Tony lets loose and and and makes this record feel kind of wild and free which is really necessary given how much the compression and and everything else kind of locks it flattens it and makes it feel slightly lifeless no way this thing is going to be one of my favorite Black Sabbath records ever but I actually am am pretty surprised that it did not come out as horrible as I thought it would I actually did come out of this thing liking a lot of the tracks I just wish the sound was better you know even though I think the songs are good and I think technically the performances were all on point I I just think the sound should have been reconsidered you know I mean if Black Sabbath was gonna go all the way back and try to really recapture the magic of their older stuff by writing songs in a similar vein and believe me there are even riffs on this album that sounds similar to riffs from their first four records if they were gonna go back and try to recapture that magic playing wise technically they could have at least attempted to recapture that as well through just the sound of the instrumentation the sound of the production that's pretty much my take on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Black Sabbath [Music] you 
Ce07L512gG4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new smith westerns record soft will this is the third full-length LP from the chicago illinois pop rock act i first heard of them back in 2011 through their second full-length LP daya blonde and album that i enjoyed quite a few songs from with this LP sketchy songwriting and really bubbly mood it was easily some of the most blissed-out indie pop of 2011 and it wasn't blissed-out because of too much reverb or anything like that mostly it was Kandi Koated melodies kaleidoscopic choruses that bursts like fireworks but even with all of this melodic beauty and just really strong pop sensibilities throughout these tracks there was a small very tiny element of sadness in the band's music like white like as I was listening to these tracks I was imagining every member of the band apathetically playing the songs with a single tear streaming down every one of their faces for sure there is a really sentimental element to their take on on very jangly pop rock there were quite a few tracks from from their last record in this new record - that actually reminds me a bit of girls debut LP however this was not an album that I was totally head-over-heels for that I was completely in love with I felt that the vocals were sort of obscured and then some of the songs more ambitious beautiful moments were really choked off by the sort of low five recording quality however better recording quality comes through on soft will and sort of rides in and saves the day like a knight in shining armor making soft will I think my favorite Smith westerns record well is Langa's were sharing favorites the wild wild west is my favorite Will Smith Western I hate Cal Church esta but seriously soft will is is a pretty big improvement on the band's last record I think with the very boyish vocals the slightly jangly guitar chords the very sharp guitar leads all coming in loud and clear in HD 1080p the band does bring a good mix to their sound this time around you could really swim through there really heavenly approach to rock music and I think this clarity makes their mix of influences really obvious this time around too and in a good way pop rock psychedelic pop piano rock and I think a little bit of progressive rock too with the song 23 the only instrumental on this album sounding exactly like something Pink Floyd would have done with some really epic guitar soloing and some slow drumming ethereal piano keys the only real downside to this track is that it doesn't really fit in with the flow of the rest of the album which is pretty much just a very nice mixed bag of pop rock songs and even though pop music at least today is stereotyped a lot to be very light and very breezy at least I can tell that Smith westerns really labored over these tracks put them together and really took a particular approach to writing these guitar melodies whether it be lead one the lead on top of that lead the bass line underneath it all the vocal melody all of it really winding and intertwining weaving bing-bing-bing-bing together and complementing one another at every turn in the song structure hell of a sparkling synth melody is all over the track the opening track 3 a.m. spiritual as well as the huge chorus vocals wow yeah the bass feels really warm in the mix the drums have a nice punch to them the vocals are right up front and center in the spotlight and the synthesizers add this indescribable thickness to this to this track and others too that really makes me feel like I'm listening to the band live and I'm seeing this fog roll in from a fog machine or maybe some laser lights it's just this really beautiful extra piece of ambience and the piano changed toward the end of the track that leads into a really great guitar solo the band really switches things up suddenly in a very sort of let it be Abbey Road type fashion it's a great climactic ending with the vocals growing larger and larger and larger and this is one of many tracks on this LP that actually has a pretty nice ending to it with the band adding an extra guitar lead or totally changing the flow of the song the groove of it up like the song idle which introduces a totally different part of the song with a new vocal against these downstroke guitar chords or full-proof which has one of the best guitar leads on this entire album the band's ballads get incredibly slow and sort of dramatic too with tracks like white oath which is one of the moments on this album where the lyrics really stand out singing about chain-smoking you're days away writing poetry that no one ever really reads and even though the lyrics here are pretty nice the vocals do feel like the weakest link in the chain where they're straining to reach a certain note or maybe they're not really controlling the pitch that they're singing all that well there's a really strong element of why ninis of wimpiness to the vocals that sort of reminds me of a very early of montreal records but no matter what shortcomings soft will does deliver up from time to time it's really the instrumentation the production and just the songwriting that that shines through immensely because even on songs like cheer up and best friend where I'm not totally in love with the vocals I'm still completely enthralled with the melodies I thought pretty much all of these songs were solid and an incredibly enjoyable at its worst this album is a really good summer record for 2013 I'm feeling a strong 7 - a light 8 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it what did I review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to people who have dreams about me and Cal Church esta Mike C town zombie and 160k thank you only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Smith westerns forever 
2wRSAdDdUS8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new havoc album unnatural selection havoc is a Denver Colorado thrash metal outfit this is their third full-length LP if you remember I loved their previous full-length album time's up one of my favorite metal albums of 2011 on that LP they took a ton of influence from bands such as Megadeth who I think they sort of borrow from the most overkill and anthrax too and they really took to copying these these very old-school thrash metal vibes with a lot of passion and gusto and making them translate pretty well to this very modern beefy production sound now the production quality from their debut LP two times up I mean it was a pretty nice transition enough to make times up a worthwhile change in sort of a peak in their career however there is just not as much daylight between a natural selection and times up sonically or stylistically I mean the production is roughly the same the gang vocals are still there the solos are in roughly the same style the riffs as well maybe the drum sounds have changed a little bit going for more of that kind of very punchy plastic e sound that a lot of modern metal bands really enjoy having in their songs the vocals are definitely a little more over the top which can be a bit of a double-edged sword I think it can make this album more memorable for some people but it's to the point where they can become a little too much maybe corny some of the singing that the vocals attempt can be somewhat off as opposed to the gruff somewhat high-pitched shouting that goes into a havoc album that is very early Dave Mustaine esque and the lyrics definitely take a much more political tone on this record too government is spying on us don't tread on me kind of thing which is actually pretty relevant for this time there were socially aware lyrics on their last full length but they had more of an apocalyptic theme on them a lot of war imagery too and there are some other topics covered as well like on the song waste of life honestly natural selection really does feel in a big way like a sequel a direct sequel to time is up except maybe a little less catchy I do think that there are songs on here that havoc is not writing them with as much pomp but I I think shot-for-shot this album is every bit as good as time's up the issue for me personally though is just that it's a little stale to me what havoc is trying to do on this record which essentially is just a Xerox of their previous record and you know I do realize that they are kind of chasing after a style that's kind of their thing but the very meat and potatoes approach that they took to playing thrash metal was sort of made up for by how catchy their last LP was with this one just not being up to snuff in that regard and the band kind of hammering through this blueprint as opposed to sort of building on it or trying some new things with it it makes a natural selection kind of a forgettable listen even if some of the grooves that the riffs pump out are pretty good basically that's my take on the album overall if you've given this thing a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it Anthony Fantana havoc you 
JSjc0XzeImg,[Music] j.cole hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new J Cole album born sinner J Cole is rapper producer and one of the more worthwhile artists that jay-z is put on in a while and jay-z endorsing this guy having him on the blueprint and signing him through rock Nation did really give him a huge heap of attention and I don't think anyone could argue that J Cole didn't take advantage of the opportunity his best that he could with some really buzz building EPS and mixtapes and then with Cole world in 2011 the sideline story on this album Cole showed his versatility because he did have some club tracks on there he did have some singles some hits as well as more personal and socially conscious moments as well well well and Cole's production talents on this album led to a lot of beats that were cinematic beautiful sort of moving at points my biggest issue on this LP though was kind of the consistency between the songs and just the lyricism when he brags and sort of centers on himself I don't really see what makes him different than any other guy out there it's not like he's the only conscious rapper out there is making a lot of waves too you have artists like Big KRIT and Kendrick Lamar who are doing conscious hip-hop right now that is bolder grittier and incredibly emotional now born sinner in a way is sort of an improvement over the sideline story I think because it definitely doesn't feel like an album where Cole had a ton of pressure to come out with a radio single or at least produce a radio single that sounded like everybody else's radio single however the album still comes through pretty disjointed despite the title despite the really dramatic cover art and the fact that Cole comes right out front and center at the start of the album and says it's way darker this time J Cole lyrically and and emotionally doesn't sound any more conflicted tortured or even more religious than he did on his last full length the instrumental talent on this LP is still there for sure the opening track of Illuminati has this heavily heavily rhythmic beat lots of detail on these drums and the soaring whimsical strings at a really dramatic vadik Matt it feels like he nabbed it from the r.kelly track I wish the B is great I've tuned in I want to hear what Cole is going to say but it turns out that all he's done is is really just heir to rerun he's rapping again about how he chased down jay-z to listen to his stuff then there's haters and internet rappers and then as if it couldn't get any worse an incredibly stupid use of the word  in the song Cole spends the next few lines justifying his use of the word saying over you offended you shouldn't be so sensitive oh yeah you're homophobic for getting offended at that since when is the person who gets offended at the use of that word the homophobe typically the user is the homophobe and what's funny is a little further down the line he calls someone a retard but he doesn't feel the need to justify that I guess retards okay but  bad the only moment in the track lyrically that I think was impressive was the spot where he talked about Barack Obama apologizing to the Japanese and then saying where is the president's apology to the impoverished people who are suffering in urban America today and you know of course I mean that's an interesting statement but it's not exactly like Cole is the first person to make that statement and and it's not like after some of the lines on this track track track that you would want him to represent this statement the track land of snakes has a sample from a great Outkast song from their album ik women I and yeah it sort of serves as as I want to say a very nostalgic backdrop for Cole as he reminisces about this love story in his past and it basically goes like he slept with a girl he hung her out to dry then she confronted him on it and and I think he might have felt bad maybe a baby dose that it's really hard to tell because there's not really a moment in this track where Cole feels really emotional or remorseful and he's rapping about painting a picture of his pain and I'm not really seeing the pain at all on on this track it's actually pretty mundane story how he describes it I just don't see what's so special about this story or his delivery on it he doesn't even seem the least bit upset that this girl slipped through his fingers or that he might have treated her wrongly and what's even more ridiculous is on the song power trip Cole finds himself obsessing over a girl or a girl and with the really kind of flat distorted very Niall beat on this song the best things about this track are the Hubert laws sample with the jazz flute and Miguel who actually did a great job of singing on this track and if he wasn't on it it would have no single potential whatsoever it boggles my mind that this was the lead single off of this LP it's not just Cole's lack of oomph that really ruins these songs or makes them forgettable though sometimes it's it's sort of what he says - that's kind of outlandish like the song trouble where honestly the lyrics to the hook on this track especially at the end of the chorus where he says gunshots in the air but I am scared for my life this entire chorus sounds like a rap parody it's kind of ridiculous to think that this same guy wrote that girl guy verse exchange on the song lost ones from Cole's last album I mean that song was incredibly emotional in my opinion a little outlandish with its concept with him rapping from the standpoint of a girl in another verse but still you gotta admire the guy's balls for trying something like that out and now something like a similar situation on this album ends up being sort of a stupid punchline like mama did you J Cole and Cole continues to dish out more stories of heartbreak over women the dude is turning into Drake but it's not even good introspective deep dark sad Drake today this is like mixtape Drake except the hooks singing and beats do not pop and the only thing keeping these songs sort of relevant to the theme of this album are Cole's very small lyrical detours into career money and and morals things on this LP get a little bit more personal and ideological like on the 9th track here where Cole is dealing a lot with people who are rich people who are poor and the song forbidden fruit which actually has Kendrick Lamar sadly he doesn't really go in on a great verse on this song but even as Cole tries to make some wider statements on these tracks he continues to say things that make it difficult to take him seriously like how he's dropping his album the same the Kanye is dropping his there are just a lot of spots on this LP where Cole seems too obsessed with temporary dramas to to make a long lasting statement it's like it's not going to get any better than this and he's not seeing that his efforts are just merely building up to be footprints that are gonna get washed away in the waves if the track crooked smile with TLC on this LP isn't begging to be washed away I don't know what is honestly the only riveting tracks on this LP the only songs that I really really liked were the songs that came toward the end namely let nas down it's got a really silky sweet sexy jazz sample throughout the track it's it's a really epic instrumental and the song is essentially about dealing with the disappointment of hearing that one of his hip-hop heroes disliked one of his big singles and Cole does not come off as a lyrical God on this song but he does feel really emotional the song itself feels way more inspired than most of the tracks on this LP I love how Cole sort of makes a God of nos he obsesses over him he goes into his past but still is aware enough to call nas out on his shortcomings with dropping singles not only you owe me but I think he could have referenced summer on smash and yeah maybe Cole is not in the position to make these kinds of statements given the nas has a few classics under his belt but you could argue that if Cole continued to make moves this ballsy he might have a classic or two under his belt at this point the closing track on this LP is beautiful it really delves into a lot of those moral and religious themes that you would assume would come with an album of this title but honestly it's just too little too late I'm feeling a decent two strong five five five if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what should i review next and that's it I want to give a shout out to nori not kim yeas baby my baby josh and video games remember this is my review if you don't like it here's a straw only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional

t5jUbqtWJZ8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comment thing that have been kind of wondering about something we've had quite a few examples of over the past few years something we've been really hyped over as of late and that is comebacks what the heck is a comeback especially in the Internet age back in the day when bands would break up and then reform after an extended period of time it would seem that that would be a comeback but now with the internet and social media and just the idea of the hype cycle being the central force when it comes to album sales and buzz building not only do labels like to sell the idea of a comeback but audiences really like to buy into it - oh my god this artist hasn't put out an album in a long time it's come back question do you necessarily need to break up as a band in order to have a comeback like let's say it took you 20 years to come out with your next album but you never formally broke the band up or really even stopped hanging out or writing music it just took you a long time to come out with the new album or what if the band broke up or was put on hiatus for just about a year or two years and then came out with a new album immediately after the Reformation is the album that took a few years for the band to release more of a comeback album than the album that took 20 years to be released just because the band formerly broke up and what happens if you're a single person and not a group of people did the same rules still apply what about Justin Timberlake it took him a while in order to come through and actually put out a new full-length album which of course he did this year but before he actually put out the 20/20 experience it's not really like he left the public eye in fact Justin's stayed pretty popular through regular appearances in Saturday Night Live and some pretty popular movies or what about groups like Boards of Canada who had a very large gap of time in between their latest album and their previous album and in the midst of this time period it's not like they made heavy heavy heavy use of social media interacting with their fans at every waking moment though they did engage their audience and building up some buzz once they had a new album to present there are some artists out there who really feel like in between album releases kind of drop off the face of the planet which is absolutely fine I just think in the instance that the artist is actually popular and has some previous successes in their back catalogue their return to putting out more music and maybe using some social media to in the process makes them being back even more exciting because a lot of newer artists out there who are up-and-coming and really trying to make a living in the music industry it seems that their success is incredibly dependent on them not only putting out as much music as they possibly can but interacting with their fans as much as they possibly can to through Twitter and Facebook Tumblr YouTube as well so at this point now has the internet sort of changed the nature of the comeback are people getting excited for new albums coming out as if their comeback albums when they're really not let's even take the new Daft Punk album for example while Daft Punk was never that far away from the limelight I mean they just put out that Tron soundtrack too before the release of random access memories when they put out random access memories it was almost as if they had been gone for a pretty long time sometimes not hearing a new studio album from a particular artist and maybe only hearing a piece from them soundtracks stuff other various projects can be kind of frustrating so at this point your thoughts what does it come back for all the bands out there with breaking up and reforming for the release of every new album be a good marketing move what are the rules regulations and must-haves for comeback does the internet love and obsess over comebacks a little bit too much expect a bit too much from comeback records what do you think let me know thanks Anthony fan tanto comebacks forever 
XdiGRpg1Row,Mac Miller hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a hot review because it's hot in here of the new Mac Miller album watching movies with the sound off Mac Miller aka Easy Mac with the cheesy raps is a Pittsburgh rapper this is his latest full-length album I believe his second commercial release and Mac Miller has become one of hip-hop's most polarizing figures over the past few years now Mac caught a lot of hype off of his earlier mixtapes singles and videos a lot of which I liked not because they were deep and conscious and and pushing the envelope or anything like that but because they were just like yeah light-hearted then sometimes a little introspective and Matt continued to gain popularity but he was dropping more and more projects that I didn't really care for and putting himself in these lanes in hip hop that I felt where maybe I don't know a little uninspired either being just a very boring weed rapper or a bubblegum pop rapper his flows were becoming more underwhelming and and it was getting harder and harder to take him seriously when he would go into this more deep and introspective side of his personality this was at its worst on albums like blue slide park and the incredibly nauseating jazz EP that he put out under a completely different name and I am happy to say that watching movies with the sound off while it's not going to be one of my favorite hip hop albums of this year it is improvements on pretty much all fronts for Mac Miller with flow with lyrics production and features with the feature list on this thing with schoolboy q action bronson ab-soul a really awesome verse from loaded luxe sort of talking about the change in Mac Miller's personality over the course of his career an event of course Earl Sweatshirt shirt shirt and don't forget M cjp like tracks with the features on here he's really keeping his ear to the underground and just really keeping it kind of gritty and and picking those artists who have their own dark styles and Mac Miller pretty much does that with the production on this thing too blue slide park was definitely an album where you could hear him getting a little a bit more groomed and cleaner but watching movies with the sound off is is a step in the more underground direction bringing more beats from clamps casino on here one of which is on the track bird colin is not in his usual cloud wrap style it's actually a banger and Chuck Inglish is on this LP as well bringing some beats Flying Lotus is on here The Alchemist Earl as well Pharrell and there are a handful of songs on here that Mac Miller actually produces himself under the name Larry fisherman tracks like Starr room which is a beat from Earl Sweatshirt actually one of the best instrumentals on this album I did not know Earl had this kind of talent in him to produce a beat this interesting the murky bass the reversed warped guitars on here - it's all psychedelic trippy feeling kind of smoky blunted it's very colourful and the instrumentals continue to be colorful on this thing with tracks like avian which has these really interesting plinky piano samples playing over and over and over and when the hook comes through these champagne rooms strings start soaring over the instrumental of course the beat hits hard on this track as well as the song somebody do something which a lot of people freaked out about initially when it got put out as a single because fly low handled the production on this hearing Mac Miller and Flying Lotus on the same track kind of a surprise but I gotta say I gotta say I got to say my only real disappointment with this song is that it's it's not one of flying lotuses better beats it's really just Flying Lotus by the numbers if anything I think the name Flying Lotus carries way more weight on this instrumental than the instrumental itself tracks like watching movies has a really strong trap flavor to it there's a handful of songs toward the back end of the cell P that go more for that cloud wrap vibe and the song matches is maybe the most bubblegum poppy song on here with this really sweet psychedelic synth lead that was sampled straight from a black moth super rainbow track what I really admire about watching movies with the sound off the most is how consistent and then Mac is in picking beats whether they're trap cloud rap whatever it's all really just textured colorful kind of psychedelic and even Mac Miller's beats hold their own against some of the other instrumentals on this LP as far as instrument oh I really can't complain about not a single song on here now as far as flows go on some of his more recent projects Mac has really been putting me to sleep with how understated and and basic some of his verses can be and unfortunately that is still the issue for me on this album at times but Mac does make some serious efforts and some serious improvements the song I am Who I am which has really slow Spacey beat a really fantastic R&B style vocal hook Mac Miller is all over this song spittin some of the fastest flows I've heard him do in a while and changing up his flows to chopping it up into fourths and 8/16 in triplets speeding up and slowing down and a lot of interesting ways and the song birdcall is is another track on here where Mac does the kind of monotone understated thing but because the beat is so just over the top and because Mac Miller some of his lyrics are so funny it does work for him if there was anything that really kind of left me hanging in terms of flows its songs like Aquarian where the tempo really slows down and it forces Mac to slow down as well and as he is rapping so much slower on this track he slips a little bit in that of tempo and it's like going this pace forces him to concentrate more on what he's doing and he doesn't really come off as charismatic or as passionate and of course there are a number of songs on here where Mac Miller is singing not just on the hook but for a majority of the track songs like objects in mirror or euphoria the last track on this LP and while Mac Miller doesn't really throw out a lot of sour notes and he does save my ears from some really badly applied auto-tune all I can really say is that Mac Miller is just a passable singer on on these songs now the lyrics on this album I I do think they're the weakest link in the chain but it's another improvement for Mac Miller if you're gonna compare to his last few mixtapes and in blue slide park and I do realize that Mac Miller he can be a little bit much at times because of all the sort of goofy and and cartoony imagery and freeform verses that he seems to throw out there lines that reference blind people trying to find the bathroom moments where Mac Miller isn't showering lines we asked whether or not Jesus made a million dollars off a cell on the cross or if you get a clue what does the clue get punching fans if they get the words wrong or even being in kindergarten putting condoms in your cubby across the salba Mac Miller is is pretty silly but not as obnoxious as he has been in the past for sure the one downside is that Mac Miller's thoughts they don't really cover a wide array of topics really you got girls you got success you got drugs and there are a lot of hip-hop songs out there on those topics which isn't necessarily a bad thing it's just that when Mac Miller raps about them they're rarely assembled into a cohesive theme story or song idea but there are spots on here that that are pretty thematic like matches where him and ab-soul really seem to be kind of getting a little nostalgic about their past star room where Mac Miller really sort of catches the plight of his current spot in his music career and then there is remember which is actually a somewhat touching tribute to a friend of his a personal friend who had passed away even though Mac Miller is pretty messy when it comes to his song ideas and song themes and just lyrics and verses at times still if you take all these little puzzle pieces and and you assemble them and you put them together you do get a pretty vivid image of who Mac Miller is now this picture isn't engaging throughout this entire LP you're handed a lot of the same puzzle pieces over and over and over again I think you really got to love Mac Miller as a person to to really get into this album considering how personal it can be at times I like this album but I didn't love it I mean there are tracks on here that I really enjoyed but some of his raps do get old for me and get a little stale and hearing him sing while it's not terrible it just really does nothing for me plus you have a handful of tracks on here where Mac Miller sort of pitch shifting his voice for what reason I don't really know why there are a few spots where he does it to bring it to a lower pitch and sort of create this adult-like figure in the way that Tyler the Creator would I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout-out to lo the she brews slammer Dan mutant radio and Baz I love you only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Mac Miller forever [Music] 
O6HlyfasxKE,zombi hi everyone Anthony van Thanh ho here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new zombie album with love zombie is a uk-based electronic music producer this is his third full-length album with love it is his longest effort yet 33 tracks spanning two disks over an hour of music which I guess a lot of people have been up in arms about but I however have been a really looking forward to listening to this thing I don't really mind long albums obviously but I haven't really fallen head over heels for zombies earlier stuff either his falling Staib you where were you in 92 was a pretty decent tribute to break B electronics you can really tell the dude has an attentive ear with how well he was able to recreate this style of music and his next full-length album dedication was a big change of pace but much more abstract spacious bear I mean really so uneventful that I really couldn't connect with it in any way whatsoever emotionally despite all the genre hopping from future garage to UK bass a little bit of dubstep break beats and now on this LP trap zombie is actually pretty consistent emotionally he really likes to keep his sound sort of on the darker more shadowy side of things and it's not really because of a use of heavier distorted sounds anything like that he really prefers to keep things atmospheric lots of reverb and tons of space in the sense and the drum sequencing his beet production tends to be very minimal sort of skeletal but still a very very moody and evocative that is definitely I think the strongest characteristic that with love has going for it even though zombies productions are still very subtle I I do find this collection of tracks to be a little more enjoyable than dedication especially on some of the better trap flavored tracks on this album with the incredibly resonant bass kicks and the twittering high hats the staccato bleeping and blooping synthesizers all of these elements together do have a particular charmed to them and zombie definitely can write a groove but just like dedication with love really feels like a mixed bag of tracks with songs of various lengths some end pretty abruptly maybe the whole mixed bag thing was a bit more manageable on dedication which was much shorter but now we're talking about spanning two discs with it which again I guess isn't a bad thing if the songs themselves stand up but the extreme similarity of a lot of the tracks on this LP makes with love a slight bore at times there are a handful of notable artists over the past year or so who have worked two nocturnal eyes the trap music sound my favorite of them being Shlomo with his recent EP and zombie is a part of that trend too and then he approaches this trend again with that very minimal style that I mentioned and that's got its pros and it's cons one of the cons being that there are very bold or interesting differences between the songs on this 33 track album to the point where when a song ends it's like oh BAM another track really begun Wow there are some songs that just crash in or fade out into the next song and stylistically sometimes they're so similar that they might as well be the same track like the tracks Digital smoke or entropy sketch on the second disc here they literally sound like slightly different versions of the same exact song however I guess a pro is that this very seamless flow and in similar emotion going into every single track does create a very uniform and chilled out listening experience there are moments where this album comes off as being slightly creepy but for the most part it's relaxing with its ethereal synthesizers and really thick bass kicks there are a few standouts to me on this album the track if I will for example which has all these breathy vocal samples and this thumb piano melody which is really sweet catchy kind of angular it really jumps out at me and the song overdose is one of the better pieces of break beat on this album really one of the darkest pieces of break beat zombie has ever pulled together I love how he takes the really busy drum sample and brings it together with some weird atmospheric sound effects that are just twisted and littered all over the mix and the left and the right it's it's really an interesting experience on head but the thing is with this album every time I find a track that I think I really like a little further down the road I I find another track that has a somewhat uncanny resemblance even though there are good songs on here that I feel that I can totally extract out of with love's tracklist and listen to by themselves over the course of this hour-long album zombies really plain untreated 808 sand generically eerie synthesizer tones and phrasing really lose their appeal and it's not that I don't like the styles of music the zombie is playing with or think that there isn't potential in what he's doing there most definitely is I just think much of the time in these songs zombies sequencing and songwriting beat writing it's also overly simplified and shallow that it becomes pretty homogeneous and not in a way that makes all the tracks feel like they're linked together for some kind of greater purpose the seldom just feels like a fat pocket full of loose change for sure it has value but who wants to carry around $40 worth of pennies what really would have made this album interesting across its hour-long runtime is if zombie through some diversity into this thing I feel that over the hour-long runtime of this LP he doesn't really take a risk I can't even say that the length of this LP is a risk considering all of the miscellaneous lay assembled beat tapes that are floating around band camp now some of which I would recommend much more highly than with love I do like to zombies sounds on this LP it's just that they wear thin and they lose novelty because there's just not that many of them in my opinion I do think though this albums throughout does have a very strong consistent and in potent mood but if you're planning on doing any incredibly intent listening to with love you might end up slightly under well I'm feeling a strong 5 to a 6 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to graduates everything bites and people who think I have too many catchphrases at the end of my videos hey listen you don't have to watch 
IYgx27ANvVo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new Seguros album vinkor quicker if Seguros is an Icelandic rock band this is their seventh full-length LP and they play rock music with this very elegant refined and climactic character to it a lot of people label it as post rock and while Seguros has a lot in common with other post rock bands they've never really hesitated to incorporate other genres of music into their stuff - including ambient music experimental rock now after putting out some of their best records in the late 90s early in mid 2000s their music these days is really sort of in this state of change on their past few records they've been really evolving their sound taking some risks bringing in some elements of art pop or taking things in a very very ambient direction on their 2012 album vault re which i think is a record that is a little underrated yeah it's it's not as busy or as engaging as some of their older records but I actually think the band took to this softer gentler vibe really well now their latest record here is really a relative one eighteen eighteen eighty it's not the heaviest or darkest album that you're gonna run across this year definitely but it is heavier and darker for this band not only is this album kind of a change for the band musically but it is a change for lineup - their longtime keyboardist Kerry is no longer with them either now there were some tracks dropped before the release of this album and and they were pretty dark and and I feel that that led a lot of people to expect a very very dark release from Seguros tracks that had really heavy distorted bass like the opener and the title track - which is actually so thick with instrumentation that the song becomes a hellish whirlwind there are all these weird percussive metallic clangs throughout the track it is it is very climactic as well as just sort of tortured Plus it's one of the few moments I've ever really heard yawns his voice come off as sort of sinister on a track because typically his singing feels in my opinion very warm friendly sort of inviting really adding to this feel and the band's music typically that that comes off as as being sort of like I'm listening to something that is being written within a magical mystical land like a fairy tale and if that's the case Quaker is essentially hearing a very dark cloud of evil roll in on this magical mystical land now aside from these incredibly dark tracks there are a few moments like stormer where you're hearing the band deliver their usual blend of instrumentation their usual atmosphere but there's a touch of gloominess to it and the closing piano piece on this album as well when you compare it to the closing piano piece on Sega roses last LP it's kind of like night and day which might be an intentional thing after all vault re was one of cigarettes heavenly albums this new LP is definitely one of the Bands darker albums may be their sister albums in a way however I don't want to take it too far and assume too much especially since I feel like this new record from the band only feels dark comparatively I don't really feel that the dark vibe permeates every single track on this album even the songs where I feel like the band is really trying to get it to translate there are some tracks on here that feature some building drums and strings some joyous horns and sonically it doesn't really feel that far off from what the band has done in the past to me they're actually quite a few tracks on here that feel that way to me although I guess I can't fault sigur rós for making an album that sounds like a cigarette it's been just about a year since vault re came out it doesn't feel like the band is putting any less effort into this record if there's anything that's less on this record it is less climactic and and I feel that is partially because the band is writing shorter songs on this thing with structures that are way more straightforward they're not really trying to create this sense of vastness that some of their best songs do they're not really wandering out or creating something that feels a little directionless before they really kind of deliver a hard or very beautiful climax I just wish there were more tracks on this album that felt as dark as the title track in order to make this new chain and the band sound really worth it I feel that a lot of songs on here sort of dulled down the bands very lavish and and pretty sound in order to make an album that feels like a change of pace only part of the time for sure I do like this album I think it will translate well with fans maybe even better than Baltar II did because people were really looking for something more eventful than what the band had brought on that record you will have people that listen to this record after being disappointed by vault re and think to themselves wow this is just much more engaging this is better I'm with this but personally I prefer vault re to this if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you loved it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana sigur rós [Music] 
lieY0VQtFiE,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're gonna do a quick little review of the new Power Trip album manifest decimation this is the debut full-length of power trip a metal outfit hailing from Texas and they bring together the sounds and the Rivage of thrash metal with the brashness and speed of punk with some gang vocals as well over the years there have been quite a few thrash metal revivalist acts to come out and release some pretty decent records some of them kind of technical and progressive like vector others really just a harsh angry aggressive like toxic Holocaust while others take a more sort of very conservative approach and just really maintain the style just do it by the blueprint but still you know some decent songs on their records evil who I mean is really just like a group of metallica worshippers or havoc which is really just a group of Megadeth worshippers and powertrip is definitely in that revivalist camp as well essentially power trip is to crossover thrash metal what the exploding hearts are to power pop you have this group that is living today but sound exactly like they came out with this record like 30 or 40 years ago it's it's really hard to believe because power trip sounds exactly like cro-mags or suicidal tendencies not only down to the kinds of riffs that they play the way that they structure their songs and the vocals but the recording is well the guitar playing on this record is fast there are loads of whaling whammy bar solos and noodling some hefty breakdowns and plenty of reverb on the vocals and the drums really giving the recording here a very Bumi sort of distance sound except for the guitars which are right up front and center if there is an issue with this record though it is very much crossover thrash by the numbers I'm not sure if I heard a single idea on this record that I could be like ah this is a power trip idea I thought it was fun for a few listens and and for sure I can't really deny that power trip is doing this style of music incredible justice I mean their take on this style of music is is really accurate but is it creative I guess is the question however a lot of people out there including me occasionally love revivalist acts and for sure when it comes to metal music specifically crossover thrash powertrip is one of the better ones I've heard this year if you've given this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you eat it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana power trip you 
7CDFaYbl7L0,it's good you gotta practice a little bit more I think we're almost there hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new melt yourself down album melt yourself down these guys are a uk-based septet this is their full-length debut out on the leaf label an album that I just had to review after hearing a few tracks from it especially the lead single off of the selfie fix my life a track that was an electronic funky groove heavy and kind of psychedelic presentation of sounds ranging from rock music to jazz a little bit of punk Middle Eastern music African music this record is an incredibly energetic blend of all of these sounds blaring saxophones that that play melodies that are a little kitschy here and there the rhythm section of this thing with the drum kit and all the hand percussion it's really polyrhythmic many of these tracks features swirling weird very noisy electronic sounds and the band also has an extremely energetic over-the-top frontman who not only has some a powerful voice and some nice range but a lot of the tracks on this album feature him doing these really weird out-of-the-box vocalizations all of these elements combine in a weird way actually makes me want to compare this group to artists like ponytail or man man the Bhutto's band holy fuck and go except I would say that mell yourself down has a stronger international vibe to their music much spicier more exotic even though there is sort of this Western Drive in the band I feel to be sort of straightened to the point kind of accessible now as far as the band's performances on these tracks they're thrilling to listen to there are some serious energy just interplay to how these guys perform on these songs hearing a band play in a way that is this lively it's just like oh my that I am alive I can taste and see and smell and feel in here it just feels so wrong I'm just so in the moment especially with the song release the title of the track actually has an exclamation point at the end which is well deserved considering all of the very sputtering electronics the bass line with rides of minor scale all of the shouts and demonic horns this song a lot more than fix my life and some other tracks on here is really a jam the band really lets loose on this groove and builds the song into something that is just really kakuka cacophonous and sort of trippy very visceral and the song we are enough it's a track that is loaded with distorted electronics it's one of the few moments where the vocals are clearly singing in a definable language English not to say that other languages are difficult to understand but it's pretty clear that there are moments on this album where the band's lead singer is is really just sort of making up gibberish and with him singing against this very thumpy bassline this track easily is the most punk doubt on the entire album it is the first moment on this LP though where I feel like the band borders on being obnoxious slightly or maybe even a little one-dimensional even though the first half of this album is really energetic still the first four tracks on this LP they sort of blend together but mellow yourself down does work to diversify the second half of this release like the song free walk which is incredibly slow and relaxed other tracks on this album feel like a non-stop half-naked dance party underneath a hundred degrees Sun meanwhile this track is like an after-hours party and a tent people are dancing but it's a little chilled out drinks are being served their lanterns maybe there's a campfire the song is really sort of romantic and and sweet in a way I love that the band after playing so hard can just sort of do this 180 totally change their tone shoe for a different vibe and achieve it in a lot of ways I think the only shortcoming on this track is the band singer who is so bold and just so in-your-face that when they tone down a little bit on this track it's not like he really reaches down to that level and does something as sweet however he does sound fine on the track mouth-to-mouth which is a slower track but definitely a more sinister one with all of the primal drums and drones on this track it's maybe the darkest on the entire LP the band really goes from this sunset Twilight situation to just pure musical voodoo in a matter of minutes the track feels even crazier when the drummer is playing tons and tons of fills for the back end of this track which actually feel very heavy metal inspired overall I have to say this self-titled LP from L yourself down is a very fun and mostly solid release it has an incredibly impressive blend of ideas great playing production and energy I just feel that it being so short and just in this short amount of time a very small variety of ideas being presented kind of keeps it from being interesting from beginning to end because there is sort of a Sammy Sammy feel to a few of the tracks on here because of how straightforward the band's playing is from beginning to end on this thing really the most surprising thing consistently are the very strange and just noisy electronics I'm feeling a light a decent seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to shout outs which I forgot to do in my last video Kanye fans I love you little B Angela and Jamil only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana melt yourself down forever you 
Vns-81egipQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new kanye album yeezus Kanye West's a Chicago rapper and producer who has been one of the biggest names in hip hop music for the past decade or so he was a guy who I've admired for quite a while now because of his forward-thinking production when it comes to making beats very few people out there in the mainstream are as lavish creative or as eclectic as Kanye and it's also impressive that over the course of his career he's been able to challenge his fan base with a few different sounds and directions even if it's meant some disappointments like the LP 808s and heartbreak but still this risk-taking has paid off in the album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy back in 2010 one of Kanye's most successful albums to date critically acclaimed across the board except maybe not so much with me but recently and I mean like since 2008 I think a lot of Kanye's songs revolve around just this really boring portrayal of egoism and of course this is coupled with some really weak hooks some terrible singing and auto-tune still even though there were some characteristics that I didn't really like on this album I didn't hate it I liked it a little bit but the way that people reacted to my review I might as well have hated it and I feel like this partially has to do with how much Kanye's fans buy into the idea that he is so shocking and and does offend so many people but honestly from my perspective I feel like ever since Kanye has gotten more indulgent with his music and this is since 808 he's been stretching his talents really thin and Kanye admits that he's not a great singer but he still puts it onto his records under the assumption that it brings his album's character and for sure it does but I feel that his voice and the auto-tune just really the quaintness of it wears thin not only this but I am just not that invested in Kanye airing out his dirty laundry and I know that some people are and and he makes music like that for his fans and partially he does it because he's egotistical as well which honestly I don't necessarily see as a bad thing a lot of successful artists are egotistical and I don't really begrudge them that I think the fact that Kanye is a great producer and has had a very long shelf life in hip-hop music has earned him for sure some pretension but I personally feel that Kanye's first three records the production was classier the topics that were tackled were a bit wider nowadays many of his songs just feel like they're consumed by his place in the music industry his place in the public eye and even though Kanye does come off egotistical it's not like lie to ourselves here we know that you know kind of underneath all of this overacting Kanye is insecure why else would he feel the need to respond at just about every jab at his public persona and just how much Kanye pumps himself up in his own songs it feels kind of like an act which of course it is for many rappers out there by feel the way Kanye does it it's not exactly flattering in a lot of ways I feel like he's evolved into a grown-up Tyler the Creator where he's really just being over-the-top to get a rise out of people but at least Tyler can kind of come down from that and diss his audience straight to their faces for their glowing fanaticism instead Kanye just continues to fan these flames whether it be in his songs or in music videos or in interviews and I mean honestly I feel the eat rolls however I can't really say that that's changed on this new LP maybe it's actually gotten a little bit worse even though sonically this album is unlike anything Kanye has done before I'm enjoying the creative forward-thinking production but I'm pretty mad on the lyrics the hooks now don't get me wrong here I'm not saying Kanye is a bad lyricist period Kanye can actually be pretty introspective thrilling nuanced when he wants to be for example with what is one my favorite songs on this LP new slaves and album that starts off with a few chilling lines about an era in which his mother grew up the racism that was around then then he sort of brings it to the races and that is there now that he feels that he is currently dealing with he throws out all of these black stereotypes and puts them on display very vividly as if they had all been said straight to his face by the people that he rubbed shoulders with and even though Kanye is incredibly passionate he's screaming nearly screaming a lot of his lyrics on this track and other tracks here I still can't feel like as he's saying you can't control me it still feels like just a pastel commercialized revolution the same materialism that Kanye spits all over on this track is the same materialism he embraces on other songs on this very album and other songs that he has put out in the past still this track and another song off of this LP black skin had really put Kanye in an interesting position new slaves being a track where I feel like he as a black person is revolting against racism that he is facing down finneus turning around on black skinhead and some other lines on this album and facing down stereotypes that are thrown onto him by other black people there are moments on the cell P where Kanye talks about getting flack for wearing polos and backpacks there's actually a line on this LP where he says something about older rappers having a high school mentality it's moments like this where Kanye actually forces the listener to reevaluate racism today in America and cultural norms whether you're white black whatever the problem is he delivers these very interesting and aggressively delivered messages with just pure mindlessness and some really trashy lines not on these songs particularly but with lines like get this bitch shakin like Parkinson's don't judge him Joe Brown and a line about black dick being all in your spouse again and these lines are just all on the first track alone honestly these are like little Wayne level punch lines even though Kanye's production on this LP is different and it can be strange and and sort of filling when it comes to his lyrics whether he's angry ordering a croissant or eating some asian with sweet-and-sour sauce his verses are just empty calories I have no clue where Cantonese Minaj's and and I don't really care that he's going Bobby Boucher I honestly think that yeezus presents some of Kanye's most rushed lyrics ever it's actually making you wish instead that I was listening to his verse on the I don't like remix at least they had the funny Suge Knight line I just talked to Jesus he said what up use this I said I'm chill and trying to stack these millions like Jesus would even care these lines come from the track I am a God on this LP on the refrain from this track Kanye goes on to say that he is a God but he's a man of God his life's in the hands of God so stop playing with God with this level of very basically racism it's really hard to see Kanye as any kind of deity even if it is a musical one is what I'm hearing here somehow divinely inspired with all the very noisy and driving and synthetic production on this LP if anything it's Death Grips inspired the beat the beats on this LP shows Kanye jumping right on to the industrial hip-hop bandwagon which has been growing over the past few years and at times he does do it with a pretty attentive ear like the beat on the opening track from this thing on sight which in moments I guess sort of reminds me of the opening track from Death Grips latest full-length LP the track features this section of a bass line from an acid house tune and just distorts it compresses it pumps the volume up and just repeats it over and over and over against a few little high hats it's ultra brittle very noisy but I still can't help but feel like I'm listening to some really haphazard beat no matter what way I slice it or look at it it's harsh but it's kind of boring Daft Punk had their hands on the production on this thing but it doesn't really make me enjoy it at the end of the day I can really only say that this song is challenging for Kanye's audience yes it's not exactly traditionally enjoyable it doesn't follow this really catchy verse chorus verse structure but it's not exactly on the fringe in the same way that Death Grips clipping CX kitronik have been over the past few years this aside there are some great ideas in the production on this album but still I I come away sort of having my issues the song black skin had attract that I do like topically and lyrically feels I don't know just kind of like a Marilyn Manson instrumental that Kanye rapped over it's got this really moody lead melody as well as this drumbeat that I think was sampled from Gary Glitter and while Daft Punk did have their hands in the production on this thing I do wish it was just heavier the song I am a God does bring that heaviness that I want it's got this really distorted resonant bass a driving pulsating beat that is just so tense but the song has also got this really incessant synth riff that is completely obnoxious and the song hold my liquor while it does have a really great melody and some lush harmonies toward the latter half of the track that I loved to hear Chief Keef auto-tuned all over this song I threw up in my mouth a little bit there's just no way that could have been presented to be good though again I do like the pulsating electronics all over this track it's a really dramatic song and the track blood on the leaves I love the horns from tonight on this track as well as the vocal sample from Nina Simone I feel it's chopped up really interestingly and actually feels a little bit like the watch the throne track ODIs in a way there's a bit of a trap flavor to the beat but the auto-tune on this song personally I feel like this track does what annoyed a lot of people on 808 Sande heartbreaks and I'm not really seeing a reason to praise it on yeezus especially with the lyrics that Kanye delivers in this track with this party situation this girl taking Molly with him and then after this the drama unfurls in the way that it would in a very bad reality show the song guilt trip I was a little excited by because of how it recycles a vocal snippet that was used on one of the lead singles from cruel summer but the sample is pitch shifted way low on top of this there are multiple layers of sense some of which are swirling around with some effects on them and Kid Cudi is singing on the track all of this together makes the song feel like just a hodgepodge really cacophonous and and not in a flattering way and Kid Cudi the dude tries so hard but he is just not as good a singer as Kanye at this point especially with cuddly good music I don't really see what he brings to this track that Connie couldn't have done on his own and this long send it up with King L on the track whose verse actually wasn't that bad kind of understated and kinase wasn't that bad either it was kind of funny especially with this is the best thing in the club since 50 put out on the club but still the synth riff on this thing it just sounds like an alarm clock Kanye is trying to do something loud and in something bold and something noisier than he typically does but it doesn't really come off as harsh or aggressive or pushing any kind of envelope all it's really testing is my patience and that's it really especially with the very minimal beat on this track I don't really see how it's gonna do too well in the club but then again Kanye did consciously not really put a radio single onto this LP the only song that I really felt was stellar on this track was the song bound to the last song on this album it features a pitch shifted sole sample it breaks in direction in a really surprising way around the middle point of the track which I liked and Connie on this track lyrically I feel is just much more impressive than he typically is even if he does throughout corny punch line here and there like Brad reputation this sort of building off of a series of lines where Kanye is talking about how he has a bad reputation with women whether they be thirty year olds who are wearing forever 21 clothing drinking some champagne at a bar or someone that he is in a long-term relationship with and just the wordplay he lays into this track and the picture that he paints is just tragically romantic especially as he's not really being a very reliable partner he is asking his partner to forget forget bad things that have happened in the past things that he said of course maybe through buying this person material things I don't know what it is about this kind of production not only do I enjoy hearing Kanye do it but it brings out something in him where he is just a little bit more consistent lyrically and topically while Kanye's lyrics in this track don't portray him as a nice guy still the song feels kind of dangerous sexy alluring compare this with the storyline on the track blood on the leaves which just really feels like tabloid fodder which essentially is what Kanye's life has boiled down to since the release of 808s and heartbreak s' Oh all on this LP there were a few tracks that I loved new slaves little bit of black skinhead especially bound to but again I feel like Kanye has released an album where lyrically he is overacting and underwriting there are some ambitious spots on this album especially the end of hold my liquor or the track blood on the leaves especially how Kanye balances these more electronic elements with the Mina Simone sample and draws the track out to really be the longest song on this entire LP six minutes but he takes these great ideas and ruins them with cheaply applied auto-tune and again just really trashy forgettable lyrics which are things that I could see working a little bit better if Kanye were trying to write radio singles and just hot quick pop singles but I don't even really feel like he's doing that anymore I don't even really see my beautiful dark twisted fantasy as just simply a pop rap album which isn't a bad thing I think Kanye is growing beyond his pop rap past in a way but still even on an album as experimental as yeezus he reeks of it and these mainstream rap ideas that Kanye can't let go of they keep him from going as deep and as dark as his production implies especially on this album where Kanye is obviously mining from some underground hip hop sounds and I feel that he's just sounding like a fish out of water and is not riding the fringe as hard as the artists he's copying do this album in a word is incredibly middlebrow I'm feeling a light too decent v on yeezus if you've given this thing a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Kanye West forever 
KmiwDR2W2T8,Jon hop again hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new John Hopkins album immunity John Hopkins is a london-based electronic music producer this is his second full-length solo LP for Domino Records I first heard of his music after he signed to Domino Records and put out his first full-length for them insides back in 2009 and album I liked a lot of tracks from especially songs like the very heavy crushing and kind of distorted title track and a lot of the other songs on this thing - which had very eerie beautiful and kind of cinematic synth playing throughout at the end of the day I just felt like the album was okay though because it really felt like a mixed bag of ideas from IDM downtempo glitch even though I did like a lot of tracks off of insides I I didn't think John Hopkins would come back around and put out an LP I enjoy this much the mmunity pulls together a lot of tracks that are various blends of house and techno styles occasionally John will come through with his very cinematic ear which will lead him to introduce some very spacious beautiful piano chords it's almost as if he's doing a modern minimal neoclassical thing against some of these electronic sounds and I have to say as far as tech house goes John's blends of these styles are really good on this thing of course you've got a lot of driving quarter-note kick drums as far as the grooves go this album is is not very robotic cold or chilly but I wouldn't exactly say this LP is bouncy or lively either rather what John is pulling together with these tracks is something that is very textured kind of glitchy really dramatic and there's a very strong melodic element to these tracks too even if it is a very soft and spacious once-once one John's beats can be really thick and just dense with different sounds but he keeps it rather simple when it comes to the melody writing which is okay he does sort of do a quality over quantity kind of thing doesn't really busy up a lot of these leads and and still even though they aren't really in your face and they do take their time to grow and progress they are very pretty gripping even though a lot of what you'll hear on this album if you try it out are repetitive beats repetitive loops that progress very subtly John with the way he arranges piano and sense and just other sounds around these grooves it makes them feel so purposeful and lofty and kind of poignant without him even really saying anything on these songs this loftiness and sense of purpose really progresses to the point where the last track on this LP with these really faint vocals and these beautiful spacious pianos they sound like they're from a cut from the last cigarette it's not a bad track but it is one of the few moments on this LP that to me feel kind of just out of place really come in at a left-field still the more electronically driven tracks that John pulls together on this thing are high-quality the opening track on here has this amazing beat that is just dark it's subtle but very dense it's simultaneously noisy and quiet it's just so friggin textured I love it the murky bass line on this thing is fantastic the atmospheric synthesizers on this thing and I love that this song the way it ends it almost feels like I'm just gliding into the next track there's not some breaking point like okay this is a totally different thing than this job really holistically conceives this album after this you've got tracks like open high signal as well as Collider songs that in my opinion take a stronger techno approach the hard beats on these tracks feel mechanical calculated but both of these songs are still incredibly detailed and Atmospheric the track open I signal with its constant beat change ups and it's bass line which I cannot even explain I mean not melodically melodically it's actually pretty simple but what he does with it texturally it feels like he wrote this really smooth bouncy bass line and he's just like choking it and shaking it just there are moments where it's really deep and resonant and thick and then there are other spots where it feels like he's just crushing and squeezing it to get these very strange melodic undertones and the song Collider takes a little bit of a different approach with its beat it's not always changing up it's actually pretty hypnotic and very very repetitive but the sounds that John arranges around this track especially the really atmospheric sense it's almost deafening how thick this track gets the more piano driven pieces are beautiful beauty-full and had a fantastic counterpoint to the more electronic tracks on this LP I think the only song that I didn't really care for was the track formed by firelight with this really slow kind of distorted shuffling beat that didn't really appeal to me all that much a lot of John's piano playing around this beat is is very pretty as it is on previous tracks but with the relief arty-farty bass line on this thing that just felt really flat and just kind of bodyless there were a lot of reasons I just wasn't digging the sounds on this thing because of that track and and the closer like I said whose sound really kind of comes out of nowhere for me this LP does fall apart a little bit at the end but a majority of this album I'm telling you it's it's it's very long stretch out tech house tracks that lasts 7 9 12 minutes and these lengthy giants as well as these smaller piano driven pieces around them I'm loving them I'm feeling a light decent 8 on this LP if you've given it a listen what do you think did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to John Smith who made this picture Edward Snowden and the NSA remember you're being tapped my dad and the Kanye review which is coming up next okay all right only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana John Hopkins forever [Music] you 
F4idnSlZeWc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new mount kimby album cold spring fault les youth these guys are a uk-based electronic music duo this is their sophomore full-length LP their full-length debut crooks and lovers was easily one of the most buzzed-about electronic music albums of 2010 and that LP stylistically featured a lot of dubstep sounds future garage sounds a little bit of wonky as well and they're really going for a noticeable change of pace on this new record with more vocals more live instrumentation guitars drums they even have some vocal features on here from King cruel AKA zu kid on two different tracks one of those two tracks you took your time is actually one of my favorite tracks off of this LP I loved it as the record label Warp Records dropped the song up to the release of this album and part of the reason I love the track so much is because King cruel is incredibly passionate and convincing as a vocalist yes he's not always there in terms of pitch but I feel like when he dips in out of it it's because he's sort of really overacting and just really bringing something that's ah it's in me right here however the vocals that mount Kimi brings to the table on numerous tracks from this LP not as gripping a lot of the vocals that mount can be offers are very faint they're obscured a little bit too much by reverb and and in my opinion somewhat passionless and the vocals really are a consistent issue for me on this LP there's not really one single track on this album where I like them however that's not really the only thing keeping me back from enjoying this release for one I think the recording on this album is a little too low by really and that could possibly be the case due to the title of the opening track on this thing the home recording reference and you know for sure there are some great lo-fi records out there fantastic lo-fi records really but I I think that this recording quality bites this record in the but it really bites the duo in the but on here mostly because of the fact that the sounds really are not that vivid they're they're not that unique or interesting and the the melodies aren't really vivid enough to cut through the extreme amount of reverb and again just how faint some of these sounds are I know Mount can be from their from their debut tend to run a little subtle but the the consistently murky flavors on this record just really takes the life out of some of these sounds listening to the songs that were dropping from the cell P as they were being released was okay you know one or two tracks at a time but as a listening experience as a full-length listening experience this record can get a little monotonous not only can the sounds be pretty faint but the songs as well in terms of of structure the song made to stray is is one of the better pieces of drum programming on this LP it's got a nice beat to it it's very busy it's very detailed but the progressions really aren't there to keep the song interesting from beginning to end it gets really dull and when the vocals come in again they don't really add that much change to the overall feel the track because of just how unengaging they are there are other tracks on here like break well which don't really peter out into a full song it brings an interesting synthesizer idea or just kind of a motif like thing and then it cuts out and while some songs are short others seem to kind of drag on a little bit the song blood in form is one of the most obtuse tracks on this album it has the oddest most off-kilter beat and a lot of the sounds throughout this tracker just so sour and kind of unrewarding it's it's really a jumble a kind of unrewarding jumble i think as far as some of the instrumental pieces like toward the back end of this LP where I'm hearing what feels like more live instrumentation I mean the performances are fine mount kimby is most certainly tight nothing feels incredibly out of place but it's just all too breezy there's just not a lot for me to I feel like latch onto with this album the music just wasn't really moving to me there weren't many moments that offend me but I feel like this album is sort of like a minefield of boredom I know that's brutal I know that's just a you know a harsh thing to say but I just don't really care for it there's not much on this record that that I enjoy listening to unfortunately if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it thank you for watching Anthony Fantan Oh Mount Kim be forever you 
NUv6sK-7POE,mr. McCoy hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new missed a ex choir mixtape kismet this guy is in New York MC he's been one of the more underrated faces in the underground right now and I can kind of understand why I've been sort of on the fence with him for sure for the past couple of years his Lost in Translation mixtape back in 2011 was the first time I heard of him and while many of the tracks on this tape are pretty hilarious are very grimy had that very urgent just the gutter eastcoast sound there are a lot of pretty nasty and gross parts throughout it very great production choices as well but the tape is is a uniformly lo-fi making a lot of the songs feel kind of muddy and just sort of Sammy Sammy he's a little lyrically inconsistent at times but when ex choir sits down and writes a topical track or a song with a story some serious magic can happen now his last project that I heard man in the high castle which dropped back in 2012 that in my opinion was everything that was bad about lost in translation just amplified we believe but I do think kismet is ex choirs most focused project so far it's much less lo-fi than lost in translation and man in the barrage but doesn't feel overly groomed doesn't feel like ex choirs lost his grimy persona there are a lot of topical tracks songs with tangible subject matters and some really creative and colorful production choices on this thing - I really feel like on this tape ex choir is growing as an artist bring raw truths and some very vivid verbiage like the dirty fingernails and the witch doctor wisdom and the crown of thorns made of barbed wire in the track noble drew alley which has these amazingly heavy electric piano chords on the track they're just so thick they're even thicker and just bathe and the kick drums on the track itself and beyond this thing it almost feels like slow motion boom bap and the song cherry raindrops another track on here that I dig quite a bit it's a song that really reminisce is about a relationship that seems to have demised still it's a sharp piece of romance with how ex choir describes a lot of the characteristics of their relationship and some of the lines here are poetic whether they be about drinking another person's soul or comparing his significant other to ocean a west african deity the instrumental and the flow the ex choir brings are just so smooth they're sensual it's a kind of sexy track even if it is sort of peppered with some foul observations biting another person's lip and blood coming out and then sort of licking the blood off their face this person has a flat butt as well and the something-something on what I think is the bridge on this track too may be intentional but still not incredibly appealing and the song vanilla rainbows brings another side to Ex choirs personality on this record it has a pretty ridiculous intro with him talking about this passion tattoo on his stomach and he gives himself with a little comparison to Marvin Gaye and Isaac Hayes but in a way he does legitimately report on his struggle and actually delivers his raps in a very straight almost monotone voice kind of getting rid of the goofy element that does come with some of his flows and he just sounds really serious and straightforward just down-to-earth and he sounds this way as he is rapping about people who have helped him get to where he is today not only that but he's rapping about a lot of relationships throughout this album - or maybe just one relationship getting mentioned over and over and over a lot of rappers throughout their albums will mention tons and tons of instances of indiscriminate sex and while ex choir does indulge in that he seems really infatuated with monogamous relationships on this project whether it be through cheating or just being with someone long-term it does give him a little bit of depth and and personality on this thing like on the song hoes I don't remember which is a ridiculous song title and actually is way more tender than the title would suggest the song chains a pretty strong theme throughout dealing with jewelry chains and slavery chains around your mind mental chains holding you back though the chorus is a little repetitive I do like the sentiment of the song and the verses do carry through the theme of the chorus which is a pretty good thing especially considering that doesn't happen on a few of the tracks here mostly on the songs that get a little looser a little crazier it's not like X choir just gets really serious and personal throughout this entire thing they're very angry braggadocious and kind of cocky tracks on here too like the song tomorrow's gone a posse track with Danny Brown nacho Picasso and Flatbush zombies which hits really hard and has a few very subtle but interesting beat change ups toward the end that get really weird and kind of dissonant with the sense I do think this project falls apart a little bit toward the end though the song orbs in which the title feels kind of like a very small swing at Drake the song seems kind of like a throw it's sort of silly with how X choirs rapping so slow kind of goofing off on his lyrics it gets really boring really fast with how long it drags out what makes me even matter is that this song is pretty long meanwhile the song never running again is just over a minute long and lyrically conceptually I think it's one of the best song ideas on this entire album and it just sort of cuts out of nowhere and the bonus track on this thing x studio is kind of this weird account of having sex in this dude's music studio with of course a flash drive being mentioned a mixer preamp it's another funny concept that this album brings to the table but unfortunately it gets kind of stale by the end of the song X choir does here and there indulge and very sophomoric humor which does set him apart from other people but again I think he's yet to really do that in a way where it's interesting from the beginning to the end of a track or at least funny but I do think this is the closest he's come yet to making his vibe really translate in a big way to where I think just about anybody could appreciate it I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why we you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to and then a tapes Boards of Canada fans I love you Kanye to the MU Arts fuse and Action Bronson only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana ex choir forever [Music] [Music] 
b7FP2Jc8Uwg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and yeah just a little quick question here for you something I've been wondering a boat I'm curious as to whether or not location where you are geographically is going to continue to be a very relevant factor into the future when it comes to making it in the music business and getting your music out there getting people to listen to your music I am someone who comes from a place that is not exactly well-known for its music scene internationally or nationally you know really even locally a lot of people from Connecticut don't even really know that there is a music scene but those of us who have taken part in it do enjoy what little of it there is but it has been growing over the past few years and I do think that is do a lot to actually the Internet the fact that a wider array of people out there right now have more access to alternative forms of music whether it be rock pop electronic hip-hop metal what-have-you they don't get me wrong there are artists who are from Connecticut whose music I appreciate greatly rappers like apathy or Dan Barrett Giles Corey have a nice life specifically there are other artists in my review roster whose albums I have touched down on and praised as well I will link to some Connecticut music scene relevant stuff down in the description box okay now being from Connecticut but also being somebody who covers a lot of musicians every single week that are not from Connecticut at all that are really from all around the world I can't help but feel like you have artists who come from really the middle of nowhere put together a hot track that ends up getting a ton of buzz on the Internet if it can happen there why can't it happen here the truth is that it could happen here it really could happen just about anywhere which is why I can't help but feel that when it comes to having a music career getting your music noticed location doesn't necessarily become a factor for sure it can become a factor because if you're a band and you're just starting out you're in a big city maybe there are some in our people some Scouts in the area or you've got a healthy buzz locally and these people are kind of able to elevate your music because you have a ton of people condensed into one area who are huge fans of your music the general consensus is that if you're an artist whether it be in a band or solo and you are participating in a huge big healthy vibrant music scene your chances of being noticed have increased maybe the probability is a little bit higher but I think it's getting to a point where not only is the probability just as high if not higher participating in putting your music onto the Internet just making a really good album release and just putting it out there or just a quality single maybe a music video whatever the content is and wherever it comes from the potential for you to take off is is there even if it's with a small subgroup of people who are into a particular niche genre and the thing is not only can this happen in just some kind of random small town in America or just a place that's not really well-known for its music scene whether it be a city or whatever but Americans are seeing songs from other countries becoming huge hits on the Internet and then all of a sudden they're being played on the radio over here which isn't a bad thing at all I actually think it's interesting that in the next few years maybe the internet will do us a lot of good in terms of breaking down a lot of the barriers and separations that we have between the music scene of Americans the music scene that the UK has going on music scenes going on in Asia music scenes going on in Eastern Europe music scenes going on in Africa and South America and not only will we be more conscious of music being made in these places but hopefully they will be conscious of what we're doing over here as well actually I think that's probably already the case thanks to huge internationally known record labels but I'm thinking more from the perspective of underground music because often when I go out trying to seek out music from other countries on the internet I am sort of bombarded with what is the most popular and that's in because I don't really speak any other language other than English flu the language barrier keeps me from really diving in and finding what might be really groundbreaking however with people out there starting new music sites and blogs and and musical sharing platforms every day I see these boundaries kind of fading away so into the future will location still impact whether or not you can make music and successfully get it out there and get people to listen to it will you be better off as a rapper in New York City or as a rapper in Portland Maine let me know what you think Anthony Fantana location music River you 
pyVm1-MZ5Mc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Action Bronson and Harry fraud EP sob stories oh Action Bronson is a New York rapper easily right now one of the best in the underground on the east coast and mixtape after mixtape album after album music video after music video the dude has built up a pretty hefty and healthy buzz the dude's got a lot of personality though he does tend to run kind of profane and even though he does rap a lot about cars girls the more glamorous things in life food a lot of food however I do think he can be pretty hilarious with some of the things he says in his songs another thing that keeps a lot of these very familiar hip-hop themes kind of fresh is that on a lot of projects Action Bronson will work with an entirely different producer for the duration of an entire project putting out releases with static Selecta as well as party supplies one of his more recent ones and I think my favorite to date the project he put out with the alchemist rare chandeliers and now this new EP that he has out is with Harry fraud which in terms of producers is a bit of a change of pace for Action Bronson Harry fraud is a very versatile producer for sure however he has worked with artists who are much more mainstream than Action Bronson and when he does produce beats they are usually a little more I guess modern in flavor than some of the boom bap stuff that action tends to kind of spit on and of course there are some tracks on this pretty short release that do bend to action Bronson's East Coast whims like the song seven series triplet which of course does have a boom bap beat on it a very dramatic epic descending bass line and some really cool guest verses from prodigy and Raekwon the song no time as well as a very hard-ass grimy instrumental except this one does go a little easier with some very jazzy horns on the back in an electric piano improv Action Bronson comes through with that non-stop flow saying that with a few sweet words your girl will go down rapping about beamers porn stars it's not like all the songs on this LP are just like this though Bronson does use Harry fraud to rap over some instrumentals that do have a more modern flair to them the song strictly 4 my jeeps I think is a bit of a combo of some newer sounds and action Bronson's more sample based boom bap production preference the speedy claps and build ups on this track it's really just a hard knocking friggin beat and the songs the rockers and alligators both have trap music flavors in them of course which in theory isn't necessarily a bad thing since a lot of the stuff Action Bronson raps about many other more mainstream rappers who rap over trap stuff rap about you know he's rapping about greedy violent especially on the moment where Wiz Khalifa is featured though I'm sure it is great for action bronson be working with a guy that big not only that but action bronson really dozen right hooks very well for this kind of hip-hop style he tends to come through with a more repetitive just kind of vocal hook which would work much better if the if the beat were a bit noisier a bit harder hitting but instead we've got kind of a lighter very trappy instrumental that would probably lend itself much better to something with a stronger pop Flair overall I got a Sam a little on the fence with this EP it's alright there's some decent tracks on here the few openers that were on this thing we're really too short to be memorable it's really action bronson just trying some new sounds just using this as a testing ground to put some new ideas forward and just kind of seeing how they how they work out and of course the guy gets props for trying something new and it's not like when he was doing something a little more modern it was a complete failure the song strictly 4 my jeeps like I said is a great combination of that boom bap sound and some more modern trap like just style hip hop production and that's essentially the review if you've given sob stories a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it I what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Action Bronson forever you 
YNR8gi8WxmY,young others hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new young father's album EP project mixtape tape - these guys were Scottish hip hop trio who I first reviewed back in 2012 with their debut project tape 1 a project that got snubbed a little bit in all of the year-end lists buzz however that didn't really stop the trios progression past that point putting out music videos touring internationally landing a record label deal with ant icon one of the leading record labels when it comes to experimental and adventurous hip hop and electronic music and young fathers fit right into the roster of this label with their blend of hip hop music noise and low fine music African music a little bit of soul a little bit of reggae the mix of influences that these guys brought on tape one was really impressive not only that but how they brought them together the songwriting was impressive the energy and the production were impressive the only thing that I didn't really love about tape 1 was just how short it was it only 20 minutes now well young fathers have put out a new release tape 2 and unfortunately it is just as short as tape 1 not 20 minutes but 23 creating this very short blast of unique and creative hip-hop that's essentially the goal again on this sequel to tape 1 hit them with something new and then leave them wanting more the only thing really different sonically about this new project is that maybe it is a little less lo-fi a little less grimy and for sure they do incorporate some different sounds and instrumentation but they are hanging around in roughly the same creative realm and the quality of this project really does come down to how great the songs are the opening track on here I heard which is a really soft opener the band is definitely not starting this album off with a bang it's got these very light reverb drum loops and very distant cavernous reverb vocal and even though the album does sort of ease you into things it's really the beauty of this song that is so just oh wow the vocals are incredibly passionate and well sung because young fathers are not only very capable rappers but singers as well and I love the really ethereal wash of since on this track too even though young fathers tracks can be a little low fie a little loose a little distant they do care about the sounds that are going into the tracks and I just love the refrain on this track which I really just can't stop singing when I hear it insane and feeling dirty inside impugned daddy I really love the understated rapper inside I'm kind of dirty inside I'm feeling a day I'm really loving the understa stop okay stop don't don't do it again the understated rappers on this track really good the song come to life hits really hard it's one of my favorite tracks on this LP the instrumental to this song and a lot of ways reminds me of one of my other favorite young father songs from their previous project rumbling the kick drums had this really thick thud quality to them and the synthesizers which are very warm just Pig pile on top of one another in a crazy way and this track might have one of the best group vocal parts of any song and this pretty short release the group vocals captivate again on the song only child even though the song has a slightly different vibe to it with some very ham-fisted piano chords that are just hit as hard as possible with a very lumbering beat the beat actually feels like it's it's recorded foot stomping onto wooden floors or something and with the piano chords and the opening rap verses laughs it's a boy the song is really one of the more fun moments on this entire project it's a sin that it's only two minutes though I will say that even though young fathers does and their tracks abruptly they do pack quite a bit of structure into these very short songs tape 2 takes a darker turn with tracks like ebony sky and mr. martyr mr. martyr actually has one of the more eerie vocal melodies on the entire thing and ebony sky has a pretty dark or frein about a woman looking for love in all the wrong places and both of these tracks have bass in them that's it's very rough it's very hearty the production is so consistently creative and textured throughout this entire thing the song way down in the hole starts off very fun very soulful kind of light-hearted but then all of a sudden it kicks in is very dark piece of percussion with these clicking clacking paradiddles and this rising bass where and this just goes on constantly again and again and again it's like being spun around in a circle violently and the song queen is dead probably young fathers loudest song yet there is this blaring chorus with not only just bright ear piercing synthesizers but the three of them going simultaneously wah wah look really this track and way down in the hole two of the most unique pieces of production I've heard this year period overall tape 2 is is a great tape I love it at first I was just kind of oh I just wish it was longer just like tape 1 but the material that young fathers have laid into this thing again they come through as being catchy creative fun unique still the one thing that I feel like is holding them back a little bit is that tape 1 and tape 2 as good as the material on these projects are all they still feel kind of like a mixed bag of tracks not really like a cohesive thing the only thing that really makes these tracks or these projects feel so cohesive is the fact they are so out there and that young fathers really busted their asses to create a signature sound I'm feeling a light a decent 8 on tape - if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to your 1000 video my 1000th video this is um I I've had other videos you did the one zero zero zero yes my one my one thousand video menacing you and they sang one 1000 video nope one 1000 video one 1000 don't you know don't channel okay hey only the strong subscribe all mistakes are intentional Anthony Fantana young fathers tape to forever 
LvZ7ZQ_USuA,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new primal scream album more light these guys are a Glasgow rock band they've been releasing material since the late 80s late mid 80s and this new record of theirs is another addition to their ever-growing discography in which there are a few major highlights like Screamadelica and 91 exterminator in 2000 and this band's career has really been defined by almost always being in some sort of state of flux Primal Scream's albums can be mixed bags from time to time but their best and and some of their longest releases are undeniably cohesive and for sure this new album of there's more light is one of their more cohesive ones as of late I think it's one of their better records as of late it's one of their longer ones - if not the longest album period and Primal Scream's records that break that 60-minute mark do tend to be some of their better ones now for one the band is getting back to their more psychedelic side the more psychedelic side of their sound with numerous songs on here being really thick noisy heavy with instrumentation very repetitive with riffs that that are just grooved out to the point of being a little hypnotic and I think this is one of their more consistent records - with how much the band sticks to some of these more psychedelic and just trippy sounds this LP is just overwhelming with sound and momentum and and rock-and-roll swagger and it can be pretty impressive instrumentally as well bringing together rock instrumentation blending it with strings with horns of course this is not the only vibe that the band channels on this record you've got the buzzing walls of guitar and the blaring sax riffs on the opening track 2013 you've got acoustics on here backed with some sitar hard distorted riffs against some very sharp drumbeats song hit void brings a really shoegaze evite to these very just wavy wavy warped guitars their tracks on here the features some very strange see echoes and The Closer on here features Bobby Gillespie singing over what what feels like some kind of long-lost gospel chorus backed Rolling Stones instrumental it's a little hokey but it is fun it's a really big change of pace from the urgent opening track on this LP that talks about just the media propaganda rock and roll the only other track that sticks out to me is not being incredibly psychedelic but still is another favorite of mine on this thing is the track invisible City with its very just hard grooving bassline that that to me feels like the band is really getting back to their more alternative dance side of course there are some very peppy horns throughout this track too and it's got one of the sharper choruses on this thing even though it is short it's very catchy if there is one thing though that that I didn't really care for throughout this LP it to get a little old to me it is Bobby's vocals at times there are moments when I wish he was as passionate as he was on the closer the sort of breathy approach that he makes to a lot of the songs on this album can get a little stale and makes these songs feel say me say me at times the only other issue that I have is that is that some of these songs with this album being very long can feel overly long elimination blues tenement kid I think the vocal melodies on these tracks are a little too repetitive as are the lyrics they feel a little too surface level for me the track goodbye Johnny - suffers from this issue and on top of it just the the vocal delivery and the lyrics feels a little corny compared this track this slower track with another slow track on here walking with the beast which is very pretty beautiful guitar melody on this track it's a little Velvet Underground esque and and to me one of the more moving songs on this album I can really tell lyrically Bobby Gillespie is is struggling with something in in what he is saying and at least while he is putting down into words yeah he's breathy again on this track but with what he is saying it feels like a very personally painful track overall I did think a few of the tracks on this LP were underwhelming sure but for an album this long that was never a point at which I was sitting there and I really felt like I wanted it to end I was always in a position where I was just waiting for what the band was gonna throw at me next and in retrospect even though an album like that can get kind of old because once you learn its intricacies it's you know you know them it's whatever it's not a surprise anymore I still ended up pretty pleased with with how this LP came out what my listening experience with it was this record is not one of my favorites of this year but I do think it is possibly the best the band has put out since exterminator so do take that into account if you've given this LP oh listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh primal scream more light 
k-37V-1igRw,Boards of Canada it is hot is hot right now hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Boards of Canada album tomorrow's harvest Boards of Canada electronic music duo whose musical style tends to run a little nostalgic you've got a lot of analog since in their recordings against some subtly IDM influenced beats and even though the analog cents do carry a certain era of music with them it's really the quality the sound quality of the recording that Boards of Canada works with that really lends their tracks some real magic retro magic recording that Boards of Canada typically works with is so grainy it's so smudgy in quality it sounds like I'm listening to a reel-to-reel tape or watching a VHS tape or watching a 9 millimeter film reel and even though on the surface this does sound a little bit like a gimmick the sound play and the music that Boards of Canada brings to the table on their most critically acclaimed LPS is really worthwhile it's not only incredibly melodic and memorable but very vivid with its imagery listening to an album like write to children is like listening to the soundtrack to an old documentary film or a sci-fi movie and when I say documentaries I mean documentaries about deserts Tundras space or under the sea just the most desolate places on the earth it's like the duo is really making up music for some kind of film that is going on in their heads especially with many of the shorter songs on these releases of theirs that last maybe 1 to 2 minutes it really feels like they're pulling together some incidental music for something and even though tracks like the smallest weird number do come and go pretty quickly they are strikingly beautiful in the synthesizer phrases and how the duo manipulates them while I'm sure the duo does have a certain picture or something in mind when their career getting a track the the way that they form their songs it really encourages the listener to sort of come up with their own narrative as well which has really made their music very engaging this is roughly the style that Boards of Canada have come through with on the more successful side of their career on work record since the late 90s of course with some variations in concept and sound from album to album but on this new LP of theirs tomorrow's harvest their first full-length in eight years I can't really say that Boards of Canada have spent that time reinventing themselves or coming through with an entirely different sound or mood I can't even really say they continued experimenting with some of the more natural and acoustic sounds that they introduced in a big way on the LP campfire head phase their last full-length there are some samples used on this album whether they be vocal snippets or something a little more musical however they're not really any more prevalent here than they are on any other LP I feel and like usual the beats skitter about they're sort of repetitive they are cold they're robotic but there is somewhat of a natural vibe to them because of the very splotchy sound of the recording in a lot of ways on tomorrow's harvest I actually think the duo is trying to relive what a lot of people consider to be their best full-length album really their mission statement music has the right to children and while yes this album is ambient it's not like that's an angle that the duo hasn't worked with before and in addition to the more apocalyptic vibe of this record certainly the lead single from this LP sells that angle but I think that desolation that comes through on many tracks here that is a feel that many of the duo's older tracks have have toyed with in one way or another it's not like these themes haven't come up before with Boards of Canada but I will say maybe they are at their most potent on this new LP maybe this is Boards of Canada's most sad and remote record now there have been a lot of triumphant comeback Sauveur the past few years that we have observed My Bloody Valentine Godspeed You black emperor Daft Punk of course this year Fiona Apple Justin Timberlake - yeah I wasn't crazy about the record but a lot of people were so indeed there is more than one way to have a successful return to music and I think Boards of Canada is in in regards to buzz and and possibly record sales in some ways I actually think Boards of Canada's aesthetic is is more relevant than ever in this current cultural landscape that we sit in that is obsessed over things like Polaroids and as David's and as their technology and in musical expressions from 30 40 years ago we are post chillwave people and I understand the appeal of this angle I too love a nice revised piece of musical nostalgia but Boards of Canada's sound is is incredibly well established at this point they're not some trendy newcomer or even an old face trying out something completely new so even though nostalgia may be a key feature in boards of Canada's music is is this new record as good as their previous efforts is it just a good listen in general I personally feel that tomorrow's harvest is is a slightly uninteresting come back for Boards of Canada because essentially on this record in my opinion they have come back to do exactly what they have done before but with less detail less adventure less extravagance less memorable moments now for one I've never really been huge on LPS that bring together a smattering of short motif like tracks this is part of the reason I don't really review soundtracks on this channel because I truly feel that in order to enjoy the soundtrack to its fullest extent that the images need to be there as well the soundtrack was made to marry with the movie now I know that Boards of Canada's previous albums are all like that however on many of their old tracks especially the short ones the sound play and the melody writing was so vivid and was so out there it was striking it felt inspired it brought this sense of wonderment tracks like the color of the fire or triangles and rhombuses these were tracks that had a strong retro vibe to them yes but we're also experimental very psychedelic kind of trippy to the point where it felt like these sounds even though yeah we're familiar with them being from a different era of music hearing on this record it's like they're coming from a completely different world entirely I can't really say that's the case for tomorrow's harvest like the very short track on this record telepath we're really the only interesting thing about the song are the manipulations of the vocal sample and the very murky buzz and the bumbling melody on the track you ritual this song the sounds that it delivers feel so effortless for Boards of Canada in comparison with some of the busier tracks in their back catalogue it's it's really borderline offensive and the song collapse where I'm really hearing a bunch of synth arpeggios brought together with the sounds of wind it really feels like Boards of Canada are truly recreating the soundtrack music sounds the progressive synthesizer soundtrack music sounds that inspire them as opposed to building on them experimenting with them even the longer tracks on this LP don't have the amount of meat on them that Boards of Canada used to lay into them like the track Whiteside Klose with some droning sense some pulsating chords and a very eerie melody it sets an apocalyptic mood but it is not engaging for the full three minutes that it lasts there are songs on this LP that I like but I still end up sort of having my reservations about them like the song reach for the dead the lead single off of this LP which I do enjoy the song has a really strong mood to it it feels like doomsday with how lurches and just pulsates forward very coldly but I feel like how strong that mood is on this track has more to do with decades and decades of synth music and that kind of being an institution that we are familiar with as opposed to anything that Boards of Canada specifically does with this particular song I do like the way that the beat creeps in toward the end of the track but I have to say in terms of progressive synth music progressive electronic music out there what Boards of Canada are doing on this record just feels a little sort of elementary still the song jacquard cosway's is is pretty refreshing with it's very off-kilter beat and these swirling synthesizer phrases that that are really dizzying sort of hypnotic and they move I would I would say very warmly as the song progresses forward it's really sort of inviting in a way one more inviting tracks on this entire LP the track sick times has a very ominous feel to it but it brings that downtempo sound that Boards of Canada toys with once in a while and the song Palace Posey is is maybe when I favorite tracks on here has some great vocal samples very musical and I'm loving the the more natural feel of the drums on this track they almost sound like live drums and again with the vocal samples I love how strange and scattered and distorted and manipulated they are and when these local samples come in they introduce a really awesome chord change and the chord progression on the song nothing is real is really uplifting again another warm track in this collection as I said there are highlights on this album but they are as prevalent as gas stations greasy spoons and convenience stores on on an abandoned stretch of desert road because a lot of the cell P does feel like driving by tumbleweeds rocks sand and coyote corpses I really do think a lot of this album is pretty uneventful and the only way that the songs truly work together is to create a slightly forgettable experience which I understand is a bit of the point to create this vast sense of nothingness but I think there are different ways to go about that other than to just incorporate less elements less experimentation less melody still overall I have to praise this record for the songs on here that I did like and even the tracks that I didn't care for too much they were still immaculately produced the sounds were great and at least Boards of Canada were able to bring a consistent mood a consistent emotion to this record I'm feeling a light two decent six on this record if you given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to clipping who recently got signed to Sub Pop Records yeah Gavin Pia and Gerry Jen jr. st. Junior the third only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana Boards of Canada tomorrow's harvest forever [Music] [Music] 
ZQfeooofNMo,Oh oh my god I feel like a terrible person I keep forgetting to do this segment now we're like a couple weeks in a June night fool man whatever you know we'll get over it we'll live we'll be okay we're gonna be okay your mother and I are not getting divorced don't even worry about it no no it has nothing to do with you are a little bit a little bit to do with you all right listen it's June but obviously May is over and I want to go over with you guys what were my favorite releases from this past month before I get too far ahead into what where my favorite releases from this month or the favorite albums that this month so in my opinion what were the best albums that I reviewed back in May just in case they slipped by you a little bit let's start off with the new deafheaven albums sunbae there you wonderfully produced and written black metal album with elements of post-rock in there with elements of scream Oh in there with elements of punk music in there it's very very melodic and uplifting even though it is incredibly harsh in execution with its distorted fastly stroked chords and its blast beat drumming screaming retched just brittle sharp harsh harsh harsh vocals the melody writing and the way that this band sort of speeds up writes build ups and crescendos it's very very just I just feel like I'm running up a hill toward the sunset through a field of flowers and life's just feeling good just feeling affirmed I'm holding girlfriend's hand too or something you know and just feeling like I'm on top of the world so so yeah this album is a noisy aggressive on the top of the world feeling next the nude this next the new this routine is hell album these guys are in Netherlands hardcore punk band their new album was produced with Kurt Balu of converge and he brought a very very heavy sound to this record the band play is sort of mid paced hardcore punk and throws out a lot of lyrics that have to do with just you know going against the societal grain if you will not accepting what's been handed to you and a load of other sort of just frustrated imagery it's still the riff writing is very much friendly the songs are great they're catchy I just love the ferocity that this band brings to the table with this pretty short album it's really enjoyable front to back next the new Daft Punk album random access memories this is one of the LPS that I think over the past month people have been really curious as to why I like it or rather why they should like it and you know I'm just gonna say straight up here because maybe this did not come across clearly enough in my review maybe because I was so excited about the album yes I know this album was hot however this album is still very very very much a niche thing not everybody wants a disco funk album you know and I mean not everyone wants a cent funk soft rock disco album with production on it the harkens back to the 80s more than it does the 70s with it's very sort of clean shiny quality and I agree with what some critics have been saying and that if another artist came out with this record then maybe people would be less hyped over it however Daft Punk did come out with this record and I did end up enjoying it that is the current situation and the situation that we are in is the situation that we deal with and it just so happens that I enjoy the hell out of this record next the new Dillinger Escape Plan record if you're looking for a metalcore album that will do backflips around any other metalcore album that is sure to be released this year with its really really intense and angular riff egde then do listen to this album one of us is the killer I just love how how fast the band plays on some of these guitar parts that they've right now and I really think the mr. bungle might patent influences that have always been with this band have really come out in a big way album and the new altar of plagues album teeth glory and injury a really interesting metal album that is truly a mixed bag of not only black metal but industrial music - a little bit of ambient music really a slew of different musical styles brought together under this this very dark tortured umbrella really this is gonna be one of my favourite albums of of this year I think because of how over-the-top the vocals are because of how sticky some of these riffs are and just how odd some of these songs are in terms of song structure and kind of surprising they are to this album even though it is sort of all over the place it's it's just so intense from beginning to end a lot of loudness I enjoyed this past month maybe will mellow out this June maybe maybe we're gonna mellow out a little bit if you've given anything to listen from this past month and I'm sure you have what were some of your favorite records from May and maybe you know up to the point of the start of June I know this is gonna be on the next one I love you okay have a good day the needle drop brother 
EWNqiY8HNpU,[Applause] everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and gonna do a quick review here of the new logic mixtape welcome to forever a release that I just had to get thoughts down on with video because just a lot a lot of people have been asking me the student is an up-and-coming Maryland rapper although maybe not up-and-coming anymore he's really where a rapper would want to be he's recently been signed to Def Jam from what I understand he is a 2013 double XL freshman he's got a new mixtape out young Sinatra welcome to forever and I mean I I have watched people freak out over this guy's projects time and time again and while I don't really think he's he's bad I mean I've I failed really to get my excitement level up to you know what what what I'm seeing a lot of people are at I guess for sure by traditional rap standards this dude can spit you can't even deny that this guy is a spitter through and through but in my opinion he sort of has this unwillingness to work outside of sounds and stories and blueprints that were already formed before he came around not only just boom bap sounds which occasionally come up in his songs but other popular rap styles and genres too his last big mixtape undeniable genre hopped a lot as well as much as his new one logic is just as happy to do boom bap as he is trap or pop rap or even rap over some really popular instrumentals occasionally his instrumentals reference a little bit of jazz rap and he does that rap singer thing too where he gets a little tender or he just sings on the hook and the way the Drake would or Kid Cudi but I liken his singing style a little bit more toward the drake side of things and you know while everything that logic does on his mixtapes as he tries one sound after another none of it really comes off as terrible i mean i guess there are songs on this tape in his previous tapes that i don't really like but mostly it has to do with not really caring for the style that he's going for to me overall his projects just feel like they don't really have much in the way of focus because he just wants to do a little bit of everything and offer his listeners some kind of mixed buffet and while I do have to give this guy huge points on his versatility it's not like he performs on any of these rap styles as well as some of the big names in them in my opinion his boom-bap style stuff doesn't really grip me in the way that pro era's does his trap stuff doesn't really come off as as just over the top or as just in your face or as memorable as maybe a guy like waka flocka flame or Gucci Mane would for sure on this new mixtape this dude had guts to rap over the miss Jackson instrumental and truth be told that's really one of the better tracks on this entire project lyrically flow wise what does end up sort of defining logic and and sort of giving him style at the end of the day as he jumps from one rap style to the next is that his lyrics can get kind of personal and delve into things like his past with his mother his race his skin color spots like this can get pretty heavy but I'm sort of wondering where is he gonna go once all this dirty laundry is out on the line you know what I mean because once we've heard these stories there's only so many ways he can frame them where they're gonna keep being interesting you know and at this point he's still really yet to form his own sound right now he's making mixtapes that sound like the exact kind of album a major labeled want him to make some kind of focus-grouped okay we need a soft song here for this group of people we need a hard song here for this group of people we need a trap song here for this group of people we need a song like this because gonna be a hit on the radio there's too many albums out there doing that already and I do you know I will say that for sure logic is is a vibrant dude in terms of his his energy on the mic I mean I would just love to see this guy settled down with a few producers and instead of you know maybe a ton of different ones or at least a few a few of the sounds that he likes to play with and really sort of focus them you know and and if he could do that I think he could do great things you know not just sort of be this rapper who jumps around on a million different sounds that were around before him you know really do something that people odd that's what a logic song sounds like I mean to me I'm after listening to a handful of his projects I still don't know that you know I still don't know what a logic song sounds like I'm sort of doing this video because I'm curious as to as to what you guys think you know I'm gonna read your comments on this let me know what did you think of this new mixtape of logics if you gave it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it Anthony Fantana logic forever [Music] 
cT-jGQ2bpgg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd like my new curtain pretty depressing basically I hope you don't mind me doing a short little review over here of the new pharmacon album abandoned pharmacon is the experimental music project of Margaret whose last name I imagine is pronounced char da if her last name is as French as I imagined it to be she's been involved with the fringe side of music since she was about 17 and this new LP of her seems to be her first kind of big commercial full-length effort it's out now on sacred bones records now considering the genres that Margaret toys with on this record noise music little bit of ambient music power electronics some people will say I'm actually surprised that she doesn't have more music in her discography I'm talking like hundreds upon hundreds of just home recorded CD ours and cassettes of semi-improvised noise pieces but actually that's not the case in fact her discography is is somewhat sparse and from why I read about her she doesn't really improvise her pieces whatsoever they're all very methodical they're all very planned out they have clear cohesive patterns to them and for sure abandon is an album though it is noisy it is pretty organized it is pretty detailed though still very over-the-top as you can imagine with plenty of blood-curdling shrieks coming out of Margaret's mouth on some of these tracks especially the opener on here which which really to me feels like Margaret's mouth is just Pandora's box she just opens it and pretty much every sound you can imagine being in hell comes out it's a no surprise to me that she describes her music in a way to be kind of an exorcism for sure it feels that way now as far as lyrical content what she is saying if in fact she is saying anything is is pretty into sight durable though that doesn't necessarily ruin the tracks for me really her vocals are just for added sound added effect if you will as far as other sounds on this album Margaret is is pretty great when it comes to sound craft whether it be some very murky vocals that might be performed live might be pretty recorded and kind of looped and layered on top of one another to make this kind of psychedelic theory wall of vocals which happens on the second half of the track ache it's a really dreary atmosphere this creates or whether it be just very droning sharp high-pitched ear piercing electronics like on the track pitted and of course on top of these very sharp electronics Margaret is bringing these vocals that are just very stony very cold very deadpan the song is backed up with this industrially flavored Bank Lang percussion and the drone at the end of this track gets so sharp it gets so sharp as the song finishes it's like dentist drills going straight into my skull even though this album can be pretty abrasive at times it is somewhat hypnotic and kind of alluring with its eeriness its ominous 'no sand it's it's repetition one of the tracks on here crawling on bruised knees might be my favorite on this album for one there are these repetitious samples happening throughout the track that feels like margaret was pointing a microphone at a low-flying plane it does effectively create a very weird vibe for this tune I like the very minimal repetitive beat on this track the very treated vocals it's like a robot just screaming for the end of its life suffering and pain or something the issue for me with this track and many other tracks really just this album as a whole is that there is ear grabbing sound play and ferocity throughout this thing but the songs and the sounds and ideas really lose their luster over these six or seven minute song lengths that really don't feature that much progression in my opinion a lot of the tracks on here just close out with me feeling they didn't really do much outside of just repeat the original idea that it introduced which which of course was interesting when it was first introduced but by the time the album is over the song is over rather I'm just on the fence the songs on your only end up to me being memorable for their elements not really how they assembled them and of course the very disjointed 27 minute long closing track on here which I suspect was kind of added as an album only track on the high tunes to get people to buy the whole LP as opposed to just a few songs off of it that track really just didn't do anything for me and sort of epitomizes my issue with this album at times it's that it can be intense but the intensity doesn't really progress or go much of anywhere a lot of ideas on here are pretty good but very disjointed and don't build on one another really for sure I'm looking forward to future music coming out of this project there is a lot of potential here I think Margaret like I said is great when it comes to intensity and when it comes to mood and when it comes to sounds it's just building these songs out to something that feels engaging for six or seven minutes that I think needs to to happen Plus that there's just a handful of songs on this LP just four tracks outside with a very long closing track of course on a future pharmacon release I would want to see some more material as well yeah I'm just sort of on the fence with this LP if you've given them to listen what did you think of it love it hate it why and that's it pharmacon anthony Fantana you 
95Y5IyPsMpc,baby baby baby baby baby baby bbbbbb beep hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Thundercat album apocalypse Thundercat is a virtuoso bass player and a songwriter from LA who went from suicidal tendencies band member to flagship artist on the brain feeder Records label in the matter of a few years through some really nice contributions to the music of Flying Lotus and a pretty well-received debut full-length LP the Golden Age of Apocalypse an album that did feature production from Flying Lotus on it and brought together his love of wonky and just Spacey experimental electronics and hip hop together with Thundercats love of new jazz jazz fusion jazz funk some of the songs were kinda brief and the vocals were not the best but the album still had incredible aura about it and and was one of my favorite LPS the year got dropped mostly because of the very flashy bass lines and melody writing the very progressive kind of futuristic production however in my opinion I don't feel that Apocalypse brings a lot of what made the Golden Age of Apocalypse so charming to begin with even though Thundercat does take a lot of influence from jazz and jazz fusion this record is still pretty overwhelmingly electronic and and that's fine I mean his last record was electronic as well but that really progressive futuristic forward-thinking vibe of the sounds that are going into Thundercats music seems to have kind of disappeared and has left some of the more upbeat songs on this album feeling like mere demos of tracks that would have definitely come out in the era of music that Thundercat pulls from influentially they just feel as if I'm hearing sequence drums behind some very vocal and bass and since mixing and really what these songs are awaiting is is a real studio recording with a full live band songs like heartbeats and setbacks as well as the track oh it's X there quite a few passable songs you know verse chorus verse type songs on this record and there are other tracks on here that don't really feel like songs at all songs that are more motif like tracks that to me sound unengaging and kind of uninspired in just about every way that you could look at them like the very dark bass line and the hissing sounds on the track crack crack crack crack the life aquatic attract the sets a pretty ominous tone and really does nothing with it for a very repetitive two minutes I feel the same thing about the track seven and then there are the vocals which of course had never really been Thundercats strongest point on his records but he's easily overcome that issue with very forward-thinking beats and sounds and sound craft is great playing and his melodies which a lot of the time are very angular memorable kind of sweet jazzy but on a lot of tracks here his pitch is just is just barely there or it's hanging on to the note he's singing by a thread on top of it his vocals on many tracks here are touched with this reverb effect that is very very thinning making his voice feel even more weak than than it is when he reaches up into his falsetto not only that but Thundercats vocal delivery on these tracks is pretty flatlined as well to me it feels like I'm listening to a really nervous performer at a vocal recital there are definitely flashes of interesting moments on this record for me songs like special stage which has a very sweet pretty and contortionist melody on it that just does backflips all over the track even though it is very slow and kind of a motive though the lyrics are a little corny don't you know you rock my world the synth melodies that come through right at the beginning on the track oh it's X I mean they're really fun which is something this album is incredibly lacking in especially since a lot of the grooves that the beats on this record are supposed to be driving are so corpse-like aside from ocean it's X many of the songs on here are just stiff as hell the track the actually felt like it had live drumming in the mix the grooves that the drum were playing were very hard there was an improv there against the bass it felt like I was hearing some live-in-the-moment action on this particular track which excited me in a sense because I've caught Thundercat live before and him in his band that he performs with are amazing but the improvisations toward the end of the track weren't really all that memorable though they were really chaotic and kind of noisy and the recording on the drums on this track just sounds like crap I mean it's just a lot of noise and I can't really make out a lot of the details and just a lot of the finesse that was going into the drumming on this song because it's just really so rough around the edges and thrown together so with the weak songs on this album the boring melodies the pretty cringe-worthy vocal performances and the loss of just flavor and style and direction on this album I was incredibly disappointed with this release I think the only song on this LP that I liked was the six minute closer it was the most ambitious part of this LP and in my opinion the only moment that still had that futuristic flair to it that Thunder cast so fantastically brought to his debut the song starts off with some really sweet epic strings great piano the instrumentation builds and when Thundercat starts singing he's sort of forgoes the falsetto and is singing very nicely on this track and is delivering some beautifully commemorative lyrics for for a late friend easily this track was the most inspired moment on the album for me everything else was either something I didn't like at all or I was just sort of on the fence with and just really not feeling anything from whether it be something positive or negative unfortunately I mean I'm feeling decent two strong three on this record if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to John Tucker tell Ilana and Rick only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional the needle drop thundercat apocalypse forever [Music] [Music] 
98AjeD_2AFc,I thought it was Chris Rock hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Laura Marling record once I was an eagle Laura Marling is a UK singer-songwriter this is her fourth full-length LP up until this point she's always been a musician who I've never really been enthralled with enough to enjoy one of her full lengths from beginning to end but for sure I have enjoyed some of her singles like the song Sofia one of the bigger tracks from her last full-length LP a song that features some very tenderly finger picked acoustic guitar melodies that follow very shyly in Laura's vocal melody and Laura's vocal is a pretty impressive one she has a nice range especially when she's digging down into her lower and when her voice gets really husky sort of beautiful and very womanly which she does quite a bit on this new LP now as her albums have progressed Laura has been stripping things back more and more instrumentally and and I feel on this album she is really down to the acoustic bare essentials acoustic guitar upright bass piano hand percussion but some drum kit as well cello and this instrumental shift has made for a very very intimate album right here songs that are moodier to to me the direction she's been going in very slowly up to the point of this new album is is a very welcome change from her very early stuff which was way more indie folk much more full pop reminded me a little bit of Jenny Lewis or even Feist at times and now on this new album Laura is coming off way more influenced by artists like Joni Mitchell though I will say the differences between Laura's songwriting style and Joanie's are still very much apparent Laura is very direct with her melodies very direct with her emotions and storytelling even though her lyrics can be a little cryptic here and there now even though Laura is going a little quieter on this LP than she did with her previous and and that might seem a little scary especially since Laura's demeanor is so subtle to begin with on top of it we've got sixteen tracks on this thing in the hour of music and I will admit this thing is off to a sort of slow start with this triage of tracks that really segue into one another seamlessly if you're not paying close attention it feels like one continuous song songs like take the night off and I was an eagle and you know a lot of the instrumental performances on these tracks to me feel somewhat inoffensive really not all that moving or exciting though there are some things I like about these tracks like the building cello and guitar passages on the track I was an eagle or even Laura's vocal on the track you know where she is sitting on the edge between spoken word and singing and moments like this is when Laura comes off very very earnest and it really hooks me damn oh the hippies that step empty footed however I would say after these tracks this album really really does pick up with some standout songs still Laura does not come on strong or anything like that on this LP she is a gentle soul through and through getting a motion add to this album is a lot like getting light out of a very tiny candle you just gotta light it and sit back and let your eyes adjust to what is being offered sure it's not as efficient as a giant fluorescent light but a candle does bring a particular mood to it with its faint flickers of dark orange and red on the walls even though to some people on the surface this record maybe a little middle-of-the-road I think Laura is actually deceptively understated it is how cold and just how callous she feels on this record that obscures a little bit the interesting lyrics and melodies that this album does have to offer don't get me wrong I feel like the handful of forgettable tracks on this LP and Laura's voice and personality which are not that bold does work against this album in a sense but there are still plenty of songs on here that shine through plus I think this is Laura's best record yet and this is really the sound of a singer/songwriter coming into her own I love the song breathed with its winding and descending guitar and cello melodies that are beautifully crafted and the lyrics on this track deal with love and the two participants in a relationship being mutually cruel to one another and the song master hunter one of the to your tracks on this LP and maybe my favorite track on here has this really badass acoustic guitar if that just feels really desert really just dark and dusty and the lyrics that Laura lays on this track I'm a master hunter I've cured my skin nothing gets in it really paints Laura as this cold leathery sort of beaten down individual being down emotionally and her demeanor really reflects that laura has always been a singer/songwriter to me that that has been a little underwhelming because her voice doesn't have so much oomph to it and this album for one song after another almost reflects on on why she comes off that way the song little love caster is one of the quieter songs on this album but it has this very sharp teeny-tiny dreary melody being played on the guitar that to me feels very Spanish guitar inspired and the way that the cello just sombrely creeps in against the guitar and Laura's vocals it's the first point on this album where I was really chilled and I I just snapped I felt like wow I get it I get why Laura is this way or I sort of see the appeal as to why she is this way I'm sympathizing I'm being moved here because connecting with Laura's music emotionally can kind of be like catching a very faint dying and distant radio signal there are moments on the selkie where the devil tropes that pop up in the lyrics don't really read all too well for me it feels like Laura's really beating a dead horse and the schmaltzy organs on where can I go and once just feel a little too corny for my taste but still this album does finish with three of its best tracks love be brave little bird and saved these words songs that to me portray an interesting dynamic on this album there is an interlude around the middle point of this thing and it becomes very apparent by the back end of this thing that Laura is circling around a lot of the same lyrical themes some of these same chord progressions or guitar play like a little bird which is the second to last track as opposed to the second track once I was an eagle bird bird plus both tracks have this ascending guitar and cello phrase in it the song love be brave has this beautifully twang II guitar melody on it and the closer on this album save these words to me is really sort of the cherry on top for this album is the meaning of this album wrapped up in a nutshell I mean really the lyric where Laura very sort of tongue-in-cheek Lee says thank you naivety for failing me again that is really what this album boils down to I mean Laura is someone who is just down trodden by love and being naive not being able to see the red flags being able to live in bliss and that is a concept that Laura touches down on quite a bit on this LP really this lyric is is one of the most passionate points on this album for me throughout this LP Laura displays love is this thing that brings her great pain but obviously she's attracted to it she's infatuated with it to write this many songs in regards to it again there are some songs on here that are not incredibly memorable instrumentally and Laura still to me is not is not the most standout personality in the singer-songwriter world but I think she does have a very sharp sense of lyricism a sharp sense of melody great sense of song structure and she clearly went into this album trying to fine tune it as a whole piece with tons of songs that not only revolve around a lot of the same topics use similar lyrics reference one another this thing really did feel like an experience even if some points were a little underwhelming I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it I want to give a shout out to Cal who will not be reviewing the new Boards of Canada album Alex Jeremy who had a very passionate conversation with me about this new Laura Marling album and Eric Thomas who I actually mistook for Chris Rock in the vocal samples from that new disclosure album that I just reviewed ex NFL player and motivational speaker Eric Thomas I've actually been subscribed to him for a while on YouTube and I will link you guys down there in the description box this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional and mm-hmm Laura Marling once I was an Eagle get the knee Fantana forever 
DyvURtL9--g,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comment thing something I wanted to kind of discuss with you guys um something that we deal with every day basically on this channel and that is genre what is the style that a piece of music sits within what is the category what are the defining characteristics how can we label this particular album or song piece I happen to be of the opinion that this sort of thing is is is very helpful in a way however I I do understand that genres and the labels can be somewhat of a double-edged sword and more often than not I feel like the more negative side of genres are are acknowledged and dragged out into the open more than the positive sides are I feel like the positive sides don't really ever get discussed or defended because the positive sides are just so inherent they're just so effective that they don't really need to be discussed you know whereas for the negative sides they definitely need to be talked about because people should try to lessen the damage that genres could potentially do for sure there are plenty of artists out there who don't necessarily get the listeners or the audience that they might deserve because of their hard work because they are in a particular genre of music this could be as basic as people deciding that they do not like rock music or they do not like hip-hop music that they listen to everything except country and dubstep however when they talk about those kinds of things maybe they don't really know their country artists out there that could really appeal to them that there are dubstep artists that don't sound like Skrillex that there are rock artists that don't necessarily have the kinds of qualities that typically annoy them in rock music and that there are rappers out there who don't rap about bitches and who and money so for sure people do use on rule Able's occasionally to push away tons of artists that they may enjoy and what's even worse is these days in in the Internet age where hype is a really big factor when it comes to trying to get underground records seen and listened to you have artists like let's say Neon Indian or even how to dress well who gets stuffed into these new hot micro genres like alternative R&B as well as chill wave and then their hype dies down because people are less interested in their little micro genre that they themselves didn't even really try to invent it was something that was tagged on to them by either passionate listeners who were talking about it online creating tags on last.fm or rate your music or something like that or by bloggers reviewers music journalists these are only a few of the potentially negative impacts that that genre can have also I imagine in a way it can kind of limit the creativity that that we may see as an audience because artists or people are trying to be artists may see a kind of limited potential in the amount of John Rizzo they can toy within however as I said earlier there are very positive things about genres the reason we have genres really because people as soon as they hear a piece of music that they love they want to hear more music just like it the song that you heard was so amazing just happen to be a Led Zeppelin song which caused you to dive more into Led Zeppelin which in turn made you want to get into classic rock or just hard rock blues rock you go from there to cream Blue Cheer and because you have these labels and categorizations that have been used for decades and decades and decades you have hundreds upon hundreds of bands in this one style of music that that you are free to kind of binge on to your heart's desire and obviously people feel that's a great thing or else John Rose wouldn't be so widely used and popular and acknowledged it's difficult to say whether or not the the bad outweighs the good and that's why I guess I'm coming to you guys and asking you this question I mean while there are artists out there who are being discovered because they fit very snugly into a very particular genre they're other artists out there who are being completely ignored or avoided because they fit into a genre as well on top of it they're artists who don't really fit snugly into much of any genre and numerous records out there maybe have six or seven or eight genres maybe even a different genre being approached with with every single track hell maybe even one single song that has six very clear different genre influences flowing throughout it so genres and labels do have their limits I feel like we're going to continue using genres and using labels it's important to acknowledge that not everything can be labeled easily and adequately efficiently accurately on the front page of the YouTube channel youtube.com slash the needle drop YouTube just brought a new channel design to the table and I started making use of the shelves feature where I can separate out now my reviews by genre I have rack reviews hip hop electronic music loud rock which I kind of throw a lot of extreme metal in there metal just in general punk music as well as others Avon's oddballs things like that and still you know I sit there and I have particular reviews that I have just done and I wonder where to put certain artists even though these genres that I have put together are very very umbrella like the CX kitronik review that I just did while CX kitronik does have elements of hip hop in his music maybe hip hop is the most prevalent influence in there I could see songs from that record that he just put out going in the rock category going the loud rock category go in the electronic category and even going in the others experimental and avant-garde [Music] is a concept of genre is an idea and ideas can be used positively and used negatively genres used negatively when someone uses it to avoid trying something new to them as onra is is used negatively when it's used to insult a particular artist so yeah let me know what you think about all this genre business anthony Fantana genres forever [Music] 
w33XqeTSNeg,disclosure settle Oh cat wins again blinking contest champion I can't even tell when you blink cow can blink right here cow blink not seeing it all right hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new disclosure album settled disclosure is a uk-based electronic music duo this is their full-length debut LP hmm these guys have had some of the hottest dance music singles of 2013 period tracks like white noise featuring alunageorge as well as you and me with Eliza Doolittle tracks that have a slightly aged electronic dance music vibe to them there's a lot of dance pop on this LP as well as bass music garage and future garage believe me when I say that this is not just some kind of trash Eaton's instance on the contrary disclosure brings quite a bit of class to the table when it comes to four to the floor dance music there's some very detailed production on this album that brings a very light bouncy playful mood now there is an issue with this LP it's not gonna be for everybody it's good it's very good just maybe not so good that it's gonna bring in people who aren't typically into this style of music people who are on the outside looking in on this album understandably may see it as no more than background music for a day of shopping at Urban Outfitters or forever 21 however that doesn't mean that there aren't worthwhile tracks on here this thing is straight-up dance music and dance music that is so sharp I could see tons of tracks on this LP being very much worthy of extended mixes that get laid out on white label 12 inches played by DJs and huge clubs to dancing whore of teenagers the 12 tracks on the selfie highlight light to different sides to disclosure style you have the very catchy dance-pop numbers with vocal guests and the more instrumentally driven tracks which have a lot of vocal samples on them where disclosure really gets down to business when it comes to groove craft and really taking a loop of music and progressing it changing it keeping it engaging from the beginning to the end of the track this is occurring on songs like one of the opening tracks on here when a fire starts to burn which features a pretty prominent Chris Rock sample the song stimulation the song grabbed her to a lesser extent the track f4u these tracks feature kick drums on pretty much every single quarter no kicks that are punchy but not all that resonant or very very bassy these kicks are just splashed with little baby hi-hats watery synthesizers and very very resonant synth bass lines that sometimes are very nimble jumping bouncing all over the place the phrasing of these bass lines at times reminds me of a lot of the bass lines that I would hear in acid house music from the from the tb-303 though I'm not exactly sure they're playing with that particular piece of hardware though the track stimulation there's a little bit of an exception with its bass lines line lines which really rings out hypnotically I guess my point here is that these tracks and many other on here are working with roughly the same sonic recipe you're getting a lot of the same drum Tambor's a lot of the same synth sounds hell a lot of the same rhythm patterns instant however disclosure still manages to bring quite a bit of variety to this LP with some bold samples and a gauntlet of vocal guests the track grab her has this really sort of goofy ascending and descending synth melody that plays almost throughout the entire track it's a really fun groove if there's anything about the song that sort of gets to me it's that this melody grows kind of stale as these song progresses sometimes what makes these tracks stick out or what makes them special disclosure repeats it a little bit too much like the Chris Rock sample on when a fire starts to burn I love the track I think it's got a nasty groove I'm loving the synth on it and I just think the sample is is pretty funny though I could see it really wearing its welcome with a lot of people as far as the more dance-pop tracks on here with vocal features these are the songs that are really pulling people to disclosure really turning heads and it's easy to understand why especially with tracks like white noise with alunageorge this song is dance-pop perfection explosive hook which they build up to with some spacey synthesizers I love that segue and the synth bass line on this thing is so freakin catch or it's just a synth lead either way it's very nicely manipulated to have a little bit of as far as lyrics go on on this song and really all the songs on this album they really have to do with love relationships lust nothing altogether new yeah disclosure isn't really reinventing the lyrical wheel here but I don't really think it's a hindrance to the album I love the song voices on here with Sascha cable her performance on this song really sticks out mostly because of how jazzy it feels in a sense with the melodies she's singing I love the way that she paced out her vocals so that she's singing a little bit disclosure brings in a very heavy bass line it's a nice trade-off I have to say even when I don't really care for a vocal guest on one of these tracks I still love what disclosure does with the song track for track I have to admire the level of detail just how meticulous they are with every single thing they put into their songs at times the grooves feel ultra simple you're just getting drums you're just getting a little bit of synth bass and then all of a sudden a rush of synthesizers and effects come in and thicken up the whole recipe completely changing the vibe of the song shifting from fast moving groove to atmospheric stillness now there are vocal guests on here that overwhelmed me others underwhelm in a sense like Edward MacFarlane his vocal melody on this track is just really repetitive and pretty boring as well nowhere near is dynamic or as interesting as the vocal performance alunageorge brings to the table for example or even I'm not a really huge fan of his voice again another vocal I couldn't pick out of a lineup but still he does try to bring more variety to the melodies he's sing this on the song overall settle is is a mixed bag of dance tracks but not a bad one at all I think the only song I really disliked on this entire thing was one of the bonus tracks with Jessie where with the really horrible vocal layering on the song feeling really dissonant and just unrewarding in every way possible some songs were a little much others were not enough but when this album was good and believe me most of the time it is it is great the best spots on this LP are excellent examples on how to modernize house musics oldest and most foundational ideas I'm feeling a strong seven on this LP if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to James Derek Whitney Hunter and you all mistakes were intentional only the strong subscribe the needle drop disclosure settle forever [Music] 
LDMNhCOs0G0,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new CX kitronik album crack attack - ah damn it CX kitronik is a brooklyn beast producer vocalist and recent addition to the lineup of the infamous atari Teenage Riot and with this new sophomore LP of his CX essentially brings to the table a series of tracks that have incredibly aggressive interpretations of music hailing from hip hop music electronic music rock music and the thing is he's been doing this for years the guy's full-length debut came out in 2006 this new LP of his on Stones Throw Records obviously it's taken him a little while to put it out but maybe that could be a kind of good thing we are in a spot now where we are post Death Grips we are post clipping we're post Blackie so yeah he's been doing it longer not only is that clear just from looking at his discography but it kind of sounds like that too with the influences that come up in his music the break beat drum patterns on here that feel like they're coming straight out of the 90s the quality of the noise and the distortion on this thing how saturated it feels how muffled it feels at times to bring crack attack - together CX invites a lot of emcees into the fold a lot like his full-length debut which had way more tracks on it in comparison to this which itself is pretty long 17 tracks 50 or so minutes at the end the day crack attack - really is like one of those producer curated albums where you have someone pulling together all the beats and they just deliver to you these instrumentals loaded with a gauntlet of different emcees typically I rail against albums like this and I don't really care for them because of how inconsistent they could be in terms of the quality of the verses the quality of the rappers most of the time I feel like some people are really great others are subpar and on the whole everyone is not really bringing their best stuff because they're just kind of coming in and leaving after a few bars however CX kitronik is is sort of a special producer he is an out-there dude not just any MC can rap on his music and and I don't think just any emcee would want to rap on his music his style is is not really for everybody's because for sure the people that he brings to the table do their best to match the very extreme energy the CX brings to the table on a lot of these songs I would actually say that crack attack 2 is actually a lot like listening to a compilation of hip-hop music and digital hardcore that was released on some underground label that folded in 1998 because even though a lot of the MCS on this LP do have their own sort of rapping style they have their own verses it's all filtered through the same grimy lo-fi distorted effects and recording quality now if there is a warning I want to give you with this LP not only is it just in the red for many tracks on here but CX kitronik does not take himself all that serious as if the shrine of butt cracks on the front cover of this thing didn't already tell you that there are some weird skits on this album whether they be about the surgical shortening of butt cracks or hunting for butt cracks in downtown Brooklyn or even the ends of some of these tracks have a barrage of samples on them about butt crack crack oh he's got crap I like toe toes ooh crack sometimes it's goofing but when it's not goofing it is delivering some incredibly high-energy music that demands a lot from its listeners it really needs you to just turn up the I don't give a and I know that's difficult for some people especially with this LP because you have some weird tracks on here like you're a dummy with metal style vocals growls alternating with just ear piercing and annoying shrieks the instrumental feels like nothing the thrashy sped up guitar chords and drum machines with lyrics about diarrhea chicken pox drugs and of course masturbation it feels like some mindless self-indulgence b-side from the band's earlier stuff and I would say consistently the more rock-oriented tracks on this thing are really too gaudy for words really too gaudy for me to handle period CX kitronik truthfully can be a little one-dimensional however when this album is good it's frickin good like the opening track on this thing with these sharp very bright synth horns amazingly heavy beat shouted group vocals on headphones it's like listening to a mushroom cloud sized explosion occur between my ears I love the song locked into with Billy days from mo P not only is his voice really beefy on this track and I love it the bass the kick drums on this thing are great too and the high hats are going so fast I can't even count up the song blackout brings a little bit of old-school breakbeat magic and the song let's go crazy with the tari teenage riot is just nothing but shouts noise screams it is just non-stop intensity I would say the only major dynamics that this LP brings to the table is that it can smooth out occasionally into a hip-hop s groove that feels a little more traditional like the song ladies crack with lady miss lady miss brings a great verse on this track she is a fantastic voice she really complements the song I'm loving the murky bass and the instrumental I liked the snappy snares and the rhythmic change ups that this song offers - I like that see X can just turn down the volume a bit but still not lose that lo-fi grimy gritty flavor beats like this as well as tracks like menace to society and and buddy crack these instrumentals remind me of like old school company flow style production although I will say tracks like buddy crank do highlight just a mayer issue that I have on this LP like I said earlier with these producer curated albums I do run across a lot of verses that I'm just like this one in particular with John Wayne where he is rapping about just one is he's he's like the Cookie Monster cookie binge I just was not feeling it I erased it from my memory it was so bad the song geezer got it as well has an Doom verse on it which is good but MOBOTIX coming right after him and again it's another very weak set of bars on this album there are so many guest emcees some of them are gonna fall on the backburner you're not really gonna notice them of course that's gonna be the case too with how noisy and distorted the production on this thing is and of course with how many people are spitting verses on this album you're gonna have a different opinion than I am as to whose verse is the worst still as I said earlier the whole inconsistent emcee problem isn't that big of an issue because really between doom MF grim Saul Williams CX does keep a pretty impressive guest list of underground heroes and pretty talented unknowns overall even though this album is loud as hell and that alone is gonna make it not for everybody that and the fact that it's sort of inconsistent stylistically and quality wise - it still just might be one of the most fun listens you have with an album this year just because of how out there and over the top it is I definitely recommend trying this thing out or at least a few tracks from and just seeing if you know maybe you get a little bit of a thrill a jolt out of it you know I'm feeling a strong 6 to LA 7 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it I want to give a shout out to Maylene Andrew cakes - Killa thanks for following me on Twitter and prancercise all mistakes were intentional only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana CX kitronik 
5uvj_3nd5kY,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Queens of the Stone Age album like clockwork Queens of the Stone Age are a California based rock band who have proven to be one of the more worthwhile groups to come out of the more slightly more commercial side of alternative rock in the late 90s early 2000s the band really separated themselves from a lot of groups being played on the radio around this time with their hard distorted very memorable guitar riffs as well as their attitude and some very passionate vocals from frontman Josh Homme II and some very sharp songwriting the tone of the band's guitars was very thick very heavy occasionally they would slow things down a little bit to a somewhat stone a rock like tempo of course things like this called back to the ashes of Caius which is essentially even as Queens of the Stone Age went into kechi ER and slightly more radio-friendly territory those stoner rock roots never really left the equation those hard-ass tough hard as nails or things like that made the band stick out as they released LPS like rated R in 2000 or songs for the Deaf in 2002 LPS that were an excellent mix of ferocity and infectious riffs melodies and choruses it seemed like Queens of the Stone Age could just be hard as hell without really sacrificing their accessibility however this is a bit of a balancing act that the fourth and fifth LPS from Queens that the Stone Age didn't hit as perfectly and this new LP doesn't really hit that perfect balance either however I think like clockwork is bringing something different to the table it's not necessarily trying to shoo for that balance this is easily the dreariest album that Queens of the Stone Age has ever done I actually think instead of being aggressive and incredibly catchy Queens of the Stone Age are being moody and incredibly catchy Josh isn't exactly strumming on acoustic guitars throughout this LP he keeps it electric he keeps it distorted but there are some piano tunes some slower songs some softer intros more loud soft dynamics the vocals feel a little bit more pained a little bit more emotional there's a stronger element of melody there's a bit more instrumental refinement at times when josh gets dark or dramatic he reminds me a little bit of Bowie or even Marilyn Manson not in a bad way a lot of the courses on this LP just flourish for lack of a better word like with the track i sat by the ocean which not only has some great lyrics on the hook but I'm loving the harmonized guitars the piano playing as well as Josh's falsetto the chorus on this track is matched with a bunch of hard rock riffs on the verses bluesy s guitar leads a riff pattern that that feels very familiar for some reason and some building chords that segues one part of the track into the other then and there's sort of a little breadcrumb trail of I don't want to say generic but just very familiar rock music tropes being used throughout this album and it's something that I'm completely sure Josh is conscious of in terms of how obvious all of it is but the really great songwriting the incredible production just a really great heavy heavy sound that Queens of the Stone Age brings at the table it all just blends it together very seamlessly in a way where all of these ideas that might have been in separate places originally just feel so cohesive Josh is singing of course is very convincing as well now there is a sense of variety among these 10 tracks here there are tracks that are a little sadder than others the vocals the lyrics the instrumentation really come together into something that is slightly depressing like the track the vampire of time and memory which not only features some grace string work at the end Dave Grohl drumming - coming back into the fold on this one some weird grainy synthesizers and of course Josh singing against some very patient piano chords it's a dramatic move for Queens of the Stone Age the only thing on this LP that to me feels more dramatic is the closer the title track on here like clockwork another piano ballad with Josh singing for an even longer stretch of time with just the piano in his falsetto with a very memorable refrain not everything that goes around the explosion of guitar toward the end of the track those is invigorating the Weeping guitars on this track has a very desert-like tone to them this desert tone is very prevalent from many tracks on the LP the song IP are missing brings guitars that just way down evalee on the heart not a lot of distortion on there just sharp and they are a minor toned and they just shut oh it hit me right there and I love how on the vs. the bass and the kick drums just syncope in this really weird way where they're chopping up the rhythm it really adds some nice detail to the track the vocals are incredibly weary on this six minute track it's the longest track on the album and I love how we get this weird little interlude in the midst of this LP where of the Stone Age really derails the song a little bit and takes it off roading the tense drum work on here and the wailing guitars and the weird segues and bridges at this point in the song it was a surprise it was kind of exciting I wish the band took a lot of songs in this direction really changed them up a little bit but still it did make this song itself quite the standout other songs on this LP though are not as drawn-out they're more concise they're more hard-hitting and no less entertaining the song if I had a tail as a murderous hook Josh brings these dark lyrics painting pictures of licking tears off of someone's face swatting flies with his tail if he had one the lyrics just have a really devilish attitude to them again we have another very desert inspired guitar solo on this thing and even though the vocal melody on this track over the verse is kind of redundant maybe slightly uninspired the groove is totally badass and I'm loving the guitar tone on this track and really nearly every track on here the guitar tones really are a glory to behold throughout this LP when they're not heavy they're very gritty when they're not gritty they're really warm again we have another little reunion on this particular track with Mark Lanegan delivering vocals and some lyrics for this song and the track my god is the Sun one of the better guitar intros for a track I think this year and it feels just as sharp as it did the first time I heard it when they premiered it online but the song Fairweather friends huge group vocals on this track and sort of an all-star cast of guest singers Elton John singing on this track and bringing piano as well Trent Reznor as well as Nick one of the band's former bassists even though there are a handful of collaborators on this track and on this album in general they really blend in - like clockwork seamlessly if I have any issues with this LP it's that maybe a few parts on some of these songs just underwhelm me slightly like the very dreary bassline on the opening track here or even the guitar intro on smooth sailing which sounds like it should be basically the television theme song for a reality show about rednecks who owned gas stations by long stretches of highway in the desert of course desert desert desert however I do love the zany falsetto vocals that Josh brings to the table on this track that are somewhat soulful in a way and the detuned guitar solo harmonies on this thing it's so awesome it's borderline hilarious you know honestly I got to say overall I love the cell P I know Queens of the Stone Age isn't on the rock fringe or anything like that and you know they're they're not trying to be and that's completely fine I know sometimes we emphasize that sort of thing on this channel but you know we also emphasize great songwriting fantastic production songs with personality great guitar tones potent emotions and in my opinion these songs have those things and and and more this is an incredibly cohesive album with its sharp hard-hitting tracks as well as songs that really sort of stretch out and give Queens of the Stone Age a bit more in the way of dynamics the band really shows their more sad side and I think it pays off in a big way and a great record really I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Bryden tracks man who was recently robbed and shot there's a link in the description box to donate to a bit of a fundraising thing he's got going on you know to take care of him because he's been shot help the man out also I want to give a shout out to a guy who asked for a shout out his name began with a w-wayne and filthy Frank all mistakes were intentional only the strong subscribe the needle drop Queens of the Stone Age like clockwork forever 
p2Z6M7GxOmA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for one of these videos we haven't done them in a while of final update i'm gonna talk about this small pile of record cinema that brandon arrow just recent additions to the collection hey before we start shout outs to this guy man he is hilarious very creative in his uh nasty nasty insults alright let's move forward let's go on but this record first record at a live show I think I caught Sam Muto live back in April and they had recently reissued some of these albums so of course had to happen I think I got it for 10 bucks or so books thought for food y'all thought for food full chronic LP as you guys may know the bands are the duo's last full like they'll be the way out was one of my favorites of theirs though a lot of people do prefer this album very simple packaging and labeling though it is a nice thick pressing just make sure it's on Tom lab or so it says on here but I guess the books thoughts thought rather just had to make sure sometimes you add s is on the ends of things and you don't mean to but you do it anyway thaw for food do check this out if you're looking for something electronic with some interesting samples as well grab this at a flea market for five bucks says six but I got it for five prints 1999 crate is a bit though nothing on this album really sounds like that don't let my terrible singing turn you away from this album sexy can y'all see that sexiness that's se I'm white I'm super white right now don't mind me as I turn white as we're showing off these records prints in the band lyrics credits on the back of these two sleeves I'm actually yet to put this on the turntable I got that pretty recently at the flea market um this is a record I caught down at South by Southwest but I haven't really talked about it until now because it wasn't released at the time now it has been released the band creative adult they played a short little set at the I guess the day party that terrorized and I threw together and they have an EP out on let me see let me make sure run for cover records a little bit of art rock on here post hardcore it's a pretty noisy pretty heavy at points to creative adult Bulls in the yard it's not a bad seven-inch actually think there's a layer you can stream it on the website so that's pretty cool alright next suicide suicide do do check this record out of this is just a reissue but still check this record out if you're looking for some noisy synth minimal synth post-punk stuff with some very odd lyrics you guys may remember I think on her last full-length LP mi a sample the song off of this album and if you've never heard of suicide before you know basically look up the song Frankie teardrop and you will basically get a you in my opinion is kind of like the mission statement of the band it's it's really like oh this is how weird and disturbing music can be suicide suicide alright this next one I also grabbed at a flea market surprisingly so I was like holy crap this is here whoa no way the United States of America it's an okay condition I mean the record itself is not beat to hell as I'm turning whiter the record itself is not beat to hell but uh the album art is a little bit unfortunately you know sleeve a little worn too I might get a new sleeve for this but a record plays through though I do have to clean it you know it does need a little bit of cleaning but you know no big scratches on it or anything and as far as what is on this record goes a lot of experimental rock psychedelic rock a little bit of influence coming from the prog side of things around that time I think this record came out in I think late 60s let me just make sure that right now before I make a complete idiot of myself 1968 um trying to maybe a little bit of Jefferson Airplane or something on this album just a slight bit of I've heard them compared by some people to Velvet Underground in a in a sense though you know it I definitely you know don't go on to this record looking for like another waiting for my man or anything like that it's definitely not that kind of album but um it is it is an interesting late 60s experimental rock record with a blend of different sounds around that time it sound like one consistent sound from beginning to end there are some interesting tunes on here and some weird sounds as well for its time it's an interesting record and you know I was like I said I was surprised to run across this thing in a flea market and I was assuming that just based on what the cover looked like that the record was not going to be in good condition and then I was like holy crap record looks good and like I said a place through just fine just got to clean it got past this compilation from the good people over at analog Africa this came out in 2010 the Angola soundtrack the unique sound of Luanda 1968 to 1976 just think about it while some of the music on this was being made that United States of America record was being made that's crazy or at least I think that's interesting but anyway a lot of Afrobeat on this thing not a bad compilation of sounds sure it kind of blends together stylistically a little bit but there are some standouts some good grooves interesting poster coming with this thing it's not a bad release at all you know I happen to be big into you know afrobeat music just African rock music African psych music in general and analog Africa is one of the more solid labels that you can go to when it comes to you know listening to that kind of music from that place that like Soundwave records places like that the records not badly pressed and of course I think it's uh is it every band on here I think yeah I think so pretty much every group that they feature on this compilation has a little bit of a backstory on the sleeve you know labels like this don't they don't screw around you know it's like not only are you getting you know the music but you're getting the background as well which I which I really love sorry if I'm stepping out of a focus a little bit over here while I'm getting a too excited about records alright this last one I could do a whole video on this but man this record fries my eyes just looking at it because of the the color difference and just the the color palette on here but oh my god I got the new knife album and you know the the I want to see the contrast of like this weird green color in this weird hot pink color may look strong in the video but it's even stronger in person you know how the animal collective record Merriweather Post Pavilion like when you see it online at the the cover art moves but when you see it on in person maybe the the the illusion is not as strong seeing this in person versus online really just burns like if I stare at it long enough I have to like close my eyes for a second it burns this is a triple LP this triple vinyl it's nice and thick and you know just in terms of like the just the cover itself and you know you're getting like interesting album art in here like lot of weird colors and washes of color in here with the tracklist but as far as what is kind of in this whole thing of course you've got your three records they're all nicely pressed black sleeves this thing is nice and many of you who may have caught the comic then they put up over on their website they also decked out this packaging with a physical poster of these comics hope finish this out this is our last one but also on the other side we're getting a lyrics to the tracks as well this is decked out you know it's decked out from beginning to end and of course on top of all this you have two CD copies of the album well not two CD copies of the entire album but two CDs you know three LPS two CDs and yeah there's another comic poster on here just like that other one that I just showed you this one folds out as well it's a it's a hefty it's a hefty package a real hefty package aha so yeah new knife record shaking the habitual and that'll be that for this vinyl update thank you guys for watching records records records records records record records forever

rzolEHmXNBE,deafheaven sunbather keep it hurry up hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's sweatiest stickiest music nerd I mean look sticky and it's time for a review of the new death heaven album sunbather death heaven is a West Coast loud rock outfit this is their sophomore full-length LP death wish records it's titled sunbather I dug on this band's debut full-length a little bit back in 2011 roads to Judah it was really well produced playing was great but stylistically compositionally I think this album a little bit fell into line too much with just a lot of popular American centric black metal sounds at the time there are just a lot of groups working within the same blueprint that they were on that album and even though I did like parts of it I was hoping that on their next album whenever that would be now I guess they would expand their sound a little bit get a little bit more adventurous now simply because of the blend of influences on this LP I could see question after question after question coming up does this album even stick out in the greater scheme of atmospheric black metal out there right now is it even black metal to begin with for sure black metal purists are not going to let Sun bather slip by as if it's you know a piece of the Nordic old-school I mean Cowell would know he was pretty involved with the scene if it aint Burzum it's bull Puckey whether it's black metal or not sunbae there features plenty plenty of man wretch focal 's blastbeats tremolo picked guitar leads quickly strummed walls of distorted guitar chords that burn like herald fire it's a pretty familiar recipe that even you should be aware of if you've been paying attention to the more american side of black metal as of late bands like Crowley's liturgy Agalloch wolves in the throne room still I think sunbather does stick out even though it's not the most technical of releases and it's not even really the most novel when it comes to ideas what I think may end up biting this album in the butt is not what is on the album at all but how people will perceive this LP I actually think maybe the whole black metal side of deafheaven sound especially on this album is being oversold a little bit because while black metal does play a large role in the music on this album there's also huge influences coming from post rock as well as ambient music a little bit of noise screamo and emo even though deafheaven stylistic influences are really clear on this album I feel they still come out on top simply because of their great production their type performances on these tracks as well as they're really memorable and just invigorating compositions composition really is one of the biggest strengths that this album does have to offer it is clear from the opening track on this thing Dreamhouse which I talked about in an earlier video the nine minute monster still floors me with every listen and it is one of the most overtly black metal tracks on the LP even as the band builds up to plenty of post rock like crescendos but what really makes the song stand out to me and what makes deafheaven stand out stylistically in general is that they take these very rough harsh abrasive loud rock sounds and mix them with such harmonious melodious rich and uplifting chord progressions and guitar leads it's kind of like listening to angels and corpse paint plug their harps into distortion pedals and just wailing away on them and the thing is sunbae there isn't even the longest track on this LP there are three other monsters on this thing that go up to ten eleven and fourteen minutes but before I dive into those I would like to talk about the flow of this LP a little bit death heaven does put quite a bit of work into putting some downtime in between these very long and rough black metal inspired tracks they segue each long piece with a shorter song it's a kind of obvious pattern that they lay into on this album but still it does pay off like the song irresistable which is this really nice guitar and piano piece some beautiful harmonized leads on this thing and what's so great is that the beginning of this track flows very nicely with the end of the previous song on your dream house so it's really like I'm listening to an extension of the same song I'm really loving the twang of these very patient guitars on this song it sort of reminds me a bit of explosions in the sky in a sense but what I think is so interesting about this song is that it is so light it's so beautiful it really sort of reveals that the Bands intentions even though the previous song was so rough are not that dark the other interlude on here please remember is a six minute track it's a bit of a drone noise piece with a vocal snippet for the first half and then it goes into some acoustic guitar some electric guitar leads and the way the leads weep on the second half of the song it really reminds me of God speed you black Emperor of course the first half with the noise and the vocal snipah again reminds me of that - and the third segue on here Windows has a huge god speed vibe to it as well with the very ominous guitars hanging in the background they're looped they're wailing they're droning and over this there is a vocal snippet of a man ranting about religion it does get a little obnoxious at this point that it feels like they're they're drinking from the same fountain again and again with these interludes as far as the three remaining epics on this album go boom a lot of these tracks even though there are blast beats and there are wretches on here they feature slower moments as well where the post rock influences and I think even the screamo influences that deafheaven has really shined through like the slow heavy distorted chords on the title track from this thing actually reminds me of some of the more post rock leaning bands and screamo like envy for example which isn't actually a bad thing I'm really enjoying the cross-pollination of these genres on this LP even if it isn't just accurately one genre throughout who cares what I think is awesome as the deafheaven takes anthemic guitar leads and multifaceted song structures and uses these to bring together one characteristic that I feel black metal post rock and screamo all have in common and that is just this overwhelming sense of passion with screamo comes through on the melodies the extreme vocals sometimes the lyricism with black metal it's the speed it's the abrasion is ferocity and with post rockets the crescendos and the builds the track vertigo on here is another favorite of mine on this LP really sort of works in three parts a very slow-moving first third I love how dreary the introduction of this track is and when the black metal inspired chords finally break through they had this weird warp somewhat sour quality to them that really makes them stick out the song has a really speedy speedy middle and the end which is incredibly tortured has rushes of guitars in there it is just eargasm after eargasm uh the only point at which this album really let me down was on the last couple tracks like I said I wasn't crazy about window and as far as the closer on here the pecan tree the song to me didn't really bring many new ideas melodically or just performance wise either the track even has these crunchy downstroke syncopated chords that the song Dreamhouse used to stick out I do like the flow of the track the very weepy and melodic midpoint does flow nicely into the very crushing end but with the fade-out on here it really feels like I'm not closing to this LP honestly no matter what genre you toss this LP into it is a really engaging melodic and passionately intense loud rock album tons of quality guitar leads on here great production fast tight performances don't let what influences this album or what it's trying to be or whatever you think it's trying to be ruin your your listening experience just give it a listen if it appeals to you it does if it doesn't it doesn't you know and just just take it from there I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I'm going to give a shout out to saint pepsi drifts and mason only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional death heaven deaf heaven deaf heaven nothin sunbather forever [Music] 
CDLs0XZiE8A,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new bib EO album silver Wilkinson video is the pseudonym of uk-based electronic music producer Steven Wilkinson an incredibly versatile producer and multi-instrumentalist whose last full-length LP mind Buckhead eye compared to a chameleon in a musical sense with how many different musical styles and sounds it accurately emulated from arena rock to glitch pop on this LP a lot of basses get covered and of course stretching yourself so thin stylistically there were some weak spots and there were some high-water marks variety seems to be the spice of life generally for Bibby oh it's really been a leading characteristic of his career throughout he has released albums that have featured influences from IDM ambient music folk music hip hop music pop music glitch music he has a deep appreciation for sound and I can appreciate that deeply oh yeah and even though I didn't really love his last full-length album because of that because of how much of a mess the album felt like slightly the music on the LP really sort of mimics the art in that you have a bunch of ideas over here and they're overlapping some are shining more brightly than others it was a little inconsistent but in comparison silver Wilkinson is incredibly consistent actually I'm not saying this LP is gonna hit you grab you by the neck and drag you aggressively through one hit after another just slamming you with hard ass courses that are gonna just burn in your mind no instead silver Wilkinson is actually a pretty beautiful slow moving and ethereal grower a dream within a dream it's like listening to faint musical echoes while floating on a cloud of cotton candy with a palette of subtle beats acoustic guitars lovely analog synthesizers and some Pleasant vocals this album the ears gently in a really lovely way there are some beats on here that are of the more visceral variety like with the the track that led to that Wow the track is really a bit of a summer pop anthem with elements of dream pop and folk music coming together if anything is sort of a hindrance on this song that exposes a bit of a you know weak link in the chain is that Bibby's vocals occasionally occasionally can be kind of forgettable in terms of tone personality and of course what is also impressive about this album even though dream pop dream folk these really light sweet sounds and genres are spearheading this album vibius still manages to work in a variety of different genres hip hop still has a place on silver Wilkinson most notably with the song you attract that feels very very indebted to J Dilla a strong hip hop beat that is a bit cloudy because of all the reverb in a good way and the song chops and loops all of these soul samples beautifully especially with the climactic string kissed finish it is so wonderful it's like dying and finding out that when you go to heaven everybody is handed a complimentary copy of doughnuts in my opinion this help he does stay pretty engaging even though it doesn't come on strong with the volume because it delivers many a sharp melody it just does it in a consistently serene manner like the acoustic guitar piece Sycamore silhouetting this track has finger picked guitar arpeggios galore against what sounds like some very beautiful string or synthesizer melodies it really has a vibe to it that feels retro very retro like it's some kind of overblown full chamber pop from the 60s or 70s however I mean that in the most positive way possible there are actually moments on here where the very speedily picked guitars and some a psychedelic vibe of the effects feels a little grizzly bear inspired a lot of people and and me included have used the word pleasant in the past to describe albums that that typically put bliss over reals musical substance but I think on this album you you a little bit of your cake and you get to eat that bit too because there are plenty of strikingly beautiful moments among these very quiet songs like the progressive synthesizer interlude in the midst of the song mirroring all which follows a very acoustic first half I think it's a wonderful transition not only in terms of melody but in texture as well now I'm not gonna lie this more Airy approach that vivió took on this LP has led to some songs that are breezy and kind of passed by aren't instantly memorable like the two-minute ambient track on this LP wolf or the seven-minute song look at a Ryan which is very very house music influenced which actually blends very nicely into the vibe of the album but not much goes on on this track that that strikes me as being beautiful it's just got kind of a decent groove to it I suppose and doesn't quite justify its length which is much longer than a lot of songs on here if anything the closer should have been longer which is actually a strikingly beautiful ballad great vocal melody on this track and I'm just loving the tone of the acoustic guitars one track after another with these spinning winding finger picked patterns oh the song Business Park which is okay I'm not completely thrilled with it does bring some drum machines and electric guitars they have a bit of a surf like tone to them but they're not playing surf rock style melodies and when the synths fly in and start playing some very bold leads it reminds me a bit of something like Square pusher would do overall gotta say on this LP bibby Oh does bring his usual variety I think we all know by now album after album videos mind is is just slightly a mess and you know it's something that I'm sure he's completely fine with has accepted and is is well aware of and on this album he essentially finds a way to bring this mess together with a very dreamy and calming veil the Fulk the electronic music the hip hop it all sounds like it agrees it all sounds cohesive it all sounds like it makes sense on this album which is fitting given the dreamy vibe of this LP because all of these genres would only work on an album in all trims that was stupid very enjoyable LP wasn't in love with every but still very solid and recommended I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this video is my opinion if you don't like it here is a straw I want to give a shout out to the enthusiasts I want to give a shout out to Sam cows bully in high school don't bully nobody it's not nice I want to give a shout out to the world is a beautiful place thank you for tweeting the album review and Kris Capello who has a new album out right now believe it or not little intern Kris only the strong

lNat70LnRuk,quasimodo hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new Quasimodo album yes sir whatever Lorde coifs Quasimodo aka Madlib a producer multi-instrumentalist DJ and rapper hey guy who was infamous incredibly prolific he's really got more LPS than most with projects like yesterday's new quintet as well as mad villain he's also released numerous tracks under a slew of other names - like the beat conductor loop Digga monk hughes and of course it's not enough that this man just makes his ton of music on his own he needs to come up with an alter-ego to release more music hence Quasimodo now this new release is kind of a collection an album a bit of a compilation it's 12 tracks which the creation of spans about 12 years dating back to the release of Quasimodo's first full-length LP the unseen an album that ton of people who are in the underground hip hop praise the hell out of and for good reason and even though there are some new cuts on this project there are also songs on here that were previously released on an EP as well as other singles so it's not like this new release is 100% fresh though the cuts that have been previously put out are kind of rarities you know you're not going to come across them just anywhere one track after another on this thing involves libs treid márk gritty jazzy blunted hip hop production which is funky as well and of course all of these beats are graced with his verses which he's known for taking the pitch of them and shifting it up if you took mad live and Shrunk him down to the size of a gnome this is essentially the voice that you would imagine coming out of him rapping and it's a kind of funny thing to hear in an age where the chopped and screwed sound is so prevalent in a lot of the hip-hop you hear it's almost refreshing in a way to hear somebody shifting their vocals up in pitch now with 32 minutes long even though yes or whatever is not as varied or as epic or as expansive as the unseen it is still a really fun listen even though Madlib doesn't take a lot of risks between the songs on this the beats he brings to the table are colorful they're classy they got a snap to them like the song planned attack which has these watery guitar samples left and right the kicks on this thing are deep as hell the snares are really thin and crisp there's a touch of reverb on there Quasimodo is rapping on this track sort of trading places with mad libs lower not pitched vocal they're these really catchy DJ cuts flying in and out of the track to it is the perfect recipe for a head Bob I'm loving the song broad factor on here as well in terms of the rhythm hiding behind all of the samples it's a little similar to the track I just mentioned it's actually similar to a lot of tracks on this LP but Madlib is good at taking these very similar grooves and colouring them with very very different samples to the point where each song really has its own vibe now there are points on this album that are a little underwhelming or for whatever reason they just don't stick like be very obvious obvious and repetitive vocal sampling on the track seasons change or mad libs kind of underwhelming verses on tracks like brothers can't see me or specifically the front mad libs rap style really tends to be sort of monotone somewhat lifeless in a way and hearing his voice pitched down to its normal pitch it actually is a bit of a hindrance since his voice doesn't exactly read too well against the Basie production there's also the very short track on your Youngblood which I guess I'm not too enthralled with but I honestly do think if you were to take most of the tracks out of the context of this album and just listen to them on their own that they wouldn't be that impressive to your normal hip-hop fan still even though there isn't you know a hot hot track on this LP yes sir is is far from a boring album because it really gains power from how all of these short tracks work together as a listening experience there's a serious power to the odd analog crackle of these tracks as they weave together into this gogo dodo like hip hop scape this is essentially the rap games answer to wacky land with all the Warped samples and synthesizers and ear candy effects there is something that is truly psychedelic about yes or whatever as far as verses go there are definitely some lyrical nuggets on this thing the song catching the vibe has Madlib talking about his music career versus the music career of more mainstream hip hop artists who sort of seem to be overnight sensations and turn out to be duds a few years down the road Quasimodo also has shots fired other rappers on the song planned attack there are also flaky people touchdown on a verse in this thing the song spark dolla is a bit of an ode to marijuana and the track green power in a way is is actually kind of sad it's one of the few moments where Mad Libs voice to me carries a completely different tone to it there are a lot of rap albums and mixtapes out there that I have heard that deliver more monotone flow and it completely turns me off however this project really is sort of the exception to that rule in a sense because this weird monotone flow along with some of the vocal effects really plays into building up this sort of hypnotic textured alluring funny entertaining and seductive aesthetic that Madlib pulls together on yes or whatever even though this is an amazing release it really is a tribute to Mad Libs talents that he can grab a series of tracks that are pretty much just a loose collection of ideas slap them on an album and they end up this friggin cohesive I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Eric Andre Pye you and albums that get releases in the UK way before they get released in the US and and I can't even get a chance to hear them or review them from makes me angry also I want to give a shout out to the rain that's happening outside right now thunderstorm only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana quasimodo yes or whatever forever [Music] 
drLldJfKOGs,I'm going for God hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new bats album obsidian bats is the pseudonym of will weeson Feld he is a songwriter singer producer and his music made a relatively big splash back in 2010 through the full-length LP cerulean out on anti Cohn records a very colourful album loaded with beats that are very compressed wonky as well as glitchy and take a ton of influence from pop music as well as hip hop music it was a sound that was really popular during that year but has waned a little bit in buzz since then they're actually quite a few records that year they had a pretty buzzy glitch hop vibe to them people like toki monsta Teebs as well as no such thing had notable releases however on this new LP bats does not go back to his old ways to his old sound on his last full-length debut instead this new LP goes in a direction that brings together indie electronic music glitch pop and occasionally will tones the electronics down and wraps these songs and piano and strings much more acoustic instrumentation and most importantly he really comes through on this album and flexes those singer-songwriter muscles writing songs that not only have a lot of lyrics and his vocals right up front and center but verses and choruses so without question on obsidian wills vocal delivery and vocal personality plays a much larger role while this album is not as psychedelic or as otherworldly or maybe even as strange or as novel as cerulean bats does keep the sound play and some of the experimentation up there are lots of odd speedy almost unpredictable and glitchy pieces of percussion that pop up in nearly unpredictable places throughout many of these beats however if there is a downside to some of the percussion right off the bat on this LP it is not as heavy bass or fefe as some of the percussion on cerulean it definitely pales in comparison in terms of just resonances still there is detail on these more subtle beats that bats pulls together like on the track incompatible which has a very very dense complex rhythm to it it is a difficult beat it's a difficult groove and with the piano the strings and the acoustic guitar leading to this track there's a serious sense of I guess you could say wonderment it's got a bit of an old-world feel to it in a way I'm thinking like trees streams rocks animals sort of dancing by medieval castles magic sorcery the dark arts whether a track on here seems to emphasize acoustic instrumentation over electronic or vice-versa the production chops that Baths showcased on cerulean are still there they just show up in different ways if there is an issue that's keeping me from loving this LP though that I have to admit it's that I'm not as thrilled with will as a songwriter or really a singer for one wills voice to my ears is effeminately sharp with its tone and it's it's so much so that feel sort of zany to me at times not only that but wills vocals are mixed so high above a lot of the other electronics on these songs that it really overpowers some of the beats on this thing making it difficult to appreciate these songs for the good production that's in the background and there are tracks on here where the instrumentals do get so simple and straightforward that there isn't much else to observe but the vocals and the songwriting that bat's is trying to pull together like the song no eyes which features a kind of slow kick snare pattern that kind of reminds me of Nine Inch Nails track closer and like that track this one has a particular obsession with sex sex is kind of a fix in this song I mean the chorus pretty much is common that me the track is pretty much a poppy observation of the seperation between love and physical relations which is a fine subject matter to write a song about I just find too ever so slightly obnoxious kind of annoying typically wills vocals appeared on his previous material as an additional sound or just something that was adding a little extra color in my opinion added an edge to a lot of his songs even though at the time they were kind of off-the-wall still I do appreciate that there's a little bit of a theatrical element going on here something that feels sort of Antony in the johnsons or even Bjork inspired at times when bats really loses me on this LP it's when there is really no wonderment or much of anything interesting in the instrumental whatsoever really it's bats not doing glitch hop or even doing glitch pop but instead just making middle-of-the-road in the electronic music that reminds me of like dental like the song miasma sky however there are some bright spots there are some moments there are some highlights that I do dig on this LP like we saw Iron Works which in my opinion is so beautifully arranged and covered in extra instrumentation most notably the strings it's so well arranged it's impossible to deny and the song Accio airy the vocals on this track are toned down a little bit to a point where I can really not only tolerate them but enjoy them and the slow pace of the beat on this thing with the driving bass line kind of reminds me of like a 90's trip-hop tune and surprisingly I really like the dark murky wall of instrumentation on the song no past and the throbbing beat on this thing it's a little tortured the interjecting piano phrases that totally break the vibe of the song and transition back into it quickly are pretty interesting as well you'd think they would stick out and sort of ruin the flow of the track but they sort of enhanced how eccentric bats can be when he puts his mind to it overall this is a pretty decent mixed bag of tracks paths has really used this album in my opinion as kind of a training ground of firing range test for his singing songwriting chops as opposed to what we already know he can do as a producer and there are some hits there are some misses and there are songs that really sort of breeze by me and don't stick with me in any way shape or form I feel delight to decent six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Germaine Carrie Jackie vine and cuts on

qsyAV70z5K4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new world is a beautiful place and I am no longer afraid to die album whenever if ever these guys are a rock band from Willimantic Connecticut and this is their debut full-length LP on top shelf records and the band style is a pretty slow moving and building version of indie rock music with a very very sad and somewhat sent to mental disposition a lot of people have labeled it as emo which is not that surprising considering this band's musical similarities with groups like cap and jazz or mineral or Sunny Day Real Estate and in my opinion some very very early Modest Mouse if you've seen the other bands that are sort of in this same style make music that a lot of people described to have a kind of twinkly quality to it mostly because of the very thin and dainty tone of the guitar and these sparkling notes that the guitars play music like this can have its own emotional intensity to it even if it does tend to be a little whiny and sort of overbearing it points now if you didn't know there's a bit of an emo revival going on right now and I do feel somewhat fortunate to have one of the more promising bands in this revival in my own backyard are you serious there's a bit in there no way I did not mean it that that way also it's like over this way even though there are a lot of pre established bands in this new wave of emo music the world is a beautiful place does stick out instrumentally and compositionally they are a little more refined than a lot of bands I think you're going to run across in addition to rock instrumentation they do bring piano since horns strings there are quite a few builds and song structures on this album there are very very post rock inspired especially on the longer tracks in this album but not all of the songs on this thing do run long it isn't the most intensive al on the planet running about 35 minutes ten tracks in this short amount of time though the world is a beautiful place does create at least some love an emotional roller coaster I feel like they're very successful at that with tracks like heartbeat in the brain which starts off with some very patient driving guitars the song evolves and do a very easygoing Rock groove they're cute synthesizers over all of this these quieter and just sort of sweeter and more sentimental verses build up into a sort of loud soft dynamic explosive chorus the song trends downward once again at a very weepy slow guitar passages accompanied with strings and then a final explosion comes I don't mean to oversimplify the song structure of this track because while listening to it it is easy to kind of get wrapped up into the emotion that the band lays out especially when it comes to lyrics in which imagery of home and friends and saying goodbye or thrown out there it's a lot of nostalgia via suburbia which might not be everybody's emotional backdrop but these topics are approached poetically so these songs about these very familiar ideas don't exactly feel obvious if your arms become smoke oh no nothing left to hold even though I do commend this track on having multiple phases and a really nice series of builds the vocals do get a little tiring for me after a while as I listen to this kind of short LP I know whiny emo vocals aren't exactly known for being incredibly on target when it comes to tempo and pitch but the vocals get messy in a very unenjoyable way especially as the band is putting group vocals together on some of these tracks it makes some of the crescendos that the group vocals sing against feel way way way less epic and instead falling a little flat because it kind of feels like listening to a group of people sing a song that they all didn't really learn the words to even though I'm not completely in love with the gigantic group vocals on this LP it is the longer tracks on this album that I think consistently dazzle especially a track like picture of a tree that doesn't look okay we watch the fallen leaves turn to frozen trees it's been another year where the echo from the echoes go I know not a passionate reading but it does sound great on the album and I'm loving the tents build of guitars and just rolling snares on this track it really brings the song to an amazing crescendo of weeping violins and moving vocals and of course this song segues right into the one right after it in fact this album gains an amazing flow between the songs right the kind of middle point of the LP which was really enjoyable considering how disjointed the start of this thing was especially with the somewhat underwhelming opener which sort of dragged on very quietly with a little bit of string and as the nelson finishes off with its last handful of tracks it it stays pretty solid the song gig life is a sonic encapsulation of exactly that life on the road touring playing with the band blended with guitar and vocals that are very ballad like in comparison with some of the other songs on this album the lyrics of course touched down on different places different settings it fits in very nicely with that sentimental nostalgic vibe that many of these tracks go for and strangely enough the group vocals on the track low light assembly go over pretty well I suspect maybe because they're so quiet whisper quiet really as the song rolls on through a bunch of guitar passages that remind me a lot of bands like let's say explosions in the sky or God is an astronaut for example but still it's not like the instrumentation gets that huge and the vocals are there still to remind the listener that this album is in an emo mindset which is fine and the band delivers a pretty ambitious closure as well though I am not huge again on the gigantic background vocals it is a finishing drag that does in its own right feel kind of cinematic I could really see the the credits rolling and I can't even read who was the key grip because the tears welling up in my eyes overall this is a really solid emo record I gotta say it's not one of my favorites of all time but it does live up easily to the standards set by some of the biggest releases in the genre people who are in love with this vocal style even though not all the lyrics are audible I think you will get into this album a little bit easier than me probably fall head over heels for it I'm feeling a decent Distronic seven on this album if you've given a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next that's it this video was my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout-out to Julia bad backyards Amanda Bynes feel better edie rest in peace and

ijsQkQwNKzs,hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review of the new Travis Scott EP mixtape project not yet so finished final version alifair Oh Travis Scott is a southern rapper and producer a 2013 double XL freshman and a lot of musical doors have been opening for him lately mostly opportunities that are good music related he recently had an appearance on Pusha T's wrath of Kane mixtape of course he had production credits and a verse on the recent cruel summer compilation that good music released Travis does have his own music out there for other people to hear download whatever but lately much of the exposure that people have been getting to him has been through his beat craft has been through his production and Alfaro essentially changes that introducing people to Travis's lyrical abilities with him rapping on numerous tracks from this project not only that but he's produced a ton of beats on this thing as well as co-produced and has added just extra production to pre-existing beats like on the beat from the song blocka which appeared on the push a tea mixtape wrath of cane which Travis has put onto this project added some extra synthesizers renamed the track now from what I understand correct me if I'm wrong this version of a loaf arrow that has been released for free download is not the complete version of the project that will be released later down the road with more features from different rap artists on these tracks there's one song on here notably upper-echelon which features a verse from 2 Chainz which gets inexplicably cut out bringing the song to a pretty abrupt end however even though we're not really hearing a full version of this project right now one that to my ears doesn't even sound like it's at a very high bitrate in terms of sound quality this is not stock people who have been praising Travis up until this point from praising him even further the people over at the fader seem to love it the people at double XL who obviously made Travis a double XL freshmen saw fit to give this project as it has been released now in XL rating so I mean I I figure I might as well listen to the project as it is right now as people are talking about and buzzing about it and you know in a way I want to give Travis the benefit of the doubt he has some big names behind him right now supporting his work and he is making what we're led to believe is going to be some great music with these names in good music into the future there must be something really impressive I'm thinking coming down the pipe because the potential that has been building up for Travis Scott for me is not really coming through on al Ferro on these tracks Travis bites numerous emcees across these songs so hard that by the end of the final track on this thing his teeth must be dull the beats on this thing range from banging to recycling bin and the lyrics flow lyrical content as well is is pretty average for you know an up-and-coming internet rapper track after track Owl Pharoah basically has the makings of a datpiff rap demo that has a few hundred downloads on it maybe let's take a look at the production first on this project since this seems to be what is helping Travis make his way the opening track on this thing Meadowcreek while it is a very short song and in a lot of ways kind of a motif and an intro to this thing it still displays in my opinion a lot of flaws bland bland synthesizers that are soaked in reverb and go for something epic let fall awfully short and on top of it travis has all of these weird pitch shifted vocal effects whether they be chorus effects or just taking a voice shifting it down a bunch of semitones and then backing it up behind the normal vocal this technique calls out to that chopped and screwed tradition that Travis comes from in Texas but it is executed awfully so badly I can't even tell what is being said in the lower pitched vocals much less the normal vocals when the lower pitched vocals are behind them he really renders numerous verses on a low Ferro nearly unintelligible the only thing I really got out of the opening track on this thing is that Travis doesn't really get along with his parents and while that may be a real problem that he deals with in his life it is played out very ridiculously at the open of a low Ferro in a way that is ambiguously funny and sad the song glides into the track bad moon where instrumentally the song really kind of feels like a dinky version of the instrumental from the Watch the Throne track no church in the wild these synthesizers and horns on this track are so thin and just so Gullah there's no body to them it's just cheap sound after cheap sound on this project and on top of it every idea and every influence that Travis is pulling from is just so blatantly obvious and not really turned around in a way that feels creative unique he's not really molding his influences into something that feels like it's coming from him he's merely just working a musical Chop Shop on this project pulling together a lot of knockoffs on this same track Travis makes use of that pitch shift effect once again to create some kind of lower voiced counterpoint to the things that he's saying much in the same way Tyler the Creator has been doing on his recent releases whether he's talking to some kind of adult figure authority figure therapist as this track gets into its latter half Travis breaks into what is a pretty cheesy melody with a lyric stating that he can't wait to on you and this moment in the track feels like he's ripping straight from the play books of either 808s and heartbreak or just Kid Cudi Travis will be rapping and then occasionally break into a singing voice that sounds identical to Kid Cudi's and you know I'm no huge Kid Cudi fan but I actually give cutting more props on his lyrical content and at least his voice well it's a little more soulful and it's it's it's his voice you know it's not just somebody pretending to sound like Kid Cudi while I understand Travis may be a fan of some of these people and of course that's that's going to come out in his music naturally he is literally trying to make his voice sound just like Kid Cudi's the only thing interesting about this track and some others on here is that Travis's production shops allows him to take a track instrumentally and just turn it on a dime at a moment's notice just really take a track and change the pace of it change the flow but change the way the instrumental sounds just suddenly I think that's a cool talent whether you're ripping off people or not that needs vision I think it is the most unique thing that this project has to offer however as Travis is structuring songs and throwing many pieces out there at me the tracks do end up feeling more disjointed than cohesive like the song hell of a night where Travis literally throws a bridge out there before the song even has a chance to establish itself or even a chorus and the second half of this track just again sounds like another Kanye b-side that if Kanye had produced it would never put it on an album but of course this is not produced up to that Kanye level it's a demo of the b-side that would not have made it onto the album and the track upper-echelon with Ti and what will be 2 Chainz I'm guessing while I do know there will be a full version of this song on a future iTunes version of this project still the ending of this thing could have been cleaned up a little bit couldn't it have either way the auto-tune flow that Travis Scott brings to the table on this track just bleeds future it bleeds Chief Keef and the beat bangs it is loud as hell and incredibly produced really detailed it's heavy it's a pretty badass track bead but the reason I'm kind of sad about it is I sort of suspect it bangs this hard because there are three other production credits on it aside from Travis's name when left up to his own devices you get a track on here like LeBlanc aflame where Travis is not only putting boring verse after boring verse over a pre used push a tbh but he's lying tons of farty uninteresting sense all over an instrumental that was really perfectly good to begin with I know initially that young chop wasn't happy with how good music ended up using the instrumental - I don't like it ended up altering the instrumental but if I were chop man I'd be ripping my hair out at this version of blocka the song naked also brings some really terrible vocal effects a shorter track on this album but still it is one of the few moments on this project that does bring a more personal side to Travis where he is talking about love dreams his future success this track does bring a little more focus to the table for Travis but still it displays his lack of ability when it comes to rapping not only are his metaphors and his imagery really weak and kind of lackluster but when he speeds his flow up on this track in particular he mumbles through his bars making them difficult and sort of uninteresting to listen to not only that but when Travis is rapping even about something that's personal he is lacking in energy in passion just look at the verse that he drops on any track on this project and compare it to the verse that Meek Mill lays out to the track bands Meek Mill goes ten times harder on that verse than Travis does on any verse on this project as this project continues Travis introduces one lackluster track beat after another that is not memorable in any way shape or form even the songs on here the shoe for really bold loud choruses are barely even catchy like the song dance on the moon with the Ovilus London the track is sort of a get high anthem with such a tacky tacky tacky melody on the hook here if you like marijuana and you like alcohol you should stay away from this song because I might make you want to sober up for the rest of your life lyrically I can't really defend Travis as being anything more than average anything more than your run-of-the-mill rapper that you're gonna brought across on the Internet he's not saying anything you haven't heard before let's be honest here let's not lie to ourselves Travis isn't revealing magical meta and wordplay here that people haven't run across before now outside of that I am crossing my fingers for some kind of night and day difference between the production and the audio quality on this project and the version that will I'm hoping be released on the iTunes of owl Pharoah I'm hoping that the sound quality gets better and that the synthesizers are really just sort of being choked by a low bit rate or something and that a million samples are so haven't cleared future versions of this project decide there's no denying that Travis doesn't really display a single original idea on this entire project if he's not pulling from Cuddy's pulling from Tyler if not from Tyler it's yay if not from yay it's future if it's not from future its Chief Keef if it's not from Chief Keef it's from a generally Houston eyes chopped and screwed sound the only thing I can really spot Travis on as far as originality on this project like I said before are some of the disjointed surprise song structures on this thing which don't even really add up into interesting tracks unfortunately I'm feeling a strong 3/2 a light 4 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this video was my opinion if you don't like it

ev49SUoNyrQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new classics album Hanging Gardens classics is a California electronic music duo this is their full-length debut LP and according to NPR music who was streaming this LP pretty recently they are in fact childhood friends who have been making music for quite a while now they have some new singles out from the cell P they've also got some remixes commercial remixes under their belts as well but this LP is really their first big outing it's on innovative leisure and stylistically what we have here are a series of tracks that are pretty much just very bouncy bouncy house music electronic dance music with a strong retro vibe that feeling is definitely in the air thanks to some recent releases like Daft Punk's random access memories and there are some other spots on this LP where the instrumentals remind me of this very warped strange otherworldly nostalgic sensation that I would typically get from something like chillwave music though this is definitely not as experimental or it is hazy I think Hanging Gardens functions off some very similar sentimental notions the grooves and the attitude that classics brings to the table reminds me of many a release from DFA records especially the one track on here that actually features Nancy Wang on vocals however even though I do compare this LP a little bit to some DFA releases classics definitely Nyx's the grit the urgency and the sort of Punk edge that releases on that label typically burn instead the beats the synthesizers and shimmering glistening piano chords on this LP add up into what is dance music's take on a smooth sailing sunny day it's Beach weather in the 80s in Southern California and as a result a number of tracks off of this LP are mint yes mint dance tracks that are worthy of inclusion in many many DJ sets tracks like all you're waiting for with Nancy Wang and I'll get you with chip Depp these tracks have snappy snappy beats and cyntha melodies that are so sweet and sticky it's like a drippy melting popsicle yet and then I want to lick it oh you're waiting for the vocal features on these tracks to me are just really confident they're bold they stick out I love the single holding on off of this LP - there's some really sort of cheesy 80s synth riffs soaring strings a punchy beat really great bouncy piano chords to me this track honestly feels like classics grabbed a little piece of each instrument from the hit song TV killed the radiostar and made some kind of weird house remix of it that was so manipulated it didn't even really sound like its source material these are just really sharp dance tracks in my opinion however there are other songs on here that are either so short they are so lacking in progression or they're so reverb heavy that they lack bayi it's to a point where if any of these tracks were to be played out in my opinion they would only be interesting as a transition toward something else tracks like rhythm Santa Clara as well as the song Domino's and two other tracks on this LP - that also have vocal features sadly the song long lost which features active child and a stranger love with Sara turn off both of these tracks while they're not terrible songwriting wise there are so much reverb especially laid onto the vocals in these songs that really sort of sucks the life in the body out of the voices especially active child whose solo material I have enjoyed I know from previous recordings his voice has quite a bit of body to it so I'm kind of shocked to hear it sounding so thin and and borderline lifeless on Hanging Gardens overall I do have to say this is a pleasant enough dance album with some real highlights and a few potholes as well there are quite a few sunny smooth and kind of beachfront inspired tracks on this LP put this album on and you will smell the ocean air I just feel like there needs to be a few more punchy tracks on here like the song super nature which is a pretty hard edged piece of electro funk and the closer on here a somewhat catchy and kind of sensual piece of synthesizer pop they're just a good handful of tracks on this LP that in my opinion are kind of like dancefloor wallpaper they're fine while they're on but I don't really miss them when they're gone I'm kind of feeling a light to decent sex on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Michelle Tony Brody Brody Brody fruit flies in my apartment and Jeremy only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana classics Hanging Gardens forever 
DYjFU8zATdc,wow that's good gonna work on that a little bit but it's coming together hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new this routine is hell album howl this is the latest full-length LP from this netherlands rock outfit recorded produced by kurt blue of converge fame a guy who must be one of my favorite producers of all time given that there are so many reviews in my back catalogue of albums that he produced and I would say on how Kurt strikes gold once again with these European up-and-comers now the band this routine as hell might not be extremely well known and it may seem as if Kurt Balu working with a guy of his stature would be a huge opportunity for them but this routine is how goes into this record pretty confident in their sound already back in 2010 the band dropped the full-length LP V Verve crusade which featured a lot of hardcore punk stylings slowed down to a slightly sludgy pace with some very heavy undertones but it's not like the band was particularly heavy production wise it's not like there was a lot of bass and Rumble in the mix the tone of the vocals were pretty average for hardcore but it was just the clarity and the passion and the directness of the lyrics that really sort of made the vocals stand out for me which in my opinion is a quality that I love so much about old old hardcore punk music where the lyricist really wanted to make a statement make a message on this LP this routine is held would occasionally speed things up like a hardcore band typically does but they would go on to their next EP repent repeat to indulge in a much heavier and sludgy er sound that was spring of last year and now with the album how will the band's sludge your side is in even fuller of effect but they still do maintain their hardcore punk style even as they're slowing things down a little bit more of course they still bring plenty of memorable readable and very message heavy lyrics and the end result on this LP is essentially 12 tracks and 20 minutes of some incredibly glass smashing bitter punk rock that I think fans of adrenaline pumping riffs and grooves and very fed up lyrics will enjoy this album kicks things off pretty well with one of the opening tracks on here in nostalgia which to be completely honest does have a riff a chord progression a groove and the pacing of the vocals on this track as well all of it reminds me of a recent track from the California hardcore punk band ceremony SiC it's really a dead ringer of course there are some small variations in the riff and this version is a lot heavier but I still can't help but love it the production on this track feels way thicker way more layered I'm loving the ominous guitar feedback as well and instead of a song about being sick very satirical e of a number of things this track is really a lyrical assault against nostalgia nostalgia burns us it does other things too according to the lyrics and there's just this impeccable energy even though the band isn't playing that quickly it almost feels as if they're playing very fast because of just how savage the energy is this track quickly segues into the next with a little bit of noise and I love that I love that this album really has a fantastic flow to it really it's just one song bleeding into the next and this happens in more ways than one - like the song shiver which really feels like an elongation of the previous track the title track from this LP howl now shiver is a slower track I wish it was a little bit more eventful though there is a great guitar solo on the end of this cut that just wails with passion as how progresses it just dishes out more and more tracks that feature essential grooves essential riffs which are backed up with some very interesting transitions and choruses really packed and condensed into songs that lasts about 40 seconds to two minutes like the song wrongdoer which has this just very stiff bashing intro riff which very quickly and suddenly transitions into the to this very sinister and gloomy guitar interlude and 3/4 overall in this LP I will say there are some unmemorable moments most notably the forty second long tracks which of course don't take a long time but still aren't that short in comparison with some of the other songs on this album I guess these songs don't really offer me anything to grab on to it's like they're here and they're gone without really putting out a riff or a melody that sticks in my head in their very short time span especially the untitled track on here which just is one short feedback piece still it's it's really the last portion of the cell P where I think this album gets incredibly solid the track I wait to see the world feels like a cinder block to the head it feels like a sidewalk faceplant with it's hard ass riffs and devilish melodies over the verses I think the song asleep has the same qualities as well I love the slow and sort of patient build of the song uncommon ground a lot of different parts to this track though I will say it does come off a bit more disjointed than some of the other songs on here still this song highlights to me was very important about this album and that's a lyrical theme it's a theme that many other tracks on here bring up through imagery of burning down towns breaking fingers from hands which at one time gave one a certain hand of cards anesthetize enjoy more than the ordinary there are just tons and tons of lyrics throughout this album which deal with not accepting what has just been handed to you and either fighting for or destroying what was given to you and trying to rebuild something better which in my opinion is a pretty strong and inspirational message even if it is expressed in a pretty angry way on this album overall I feel like this is a well written produced performed and pretty thrilling hardcore punk album with some strong lyrical themes there are some songs a few on here that pale in comparison to others but really I don't have many complaints at all I'm feeling a light a decent eight honest thing it's not exactly reinventing the wheel by do you think it's great if you've given this LP a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Paris Hilton good job on the little Wayne song the national fans I'm sorry I'm sorry also Alicia bananas Edom and the city of Chicago whose school board voted to close 50 schools even Cal chest and all that not good only the strong subscribed all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantan oh this routine is hell howl forever [Music] [Music] 
gx6YSnW3tUc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Anamanaguchi LP endless fantasy Anamanaguchi is a New York electronic music outfit who is pretty well known for combining rock instrumentation with bright bright super bright 8-bit style synthesizers and percussion it's the sound that they've been molding since those thousands to incorporate lots and lots of melody super distorted guitars pretty heavy drums taking musical cues from video game soundtracks like super r-type or numerous Mega Man games now there's a plethora of different video game musics out there and on amana Gucci definitely does not take a ton of influence from some of the more quirky dark or even dramatic sounds to come out of video game music instead the music that automata Gucci creates seems like it would be best set to visuals of epic space battles futuristic buildings colorful armored lasers and hover cars reaching speeds of 100 miles per hour now the band's latest LP endless fantasy also captures these vibes but does it while stretching out the band's stylistic basis meaning they take their 8-bit sound and they just try out more genres with it while primarily the band was known for fusing rock instrumentation with 8-bit sense and percussion like I said earlier now on endless fantasy the band is trying their hand at Japanese pop electro pop a little bit of house music now some of the genre hopping that the band does on endless fantasy is is very very much needed because this is a pretty long stretch of an album with 22 tracks spanning 76 minutes in a way it's almost as if the band is sort of making up for lost time because it has been a while since their last full-length LP if you don't count the soundtrack music that they did for the Scott Pilgrim video game with so many tracks on this album that feel very very similar emotionally and sonically I can't help but feel like even though I do enjoy endless fantasy to an extent the album is somewhat bogged down there are highlights on this album for sure very well written highlights and well produced highlights but maybe they don't stick out as well as they possibly could one of the songs that dropped before the selfie meow which I absolutely loved when I first heard it and still do loving the pumping bassline on this track the silly meow sounds coming through the song to the anthemic synthesizes lead melodies on this track that rush very colorfully as the chorus soars meeny-meeny-meeny this song really hits that sweet spot that Anamanaguchi is great at hitting which combines very awesome and anthemic and well written melodies with just outright absurdity while the band does have this real talent for writing instrumental rock tunes it just feels like they don't want to take themselves too seriously and just kind of keep things fun now while some people may hate the inclusion of this track on this album I will defend for sure the song prom night it is an electro-pop tune with a very radio-friendly vocal beat and hook and while I do think the lyrics on this track are kind of cheesy the hook the chorus is freakin killer and I actually think if the band comes through with the right music video for this track it could kind of be their crossover hit I dig the song in the basement because it does bring a little bit of variation with some breezier lighter instrumental verses with some very clear guitar strumming going on in there the songs snow angels and planets stick out to me because they are incredibly pretty slow jams I'm loving how the band can just take the tempo turn it down and make something that is as pretty to listen to as a very starry night sky is to look into and some of the harder hitting tracks like Veridian Genesis which is pretty exciting with it's very sudden tempo change in how a sort of blasts off in a very speedy way however other tracks on here just feel too similar in style whether it's to other songs on this album or previous material from Anamanaguchi like the song SPF 420 feels like the band grabbed one of their previous singles airbrushed drove it to a Chop Shop and then use parts from it for this song and oddly enough one half of the lead melody from the song pastel flag sounds just like Nellie's dilemma and tracks like a Keira or spaced wax America while I do welcome all Weezer and anime references I don't see what these tracks bring to the album others don't already and songs like endless fantasy as well as Japan air while automatic gucci is trying out house music and a little bit of Japanese pop on these tracks I don't see what Anamanaguchi brings to the genres other than an 8-bit aesthetic because I'm not really in love with these tracks for their Tunes or their structure I mean I consider myself to be a pretty patient listener for sure I have loved albums that are much longer than this one I just feel like their insistence on going for this one sonic vibe on many of these tracks drowns out some of this album's hidden potential because even when a song or a melody on this LP may be particularly good it doesn't really stick out because so many of the songs on this LP there's not a lot of sonic diversity for sure they're solid tracks on this LP that I could enjoy singularly but as I listen to this album as a whole the experience is kind of like getting belly sick off of a giant bag of candy that I was pretty convinced once I started eating it I could finish at their worst on the cell P the tracks are decent at their best they're great they're fantastic do give this thing a listen if you're looking for something very melodic incredibly produced fun and this feeling may last longer for you than it did for me exciting I'm feeling a strong 6 - Ally 7 on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I

5gDORqcKe2c,from sea to shining sea hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new national album Trouble will find me the National is an American rock band they've been dropping full-length albums since the early 2000s and they're relatively well known for their very gloomy musical attitude which is topped with the very deep monie and somewhat understated vocals or frontman Matt Berninger many of the band's tracks follow some pretty slow tempos are covered with very syrupy slow musical accompaniment and many of the lyrics that come through on the national songs deal with having a difficult time dealing with personal emotions heartbreak it's a formula the band has stuck to pretty passionately even as different albums of theirs have gone for slightly different musical vibes like the band OMS LP boxer which dropped in 2007 which had a pretty strong post-punk vibe on it but took a much more adult and mature approach to making music in this genre we have the band's earlier stuff as well which did delve into a bit of Americana all country at some points and their latest full-length album before the release of this LP hi violet was actually so adorned in extra instrumentation the band was pretty much in chamber pop territory at that point and it's pretty safe to say on this new LP of the Nationals that the band is in roughly the same territory that they were on hi violet especially with tracks like don't swallow the cap on this thing which are loaded with refined strings the swell and bounce against very gently pulsating guitars drums and bass however hi violet was an LP that I didn't really care for as much as many other people did for one there were not enough punchy highlights on the album that were as good as lead singles like blood buzz Ohio and on top of it the extra instrumentation that the National were laying into their songs which was playing very slowly and really really made the tracks on this LP in my opinion kind of impenetrable because the guitars bass and drums playing under this dreary instrumentation was already slow and kind of dreary to begin with in my opinion it made the band's music rife with apathy and an interest when clearly at least to me anyway it felt like they were going for something a little more sad and somewhat depressive now even though I didn't really love hi violet and this new LP as well sadly maybe the Nationals approach to making sad music is a little bit more true to form than some other sad songs that we know of out there today that might be a little bolder in terms of instrumentation and melody like it or not the Nationals music really draws a line between music where sadness or depression is merely the subject matter in the lyrics and a song when sadness and depression as a feeling as an emotion literally permeates every single element and characteristic of the music that you're hearing from the tempo to every piece of instrumentation to the melody writing through the chords the lyrics the vocal delivery and while I may see that in their music at least the National is conveying these feelings in a very personal way as an outsider as a listener to me the band's music comes off consistently as sort of boring and emotionally stunted and melodically bland listening to this album is like watching a guy bum around in his New York City condo in silk pajamas on a rainy day while listening to losing my religion on repeat through his iPod speaker dock with three days of stubble on his face now let me say that existential crises are real and should be face down if you overcome them they can't become moments of personal growth or fester if you completely ignore them however the crises that Trouble will find me presents feel so temporary from the first chord strummed on the opening track of this LP it doesn't even feel like there's any reason to get invested for sure there are moments on this LP where I feel like the band is channeling Leonard Cohen a little bit but never do they come off as dramatic or maybe even a little bit of magnetic fields comes through but the national was just not as quirky though they don't really try to be as quirky but I wouldn't say they're as clever or as melodically memorable either or as poetic I feel like the band can definitely be pretty engaging or dramatic when it comes to writing a hook or throwing instrumentation out there the song fireproof is definitely example but when the verses come through Matt's vocals the pace of his lyrics and what they're saying is well to me personally feel sort of unengaging with how slow they're moving I guess in a sense I just get a little impatient waiting for something that would justify all of this there are other highlights on here in my opinion like the song pink rabbits which is a pretty solid piano ballad melodically the song demons is very interesting in its seven eight times signature puts an interesting groove out there which the band performs very nicely so smoothly that it doesn't even become apparent that the song is in 7/8 and the song sea of love which is one of the more epic songs on this LP very passionate background vocals rapid-fire snare drums shimmering guitars building instrumentation but once again on this LP all of these very pretty colors and pretty pieces of instrumentation pretty individually meld together and blend into a uniformly unappealing and uninspiring it's hard for me to just dive into these things and say hey this is great this is great this is great because I don't really care for the Nationals music on this record simply based on its premise all of these ideas which may be great on paper are filtered through this very syrupy slow no justification lethargy Len that just doesn't really appeal to me this album in my opinion is just well-dressed listlessness overall I'm really sort of feeling a light too decent for on this record if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it this review is my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw I want to give a shout out to Austin for being a cool bro Kieran Leonard for being an even cooler I want to give a shoutout to Kanye for not sounding like Death Grips and of course Justin Bieber don't worry Cal takes you seriously Cal is a believer throwing through only the strong subscribe all mistakes were intentional Anthony Fantana the National Trouble will find me forever [Music] 
tTUBoFVi-HY,random access memories hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new Daft Punk album random access memories the kings of French house are back with a new full-length album that has been quite the buzz for a good chunk of this year thanks to an incredibly hot single that was dropped before the release of this album get lucky and what has also really turned heads about this new full-length is the very diverse set of collaborators that Daft Punk is brought on board to create this album guitarist Nile Rodgers panda bear from Animal Collective pianist composer Chilly Gonzales songwriter Paul Williams Pharrell and Julian Casablancas from The Strokes but what's even crazier about this LP is the direction that Thomas and guide man take the music in if you're my age or a little older you remember growing up and sort of coming of age with very hot singles like one more time harder better faster stronger and around the world of course the LP these songs came from discovery is solid from front to back on top of that the release of interstellar five five five five and prior to that homework it was almost as if Daft Punk was getting better and better and could do no wrong however the duo did hit a minor snag in the mid-2000s with the release of human after all the album overall was much less thematic than Discovery on top of that the very thin distorted production all over this album with the very repetitive grooves and slight rock influence certainly some good singles came out of this LP but there were some kind of shaky deep cuts because the effects and the aesthetic that Daft Punk were going for on this album really overshadowed and sort of choked off what quality the tunes had to offer still as Daft Punk moved on past human after all it was the timelessness of their previous singles that went on to define them not only that but they dropped a very stellar live album in 2007 and went on to produce what some people consider to be a pretty quality soundtrack with Tron and even though that was a huge project for Daft Punk and brought them a lot of exposure this new album of theirs might be a bit more ambitious especially since they're kind of throwing their trademark sound out the window on this album they're abandoning house music and instead embracing the sounds of 70s and 80s synth funk disco soft rock as well and this isn't like another human after all whether taking on rock music and doing it with electronics there's a ton of live instrumentation on this new album while some people may argue that this is Daft Punk drifting away from their roots I think that this is them getting to the roots of their roots and re envisioning it in a way that feels like it's authentically them it's kind of a risk for Daft Punk even if they do keep their handy vocoders very close at their sides now this new sound that Daft Punk is shooting for on this LP it spells out a much livelier and lighter sound on this album tracks like get lucky sound like a very nostalgic pastel fun-loving night out at Studio 54 not some kind of 2:00 a.m. rave session with banging bass and massive speakers in a gritty grimy downtown club Daft Punk is not the only major electronic music artist in recent years to trade in many of the electronics that they typically futz with for more live instrumentation and a somewhat vintage feel you can look at square pusher with a few of his most recent albums as well as what he was doing with Shova leader one or even Daft Punk worshipers justice with what they were doing on their last full length album audio-video disco an album where justice was fussing around with a lot of the same musical movements that Daft Punk is on random access memories now this new LP of Daft Punk's has a very clean shimmering rich production sound lots of drums very snappy tons of kick and hi-hat on this thing the guitars have a nice sharp metallic tone to them and bounce very playfully when Nile Rodgers brings his trademark strumming patterns this album doesn't really get hot and heavy with the horn sections this isn't a KC and the Sunshine Band kind of thing as shown on the opening track from the cell P a lot of the crescendos builds and extra instrumentation is executed with electronics vocoder vocals synthesizers of many shapes and size as many tracks on this LP field disco but it's executed with a somewhat more modern flair as if this disco music had occurred and had been recorded in the 80s and I do realize we've seen melds of these two ideas in the past through genres like euro disco electro disco Italo disco historically we can see that the music in the 70s and that the music in the 80s happened right next door to each other but Daft Punk makes a record here that brings these eras right on top of each other brings out their commonalities in a way that feels very natural light-hearted fun occasionally cheesy but also ambitious and kind of cinematic it points like I said they're very sharp punchy disco tracks on this thing like the opener give life back to music the song has a sweet infectious vocal melody that I love and I love the mantra of this track about man giving life back to music I'm feeling that and when this song goes for a rush of instrumentation the distorted guitars come in and it kind of feels like I'm listening to some kind of huge instrumental break from an 80s arena rock or prog rock song instrumentally tracks like this one don't just feel like loosely grooved out and perform dance songs they feel very methodical and kind of composed like the song lose yourself to dance come out come out come out come out moments like this are very carefully layered over the grooves and happen at precise points to make the music continue to be engaging from beginning to end this song and the track get lucky are both fronted vocally by Pharrell and these songs take a lot of disco sounds a lot of disco grooves but repeat them out with sort of a house electronic music mentality I will say the only shortcoming of these two tracks and it hurts the song lose yourself to dance even more is that Pharrell's falsetto on these songs isn't the best he's no Barry Gibb get lucky because he does work in more of his mid range does go over a lot better and has grown on me since I first heard it and believe me I've heard it dozens of times since it first dropped on the Internet the hook on this track is hella catchy and I love the way the beat shifts from when Pharrell is singing to when dat Punk comes in with the vocoder vocals it is a nice change in groove the track is so good it's making Cal want to get lucky yes baby even the song instant crush isn't bad which features Julian Casablancas on vocals the only thing I didn't really care for on this track was that the vocoders were just a little Miravalle for me on this song still tuned wise the track wasn't bad it had some downstroke guitars on it sort of felt like a stroke song but with a bit of an electronic edge to it on the song fragments of time which is one of the least electronic tracks on this LP Daft Punk brings on electronic music producer Todd Edwards to front this song vocally which is essentially a pretty sweet piece of soft rock though this track does sort of expose a flaw overall on random access memories yes Daft Punk is reaching back but there are some spots on the selkie where I wish things fell or just sounded a little bit more novel and I think some people are going to feel that way considering Daft Punk's pioneer electronic music status they've got their own sound they've got their own style why copy ideas from the Boston playbook still the song is done pretty well and the way I see it and enjoy is just by sort of taking it as one part in the larger picture of random access memories which to me is an expression of a group of different musical eras enacted animatronic Lee in this glorious Museum of the future disco smooth funk and soft rock are not the only things that are worshipped on this LP there's some very sensual and beautiful slow jams and ballads on this album as well songs like within beyond and the game of love now think what you want to think about these tracks they're soft they're not the most hard-hitting or anything like that but to me these songs are the closest Daft Punk come to doing something that is more alike to their older stuff if you take a song from Discovery like something about us where you've got very jagged bass lines a slow groove that's very disco influenced guitars and since adding a little bit of color here and there and of course vocoder vocals those robot vocals singing upfront a very strong melody a ballad and lot York's about love what daftpunk does on these slow Jamz off this album they've done before and they're doing it just as well here as they have in the past while some people have criticized the lyrical content of tracks like lose yourself to dance and get lucky certainly Daft Punk makes up for that on these tracks by proving that their lyrical prowess is still there the track game of love is incredibly heartbreaking with its portrayal of dying love in its lyrics the song within lyrically to me is very surreal and gives me the listener a sense of just smallness in this gigantic big difficult to understand world and lyrically the song beyond to me is like a very passionate journey of the soul somewhat sad and forlorn one too and on the beginning of this track Daft Punk bringing in a huge epic string section really flexing that instrumental muscle that they brought through on Tron it speaks of places never seen it is the birthplace of your dreams and as far as another slow jam on this LP doing it right with pandabear actually surprised me a lot and turned out to be incredibly good and enjoyable typically when I catch a panda bear feature on an album with another artist panda bears vocals come through and totally derail whatever vibe the album add going on however that didn't really seem to be the case on this LP I actually think pandas vocals not only were complemented really well at the very spacious music on this track but the way that he sung on the song lended itself well to the vibe that Daft Punk was going for on this album maybe it got a little eccentric as he was climbing up in range ah-ha-ha-ha-ha but still it did not become over bearing good job I love the subtle progression of this track instrumentally it was a nice song to tag on the end of this LP it felt like the slow motion montage soundtrack to an unforgettable night out with your friends now I really dig the disco tracks on this LP I love the slow jams on this LP but this album really dazzles when it comes to the longer more ambitious and more instrumentally fleshed out tracks like Giorgio by Moreau dare to have this dude on this album just shows how far that Thomas and guy man will go to get that authentic sound for this record to really pay homage to the musical eras that they are worshipping I love the students narration on this track his personal story that comes through he is just telling it how it happened and how he sees it and how his life went and what brought him to this point and the music is incredibly epic against his vocals the sequence synthesizers which really create a saga of sound the song sounds a little cheesy at first but there's an incredible energy to it as it progresses the song eventually turns into what I think is kind of a synth lead progressive rock jam it's incredibly ambitious especially as strings come in through on the latter half of the track and really fill the song out beautifully and the very dramatic song touch on this album which totally makes sense if you take a look at Paul Williams career writing songs for his singers writing songs for television writing songs for soundtracks I love the opening of this track Paul's voice sounds fantastic emotive as hell the song picks up steam eventually going into a string of very funky disco grooves that are incredibly again smooth and then on the latter portion of this thing it slows down and brings in a huge chorus again Daft Punk going for that epic musical accompaniment and some of the things that Paul is singing on this track about touching feeling being convinced that he's he's real almost it's like Daft Punk is bringing lyrics that sort of toy with the idea of being a human having feelings or being a robot and and what it means to kind of cross those planes to me the song is rock opera s maybe something meatloaf fans can really appreciate and there few other tracks on here which are very instrumentally impressive too like the track motherboard which to me isn't one of my favorite songs on this LP I think the composition the structure of this song could have been a little bit more interesting but the woodwind on this track the pace of it is very tense and it's again Daft Punk flexing that instrumental muscle and the closing track on this thing contact epic epic finish it gets so intense so distorted so heavy it really finishes this album off with a bang overall God's a incredibly impressed with this album not only did Daft Punk recapture all these old musical styles redo a lot of them with a new modern flair and kind of their own twist on it mix them all together onto this one LP where they all have a lot of different qualities to them stylistically because the duo covers a lot of different genres on this thing not just a handful and they have an incredible flow to them from beginning to end on this LP sure there are a few tracks on here that sort of paled in comparison to others but even though Daft Punk isn't pioneering into some kind of new electronic music territory what makes this album so amazing to me is that it is a tribute a tribute to music and it's a passionate well produced and well performed one at that I'm feeling 80 on the cell peak if you've given it a listen what did you think of it love it hate it why that's it this review was my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw want to give a shout-out to Dodie Bob Tammy Timothy and Big Joe only the strong subscribe and all mistakes were intentional Daft Punk random access memories Anthony Fantan Oh forever 
8loAnsnu8o4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and just make it a quick video here talking about last night I went out and I saw the one and only 8-bit chip tune rock and roll on a mana Gucci New York Anamanaguchi band Anamanaguchi chi chi they have a new LP that they just dropped this past week titled endless fantasy I wanted to kind of wait till the end of this week to really talk about the album in a video because I wanted to see them live according to what peak one of the band's members was saying on stage this was their first show after releasing the album and playing a ton of this new material from the new LP and it sounded really good in person I really can't wait to talk about this album at great length in a video I'm sort of hoping that uh it appears that there is a little bit more diversity on the album sonically then at least it felt like there was live overall the performance was really good I mean you pretty much had live guitars and live drums with pretty much all of them than the MIDI being played through the PA and even though the MIDI was you know kind of stuck in place and you know there wasn't really any way to sort of improvise it or change it on the fly or at least that sort of felt like in person the intensity of the guitars and the drums just hearing that in person did bring you know some some energy to it and person it wasn't like this flat sort of static performance it did rock BAM here is some footage and as you can see the band which they mentioned in their Kickstarter campaign has pretty much bought the really great lighting that they are now touring with behind this album from what I understand the lighting that they are playing with live is fed or I guess at least linked into the MIDI information so these lights were very in sync and incredibly colorful for the duration of Anamanaguchi said they had some projections playing as well on a screen behind the drummer and overall it was just a really good energetic performance people there were freaking out were totally psyched to see the band and the new material essentially went over without a hitch I didn't really you know pick out any sour moments or anything like that it was a really good performance if you really want to kind of see this light performance live and just hear this hyper melodic music and believe me the lights are really impressive in person definitely try to catch this band on this new tour that they're going out on with this new album from what I understand the CD version of endless fantasy is out and they didn't have copies of it with them there at the show but they should be putting together a vinyl package for this album as well down the road if you caught the band last night in Hamden Connecticut or at least it was last night at the time of shooting this video what did you think did you love it hate it why and if you do manage to catch on amount of Gucci at some later date on this same tour still same question same comment cool cool Anthony Fantana Anamanaguchi forever you

sEVQ4ZFxZxM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Dillinger Escape Plan album one of us is the killer The Dillinger Escape Plan is a New Jersey lab rock outfit who since the late 90s has been one of the most interesting groups out there to meld elements of hardcore and metal now despite the band's very complex and type playing heavy guitars they have pretty much avoided many tags from the prog metal or the gent direction and on the new LP as well the band deflects those labels mostly because of their post hardcore influence which occasionally pops up on these tracks and they're very Mike Patton inspired chord progressions and vocal experiments it's stuff like this that has kept the band's music pretty interesting over the years as they have stayed devoted to their very spastic fast disorienting musical style now on this new full-length LP The Dillinger Escape Plan is just as hard-hitting as ever matching up difficult to pin down guitar riffs with drums that are dizzying to say the least thanks to Billy rhymer for those and the band's frontman great but not only is he an aggressive fierce vocalist but he is very dynamic as well sometimes channeling vocal ranges and Tambor's that remind me of guys like Mike Patton as well as Trent Reznor many of the tracks on the selfie feature speedy riff laden versus but slowed down almost instantaneously as soon as the chorus hits and soar melodically and not to mention our incredibly catchy Dillinger clearly displays the line separating a melodic chorus from a Wimpy chorus and they don't cross it not even once on this LP as if it's easy even as they present songs on here like the title track which has a very ethereal intro sort of has a a very moody tumbleweed spaghetti-western kind of set up to it and Greg comes through singing swapping out his very fierce growls and head's splitting screams for very passionate falsettos and some really great singing in his mid-range - they're just really crushing chords on the hook - this song [Music] loving the melody on this track and at the end of every measure I believe that's the term I want to use the band has a little bit of variation on the riffs and the grooves just to bring just a touch of newness freshness anymore it keeps things interesting and also with the chorus on this thing it is so sweet and it's so catchy and I actually think this track could do some radio play if you're talking about you know a modern metal hard rock station and nobody would even flinch at being offended or this is too loud or this is too aggressive a lot like older bands like Faith No More who clearly have at least a little bit of an influence on this record The Dillinger Escape Plan finds a perfect balance between extremity and accessibility this track is just really really easy to get into even if you're not a huge metal fan even if you're just a regular rock fan however it doesn't really feel like the band compromised their sound that much to make this track there are other tracks on here too which come off a little mr. bungle esque as they switch their drums and guitars from metal mode to kind of jazzy lounge mode tracks like nothing's funny which to me has one of the most stellar hooks on this LP and paranoia shields this track in particular shows the band bringing in some really nice background instrumentation this is a move that the band is no stranger to there have been plenty of LPS in their back catalog that have featured strings but strings don't actually play at least a noticeable role on this LP on this particular track horns and epic huge background vocals this track is one of the longer and more multifaceted songs on this album I love how much the band is able to throw at me the listener and yet keep things pretty cohesive the song cross burner is pretty long and multifaceted as well to go back to instrumentation the only moment we're adding a little bit extra see if that old was with the song magic that I held you Dillinger works in what feels like a little bit of glockenspiel on the track however it melds with the heavy metal guitars in the song horribly it feels as if they had to mix it over the guitars much louder than anything else actually just to get it to read audibly against the distortion the banging drums now these very catchy sweet straightforward and instrumentally refined tracks or counterbalance very nicely with tracks that are nothing but earthquake like Furies of riffs and drums they're bloody they're like the song Prancer that opens the cell P up Oh tons of shrill chords all over this thing it's just a pummel session at the listener and it's really one of the most blazing openers I've heard on a metal record this year I also love the chord changes that come into play and the epic melodic ascent the song makes toward the end as well it's a nice second half at this track presents also the syncopated chords and vocals that are met with skipping drums on the next track on this LP when I lost my bet our masterfully played that track and understanding decay are more examples prime examples of this band playing grooves that are so odd and strange and yet they rock them so fluidly to the point where yeah sure they're technically proficient but the listener has such a straight visceral reaction to it you don't really need to sit there and think about what the groove is or how you should Bob your head to it it just comes so naturally with how they play it off showing that The Dillinger Escape Plan is the band for you if you're more into just being rocked and having a reaction than just simply flashy playing because certainly they have that the only track on here that really kind of left me cold and still you know do you really have a lot of momentum - it was the eighth track on here which was relatively shortened to me really felt like more of a riff idea than a song and the closer on the end of this album didn't really feel that climactic in my opinion it was rough it was wild but maybe I was waiting for a bit of closure or something at the end of this LP overall I have to say maybe this is slightly a little bit Dillinger Escape Plan by the numbers and it sort of wears a lot of khatyn isms on its sleeve still this is an incredibly performed written and produced metal record very solid and I would I commend it to anybody who was looking for some loud rock that is not only accessible but has a little bit of an edge to it has a strong element of surprise and some interesting riffs I'm feeling a light a decent eight on this thing if you've given it a listen hey what did you think what should i review next that's it this review was my opinion if you don't like it here's a straw want to give a shout-out to Timmy Michael Joe jr. Sarah and Ashley all mistakes were intentional only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana The Dillinger Escape Plan one of us is the killer forever [Music] 
N6LKyzMiWuw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here and I'm doing a quick video not a quick video this video is not gonna be quick it's a video it's just a video talking about a recent experience I had seeing an artist who I enjoy quite a bit live Ghostface Killah who was backed up by Adrian young bands Venice Dawn on their new 12 reasons to die tour if you guys don't already sort of know the background on these artists do check out my review for the new Ghostface Killah and Adrian young album 12 reasons to die and in this video I would essentially like to talk about my experience and recommend that you catch these guys if they are playing in your freaking area I caught these guys playing in New Haven this past week over at Oates place shout out to toads place they played on the main stage in the venue and there were some opening acts but but really my attention was grabbed I was surprised when Adrian Young's band eventually took the stage because essentially they were going to play a solo semi instrumental set by themselves before Ghostface Killah even came out and they came out full instrumentation guitars two vocalists drummer keyboards as well bass and together they went on these freaking intense heavily grooved out jams that brought together elements of soul funk rock psychedelic rock as well just really great solid playing a lot of syncopated rifts with the guitars bass and drums nice keyboard playing to the vocals that the band brought to the table as well we're just soaring epic really emotive I really understand now why the instrumentals on 12 reasons to die sounded so freakin good they incorporated some original stuff some stuff that they did for 12 reasons to die like they did the shor shot instrumental and worked it into this set which had very little gaps it really seemed like they were linking many different pieces together into this one elongated Jam and once Ghostface Killah came out and they intro'd this whole thing by kind of you know going on this journey we're gonna start playing twelve reasons to die now essentially they really performed a lot of pivotal chunks of this album with Ghostface and you know tried to play out the album as if it were the narrative that it actually is on record Adrian young coming out and saying you know the story is set here and Ghostface Killah so-and-so and he's doing this and this is happening in the storyline so they really tried to make sort of a dramatic thing of it they tried to make a little theatrical in a sense but essentially at the end of the day it was really just about the performances Ghostface Killah came out the band was playing the first instrumental from the new 12 reasons to die album i believe but Ghostface Killah was actually spitting a verse from an older track which a lot of people knew the words to I you know was a little more interested in just sort of hearing the new stuff but this was an interesting way to get people sort of into the new record in a way but sort of give it an old familiar kind of sentiment to it that people are just gonna latch on to a little bit quicker still as the songs went on the storyline of the album carried on Ghostface Killah declared war on the DeLuca's he got seduced and tricked he went out to go see the DeLuca's when they when they showed up at his place and tony was killed which adrian announced in the middle of the set the band played another few instrumental pieces and Ghostface came out after the rise of the Ghostface Killah and exacted his lyrical revenge upon his murderers and the band and ghost were really great at sort of playing into the crowd sort of having them sing along as they turn out the lights they were holding up lighters Ghostface Killah return to the stage it was really just dramatic there were masks they were costume changes and even though this shows really about the new stuff there was time to get you know a little nostalgic and and really celebrate the I guess you would say the legacy of hip-hop that Ghostface Killah is a part of adrian young and his band with Ghostface performed wu-tang's protect you neck getting Ghostface to spit method man's verse of course on the stage for a ton of tracks on this performance kill a priest was there to performing verses hyping up Ghostface and when they went into play protect your neck before they perform the song they you know said hey somebody's got to do ODB's verse who's gonna do that we need volunteers and instantly this dad in the front of the crowd just almost threw his kid onto the stage like you know here's my he looked about 10 11 12 here's my kid and this kid looked to be the youngest out of anybody there he was right up front up against the monitor and I'd been seeing that he pretty much knew every lyric from every song that they had been playing so far whether it was a new Ghostface verse or an old one so in my head I was like no doubt this kid knows all the words so they had the kid come up and no surprise he actually knew the words there was a point where he wasn't holding the microphone close enough but he knew what he was doing and they had another person from the crowd to spit the verse as well soon after this kid it was a really fun sort of interactive part of the the set that everybody had a good time with I liked that Ghost Face and the band really brought this set to a heavy climactic ending they performed a lot a lot of tracks I mean this show got out about it like 2:30 or so so it was a long set it was really charismatic it was really just loud boisterous and tense not only was Ghostface really enthusiastic as enthusiastic as usual but Adrian young and his band brought that live instrumentation intensity that you typically don't get by just sort of listening to a DJ or a producer take to the stage with an emcee because with the backup singers there and some of the jams and the guitar freak outs it really gave the set a lot of diversity and spontaneity and I have no doubt that if you were to catch these guys live yourself that you would end up with something a little bit different than what I actually did I really did enjoy this set like I said earlier if you do get a chance to catch ghost and Adrian Young's band Venice Dawn on tour the there's 12 reasons to die album then absolutely no question do it cool cool Anthony Fantana Ghostface Killah Venice dawn 12 reasons to die forever 
U2oWxvgeboY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd guy and it's time for Vampire Weekend now fires of the city Vampire Weekend is a New York indie pop and rock outfit who annoyed me on their first album captivated me with their second and has had me patiently awaiting the release of their third this now for better or for worse Vampire Weekend has easily been one of the most standout groups in indie pop over the past handful of years the band's fun pop hooks are seamlessly blended with classical music style Arrangements colorful production and instrumentation with a lot of personality and texture the band also has the capability to play tracks that are incredibly fast loud sort of noisy but still very fun and playful and occasionally they'll drop a bit of musical elements from sky muzac or reggae and singer-songwriter Paul Simon influences coming from his solo stuff has shown up stronger and stronger and stronger as the band has released more material and most of these elements show up once again to create a pretty worthwhile sequel to the band's last full-length LP contra and I say most of these elements because the band does change up their recipe a little bit on this new LP Vampire Weekend subtracts the world music element out of their music in a really big way on this release none of the tracks on this album really come through as being influenced by anything more than Western popular contemporary and classical music which is kind of strange because sounds coming from ska and reggae most notoriously have helped the band to find their sound since day one but it would seem on this new full-length LP the group is really trying to get their songwriting to stand on its own two feet and not be enjoyed relative to how many steel drums or thumb pianos manage to show up on a given track and for the most part Vampire Weekend does bring lyrics and Mel that are up to the challenge of this change with refined instrumentation with a very strong classical music vibe to it the band will occasionally throw out tracks that are adorned in strings or very beautiful chorus vocals I mean gargantuan chorus vocals which show up most notoriously on tracks like yeah hey or on the track Hudson one of the closing tracks on this LP that actually on top of the course feels as if it's backed up orchestral II the production and effects are just as dynamic on this LP as they were on contra and the lyrics are romantically poetically passionately descriptive on subjects such as life love and a really big topic for this new LP religion God it would seem almost as if this subject matter comes up on most of the tracks on this album in ways that are subtle and not so much like the track obvious style that kicks this album off which through its melody and it's chord progression has a huge gospel vibe the track features a somewhat borrowed melody but the band is able to keep things interesting musically by evolving the instrumentation as the song plods along bringing in more and more electronically tinged sounds but still managing to keep the track feeling very delicate refined and beautiful it's like a sunshiny morning day morning the track unbelievers also has a very strong religious tone to it with Ezra throwing elements in his lyrics that reference unbelievers sinners fate and being bored again the instrumentation has a really fast peppy pace to it that really really reminds me of moments from Paul Simon's Graceland same with the track worship you which has a very steady gallop to it and even though the song does add an incredibly catchy chorus this track really really caught my attention when Ezra threw the lyric out there that will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the Train and one more note on this LP in relation to religion the song yah-hey has to be mentioned it's one of the longer tracks on this LP and obviously the chorus on this album could sort of be a plan words for the word Yahweh and lyrically the song seems to be somewhat of a calm conversation directly with God sort of displaying this loss of faith with certain groups of people on this track much like on the song unbelievers Azra paints this difficult picture with religion this difficult personal relationship this desire to believe or this passion for the will to believe but there's something sort of holding him back or at least the person he's singing from the standpoint of a relationship that I think most people with a modern mentality have with religion due to things like modern science and contradictions and holy texts or just long unanswered philosophical questions though I'm sure many out there with an internet connection can easily point out the faults of religion still it doesn't make this song feel any sort of less heartbreaking for me especially since Ezra's performance on this track seems so sincere however if there is a downside to this track it is the annoyingly chipmunk vocals which pop up all over the already strange and slightly obnoxious chorus on this track in a way it kind of reminds me of the track California English from the band's last full-length LP which a lot like yeah hey was overall pretty good tune a tune I really want to like but then the band incorporates this really sort of obnoxious element into it kind of ruining it for me as much as I love Vampire Weekend because of their boyish vocals their ability to woo me with their lyrics and their beautiful melodies they're playful light-hearted yet methodical instrumentation the band occasionally breaks this love streak by putting out a track that I just can't stand not that the band should take my personal taste into account when writing music but there are tracks on the cell P like finger back which in my opinion is from front to back annoying it's the constant staccato instrumentation that never really seems to relax until the band reaches a bridge which isn't even that interesting to me and the melody that is being played with the staccato instrumentation and edge we're singing on top of it essentially results in no the docs go found love but fluffa Shep and she averted a gaze the melody is so freakin jumpy I kind of want to just try my best to grab at it except it's so repetitive throughout nearly the entire track I just lose interest the song worship you also sort of loses my interest as well by being just a little too hmm the verses on this song are so speedy that Ezra's words all sort of blend together in this really unrewarding way you know a vast majority of the songs on this LP are enjoyable like the very eerie moonlit and epic track Hudson toward the end of this LP the song is fantastic it's like a battle epilogue it's it's really just a big finish for this album outside of these sort of short shrug like semi instrumental tracks like step and Diane young I have sung their praises in the past I still enjoy these tracks quite a bit but I still can't help but feel like to an extent around the halfway point of this album the album sort of loses steam and gets kind of spotty first off you have the song everlasting arms which in comparison with many of the tracks on this album the annoying ones and the good ones just kind of feels like wallpaper doesn't really stick out in any significant way and then following this you have in my opinion the three most annoying tracks on the LP back to back to back still the the first half of this LP is is great it's incredibly solid it just seems almost as if on the second half of this album they didn't really want to copy themselves whether it be their past material or just the earlier material on this LP so they started to wildly experiment which I guess is okay in a sense because it did bring this album variety but then all of a sudden it drops off completely emotionally with the very downtrodden and subtle quiet Hudson which does finish epically but it feels as if there's a complete stop in terms of flow on the album at this point and the band just completely changes gears and then puts out a really short track to kind of close the album out in my opinion definitely not as much cohesion track for track as an album like contra I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Vampire Weekend [Music] 
wG034hgGvis,washing machine hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music bird and it's time for a review of the new cola album moody cute Cola is the musical project of electronic tinkerer and extreme sampler Michael this is his new full-length under this name with which he has released other following albums which not too much unlike this one our electronic sample based and have a sort of neo psychedelic tone to them I would actually say an earlier releases like dial tone Earth there was a really clear Animal Collective influence in how some of the samples were executed there were even some really strong dub reggae vibes which continued very strongly on his next full-length daydream repeater that dropped in late 2011 moody coupe though if you're familiar with colas earlier stuff still very much feels like a Cola release mostly because of these Spacey's synths and the way that vocal samples and just samples in general are chopped on this thing but surely this album comes off as being much more abstract and complex on this thing Cola grabs samples from across the conceptual plain everything from scissors cutting to drink sipping spans of music pieces of percussion weird unidentifiable noises breaths a lot of familiar sounds that are executed in such a strange way that I feel like I've just transported into this completely different world where nothing makes sense it's like an electronically generated Dali painting or something my records behind me are melting and kouchuu chest is playing them a lot of CO solo on a dog it is difficult to make sense ibisworld acting the rhythms throughout this album are incredibly cheery and and strange very oddly shaped and the samples are twisted pitch shifted manipulated in a myriad of different ways the synthesizers feel as if they're playing sequences that were programmed on some computer from the late 90s early 2000s they kind of have a tone to them that feel as if they were borrowed from like a self-help video or something it's kind of vaporwave if you ask me there's definitely an element of plunder phonics on this album I'll OneNote Rick's point never or Matt mos there's some glitchy music sampling abstractions on this thing too that remind me of Early Girl Talk and many of the samples on this record are pasted out in a way that feels as if they're spelling out some kind of experimental techno structure that I can't quite make sense of even though there are artists in sample-based music that I can't point to in reference to this album this LP feels more like a personal exploration of sound and music as opposed to some kind of ode to anyone influenced even though this album can be very disorienting at first because of its sounds once I listen to it again and again and again I really kind of got a feel what each track was going for stylistically and emotionally and it just wasn't this very confusing jumble for example the opening track on this thing sukiyaki to die for which in a way really has a strong jazz fusion vibe to it with its constant ride cymbals the piano and since on this thing too but of course the samples in just the the very Spacey production the reverb production makes it feel pretty futuristic and sort of Cosmo grama Flying Lotus esque it's a pretty intricate track that I dig a lot and the song deaf Christian is is another favorite of mine from this LP the track has a really busy beat and it feels as if it's sampling these Motown era vocals the words that are being sung and the melodies really ring true from this era of music but the way that this song builds especially with the hi-hats on this thing it feels as if it's also borrowing from trap music to the track is really an incredible and creative set of influences samples and edits and there's a hard groove on this track too even though many of the sounds on this album may seem strange with how they're placed and where they're coming from Cola is typically not mysterious when it comes to grooves the grooves that these beats rock are really the most straightforward thing about this album in my opinion if there is a major downside that some listeners may find on this LP though it's that the constant and strange samples being repeated over and over and over on many of these tracks can be a little overbearing and the sounds that Cola assembles on some of these tracks most notably on a track like melters Delight it's not like all the sounds in my opinion really come together into something that feels cohesive with all the synth arpeggios on the song really clashing more than they come together really makes this song more of a mess than a triumph I can see that the hi-hat really references kind of a techno thing on this song but kholat definitely makes it experimental by omitting the constant kick drum but I still feel like this track and many others on here don't go on for as long as they possibly could maybe string these ideas out a little bit make some space and build up to the most intense and really kick off in this part instead songs like melters delight really make a ruckus and and bow out pretty quickly I pretty much feel the same way about the track redeemable features songs like unfor example really take their time going somewhere set a very patient pace I love the woodwinds sense on this track which are matched up with other synth tones as well which are equally lush that combined with some of the weird clicks and hi-hats and the beat on this thing this song is much more palatable the song suspicious kind of has that dub reggae feel creeping back into colas music it has these guitar samples that really it skips across the ocean like rocks and on top of it the song takes these chill though khals and sax samples that are warped in this very strange way that's sort of unsettling and sour this album to me is really more of an experimental mind game and while it is really intriguing it is very playful that can't be denied either to listen to these songs over and over and over again the novelty of just how weird and out there they are wears off moderately quick and the fact they don't have a really strong structure to them it does make this album lose its flavor a little bit though still it is it is very admirable and likeable to kind of pop on an album that is you know sort of throwing all these unexpected things at me a little bit I'm feeling uh pretty much like a decent two strong six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it kolja moody coupe breath you 
0fgfTrHZGlY,hi everyone Anthony Pham tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Charli XCX album true romance Charli XCX is in English pop music singer who has been gathering quite a bit of buzz over the past few years over a bunch of pretty hot singles songs like stay away which in my opinion is attractive is incredibly well written really melodic and has a very modern synthetic feel to it but with a bit of a tease New Wave chic or the song you which a lot of people remember for its very interesting use of a gold panda sample tracks like these that featured really interesting and sort of progressive production really forecasted Charlie to be an artist who is going to be a little bit more eclectic than your average modern pop singer however I don't really feel like that ended up being the case even though there are a handful of decent songs on this album and some likeable instrumentals I think this album is sort of a case of taking something smearing it in some extra makeup wrapping it in some edgy clothing and then selling it as being sort of original or different I gotta say track after track on this LP Charli XCX has a very very passable voice and not that she doesn't have pitch or range really my issue with a lot of these tracks is a lack of interesting emotion coming from these vocals despite a lot of the emotional and sort of romantic themes that come out of the lyrics on this album Charlie's voice doesn't really come off as all that moving to my ears it almost gets borderline ridiculous as she embarks upon many many very slowly wrapped verses and what makes these parts so ridiculous are some of the silly just sort of cliche lyrics while I have nothing against this album's blend of house pop music just dance pop in general as well as synth pop I just feel like Charli XCX doesn't bring that much flair or personality on this record though an album like this a very short sort of concise very bright electronic pop record can be great sometimes sort of a breath of fresh air a break from some of the more serious music out there I just don't really have a lot of faith in this album to navigate its way through the modern pop landscape when it doesn't really make an effort to define itself within that instead there are too many moments on this album where it embraces some of contemporary pops worst characteristics like the song nuclear seasons that opens the cell P up while I do like the start of the track Charlie's voice is just really ethereal off in the distance it has this really Airy production that sort of reminds me of Grimes a bit once the song moves past its intro and the course is pretty decent on this thing too the verses are absolutely boring don't feature any interesting vocals or melodies whatsoever and the reason that is is because this track like many on the radio today brings pretty much Moaning that is supposed to be sold as singing and the melody on this part seems really half-baked I just find so many pop songs today where it's like the verse is completely neglected in favor of just having an incredibly explosive course which you know is said because Charlie seems like a capable singer I don't know why they would want to throw out a verse like this as opposed to something that was a little more well crafted to be completely honest there isn't a single song on this album that captivates me until the fourth and fifth tracks on here stay away and set me free these tracks to me have solid melodic writing for beginning to end explosive choruses sweet verses production that actually rings through as being very punchy and clear the instrumentation seems like it's oriented in a really clean interesting way whereas tracks like take my hand instead just feel like a jumbled mess where Charlie and her producers are trying to make as much synthetic noise as possible to make it seem like something interesting is happening when maybe it's really not the case the songs stay away really nice solid breakup song a track about not wanting to be around someone because they sort of bring those old emotions back up in you again it's torture to see them again and the track feel my pain sort of a lust song not exactly new and refreshing angles in pop music but still the singing goes overwhelm the production feels really synthetic futuristic and slightly dark unfortunately the album doesn't continue on this great songwriting streak that it sets up with these two tracks the grins the really terrible off-pitch background singing and rap verses on this track make the song nearly unbearable to me and what's even worse is the track cloud aura which features the rapper Brooke candy it's one of the few tracks on this album where the writing credits are just sort of written to Charlie and her feature spot on the song and it really sounds like it with an incredibly monotonous lead melody that seems to drone on and on and on until Brooke and Charlie just trade really annoying and underwhelming rap verses and moments on this album we're like I hear Brooke candy rapping about life in the trap and Charlie referring to getting sexy and addressed with a love interest as gangsta there are just some points when I want to ignore the lyrics just so I don't have a stronger negative reaction to this album we on some husband-and-wife but I don't care because I know I really like it they're really moments on this album where these rap verses give me a nervous tic that is so intense that I'm just begging for more parts with tacky auto-tune overall with true romance there are a few very good singles on this LP I will give it that but many other tracks on this thing feel too much like I'm listening to Rebecca Black go through her goth phase when I don't get that vibe unfortunately so many of the terrible rap verses and just trashy auto-tune get in the way of what really could be a good pop song there are moments where I really do feel like this album is lyrically shallow like when Charlie is moaning over and over and over how can I fix what I up not exactly poetry but there are some moments on this album where Charlie does come off authentic because of these sort of conversational words that she works into her verses I don't doubt that Charlie feels sincerely about some of the things that she sings raps and and says on this album but very rarely do melody production lyrics and structure actually come together into a great tune on this album really I'm feeling a strong 3 to a light for on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why 
7jZ7aMkv59U,whoa hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review of the new included album hokey fright the included is the collaborative musical artistic duo of singer-songwriter Kimya Dawson and MC / producer wordsmith man Aesop Rock Kimia is most known for her singing and songwriting on the Juno soundtrack in the Moldy Peaches and her numerous solo LPS and Aesop Rock over the years has had quite the successful solo career himself really a giant in underground hip hop is incredibly well known for his very dense dense verbose rap verses that are heavy with wordplay his flow is pretty fast as well he's really one of the most awe-inspiring lyricists in hip-hop today now Kimia and Issa are both fantastic artists and they're bright they're both people whose music I have admired over the years that I have known about them but they're two people who in my mind I would never really have a dream collaboration sort of brewing up here but maybe these two have more in common than it would actually seem to be just by looking at the genres that people typically throw them in for one they're obviously friends - over the years both of them have shown that they have incredibly potent dark sides although kima's does tend to get a little more personal three both of them in their songs can be incredibly playful when it comes to writing lyrics both of them are incredibly worthy and verbose what's not is this enough to forge some kind of significant artistic relationship they seem to think so this thing has sixteen tracks worth of artistic relationship on it and it's not like this thing is their first real collaboration either as I mentioned in a previous video Aesop Rock showed up on a number of tracks from Kimmie Dawson's last full-length LP thunder thighs and Kimmy did make a one track appearance on Aesop's new album skeleton like thunder thighs on this new LP there are moments where it seems like Kimia is playing her guitar and singing into a recorder making a somewhat lo-fi recording while Aesop spits over her guitars when she doesn't seem to be saying however that's not the only angle that the uncle'd it takes on this LP at times this loaf i recording is backed up with drum machines or it would seem that nearly everything that kemiya and Aesop pulled together on a track is drummed up in a professional studio through and through this album really seems to explore every possible way that this collaboration could have worked expanding a little further into kimiya style sometimes a little further an esop sometimes and as it could be assumed there are some parts on this LP that sort of crash and burn a little bit or where Kimia and Aesop really get maybe sort of too indulgent like on the song why do you hang up on me which is this weird beat collage with interruptions from either Kimia or s after saying why'd you hang up on me which is sort of funny though and I will leave it to you to decide whether or not thirty-eight seconds of Aesop and Kim naming different kinds of sandwiches is a fulfilling part of the album and there are some tracks on here that to me are sort of ruined by a bit of a technical issue tracks like delicate cycle or Scissorhands or earthquake were the vocals with Kimia singing and Aesop rapping right over her singing it sounds like a complete mess the vocals clash in a really ugly way as if they were mixed at the same volume and they're competing to be heard it's like you have to foreground vocals instead of a foreground vocal and a background vocal sometimes the vocals on these tracks don't even seem to sync up completely which makes it even more difficult to decipher them I see Aesop sort of conforming to Kimia style a little bit on these tracks but this could have been done better it just seems like a weird issue not to take head-on especially since not every single song on this album suffers from this problem like the song zombie cafe which sounds completely clean and and fine as well as the track the aquarium actually a lot of songs on this album go over well really well to the point where I think this is some of Kimia and Aesop's best stuff if there's one thing that makes this album aw inspiring at its best it's that Kimia and ASAP really love to go into songs with concepts and it seems that coming together only enhances that side of their artistic psyches like the song TV on 10 which essentially feels like Kim collaborating on an esop song where he throws out these riveting verses about this plane crash and losing someone in a plane crash and hearing about it on TV and hoping that the plane you're hearing about doesn't have the person you love on it the song has really murky moody beat and the more I listen to it just the more chilling it is in the song organs which sort of continues the morbid theme of this album feels like Aesop sort of rapping over a Kimia song and this track is like a hilarious PSA for donating your organs after you've passed on the song captures the philosophy of the sentiment perfectly it's really the best musical PSA of 2013 hands down Aesop's really wordy verses on this track are fantastic and I love the verse when kami comes through talking about animals passing different parts on to other animals they may thrive like when the whale gives its tail to the cat or the bird gives its wings to the bat it's ridiculous and the song bats which is the longest track on this entire LP Kimia and ASAP come together and mourn the death of Minnesota rapper idea they do it with some really really awesome just inspiring wordplay with Kimya talking about him saying he's the Minnesota Dalai Lama Kimmy and Aesop go on to sort of mourn his passing by watching bats fly and with the Lofa sounds the warm bass the guitars the choppy beat on this thing is fantastic meld of both of these artist styles and the song alligator is a really dark and strange look at sex lust and specifically pornography with a really heavy verse from Aesop talking about how when one gets into porn or is first exposed to porn there was sort of a changing point there there's a certain experience there that changes your mind makes you look at things completely differently I love how Aesop can really get down to cameos level and do something incredibly tender on a song like teleprompter and there are moments where they come together for tracks where it totally feels like they're goofing off on some abstract ideas like eyeball soup or the last track on this thing tits up which does get a little just overly long and kind of but Kimia does manage to rap all over this track in a pretty entertaining way overall in my opinion it's a pretty good LP if you can get past the clash of hip-hop and singer-songwriter the clash of these labels you will see that maybe they have more in common than we think and I actually feel that ASAP and Kimia expose sort of hidden potential for albums like this because an incredible amount of tracks on this LP are our earnest their intimate their personal they are hilarious thought-provoking and lyrically slash conceptually impressive I'm actually happy to see their personalities come together so well on this project I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana Kimya Dawson forever [Music] in Aesop Rock 
JgjDds00U3o,Boosh hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music a nerd making a quick video letting you know that in the description there is a link to a workout mix for this year 2013 workout mix last year did a workout mix came out pretty good not a rock punk and metal on there it's kind of going in the same direction with this new one but somehow it ended up with mostly electronic music and hip-hop pretty much just electronic music and hip-hop don't know how that happened maybe had to do with my workout mood I want to run more this year so electronic music to me seems like more conducive to running so hopefully you're in a running mood as well so there you go like I said down in the description working out 2013 mix give it a listen do some running get in shape for this year hmm that's it the needle drop working out forever 
zIIuA6__2RQ,baby boo-boo hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Phoenix LP bankrupt Phoenix is a French pop and rock outfit who has been around a lot longer than some people assume mostly due to their very recent spike in popularity with their fourth full-length album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix in 2009 an album that made the band a bit of an overnight sensation going gold in America Canada as well as Australia which is absolutely no surprise whatsoever considering how many sharp-ass singles are on this LP 1901 Armistice Lisztomania and lasso this album was filled with catchy sweet quirky memorable guitars really bouncy synthesizers some very agreeable vocals and overall just a really poppy sound I did like quite a few tracks on Wolfgang Amadeus Fenix but I've never really been a big Phoenix fan to be completely honest the band's sound to me has always reflected sort of a loss in personality within the genres of indie pop and indie rock over the years but it's not like there's any reason to hold negative feelings toward the band and it's not like the band came out with this fourth album changed their sound and sold out the band's music has always been really sort of sweet and hook heavy it's just like Phoenix had the right idea the whole time and had foresight and I commend them for doing that and also making music that they want to make still I have to kind of raise an eyebrow when it comes to people who were big fans of maybe the band's past few LPS and are giving a listen to this new LP and are a little disappointed with bankrupts lack of surprises I wonder when his Phoenix ever really been about surprises at all their discography they're a musical trajectory has been over the course of their career incredibly safe about as safe as taking a swim in a puddle with a snorkel and water wings as far as indie rock and pop go Phoenix's music has incredibly standard there's not an angle that you can look at it in which it does look standard you can't even call the band obnoxious or overly romantic in the way that you would Vampire Weekend or over loan in the way that you would say Arcade Fire is sometimes or even too sweet and saccharine in the way that man Kim or even Passion Pit can be the band's vocals consistently just don't really stick out to me with any sort of flair if anything they remind me of like of Montreal's Kevin Barnes if he had never had his heart broken or if he had never heard a David Bowie record all these issues aside Phoenix does bring a notable change on this new album and that change is an increase in synthesizers and electronics guitar still has a real presence on these tracks but these synthesizers they're really turned up to make the overall feel of this record thicker and bright a drum machine occasionally pops up on this album and there are a lot of grooves whether it be in the hook or the verses on these pop tunes that feel like they're ripped straight from old 80s new wave b-sides who we couldn't even find on Google if we could remember their names the band's approach on this LP is far from original these guys are not the first to rock grooves like this they won't be the last but still sharp songwriting does stick out like the song entertainment opening this LP up really driving groove on this LP and it starts out with this killer burning synth melody B nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee me me me the vocals come off pretty emotive on the verse with a nice down stroke guitar in there it's really good tune and the song trying to be cool the song has a sticky melody and this groove that feels like it's a bridge between funk disco and 80s new wave the song is so good I totally suggest it as this album's next single because it's definitely more entertaining than this albums other single chloroformed which has all these dinky drum machines that just don't do anything for the track are very redundant and almost pointless cyntha melody that copies exactly what the vocals do and this weak gutless piano phrase that feels like it's just a direct copy of the pianos from Elton John's Bennie in the Jets it's a really lackluster tune in my opinion and one of a good handful of moments on this album where the band is really mucking up their sound mucking up these tunes with just too many elements to the point where the songs just really lose their pop their snap they're instantaneousness in translation like the song SOS and bel-air which not only hits the listener with many pieces within a short span of time but all of these pieces are layered so heavily with numerous ideas flying around into this jumbled whirlwind there are some sweet melodies that are in this tune and others on here but they feel that they're canceled out by a hundred other ideas competing with them like on the song Drakkar Noir or the very drum machine driven tune don't or the track oblique City these Tunes are a little more clear than the track SOS and bel-air but still not many songs on this album come off as meticulously crafted as tunes on Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix as almost as if the band had the approach of just sort of throwing everything at the wall and just sort of seeing what sticks there are some other songs on here though that are interesting take me by surprise like the song bourgeois which is very 80s 80s esque slow jams very easygoing it's got a sweet melody sensual vocals on the track it's a killer and the title track surprisingly enough is is nearly a seven-minute synth Odyssey with a vocal part on the back end which is actually incredibly entertaining the band did a great job of crafting some sounds on this thing overall I have to say this album wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either it's really sort of middle of the road for me mostly because of how spotty it is there's some sharp songs on here backed up against some very jumbled songs as well a lot of tracks here pretty much for the whole album the band is rocking this just nearly dead deathbed 80 chic revivalism that they don't exactly make feel fresh and even though I did like some of the tunes on here I still can't help but feel that when I listen to a Phoenix tune there is something there whether it be the vocals the way the band plays are instruments there's just some sort of lack of character there to be completely honest I'm feeling a decent strong five on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Phoenix forever [Music] you you 
akI3DOvH2OA,little woman's mom hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new Little Women album long this is the sophomore full-length effort from New York jazz noise improvisational avant-garde music outfit little women and all these genres combined together with some very intricate math rock grooves made this band's debut LP in 2010 really dense difficult to make heads or tails of but still some real moments of beauty and some great plains shine through these very tough moments and made this album one of my favorite LPS in 2010 I was absolutely psyched to see the band returned with a new full-length a new piece if you will and instead of parsing it out into different tracks like they did on their last full-length they have presented listeners with 142 minute long track on this new album the recording on this new LP feels roughly the same as the last one more of an emphasis on technique and playing than trippy or distorted effects it feels very intimate freewheeling kind of in the moment really letting the rawness of the guitar the tenor and also saxophones and the drums speak for themselves this new LP just like the band's last full-length is a multi-faceted piece for sure but I guess the question is do the pieces on this new LP also come together into something that is thrilling moving exciting as well the LP throat was never the most avant-garde thing on the block it was never meant to be artists like John Zorn I feel like push weirdness much further to me the album throat was kind of a balance between composition and chaos and for sure lung also tries to find its own combination of those two characteristics as well this LP kicks things off with an intro that features very light drums sparse guitar serene harmonized saxophone phrasing it's seven minutes or so of just rock jazz bliss but then all of a sudden these stringy lanky weird mutated guitar chords come crashing down with drums and everything in terms of just goes right away the music all of a sudden becomes very and very cruel to the listener with just it's it's oddness then after this comes these long spans of chords and melodies intervals that it seems like the saxophones dance around in this very tribal primal way with how they move with one another and interact with one another it's almost as if they come closer together in terms of harmony and and drift apart as the band trips through these pieces meanwhile guitars and drums are just providing very light quiet backdrops and the only thing separating these different parts from one another are the occasional jazz freakout that lasts for a very short amount of time and just comes in and jars me for a few moments it's a sort of cruel joke that the van punches at the listener with these very loud moments like a merciless bully and then right afterwards the saxophones return to dancing around some musical phrases very quietly again but each time going for a sort of different musical vibe sometimes sounding very soft pretty calming others dissonant and then again fiery this goes on until about the halfway point of the album where the band really introduces the mother of all freak-outs on this entire LP which is one of the most jaw-dropping ly intense moments on this album to jar the listener feels like it might have been the intention and to go back to this album and listen to it again and again these jarring moments become so much less surprising or moving because it's kind of like you know you know when the Sharps got to jump out of the water though the quiet parts may feel very pretty it's not like they build or evolve in anything that that really sort of touches me an emotional way the stringy jagged guitars that occur earlier in the album end up showing up later as well bringing somewhat of a theme to this album some consistency I'm hearing pieces again there is kind of a circular quality to this composition the band is pulled together and maybe people will gravitate toward that more than some of the stuff that the band put on their full-length debut which can kind of feel like this disjointed linear musical experience even though I like that the band trying to build this piece of the more consistent structure I'm not really all that enamored with the pieces that this structure is built out of it seems like many of these louder more abrasive moments that come on very suddenly all function on the same techniques and ideas coming from each player really the only interesting moment that came out of these abrasive spots on the album was the final Ascension of the album which really really hits a high mark in terms of just volume and intensity ear piercing howls coming from the Sachs's stuttering guitars and very busy drums all over the place it's like this album is trying to oppositely mirror the very friendly beginning that this LP started off with honestly this sophomore full-length didn't really take me on the emotional ride that the debut did while I'm still into the production I think the playing is pretty solid and that the way the band likes to create just a very intimate recording around their stuff I just think they put a little bit too much of an emphasis on putting parts in this album that would grab the listener and shake them violently and then just sort of put them back down in their place and you know pet them a little bit and then grab the gun meanwhile in the midst of these moments where they're not being shaken things are just you know feeling alright very few spots on this album filled me with wonder especially from a melodic perspective I for the most part really just stayed intrigued and that's about it I'm kind of feeling a light too decent six on this thing if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah Anthony Fantana little women forever 
vwsM7UihYoY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new altar of plagues LPT 'the glory and injury altar of plagues is an Ireland based atmospheric black metal outfit who began around the mid 2000s and if you listen to this bands music their two previous LPS or some of their early EPS you can catch influences from not only black metal but shoegaze as well as post rock and they hammer a lot of these tracks out with typical black metal sounds and instrumentation tremolo guitars harsh distortion blasts beat drumming retched vocals and the winding passages very long song lengths in their albums hint toward a lot of ambition especially on their last full length album mammal which did have some really epic and beautiful moments on it but rarely from beginning to end with an altar of plagues album did I feel like the writing was eventful enough or unique enough to justify the very long lengths that this band stretches their tunes out to certainly the band would add details like some chanting or some female vocals their writing and the variety across their albums is is definitely a bit meteor when compared to a band like ash borer but I was really caught off-guard when I was hearing some tracks initially coming out from this album tracks like god alone a track that is incredibly straightforward very riff oriented amazing vocals on the track that are just chilling I'm positive after listening to this album a lot of people are still going to file this record under the atmospheric black metal genre label but the band's compositions on this new LP are much less drawn out the longest track on this LP is 8 minutes with many of the other songs on here landing in about the four-minute range and this time around the production is much less cavernous as well with the drums the vocals and the riffs being right up front and much more substantial on this record they really have brought fire urgency and detail that I feel the band's other stuff might have been kind of lacking for sure teeth glory is a step a big step toward the engaging angular jagged riffs strings faint electronics really strange synthesizers intense vocals shouts howls and dissonant strange guitars that feel like they have more in common with noise rock than they do black metal these are just a handful of the elements that the band uses to really sort of tear out everything that you once knew about altar of plagues and really remodel their sound and style from top to bottom because they've really turned it into something that is not only sort of unpredictable and challenging on this record but very brutish very rarely does the band throw a sort of expansive black metal scape out there that you can sort of get lost in or really admire the haze and kind of you know sit back no this is much more fierce and groove oriented and the grooves and occasionally melodies on this LP are grooves and melodies that are usually rocked in black metal music like the song 12 was ruined where the beat as well as the guitars have a really strong middle-eastern flair to them it's almost something I would see like the band Grails playing on one of their albums the song god alone is a track that is played in three four with a huge emphasis with dissonant guitars on the one and two beat and the song Bert year almost has this one two one two strange dance music like feel to it with this looped polyrhythm it feels like some kind of noise or percussion loop going on in the background just adding another element to the rhythm and to make the track even more of a standout this song may just have the most intense and just huh fear inducing vocals on this entire record I mean they really sound freakish and that's another thing I really admire about this album before I go on about any other tracks the vocals do have some real personality occasionally they toy a bit with those typical black metal matches but some of the lyrics are very audible on this LP and everything from the more guttural growls to the ear piercing shrieks make many of the songs on here just stick in the back of my head furthermore with the song burnt year the song progresses into some black metal drum blasts that are backed up with shots of noise eventually the song melts into these droning somewhat ambient tones surprise surprise surprise and then the band finishes things off with a really epic and somewhat noisy ascent it's a thrill ride and it's an incredibly grim thrill ride it's like a funeral march through a river of blood that is pouring into some kind of gargantuan demon's mouth quenching his blood thirst anyway this thing is loaded with riffs and grooves of different shapes and sizes really adding variety across the nine tracks on this album and what medium these grooves sort of come in whether it be guitar or drums or some kind of electronic loop which is the band surprise of choice right in the middle of the very vast and slow track a remedy and a fear and this surprise loop eventually guides the song into some really heavy heavy guitars and mind you that these heavy guitar passages sit in between a very quiet moment with chilled out harmonious chorus vocals that that almost sound cultish and how they're delivering their there stone-faced singing and after all this comes distorted dissonant over modulated guitars and electronics that just overwhelm the senses altar of plagues is taking some serious risks stepping outside of their black metal comfort zone and writing some really exciting songs in the process the song quickly segues into the next track with a quick drone and that's another thing I like about this LP so many of the tracks segue into one another whether it be very logically with the same tone or the ending of one song really going to the beginning or maybe just sort of a quick rush to sort of overlap the two elements of the album and this really makes teeth glory very holistic listening experience for sure that was also the case with altar of plagues other releases but as I've already said I'm a little crazier for the material at their writing this album especially since one four-minute track on this album may contain a handful of different ideas that are pieced together in a really interesting way for the most part the production the recording on this thing is pretty straightforward it kind of gets the job done which isn't necessarily a bad thing because it just presents the instrumentation and the band's great playing and fantastic writing and surprise song structures on this thing make that a delight but there are some weird recording and mixing choices on this album for sure the loops and some of the electronics the band chooses to use on many of these tracks don't exactly meld with the instrumentation in a very natural way from time to time songs may make a huge jump in volume from one moment to another there may be a riff that jumps out feeling as if it is 2 times louder than anything else in the mix on a certain track considering the unorthodox past that black metal has had in terms of recording and mixing I actually thought a lot of these strange quirks brought the album more character rather than kind of ruin my experience with it despite the saturation of ideas and sounds that are thrown at the listener the flow and the evolution of this album is really sort of clear and impressive the album is just like a mess of different ideas but they're stitched together into this evil quilt of evil and it just feels like there are a lot of stylistic inspirational points for this album everything from metal to maybe a little bit of noise music post-rock experimental rock electronic music a little bit of industrial music - it's amazing that all these influences come together in a way where it's very obvious where it's all coming from and yet it's so uniform in its mood and its sound the album is so tortured it's so head splitting it is so pained the only variation from this mood is really the last track of the album which features a pretty heavy post-rock like ascension that brings things in a pretty triumphant territory I'm really impressed with this LP I thought it was great one of the better metal experiences I've had this year if you've given to listen what did you think of it I'm pretty much feeling as strongly to a light 9 on this thing what should I review next and yeah that's it altar of plagues teefed glory and injury forever [Music] 
pLGKl1e5_WM,chance the rapper acid rap hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for you review the new chance the rapper mixtape acid rap chance the rapper is a Chicago rapper and singer and this is his follow-up project to the 10-day mixtape that dropped last year which you could definitely say is kind of overlooked considering just how much speed hype popularity that chance is gaining off this new project and if you compare acid rap to 10-day you can definitely see an uptick in quality or at least memorability because there are less moments on 10-day that seem to feature that very quirky nutty over-the-top personality that people seem to be celebrating on this new project plus the production on this new project is flashy er the recording quality is better too now as far as the personality that chance brings on this mixtape it seems to be much of what his focus lies in chance is personality his voice that he delivers his raps and his singing with is done in this sort of high mid pitch register and there's a sharp rasp in a lot of his vocals too and he comes off incredibly energetic for somebody whose head seems to be very riddled with drugs acid xanax weed and alcohol seem to be major players and a lot of chances lyrics with Molly and wax as well as many other things kind of hopping into play cameo roles in fact the song push a man kind of paints this drug-dealer image of him in the hook of the song anyway with very smooth jazzy production and the song is peppered with his nananana yeah ad-lib that he likes to throw around everywhere when rapping chance paces his words out in this Rastafari style flow and the hook on this track is sort of backed up with some chopped and screwed vocals it's a killer hook there's actually a bit of space as soon as this first portion of the song finishes and then it leads into a sec portion and I mean it's a big gap of literally silence which according to Twitter chants says that if you're on acid while listening to this project don't skip it because it takes away all the feeling but while listening to this I was pretty sober so I'm not sure if I should skip it or sit through it either way the track breaks into this very Spacey lush synth heavy beat that feels very nocturnal and has a huge good kid maad city kind of vibe to it and when chance finally pops into the track his flow gives off the same feel and on this latter portion of the track which is very quiet very subtle chance paints himself as this guy with a blunt on his lips he's got his 9 on his hip and it's got the shit's at this point the song chance comes off very druggie very violent but then he sort of turns around and wonders why the media doesn't really cover the extreme gang violence that goes on in Chicago it feels like to me that chance has a love-hate relationship with where he comes from and violence as well while he sees Chicago as a place that has personality and has built him as a person he hates the violence that goes on there and while he does seem to fear it in a very serious and real way he does use it occasionally to sort of further his persona maybe just sort of throwing some tough talk out there in order to counteract some of the more vulnerable and personal moments that are spread throughout this tape musically he even celebrates Chicago a little bit with some Juke influence on the beats from the opening track and the closing track on here too which I loved still on this track and maybe a few other moments on this tape chance is taking some really important social issues in his lyrics setting them up against a great instrumental but the urgency of these issues to me doesn't really come through all the time chance may have some strong personal feelings about some of the stuff he brings up but he doesn't come off to me as like a serious voice on some of these topics usually when he tries to take on a tangle the difficult issue like drug addiction or violence or one's relation with God it comes off very surface and just barely scratched I feel like I'm just left with some messages and some images sometimes that thickly glazed over with a layer of inebriation there are moments on acid rap though where chances very personal relationship with drugs does seem to help them out and lead to some real song inspiration like on the track cocoa butter kisses not only is the instrumental killer on this thing really smooth great organs on this track fantastic melody very memorable really tasteful hook soulful singing coming from chance and I love the sentiment of this track basically talking about how when you smoke a lot whether it be cigarettes whether it be pot you have your life especially your relationships with people who aren't in on that part of your life kind of change because the smell is there people who you have a relationship might have strong feelings against you smoking it's a part of smoking that is is really real but it's an element of this life that isn't really explored through song all too often because there's nothing glorious about it it's kind of awkward and chance does a great job of capturing this awkwardness on a track with a guest verse from Twista that is absolutely awesome as acid rap continues chance comes through and exposes his more tender side which I'm sure a lot of you saw coming he delivers a pretty interesting love song with the track lost which makes the idea of dropping acid with someone sound really romantic the track has a beautiful piano led production awesome jazzy flute and guitar on this thing lyrically chants delves a little bit into the specifics of the relationship that he has with this girl and though the track does have a really sweet sentiment to it there is a bit of speculation left in the verse drop by no-name gypsy which is a great verse where we are left off with the line where she says the only time he really loves her is naked in her dream sort of illustrating some kind of disconnect between the two of them when maybe they're not high the album gets even better on the next two tracks with the track everybody something which is a really fantastic sentiment on this album just talking about everybody is somebody's everything that's essentially the message of the song it's talking about relationships whether they be family or romantic and though chances Ryan's come off angry sometimes on this track he goes on to say that he is who he is because someone loved to help him beat his demons and basically get him through harder times there's a funny spot toward the end of the track where he goes on and on about how he talks white or just sort of has this white inflection to the way that he converses in everyday life and sort of an underlying subtlety to this point in the track is that he uses a flow that feels completely ripped from Eminem's Slim Shady LP Chan's had some great wordplay toward the back end of this track and the way he sings on the song is just another reminder that he has a very strange voice but can definitely sing I love the song that's love I feel like it's a great middle point on this album another passion is spot on here but for me the LP really loses steam after this moment acid rap continues with three pretty major features from childish gambino action bronson and absol on the next three tracks but i really feel like these songs are some of the most lackluster on the album and it really has nothing to do with the features whatsoever i feel like on these particular tracks the production is the weakest a lot of chances hooks on these songs are the most forgettable and half-assed and I don't really feel like there's a strong message or sentiment to any of the tracks either they just feel like really breezy moments the track favorite song is really poppy it has a sweet instrumental but the moment were chance flies in with thee that's my jam that's my damn but that's gonna that's gonna do it just feels like he's not even trying the song Yan yak comes through with that Rastafari flow again I like the heavy bass line on this track and action bronson delivers a fantastically just over-the-top and funny verse on this song but chance essentially makes a hook out of his somewhat obnoxious ad-lib that I feel like keep peppers way too hard on the album anyway and smoke again maybe this track is my least favorite of the three the beat to me doesn't really feel like anything but a trap beat with the hi-hat stripped out of it chances lyrics don't really hit me in in any way whatsoever no surprises nothing really all that interesting and absol on this track may have dropped one of his most lackluster guest verses that I've ever Hurd especially with the line where he says no doubt like Gwen Stefani's group let me put my mouth where you potty boo after these moments the album returns back to that production that feels very refined its melodic it's chill it's sweet on the ears but on the track acid rain though chance is getting really nostalgic in his lyrics it just feels like there are too many moments on this track where he's grasping for something to struggle over personally and the closer was really the best thing the end of this album had to offer overall I didn't really dislike this mixtape I thought I was really likable and I liked the personality that chance brought to the table and a lot of the hooks on the first half of this LP for sure there is reason to celebrate chances growing popularity because he is certainly different than your average ignorant Trapp rapper but with a lot of the things that he says in his lyrics I don't really feel like he's a breath of fresh air or anything like that because lyrically he doesn't really come off as enlightened or as progressive as one would assume just by listening to his out-there persona I guess there are just a lot of moments where he lets hooks beats and his ad-libs carry his songs from beginning to end there are these spots on this album where he feels like nothing more than a goofy acid dropping cartoon character who is way too jittery and unfocused to drop some lines that would really sort of widen some eyes and surprise some people when it comes to some of the serious topics that he attempts to tackle on some of these tracks overall I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this tape if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana chance the rapper forever you you 
Fwpukj7EszU,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd with a question comment thing asking you about experimental music versus accessible music mainstream versus underground music simple versus complex music listen it's going to be really hard for me to completely explain this in very simple terms but I think once you hear me out you will totally get exactly what I'm trying to portray here or highlight so okay you guys know there are various kinds of music out there that are just not as popular as some other kinds of music and I don't mean just genre I mean there are artists within certain genres that are not as popular as artists who are in that same genre like let's take various artists in the abstract hip-hop camp not really getting as much shine or as much popularity as artists who are in the pop rap camp and let's say for your entire life you're a really huge pop rap listener and then you get into this different underground version of hip-hop music and for whatever reason you find it really really appealing maybe you think the lyricism has more wordplay to it maybe you think that the beats are more intricate or have a different character to them or something like that or maybe you're really really really into pop rock and then all of a sudden one day you really really in do progressive rock there are tons of examples like this that I could throw out there that maybe some of you can relate to I guess on my point is is once you really click with this style of music that may be experimental maybe it's really progressive maybe there's some technical ability there maybe the playing is really flashy or something maybe the lyrics are really amazing maybe the melodies are very unique maybe there's some kind of strange eccentricity there that really attracts you to some of the artists in the genre maybe there are some weird psychedelic effects that really make you attracted to whatever artists are in the genre that we're talking about once this thing clicks with you does then make it difficult to go back and listen to music that you think is more accessible music that's more poppy because now you're not working with this extra edge let's say you're really into death metal and you listen to some of the bands that you perceive to be the most freaking brutal does it make it difficult to go back and maybe listen to I don't know some Nickelback or something appreciate a little bit of creed I personally would not call myself anti pop or some kind of snob when it comes to music that is poppier there's certainly our artists that I do like that play pop music and and certainly a lot of the bands that I review on this channel do function off of a verse chorus verse format but still there are times when I listen to particular artists and I just feel like there's something missing there's not that edge there there's not that characteristic there there's a lack of experimentation or or adventure that I find to be so exciting and thrilling and then moving as well when I come upon an artist's like let's say Shabazz Palaces or Janelle Monae while it may feel like this question is coming completely out of the blue I don't think I am unfounded in wandering these things because certainly in the comments I have seen hatred or animosity against mainstream music against pop music and I know a lot of the people who watch my show or fans of various kinds of underground music and I'm wondering if there is something about the music that you do listen to that makes it difficult for you to enjoy little Wayne or Lady gaga or Taylor Swift or McLemore or Katy Perry or Wiz Khalifa maybe this is just the process of people forming their own tastes and their own opinions or their own perceptions of what is good versus what is bad versus what is really real when it comes to this particular characteristic you look for in music like let's say you're really into singer songwriters especially ones that have you know kind of a sad tone to their tunes and you first come upon Elias Smith and his material you find incredibly depressive and you're like wow this guy is freaking this guy's the deal while I do see some animosity with people who like underground music toward mainstream music surely there must be someone out there thinks the mountain goats and Taylor Swift are both enjoyable because there's a whole range of different tastes out there maybe there's someone out there who's really huge into swans but also pretty big on one direction because while I do see this trend I also have to kind of acknowledge that there are exceptions to the rule and there are people who have all sorts of weird combinations of tastes just let me know I'm curious do you think that listening to experimental music underground music different music makes it more difficult to listen to music that you perceive to be more common maybe a little less specific appealing to sentiments that are a little more plentiful or working with some musical ideas that are a bit more tried and true what do you think I want to know Anthony Fantana questions forever [Music]

fMWT7_SsowU,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new RA the rugged man album legends never die Ari the rugged man is a New York rapper and this new LP of his is essentially the guy's celebrated return his last full-length LP die rugged man died came out about ten years ago at this point but the dude's very long career but short discography can be explained pretty easily just by listening to his mouth sure a lot of the lyrics the RA throws out there are pretty nasty are pretty vile but he also doesn't seem to hesitate when it comes to pointing out  that he sees in the music industry that I'm sure has gotten him in more hot water than just some foul language as far as the music industry and the rap game goes he doesn't really strike me as the kind of guy that likes to play ball either and he's really kind of bitter ever so slightly about how he's gotten shafted in the music industry and I can certainly understand why in a recent interview with uncut Ari revealed that early on in his career as he was gaining buzz behind his music and jive and Def Jam were basically scheming on how to market him he was eventually faced with their plan that they would hide his white identity despite getting the short end of the stick from his record labels RA with is very real and rebel and sort of no BS persona earned a lot of connections musically with a lot of different artists including wu-tang as well as mob deep the notorious b.i.g which is an endorsement he brags about pretty heftily as well as Jedi Mind Tricks and re still very much breathes this era of hip-hop he's kind of a traditionalist and still today on this new record of his he's not really interested in making nice nice industry friends and connections he's the kind of guy that if you're going to like him it's going to be on his terms in the first minute of music or so that this album kicks off with on the intro track RA lashes out at hipster skinny jean wearing emo rappers industry and mainstream puppets or just in general people who aren't ready to hear real hip-hop which is about Rhymes and writing them down in notebooks even takes a swing it internet nerds personally I think it's pretty silly that Ari would take a swing of people who could become potential fans still it's not like his disclaimer has no accuracy whatsoever his music really is for people who want to hear fast impressive flows that want to hear lyrics and dissect bars he's not the most emotive or over-the-top rapper you're ever going to hear his voice for the most part on his tracks is pretty flat and monotone with his low heavy ass voice the lead single off of this LP the People's Champ breaks through with a huge freaking beat it is the anthem of the album and it is loud it is proud the beat on this thing is bombastic it's a little cheesy but the dude has some pretty funny lines comparing his flow to the Sistine Chapel and this one line about having identity issues and self-hatred and calls himself a pissed-off Wigga who just stepped off the slave ship the dude is nasty offensive politically incorrect in more ways than one and he couldn't be farther away from being apologetic about it the next track on here a track that I also liked which also has a sort of cheesy B and a really cheesy cheesy hook so goo B now I'm still won over by how charismatic this dude is the song is peppered with some references to older hip-hop music that influenced Ari the rugged man but mostly the track is a look at his kind of weird personality painting himself as this dirty guy who's got stinky breath he's grimy as hell and there's even this line in here where he calls himself a white guy who's ruining what black people invented there are a lot of spots on this LP where Ari comes off as a self-hating asshole who I'm sure many of you will love to hate as well but there are spots on this thing where man is this guy earnest and heartfelt the song legends never die the I'll track on this thing is a look at his relationship with his father another track on here where I'm not really 100% on the beat it's this heavy-handed rhythm with a little bit of acoustic guitar sampled in the back just feels too much like it's grabbing for sadness but arias performance on this beat to me makes it completely irrelevant the song opens up with just our a being with his father in his final moments in the hospital his dad fighting cancer but it's not really a depressing track because it evolves into just him reflecting on the amazing relationship that he had with his father how he reflects upon his dad is just so beautiful and so sentimental it seriously makes me feel like I wish I could mean half as much to someone one day and then he paints his dad as this guy who was loving who was kind but also sort of crazy a trickster a music fan a Vietnam vet and someone who was really proud of his son for for doing what he wanted to do and sort of chasing his musical dreams and at the end of the track where literally Ari gets choked up saying the final words of his last verse it's really intense moment there are some other highlights on this LP like the dangerous three which features brother Olly as well as master ace it's one of the few tracks where I really love the instrumental on the track there's a really epic beat changeup in the middle of each verse that each MC on this track handles very nicely verse for verse RS collaboration with Hobson doesn't go over too bad and hearing him Vinnie Paz and Sadat X a rapper who are a cut one of his earliest earliest singles with like back in the 90s was like a blast from the past there are spots on this album where RA is very just abrasive personality doesn't completely vibe with me either I feel it's just too corny or he's just trying too hard to say something silly or offensive or just insensitive just to kind of but there are other spots on here where he comes off as foul-mouthed but self-aware like on the song shot in the head where he's going on and on and on about how much of a disgusting person he is so much so that he's making liberals want to give him the death penalty conservatives are wishing he was aborted and right in the middle of the song this weird voice comes in and says hey why don't you rap about something positive like politics or like the environment or something I'm not even going to spoil the verse for you but the song gets even more hilarious from there the only thing about the track that I think is is really absolutely crappy but I guess it really sort of goes with the theme of the song is the surprise opera vocal that covers the hook on this track yes an opera vocal which shows up more than once on this album and in this particular instance it's singing ah I'm a piece of  I'm a butt o re spits a very apolitical verse on this track but he goes further to make a song like media midgets for example where to me it really kind of feels like he's trying too hard to be like the TV the radio mm and I do agree generally with the sentiment of the song it's just that here and maybe a few other moments on this album I feel like he's just trying too hard to school me learn me something and another track on here bang boogie while it is a good track it really only feels like half of a complete song and I know I've already said that there are some beats on this album that I don't really care for but I could seriously rail against some of the instrumentals on this album corny classical music samples all over them that take the most obvious and endlessly sampled pieces of music from these great compositions songs like Tom Thumb laugh clown laugh as well as underground hits and the song hallelujah feels like some tech9 and Chris calico afterbirth seriously the hook and the beat on this track is so gaudy even ICP would like think twice about using it it's got to be the worst course on the entire album second worst silver medal goes to the song love to which has a sung R and B hook on it about putting it up that but it does kind of make me giggle though overall re the rugged man can be a kind of dicey dude there are moments when I'm completely repulsed by him and other spots on here like the closing track life is precious if you give this track a listen one of the most moving hip-hop songs you'll hear all year ari is an acquired taste I do think there are a lot of likable qualities about him and I would like to say that this comeback of his is maybe just the start of a new beginning and something greater to come in the future but I have a sneaking suspicion that he's the kind of artist who is sort of stuck in his ways and just wants to do what he wants to do without worrying about evolving or doing something new or sort of doing something revolutionary he's just going to kind of do what's comfortable for him and that's completely fine if it pleases his fans I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it thanks for watching Anthony Fantan o RA the rugged man forever [Music] you 
PFWqbDKJhW8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd here doing an interview with a conversation with california hip-hop outfit clipping hey guys how you doing good the are you tired what's going on you know all right um let's get started questions so many on the top of my mind and i also just want to thank you for just putting out mid-city earlier this year if you guys haven't caught that album I reviewed it a few months ago and I'm still listening to her recently and it's still like just burning itself into the back of my head and will forever to sort of like hopefully stay there is just like it's really just out there hip-hop release and um while it did really impress me when I first heard it the more I started looking into you guys musically I just started seeing like so many differences between your solo projects and I mean it just it has to be asked like how did you guys come together and just sort of reconcile your different styles and kind of bring them together into this one project yeah I don't know I mean I think this was we've known each other for a very long time you know and been friends for a long time so this was sort of at least on my end I've been wanting to find a project to work on with these guys for a while I think clipping happens to be the thing that we're all of us can do the part of what we do really well and and just that like you know it's rare for me to be involved in a project where really all I have to focus on is like writing raps that match with a concept that we agree on you know I don't have to worry about like picking my own beats we're doing that by committee the beats are being built so for me like to just get to focus on rapping is great you know but still it could have between your your various is sort of projects and how much diversity there is in all of them this could have gone a lot of different ways like William and Jonathan didn't necessarily need to put together beats that combine hip-hop grooves with harsh noise because you guys have worked in projects that don't incorporate harsh noise so I mean you know what what exactly made it turn into that direction um well let's see so I actually do mostly work in noise I mean Jonathan and I have done some films but I mean there are tracks of yours that I felt were more ambient would you say there that are noise um well that's suddenly like this the scene the community I come from like ego and I was doing like more ambient stuff like I still consider myself a noise artist like okay people I play with those are the people that's the the labels I get to put stuff out on those are the people I play shows with and hang out with so yeah I mean there's diversity within that yeah we definitely I've done a lot of ambient stuff um but I still think of it is coming from this sort of like gutter noise place um but uh yeah I mean you know we've we've I mean literally dahveed and I have known each other each other since third grade and Jonathan and I lived together starting like 12 years ago now um and well what for like five years yeah about seven years ago yeah um during college so you know and we all do a whole bunch of things like I think the other thing about all of our projects is that they're each very much like a project none of them are just like oh man this is who I am and what I do they're all like very bounded within like oh this is the project name these are the rules of what we're allowed to do in that and so we make that but I think it's not it's certainly not limited that's not like all we can do so we I would now listen to a ton of other stuff and talk about other stuff we listen to we've all listened to each other's music for you know mm-hmm I mean the outside of listening to each other's music I mean do your tastes overlap more than probably most people who just sort of stumble upon clipping assume you know at first listen uh maybe so yes so so I mean yeah certain you know me and Bill have been going to record stores together every Tuesday since we were kids you know so that like I I think we influence each other's tastes a lot so that makes sense but Jonathan I mean I tell every every time job does like this thing's really good and should gives me something to listen to and I listen to it and it's really good like I you know we do I think I taste do like yeah and I feel like we we were going to record stores over Tuesday College like yeah I gather I'm not it's not to like I I don't know I mean it's our record collections all look fairly similar in a lot of different areas and we each got our own like genres that we focus on outside of that that you know like where they were the authority on that in the group but like if you look at like a core of like there's a huge like the Venn diagram of our CD collections like there's a fake junk in the middle that we all share and some of that is like stuff you wouldn't even think that a band that sounds like clipping would be into you know I don't know an example but like you know not not necessarily something that you would expect clipping elec okay so I mean you guys are essentially like cooking this clapton plan and you all like each have your element rings of life is certain farm together and then it's clipping passion well we have have something considering we don't like you know it's not like I'm the guitar player and he's the drummer you know like we gotta have our mission impossible like we each have a function you know otherwise what are we all doing here okay so you're talking about not just like sort of pigeonholing yourselves and just sort of painting yourself simply as artists but expressing yourselves more through projects and kind of you know setting boundaries and setting ideas for like different outings that you go on what were some of the boundaries and just some of the basic ideas that you were going into mid-city and what could be ideas that sort of come out into the future versus some of the ideas that maybe you were just sort of dealing with on that EP that I though several tracks that you dropped before midsi even existed well we've made all those tracks really at the same time and actually I mean but about half of mid-city we made are some of the mid-city contains some of the first and some of the most recent tracks we made in it and the tape is kind of thrown middle layer um I mean initially I mean I can remember I can remember I used to DJ a lot more than I do now but I can remember even like 10 years ago you know 10 years ago but but around that around that long ago like throwing on the Gummer's about record and throwing like a you know like a David Banner acapella over the top of it and saying this is amazing this needs to happen these two were synchronized a little better this would be the best thing in the world and annum bill was in a band called beach balls for a while he's a little ashamed of but I think is really one of the best days was building and Kyle Maps in la la staple at this point others like in 12 bands at once kind of people up but but there was a track on one of the beach balls releases I'm sure you can't find it was just the beginning twins whisper some acapella over this incredibly sort of brutally high-pitched minimal kind of clicking beat that bill made it basically sounds like clipping like it sounds like clipping and I heard that track and I said this and it and this was in years past after this track came out and beach ball stuff doing things and I said this needs to be just a band like a band needs to do this stuff like this needs to be a project so he and I started doing remixes that are I think all on our soundcloud of just like existing acapellas um and and our rules were no beef no drum sounds no pitch you know field recording noise I mean pit everything is pitched right but but no no tuning systems right and no harmonies and so those were kind of our initial rules they would that be moved down it just seemed natural to get him on these tracks and then is the second we started performing these tracks live with him we realized we never needed to do another remix again that this should be just a live project but yeah we had we clearly break that rule all the time the no drama no joke no no tuning systems rule obviously write that in almost every song but that's that's the starting point almost dollars mm-hmm you know or or like here's an experimental music technique or concept or an existing piece that represents like a process how is that how would you use that process Mikula right and it is sort of about translating processes or techniques so usually if they're working on something um in here like I'll be sitting here and eventually it'll come to us oh this sounds like this kind of record that's sort of rap specific that's like that has definite like genre indicators about it and and that's sort of what I I tend to base and that's my jumping-off place usually from a lyrical standpoint or at least from a rhythmic standpoint it at least informs the cadences that I choose on that sound mm-hmm well I mean obviously with Davi there and working on songs with him you can actually paint a unique or just sort of a custom narrative to the songs that you guys are putting together but going back sort of a remixes that you were doing or just with dahveed putting out tracks like about that where you have a lot of motifs in them that may come from like club rap or like gangsta rap what does putting these kinds of lyrics together with such a noisy beats do I mean do they satirize these kinds of messages they glorify them do they just make them grittier just put them in a different perspective and just nothing more than that I think part of the the goal is certainly to UM to try and just draw a connection between two uh rap where we see maybe similar I mean two different types of music where we see maybe similar attitudes or certain sort of aesthetics that we think are compatible but you don't you just don't hear together we certainly and and another thing we talk about is that like satire is not really the point we're definitely not like any rep any rapper that's doing anything different is assumed to be as a result critiquing rap right I mean you got this whole like ever since stakes is high anyone who does a weird rap song must hate mainstream rap or must be just like you know it becomes this whole like hater rap like anyone doing backpack stuff anyone doing it you know ant icon type stuff is like by virtue of the fact that they're doing something different means they must hate this and to like this is to dis is to disassociate yourself from that and the thing is is we like mainstream rap I mean we want to not we're trying to convince not trying to convince anyone we're fixing it we're just trying to like make space for other stuff that doesn't exclude it's not about like this is bad and this is good this is about this is also available if we can also do this we're finding our own way of contributing that's that's that's it's honest to who we are without trends or adopt personas or pretend we're anything other than we are I am in a way that's participating not you know rising above er I we just want to be part of this music that we love in the way that we feel like we can contribute as Creative Arts we all like really are into sort of club aesthetic since a grittier sort of darker rap songs and gangsta rhyming we generally love gangsta rap albums you know so um and they don't get made that much anymore so you know when we have an opportunity to approach those themes from a way that feels okay for us to do like we're going to do that yeah because I mean if while there are moments where I hear these genres of rap in your music but it turns out darker or is kind of like a dark humor side to it like on the track particularly where you know you're talking about being in the club and you know you ask who's got kids at home you know which i think is absolutely hilarious is that a year show someone raised their hand I was yeah yeah but yeah she was great but obviously there is some sort of fandom there in order for you guys to get all of these just all these ticks and all these idiosyncrasies so accurately and put them in the song to the extent that you can make the beat so harsh in noisy and experimental but what you're doing cannot be denied as hip-hop because it sounds so indebted to it and yeah that's it thank you yeah okay well I mean but that's just like you guys have just kind of shown so far the interview and recently um on a little piece you guys did with silk screens really kind of going into sort of via the inner workings of the song about that and really pulling the track apart and talking about the process of it and the mentality of it and the various sounds that build it up for a project that I guess sonically is so experimental and so alienating you guys seem so just kind of earnest and matter of fact when it comes to sort of talking about it like it's just this you know it's just like what we're doing you know it doesn't seem to be like this dark looming thing it doesn't seem like you guys take yourselves too seriously or something that on a lot of tracks here feels so stone-faced right yeah there's nothing metaphysical or magical about music at all to me I mean like like you know we are coming coming from a musician right well this person anodized as people we're not very mysterious it turns out I mean maybe like I guess if people have said this a number of times talking to us it shows and stuff or our meeting us it's like they thought we'd be monsters based on what that stuff's out and we're I don't know I guess we're really not you know why well I mean from from I I do feel like this is going somewhere from the position of someone who's trying to make something they're proud of and get it out there um and end people who know other musicians as well who are in various projects you know do you feel that sort of being sort of open and honest about what you're doing is the better thing to do or you know sort of the more marketable thing to do or do you see people actually getting by by me more anonymous you know and just like being a bleed Dix I think we are nerds and like that like the thing on silk screens where we break down the track we just did that because that's what any one of us would have wanted to read from one of our favorite artists right love for Mannie Fresh to do that person I would love for The Neptunes to do that for a song I would love for a young chop to do that with a song right now like the people were super into like I would just love to see that kind of stuff I mean we're dorks and we make music and I'd love to see someone break that down like we're not we're clearly not clever enough to like think about how to market like the three of us talking like no decisions are being made based on its mark their marketability like me like simply it's certainly not in our like yeah our presentation of self in media outside the music itself I mean the project itself is to I mean we made the first couple of tracks and I said this is instantly the most random and least accessible thing like that I've ever been involved in it's like it's the clearest what the intention is in what it's it's so clear to me and it's so specific and it just does its intention and moves on and that's it but it's also if none of us thought that anybody would give a you know like we thought that this was weird and inaccessible and um you know weird innit like well anybody before the record came out none of our friends even liked it everyone was kind of like and like all of our roommates were all like as alright when are they gonna get over this and go back to making stuff could you like it out we had so many times of like people being o-rings do like just friends mean like this is the thing I'm working on a play it's just like these weird like ice like reactions people don't know what to do with it any um any reactions from a dahveed and sort of showing the the project around I know my like sort of closest associates like the people the other people who I make music with really have always liked it you know um but I think and you know and the more sort of like hip hop heads that I play it for who are also artists those the thing are always like yo this is really this is good I've never heard anything like this before this is good but the same thing was like I don't know who this is for but it's really good you're like I wouldn't play this for my friends but it's really cool that you're doing it's evident Facebook recently Facebook friend of mine announced it's like oh I'm going to the shows band clipping um and and and I noticed I there was like a threat of like 20 to 30 comments mostly by the same one person who clearly was listening to the album as he wrote all of these comments and then what is this crap this is terrible it's just like just like you know nonsense noise and like violent laughing I can't get into this at all and then like I'd like a comment later is like wait actually I I take that back I like this song a little bit I don't know but I'm still I'm still not into the whole concept it's not execute red just like comment after comment you could see them just like sort of turn around gradually towards the album like really amazing by the end it's like I love clipping clippings amazing history I mean what you guys are doing may not exactly be Orthodox but there is sand I'm sure dahveed can speak on this as well especially that there is sort of this growing underground on the internet in hip hop right now that is really sort of fracturing off from what the mainstream is doing and you have hip-hop artists who are getting pretty popular sort of doing their own thing and not just necessarily conforming to whatever sort of on the radio right now yeah totally but I think also what's happening that what feels to me like it's happening that that is sort of great and I think it's something that we've been waiting for for a long time is for people to not for people who are not in the mainstream to stop being so opposed to what is happening in the mainstream you know like that the sort of I like most we have it starting to dissipate you know people are splitting off but not necessarily in a rebellious way it's like just trying to throw new ideas out there exactly and the Internet has certainly made that more possible and has made the the conversation sort of more widespread and more available to everybody so I think it's just you know it's just easier to share ideas as opposed to being like so mad because the only way I could get my idea out 10 years ago is if someone plays it on their radio station and you know that and they're not gonna play my music so now I'm really pissed off you know it's like well everyone's gonna hear this anyway more people are going to hear this on YouTube they're gonna listen to it on the radio anyway so we can still engage in the conversation I guess um it's just interesting to me how a lot like rock music I mean you know not to you know sort of be cliche about it and but you know when punk split off and sort of had its own thing it felt like it was like sort of animosity between what was punk and what wasn't and what was underground and what was mainstream and now that you have this kind of similar thing happening with hip-hop but on the internet and everybody sort of has this free rein to express themselves in the way that they want and you know if there's an audience out there for whoever you know can get an audience I mean people can go stream on your soundcloud and whatever um I mean do you sort of see yourself sort of at the forefront of what could be just sort of more subgenres coming through in hip-hop right now I mean like that'd be cool like we were talking today like it'd be really cool if someone tried to copy this idea you know just to hear what that sounds like but but um I think that's not like we said the intent is just to sort of participate in in the in the genre in a way in the way that we can so I don't think we don't we don't feel like we're spearheading anything yeah and and like maybe whatever maybe the three of us just happened to be a little too old for this but when you're talking about punk punk and splitting off from rock and then also like other underground musics at the time like metal and that these just severe animosity I mean even within the undergone severe animosity in the 80s between Punk and metal like the hatred over what is just a tiny little generic difference within white dudes playing goddamn guitars it's like we haven't liked our what we're doing doesn't yet come with like this is you know an identity as a high school student and this is the fashion that it comes with and like we don't have like there's not a type of kid that listens to us yet you know like there aren't enough of us yet so there's not like oh yeah punk kid versus a metal kid like short hair versus long hair like there isn't an identity associated with what we're doing yet I mean maybe if we baby if anyone ever like imitates us maybe if we have people following in our footsteps that sounds idiotic but you know if there are other bands that this inspires maybe like maybe this will happen but I thought I were too old for that - ever - ever understand that I mean we're like now like Lemmy you'd ask Lemmy from Motorhead he says his favorite bands are like Elvis and the Beatles you know maybe we're that dude right now uh you know especially off of the just the buzz that has come from from releasing mid-city are there any sort of label signings or anything in the future for this project or you know as anybody like sort of scout you guys out for your next album or yeah we're not really loud we can either confirm okay yeah sorry what is that like are you guys game there's two talking about something or is it sort of like you know you've had a lot of conversations with people and it's been it's been really cool there will be another album and you'll hear it and it'll be on something maybe yeah oh well I know you guys were involved in a lot of different projects is there any sort of urgency and coming out with the next clipping album or you guys just pretty much concentrating on whatever you do separately at the moment I would like performing live we really really like doing clipping so I think we're all kind of excited about continuing to do it as much as possible right now yeah the urgency is to not have to do other stuff like we all you know we all a day me odd jobs like it's it's not yeah whatever it takes to not do that also so right now clipping looks like the most likely vehicle to not have to do your jobs at the moment um okay I just like wanna throw a few different fan questions or just sort of questions that that people threw at me off of off of Twitter somebody um uh Alex was asking me specifically if you guys could give me a couple people actually besides him if you give me some background or just a little bit of a tale behind the song story which is his favorite song off of the album which is really one of the highlights for me as well because of how intense the narrative is yeah I think we had been like throwing around the idea of doing a story wrap for a long time you know in sort of the vein of classic story raps pretty little story or whatever hated story of snoopeh fella of you know meek Mill's a Tony story right like um so what we've been throwing around that idea and then when that became out it there was so much movement in it it changed so much that it seemed that to me it was like oh great this is a good time to do this and I think uh you know as we tend to do with this group if we have an idea we're gonna sort of push it all the way so I was you know in that sort of meek Millz kind of like violent gangster story mode but like what what do we do to push that further and like you know kind of what an absurd protagonist for a rap song is a is a sort of queasy police officer with a drinking problem you know like that um it just seemed like well I've never heard that before like let's see what happens if we if we push that up against this uh yeah it was like a total misunderstanding of yeah it seems more like the beginning of like a noir film or something okay that's definitely so yeah it's you know as we do a lot it was about sort of having a really specific genre influence and then lyrically about what what really pushes what really tests the limits of that genre like what can I do that still is des is clearly indebted to and clearly in there that um that really tries to expand the conversation about it and for me it just happened to be like you know sort of ignoring everything that he about tells us about how those are supposed to happen in choosing a police officer as your protagonist and trying to make him somebody that like you know is is so  up that maybe you end up caring about him FN or at least like you know feeling sort of sorry for this for this guy here I mean it wasn't there something about sort of sending the girl home in a cab at the end of song that to you said like song ending like story I think that was just when we got back to the beginning you know that was him like sort of see you know that was the the big reveal to me was like oh no the guy in the cab the girl in the cab was his sister alone it was like why'd you go after that he's you know that was just sort of the tragic ending it was the was the reveal slide there was nothing more to say after that and the beaten and so alright clever trick okay so for for William and Jonathan um you know reacting to things like screws in a box rolling around in a goddamn my  jaw drop when I saw the disabled the cassette case like I I guess I guess this guy Jack wants to know do you just hear potential beats in everyday life you know like you just hear a sounded like that's gotta get sample like holy crap that's gotta be in a song pretty much yeah kind of I mean yeah it works the other way too you just go out and record a bunch and then you and you end up with something and as you go back and listen to the recordings cuz cuz we're all really sampling sound remember than making capturing sounds we're getting recordings right and they're reporting them the sound of two totally different objects right and actually realizing that was a huge that was a huge kind of leap for me and working of this kind of music because all of a sudden doesn't matter how good the recording is right the recording can be really bad when you're thinking of the recording as its own entity you know like I if you remember the song guns up on the record it has this loop of us hammering nails into a board that's like a really bad report lately until I move out that was just like a little crappy portable recorder to be potentially blew out it was in who's in my garage on the other side of this wall where the rolling door was open and the freeways right there it's really noisy it's really loud but it's an interesting recording right even though it's not necessarily a compelling sound somehow the recording is amazing kind of character that's really cool but yeah like libraries at the step where we just go out and everything is stuff we do ourselves generally but we make lots and lots of recordings and often times when we're somewhere in a beat like we're like oh we need a sound that's like this and without describing it as like oh we need a sound that is glass breaking well like all we need a kind of a high-impact sound heat like a like a high-frequency sound that has a really strong impulse at the front of it and then we just like go through a bunch of stuff we haven't go like oh this one sounds cool pull that one out this one sounds cool and like like clearly we haven't we haven't made any beats that are like oh the rapping is about these objects so let's make the beat with these objects it's like we have we we this object with something we record it let's throw it like that was the thing about all this stuff in about that where was like the songs not about tapes or glasses or screws in a box or anything like that it was like I don't know we needed a sound to do this so we went upstairs and fished through the kitchen and then I came back down here and click some things together like ripped some paper up like occasionally occasionally we'll be working on the Sun we say oh we absolutely need the sound of that we work really well like definitely that song mob to it we definitely stopped working on the beat and drove across town to a parking structure and kick the trash hand on the stairs and recorded it because it is a trash can falling down the stairs yeah the grubart built like that was but that wasn't like conceptually because this song was about that we were just like what it with yeah yeah yeah we chose before here yeah we just like broken trash can that wasn't ours copy that I do hear you that the sound that you do get on a microphone once recorded is different than what you're actually sort of thinking of that or rather your association with the object because I mean it certainly feels like you guys treat the sounds that way because I would not have figured that 90% of the sounds that you use to make about that we're actually the sounds that I was hearing I think the only sound once I thought about the recording when I was listening to it that I really the only sounds really throughout the entire record aside from maybe the harsh noise that I was able to pick out as you know recognize what they were were like either ripping paper broke in class everything else either just felt like I just assumed it was electronically synthesized or just some coming from some weird place I probably still it could be baffled by most of the sounds on that album and it really just sort of feels like you guys are treating the sounds just for the sound quality of it as opposed to you know yucking it up and be like what people think it's funny we slam a car door you know and really make it obvious that it is a card or there could be a  card or two on the album for all that I know I have no idea but if there are you know would you are there to tell me yeah we remember I don't think um and there's a lot of there's a lot of synthesizes again yeah that we'd hit me that song to do the dissection of because it was compelling because it had all these other elements in it I mean a lot of the songs have stuff like that and we could have done something interesting from most of the songs but that one had a lot of a bunch of just like funny little things that we were excited to tell people about and things that we'd record that we still had on hand because like there's really we recorded all of the stuff that was sitting on my desk yeah like those do this when we get when we made that track like and that stuff was all still there so you can take pictures of it and give them to the boat yeah I mean and like our relationship to that kind of sound as we're talking about is very much like we are portals portals anyway sorry sorry rose and not anyway but like I mean our relationship to a lot of that stuff comes from like music concrete the music practice genre starting in the 40s in France that we have read everything there is to read about it and have listened to most of it and really not most of it that's impossible we listen to a lot of it and we like in we're fans of this stuff well this is so our relationship to that is definitely like that was our attempt to that or to that's how we think about sounds is very much influenced by that type of music and getting to talk about it was also cool because we're also I feel like that's a sort of tribute you know in our way to be like these are the artists we like in this weather this is what we thinking about alright guys thanks for coming on and do the interview Gordon yeah yeah thank you say um do you have any sort of live date live dates coming up ASAP that you want to plug we you're about to leave on a West Coast sort of Luke tour of the US with our good friends what village

guys I'm with Brian Chippendale yeah that's awesome um uh and by the way the the foot village remix you guys did was awesome if I hadn't liked that the remix updated of the song as a drug deal um are there any hopes to do like other remixes like that into the near future sure yeah I mean we've you know the remixes are really fun and relatively easy for us because we don't have to come up with the idea from scratch so you know so when people ask us to do them if we have the time like we're usually about doing especially we like the project what's really easy with with as rich of material to draw from is fulfill it right yeah slow rhythmic fun laughing yeah all right clipping its clipping bitch could you guys just knock out the bitch before you go just say it it's clipping bitch doctor done that forever yeah 
16QuI9jkn7w,savages silent yourself ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new savages LP silence yourself savages is a UK post-punk band and this debut album of theirs they have landed a release for on Matador Records off the back of a very strong single flying to Berlin slash husbands the band put out some pretty impressive live recordings of their stuff last year as well and the band's sound has a very authentic retro post-punk vibe to it but it's very clear that the album we're dealing with here could have only been made today there's a very modern volume and brightness to the recording on this album and the band does a great job of mashing together some of the best ideas in the genre savages clearly works with a bird eye view of this musical era because they're able to appreciate the eccentricities and the aggression of a band like the liver the raincoats or the fast paces and the moodiness of some of the best tracks to come out from Joy Division in Bauhaus the vibrato of the band's lead singer Jenny Beth may make a Siouxsie Sioux comparison very easy on this record but savages show very little of the pop appeal that Suzy would show on some of her and her band's later records on silence yourself if anything the band is pulling more from Suzy's earlier more Punk driven stuff I could go on and on about the influences on this record however influences are not really a need to know you don't need a bachelor's degree in post-punk to enjoy or get this record because the biggest thing this record has going for it is that a rock driving bass lines guitars that blare out into the night with a really sharp tone and are emphasized with reverb pounding drums and Jenny's vocals atop all of it which just raises the energy level of these songs higher now among the 38 minutes or so of music that savages lays onto this LP there are some surprises namely tracks like hit me which are incredibly noisy and chaotic the guitars and the drums come together into this thick thick mess of sound that kind of reminds me of like an Ice Age record and on this track jenny has some really nasty just swagger to her vocals or the track waiting for a sign which is very spaced out slow and dismal or the piano like closing track on this LP where Jenny's vocals turned from a shriek to a beautiful Kroon and the transition is really nice the piano isn't stuck playing the same dumb progression the whole time there are some flourishes there there are some little changes little additions that are nice keep the track engaging of course Jenny's vocals her lyrics are very dramatic on this song and surprisingly there is like a jazz bass clarinet solo on the tail end of this thing that goes over pretty well as well the song dead nature is a bit of an oddball on this thing as well as kind of an intermission that separates one half of the album from the other half but the rest of this LP is just brash hard-hitting post-punk body moving beats coming from the drums guitar leads that burn themselves into the eardrums this record sounds like the world is on fire and this record is the only thing that could put the fire out open up your windows play this album and let every neighborhood America hear this and this feeling is partially due to the incredible urgency that savages delivers on some of these tracks with things like their tightness on tracks like she will as well as this new re-recorded version of the song husbands the band is just they do not miss a beat they are just a well-oiled post-punk Machine muscular playing on this thing the instrumental side of these songs is just really really impressive from just catchy melodies to just hard-hitting riffs but the vocals and lyrics really enhance these tracks with subject matters and poetry that can be kind of a widening and disturbing abstract song I am here is a bold statement about the existence of oneself and it is said with no fear and these lyrics are backed up with guitars that are so loud they cannot be ignored the riff on the course this thing actually sort of little bit my Queens of the Stone Age the song city's full of has it's really driving hook just guitars propelling this chorus in the tale that's being told in the track is one of love dancing lust jenny is sort of describing the wrinkled eyes and the stretch marks of her love interest and the song no face is an awesome statement of somebody who basically copycats their personality from really anywhere they can desperately grab it and lyrically the song she will is an exploration of femininity sexuality desire songs melody though it's eerily similar to Joy Division's level tear us apart the song Striped has this great slithering guitar lead and this totally lip biting groove to it I will say that this is maybe one of my least favorite parts on the LP though because of the chorus which feels kind of flaccid the guitar phrasing and the vocals aren't as sharp here as they are on many other spots on this LP overall downsides with this album there aren't many there are some tracks that I just don't love as much as others but if there is sort of a nitpick that I have there are tracks on this album where Jenny vocally lyrically comes across with a very direct direct statement and I'm just saying there are moments where what she's saying feels so esoteric I just really can't make heads or tails of it but beyond that the energy is stellar the songwriting is really great the structure on these tracks is solid they're very straightforward they're hard-hitting and yet they have Peaks they have valleys they have different pieces to them the production is freakin top-notch think about it if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah that's about it Anthony Fantana savages forever [Music] you 
dFDF8bMJ-NA,the hexan hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new hacks and cloak LP excavation this is the sophomore full-length LP from this uk-based musical project its self-titled full-length album came out in 2011 this new record is out now on triangle records a label that specializes in the dark the moody the atmospheric through artists like Balam akka as well as clams casino avian Christ even vessel whose last full-length LP I reviewed pretty recently and the label is kind of picky only choosing a handful of different artists for its roster and all of them sort of bringing their own unique brand or flair to these moods these vibes that the label sort of specializes in and certainly the haxon cloak has no problems meeting these needs on this new full-length album just look at the title if this album is an excavation certainly the accent cloak gets very low it gets subterranean I haven't heard electronic music or at least electronically tinged music this frightening since some of lust mort's best albums I also would not be surprised if the Hexen cloak took a lot of influence from horror movie soundtracks on this LP and I don't just mean the music that may be composed for a horror movie soundtrack I'm talking about like the gargantuan bass hits and the very sharp jump out in your face noises that appear in about every modern horror movie trailer this is essentially the opening track of this album in a nutshell like I said earlier this album is essentially dark ambient music it lasts for about an hour stretched across nine tracks a lot of the tracks on this LP are incredibly vast and tall and wide thanks to the incredible reverb that the accent cloak employs on this album but many of the songs are beat driven as well which does give these tracks pace does give them direction a lot of the tracks on this LP though don't really rise in a way that is traditionally exciting in music the accent cloak kind of prefers to hang down in the deep bassy murk of low end frequencies this album is so dark at times you can even see your end front of your face which is also a description I threw at the vessel album that I also reviewed on triangle records but the Hexen cloak is much more obsessed with low frequencies than high creating rumbles creating fuzz a physical experience with the music that feeling definitely comes through on parts one and two of the title track on this LP the first of which features all these sputtering clicking very busy electronics matched up against some very eerie and bacey atmosphere tones the second part of this title track has all these kind of metallic waves of sound repeating and just cycling over and over and over it's like an industrial anaconda and the song eventually gives away to some very beautiful synthesizer arpeggios the accent cloaks sort of tossing very sparse moments of beauty at the listener matched up with just this grimness the horror movie sound play gets intensified on the next two tracks of the selkies starting with Mara these massive drum hits and I mean massive are pulsating throughout the track huge piano hits on the song as well from the low end of the pitch spectrum and these wailing strings coming like the strings creep like drips of blood coming down the wall of the horrible torture chamber that all these sounds are clearly coming from the song leaps right into the track mist which starts off with a voice that literally jumps out at the listener like a knife-wielding psycho the song has this dragging double bass line it sounds like a horrible fog lurching out from some kind of creepy forest and the way the vocal that popped up right at the start of this track is edited and placed throughout the song in this sort of skippy strange way it's kind of creative odd and very memorable there is more appeal to this LP though than being completely creeped out though being creeped out will be the most obvious reaction to have when listening to this but let me say this if the sounds on this album weren't crafted amazingly well and if the songs weren't sort of built and pasted in a way that kept them engaging and interesting these creepy feelings wouldn't necessarily even come about in the first place it's the very last song on this album it feels kind of like a legitimate change of pace this synth melody comes through that is actually pretty serene and in comparison to a lot of the other stuff on this LP is kind of obliphica the song grows very dark and very cold over a slow period of time though the song is 12 freakin minutes long but as it gets darker and heavier with some very eerie strings and some double bass and a very heavy heavy bass drum the slow very basic and over the course of the song boring beat actually where's the songs welcome out really fast the song slowly decays into staleness over its 12-minute run time unfortunately the most obvious downsides to this LP is that there are some moments that drag on and don't have an incredible amount of musical detail or just sonic detail in them it seems like the hacks and cloak gets more joy out of the space left than space filled which isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself certainly it helps along with the very potent and amazing vibe that is conjured on this album but it does keep some of these tracks from being engaging throughout on the flipside of this complaint there are some songs on here most notably the ones around the three-minute mark that just feel too short half-baked kind of underdeveloped like they could have gone on longer or evolved into something else still these problems only reflect a minority of tracks on this album as is this album is incredible when it comes to sound play and just pulling a very very strong emotional reaction from me there are moments where I do wish the sonic palette was a little wider and that the accent cloak found different sounds and different textures to sort of bring more variety and that the structures and the rhythms behind these tracks weren't quite so basic but man is this album like an experience I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this LP if you've given it a listen what do you think of it do you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it the haxon cloak excavation forever [Music] [Music] 
W3v3SPfkTzE,Jenny haha innocence is kinky hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jenny Havel album innocence is kinky Carol Cheech esta spoken poem pistachio pistachio green green bean PAP tamale I'm sweat well Jenny caval is a norwegian singer songwriter and this is her sophomore full-length LP under her own name previous to the release of albums under the name jenny of all she was putting out music under the name rocket to the sky she's had other musical projects as well she is also a writer an occasional music reviewer a jack of many trades of Jenny now Jenny's last full-length album a few years ago viscera does deliver what the album title suggests to an extent it's kind of a singer-songwriter affair very powerful emotive vocals instrumentation that occasionally is climactic growing and growing and growing as the song progresses but still a little toned down in comparison to summer for rocket to the sky stuff on this new LP of hers innocence is kinky and boy is it spanking jenny has gained a somewhat spontaneous edge the songs on this new LP overall are shorter follow a very linear surprising kind of jagged unpredictable structure there are more noises and effects employed on this new LP and overall Jenny does cover a slightly larger genre bass like on our previous LP there is spoken word on this new album but I would say Jenny relies on it a lot more it's almost as if that eclectic kind of confident side of her music that was very prevalent in rocket to the sky has returned on this new album but with much more impressive production which is brought to the table by John parish PJ Harvey's producer who most recently worked with her on her fantastically huge album let England shake now if you're sad to see Jenny's more straight forward side go on this new album innocence as kinky might not appeal to you exactly there are a lot of tracks here that suffer from abrupt ends there are songs right next to each other or motifs that have a completely different vibe than the song that they follow in the song that they precede there are some sudden shifts and instrumentation as well that are interesting but I can't help but feel like some of the discord that Jenny drums up on this LP is made to throw the listener off of the breadcrumb trail of very obvious influences for one PJ Harvey and a lot of her spoken word moments just breathe Kate Bush's fifty words for snow which aren't bad influences to have or wear on your sleeve it's just that as I listen to the album more and more the novelty of how disjointed this album feels wears off and then not much is is left over in terms of tune or songwriting to keep me there and keep me engaged and keep me returning to this album how disjointed this album is can sometimes feel like assembling a thousand-piece puzzle but without knowing a tenth of the pieces on this album are missing still a great deal of the parts that have all has left on this album are very enjoyable and range from being hauntingly beautiful to twisted - even uncompromising interestingly enough a Vols refusal to blend many of her ideas together on this album actually keeps her from being completely in the shadow of her influences most definitely on this album the production brought by John parish is kind of a double-edged sword as beautiful and as detailed and as textured and is well put together it is and many times on here there are a ton of spots that just sound very much like instrumental flourishes from let England shake and while Jenny just like PJ on letting gland shake has a strong narrative voice there are a lot of parts where she instead comes off as very cerebral abstract sexual a bit of spoken word on the opening track with the self he delves intimately into a late-night session with some online porn the synth and drum groove that pulsate against the spoken word and eventually roll the track into a full-blown song is met with a very sharp jagged guitar lead that just lurches and creeps forward feels very nocturnal and kind of dirty just like the words that Jenny is laying against this music there are moments where she's just belting and calling out within her high range and other spots where she just really tones her voice down and coos very softly her Ange of pitch and emotion is really one of the most impressive things that this album has to offer especially when on this track and the song right after it she's going through this weird thing with the song I called those a very sort of loud and catchy change of pace with its constant snare drum a sort of paces itself out like it's a 60s pop tune with some guitar arpeggios that feel like they're coming from sort of the same field of range but totally panned over in the right channel is this screaming noisy chaotic guitar playing not only is this totally just mucking up the vibe and a kind of exciting and noisy and just destructive way but Jenny's voice goes from being very high and sort of bright to being completely tired and depressing like she's having this sort of schizophrenic episode right in the middle of the song on the other side of the spectrum Renee Falcon Eddie of Orleans on the next track has more of these coud narrations matched up with sort of knife style vocal effects that call out very eerily emotionally the vocals feel really passionate they're backed up with some throbbing electronics and while it is a really cool combination of influences and ideas that I applaud Jenny for there's nothing here in terms of an interesting song structure or tune the song really kind of feels like it bumbles around just tossing together some concepts that might have been interesting I do like the track is there anything on me that doesn't speak because it does get more and more intense as it goes along and the song amphibious androgynous is another very cohesive track on this album actually tells a pretty clear story from beginning to end with Jenny falling in love with this stick man and literally he is made of sticks and she's having a difficult time because of their mismatching physicalities loving him kissing him a lot like how Kate Bush made love to that on her last LP and then he melted and I do think the last third of this album is the best material in the most consistent material that this LP does have to offer but every time I listen to this album I didn't really come away anything more than sort of intrigued but still wanting more and expecting that Jenny will go into more interesting territory into the future as long as her production continues to stay this detailed and ambitious I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this album if you've given it a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Jenny have all forever 
_FkBBvNmARM,everybody couch your chest to here this video is Anthony talking about seeing the music band shabby pass well that that was rough and I really regret letting you do it thank you Shabazz Palaces hails from Seattle Washington in 2011 they came out with one of my favorite hip hop albums of that year black up they were playing over at Wesleyan University in Connecticut this past week the duo features tendyne who in the live setup of the duo has various bongos around him as well as a floor Tom hi-hat a thumb piano too and a little electronic trigger pad as well that was playing various samples throughout the night as he was hitting them with his drumsticks and Ishmael Butler who was playing MPC was on the mic as well as well as Tendai actually who was singing it with a little bit of auto-tune at times during the night maybe something that Shabazz Palaces may incorporate on their next full-length album truth be told that actually sounded pretty good but anyway Ishmael Butler formerly of diggable planets on NBC on the mic as well in this particular live setup and man was it awesome I feel like just them together broke most of the stereotypes that typically come with you know just kind of a come on stage and push play and just sort of say your lyrics hip-hop performance Shabazz Palaces not only played a ton of old stuff from their previous EPS of course a ton of cuts off of black up as well but it seemed like maybe they were playing some new stuff as well or just what seemed like improvised and sort of reworked ideas within a lot of these previously written tracks of course the sounds that appear on Shabazz Palaces albums they're being executed with a lot of the instruments that they use to record these albums and of course the same samples as well on the MPC or or sampler but it didn't feel like anything in the set was heavily pre sequenced or pre-recorded you saw Ishmael Butler sort of hammering out a lot of these beats with his finger just on the fly right in front of the crowd and a lot of the live percussion that you hear on the duo's albums was of course just as live in person as it was on the records but to just hear the made in person allowed Shabazz Palaces to improvise on these songs stretch certain parts out or change them up on the fly which actually happened quite a lot some tracks were fading into other tracks completely it seemed like they would do a complete 180 in the middle of maybe doing a quieter groove and then maybe doing a spastic freak hour totally changing up the beat and then go on this tangent this musical improv for about a minute or so and then go right back into the song or the groove that they were sort of experimenting with it first so not only were a ton of popular cuts from their previous EPS and blaka played but they were very very much revised to feel like something completely different all of the songs were pretty much played in this really long jam like succession where there wasn't really a huge gap in between any of the tracks it just really felt like a continuous non-stop live performance as far as the sounds go a lot of the highs were really sharp the bass was really resonant and overpowering the bass is huge on on black up for example but I mean they really emphasize the low-end tones in in this live performance now performing before Shabazz Palaces were two different hip-hop outfits one was militia Molly mob I'll put some information for them in the description box and right before Shabazz Palaces was actually fellow Seattle hip-hop alternative duo the satisfaction whose new LP on natural I reviewed last year enjoyed quite a bit and their set was very smooth it was sultry it was you know pretty awesome very charismatic and the singing was was much more on point in person than I thought it was on the record and it was a pretty tone down set not a huge live set up or anything just two microphones and they just kind of did their thing but when she does palaces came on they had all the equipment coming out and after about an hour of performing like I said with these non stopped jams with just one song fading in after another there was a little bit of a break and then the satisfaction came on and started performing material that Shabazz Palaces has out that features them then they started playing the satisfaction material that features Shabazz Palaces so they kind of like did this mini set within the set of songs that they you know have have collaborations on together and that came out really great too after the satisfaction left the stage vast palaces played a handful more tracks and there was definitely a likelihood that some of the material I was hearing was new but it just felt like so much of what was happening was done semi on-the-fly and I'm completely happy with that you know I'm I like a live set where it's not just like oh here's a song start stop clap here's another song start stop clap and all the songs sound exactly like they do from the record I mean this to me very much felt like this continuous sonic experience that you can get lost in I mean Shabazz Palaces while their songs on their records can be very catchy and very hooky they were so so so much about the grooves on this live performance just getting those grooves out there making sure that they're on tempo making sure that just people are dance and a lot of people are just dancing and swaying during this live performance because of just how awesome these beats were that Shabazz Palaces were pumping out they're just a fun life said it was exciting to see that Shabazz Palaces is as psychedelic in person as they are on record and are able to in a really masterful way recreate the sounds and the strange textures and just the very otherworldly aura that comes through on their EPS and black up if you've ever caught Shabazz Palaces alive what did you think did you love them did you hate them why and yeah that's that's net Anthony Fantana Shabazz Palaces forever you
